0902.4712	lyman break galaxies at z~1.8-2.8: galex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep  field	abridged: a photometric sample of ~7100 v&lt;25.3 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)has been selected by combining subaru/suprime-cam bvrci'z' data with deepgalex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep field. follow-up spectroscopy confirmed 24lbgs at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7. among the optical spectra, 12 have ly-alpha emission withrest-frame equivalent widths of ~5-60aa. the success rate for identifying lbgsas nuv-dropouts at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7 is 86%. the rest-frame uv (1700aa) luminosityfunction (lf) is constructed from the photometric sample with corrections forstellar contamination and z&lt;1.5 interlopers. the lf is 1.7+/-0.1 times higherthan those of z~2 bxs and z~3 lbgs. three explanations were considered, and itis argued that significantly underestimating low-z contamination or effectivecomoving volume is unlikely: the former would be inconsistent with thespectroscopic sample at 93% confidence, and the second explanation would notresolve the discrepancy. the third scenario is that different photometricselection of the samples yields non-identical galaxy populations, such thatsome bx galaxies are lbgs and vice versa. this argument is supported by ahigher surface density of lbgs at all magnitudes while the redshiftdistribution of the two populations is nearly identical. this study, whencombined with other star-formation rate (sfr) density uv measurements from lbgsurveys, indicates that there is a rise in the sfr density: a factor of 3-6(3-10) increase from z~5 (z~6) to z~2, followed by a decrease to z~0. thisresult, along with past sub-mm studies that find a peak at z~2 in theirredshift distribution, suggest that z~2 is the epoch of peak star-formation.additional spectroscopy is required to characterize the complete shape of thez~2 lbg uv lf via measurements of contamination and accurate distances.

0904.3861	two-dimensional kinematics of slacs lenses: ii. combined lensing and  dynamics analysis of early-type galaxies at z = 0.08 - 0.33	we present the first detailed analysis of the mass and dynamical structure ofa sample of six early-type lens galaxies, selected from the sloan lens acssurvey, in the redshift range 0.08 &lt; z &lt; 0.33. both hubble space telescope(hst)/acs high-resolution imaging and vlt vimos integral field spectroscopy areavailable for these systems. the galaxies are modelled - under the assumptionsof axial symmetry and two-integral stellar distribution function - by makinguse of the cauldron code, which self-consistently combines gravitationallensing and stellar dynamics, and is fully embedded within the framework ofbayesian statistics. the principal results of this study are: (i) all galaxiesin the sample are well described by a simple axisymmetric power-law profile forthe total density, with a logarithmic slope gamma very close to isothermal(&lt;gamma&gt; = 1.98 +/- 0.05 and an intrinsic spread close to 5 per cent) showingno evidence of evolution over the probed range of redshift; (ii) the axialratio of the total density distribution is rounder than 0.65 and in all cases,except for a fast rotator, does not deviate significantly from the flatteningof the intrinsic stellar distribution; (iii) the dark matter fraction withinthe effective radius has a lower limit of about 15 to 30 per cent; (iv) thesample galaxies are only mildly anisotropic, with delta &lt;= 0.16; (v) thephysical distinction among slow and fast rotators, quantified by the v/sigmaratio and the intrinsic angular momentum, is already present at z &gt; 0.1.altogether, early-type galaxies at z = 0.08 - 0.33 are found to be markedlysmooth and almost isothermal systems, structurally and dynamically very similarto their nearby counterparts.

0908.0003	the lick agn monitoring project: broad-line region radii and black hole  masses from reverberation mapping of hbeta	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun and also the well-studied nearby activegalactic nucleus (agn) ngc 5548. nine of the objects in the sample (includingngc 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during themonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between thecontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broadhbeta emission. we present here the light curves for the objects in this sampleand the subsequent hbeta time lags for the nine objects where thesemeasurements were possible. the hbeta lag time is directly related to the sizeof the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured widthof the hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determinethe virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine agns. theabsolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalizationderived by onken et al. we also examine the time lag response as a function ofvelocity across the hbeta line profile for six of the agns. the analysis offour leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function ofvelocity. however, sbs 1116+583a exhibits a symmetric time lag response aroundthe line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-lineregion (blr) clouds, and arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is mosteasily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. further investigationwill be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical modelsof the blr by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.

0908.0602	direct observation of cosmic strings via their strong gravitational  lensing effect: ii. results from the hst/acs image archive	we have searched 4.5 square degrees of archival hst/acs images for cosmicstrings, identifying close pairs of similar, faint galaxies and selectinggroups whose alignment is consistent with gravitational lensing by a long,straight string. we find no evidence for cosmic strings in five large-area hsttreasury surveys (covering a total of 2.22 square degrees), or in any of 346multi-filter guest observer images (1.18 square degrees). assuming thatsimulations ccurately predict the number of cosmic strings in the universe,this non-detection allows us to place upper limits on the unitless universalcosmic string tension of g mu/c^2 &lt; 2.3 x 10^-6, and cosmic string density ofomega_s &lt; 2.1 x 10^-5 at the 95% confidence level (marginalising over the otherparameter in each case). we find four dubious cosmic string candidates in 318single filter guest observer images (1.08 square degrees), which we are unableto conclusively eliminate with existing data. the confirmation of any one ofthese candidates as cosmic strings would imply g mu/c^2 ~ 10^-6 and omega_s ~10^-5. however, we estimate that there is at least a 92% chance that thesestring candidates are random alignments of galaxies. if we assume that thesecandidates are indeed false detections, our final limits on g mu/c^2 andomega_s fall to 6.5 x 10^-7 and 7.3 x 10^-6. due to the extensive sky coverageof the hst/acs image archive, the above limits are universal. they are quitesensitive to the number of fields being searched, and could be further reducedby more than a factor of two using forthcoming hst data.

0908.1621	dry mergers and the formation of early-type galaxies: constraints from  lensing and dynamics	dissipationless (gas-free or "dry") mergers have been suggested to play amajor role in the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies, particularlyin growing their mass and size without altering their stellar populations. weperform a new test of the dry merger hypothesis by comparing n-body simulationsof realistic systems to empirical constraints provided by recent studies oflens early-type galaxies. we find that major and minor dry mergers: i) preservethe nearly isothermal structure of early-type galaxies within the observedscatter; ii) do not change more than the observed scatter the ratio betweentotal mass m and "virial" mass r_e*sigma/2g (where r_e is the half-light radiusand sigma the projected velocity dispersion); iii) increase strongly galaxysizes [as m^(0.85+/-0.17)] and weakly velocity dispersions [as m^(0.06+/-0.08)]with mass, thus moving galaxies away from the local observed m-r_e and m-sigmarelations; iv) introduce substantial scatter in the m-r_e and m-sigmarelations. our findings imply that, unless there is a high degree of finetuning of the mix of progenitors and types of interactions, present-day massiveearly-type galaxies cannot have assembled more than ~50% of their mass, andincreased their size by more than a factor ~1.8, via dry merging.

0911.2236	cosmic evolution of virial and stellar mass in massive early-type  galaxies	we measure the average mass properties of a sample of 41 strong gravitationallenses at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4 - 0.9), and present the lens redshift for6 of these galaxies for the first time. using the techniques of strong and weakgravitational lensing on archival data obtained from the hubble spacetelescope, we determine that the average mass overdensity profile of the lensescan be fit with a power-law profile (delta_sigma prop. to r^{-0.86 +/- 0.16})that is within 1-sigma of an isothermal profile (delta_sigma prop. to r^{-1})with velocity dispersion sigma_v = 260 +/- 20 km/s. additionally, we use atwo-component de vaucouleurs+nfw model to disentangle the total mass profileinto separate luminous and dark matter components, and determine the relativefraction of each component. we measure the average rest frame v-band stellarmass-to-light ratio (upsilon_v = 4.0 +/- 0.6 h m_sol/l_sol) and virialmass-to-light ratio (tau_v = 300 +/- 90 h m_sol/l_sol) for our sample,resulting in a virial-to-stellar mass ratio of m_vir/m_* = 75 +/- 25. finally,we compare our results to a previous study using low redshift lenses, tounderstand how galaxy mass profiles evolve over time. we investigate theevolution of m_vir/m_*(z) = alpha(1+z)^{beta}, and find best fit parameters ofalpha = 51 +/- 36 and beta = 0.9 +/- 1.8, constraining the growth of virial tostellar mass ratio over the last ~7 gigayears. we note that, by using a sampleof strong lenses, we are able to constrain the growth of m_vir/m_*(z) withoutmaking any assumptions about the imf of the stellar population.

0911.4107	cosmic evolution of black holes and spheroids. iv. the bh mass -  spheroid luminosity relation	from high-resolution images of 23 seyfert-1 galaxies at z=0.36 and z=0.57obtained with the near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer on boardthe hubble space telescope (hst), we determine host-galaxy morphology, nuclearluminosity, total host-galaxy luminosity and spheroid luminosity. keckspectroscopy is used to estimate black hole mass (m_bh). we study the cosmicevolution of the m_bh-spheroid luminosity (l_sph) relation. in combination withour previous work, totaling 40 seyfert-1 galaxies, the covered range in bh massis substantially increased, allowing us to determine for the first timeintrinsic scatter and correct evolutionary trends for selection effects. were-analyze archival hst images of 19 local reverberation-mapped active galaxiesto match the procedure adopted at intermediate redshift. correcting spheroidluminosity for passive luminosity evolution and taking into account selectioneffects, we determine that at fixed present-day v-band spheroid luminosity,m_bh/l_sph \propto (1+z)^(2.8+/-1.2). when including a sample of 44 quasars outto z=4.5 taken from the literature, with luminosity and bh mass corrected to aself-consistent calibration, we extend the bh mass range to over two orders ofmagnitude, resulting in m_bh/l_sph \propto (1+z)^(1.4+/-0.2). the intrinsicscatter of the relation, assumed constant with redshift, is 0.3+/-0.1 dex (&lt;0.6dex at 95% cl). the evolutionary trend suggests that bh growth precedesspheroid assembly. interestingly, the m_bh-total host-galaxy luminosityrelation is apparently non-evolving. it hints at either a more fundamentalrelation or that the spheroid grows by a redistribution of stars. however, thehigh-z sample does not follow this relation, indicating that major mergers mayplay the dominant role in growing spheroids above z~1.

0912.1605	environmental effects in the evolution of galactic bulges	we investigate possible environmental trends in the evolution of galacticbulges over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.6. for this purpose, we construct thefundamental plane (fp) for cluster and field samples at redshifts &lt;z&gt;=0.4 and&lt;z&gt;=0.54 using surface photometry based on hst imaging and velocity dispersionsbased on keck spectroscopy. as a reference point for our study we include datafor pure ellipticals, which we model as single-component sersic profiles;whereas for multi-component galaxies we undertake decompositions using sersicand exponential models for the bulge and disk respectively. although the fp forboth distant cluster and field samples are offset from the local relation,consistent with evolutionary trends found in earlier studies, we detectsignificant differences in the zero point of ~=0.2 dex between the field andcluster samples at a given redshift. for both clusters, theenvironmentally-dependent offset is in the sense expected for an acceleratedevolution of bulges in dense environments. by matching the mass range of oursamples, we confirm that this difference does not arise as a result of themass-dependent downsizing effects seen in larger field samples. our result isalso consistent with the hypothesis that - at fixed mass and environment - thestar formation histories of galactic bulges and pure spheroids areindistinguishable, and difficult to reconcile with the picture whereby themajority of large bulges form primarily via secular processes within spiralgalaxies.

1002.1083	the non-evolving internal structure of early-type galaxies: the case  study sdss j0728+3835 at z = 0.206	we study the internal dynamical structure of the early-type lens galaxy sdssj0728+3835 at z = 0.206. the analysis is based on two-dimensional kinematicmaps extending out to 1.7 effective radii obtained from keck spectroscopy, onlensing geometry and on stellar mass estimates obtained from multiband hubblespace telescope imaging. the data are modelled under the assumptions of axialsymmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function (df), by applyingthe combined gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics code cauldron, andyielding high-quality constraints for an early-type galaxy at cosmologicalredshifts. modelling the total density profile as a power-law of the formrho_tot ~ 1/r^{gamma}, we find that it is nearly isothermal (logarithmic slopegamma = 2.08^{+0.04}_{-0.02}), and quite flattened (axial ratio q =0.60^{+0.08}_{-0.03}). the galaxy is mildly anisotropic (delta = 0.08 +/- 0.02)and shows a fair amount of rotational support, in particular towards the outerregions. we determine a dark matter fraction lower limit of 28 per cent withinthe effective radius. the stellar contribution to the total mass distributionis close to maximal for a chabrier initial mass function (imf), whereas for asalpeter imf the stellar mass exceeds the total mass within the galaxy innerregions. we find that the combination of a nfw dark matter halo with themaximally rescaled luminous profile provides a remarkably good fit to the totalmass distribution over a broad radial range. our results confirm and expand thefindings of the slacs survey for early-type galaxies of comparable velocitydispersion (sigma_sdss = 214 +/- 11 km/s). the internal structure of j0728 isconsistent with that of local early-type galaxies of comparable velocitydispersion as measured by the sauron project, suggesting lack of evolution inthe past two billion years.

0707.4173	a wide-field survey of two z~0.5 galaxy clusters: identifying the  physical processes responsible for the observed transformation of spirals  into s0s	we present new results from our comprehensive comparative survey of twomassive, intermediate redshift galaxy clusters, cl0024+17 (z=0.39) andms0451-03 (z=0.54). we identify and study several key classes of `transitionobjects' whose stellar populations or dynamical states indicate a recent orongoing change in morphology and star formation rate. for the first time, wehave been able to conclusively identify spiral galaxies in the process oftransforming into s0 galaxies. this has been accomplished by locating bothspirals whose star formation is being quenched as well as their eventualsuccessors, the recently created s0s. differences between the two clusters inboth the timescales and spatial location of this conversion process allow us toevaluate the relative importance of several proposed physical mechanisms thatcould be responsible for the transformation. combined with other diagnosticsthat are sensitive to either icm-driven galaxy evolution or galaxy-galaxyinteractions, we describe a self-consistent picture of galaxy evolution inclusters. we find that spiral galaxies within infalling groups have alreadybegun a slow process of conversion into s0s primarily via gentle galaxy-galaxyinteractions. the fates of spirals upon reaching the core of the cluster dependheavily on the cluster icm, with rapid conversion of all remaining spirals intos0s via ram-pressure stripping in clusters where the icm is dense. in thepresence of a less-dense icm, the conversion continues at a slower pace, withgalaxy-galaxy interactions continuing to play a role along with `starvation' bythe icm. we conclude that the buildup of the local s0 population through thetransformation of spiral galaxies is a heterogeneous process that neverthelessproceeds robustly across a variety of different environments.

1002.3619	amuse-virgo ii. down-sizing in black hole accretion	(abridged) we complete the census of nuclear x-ray activity in 100 early typevirgo galaxies observed by the chandra x-ray telescope as part of theamuse-virgo survey, down to a (3sigma) limiting luminosity of 3.7e+38 erg/sover 0.5-7 kev. the stellar mass distribution of the targeted sample, which ismostly composed of formally `inactive' galaxies, peaks below 1e+10 m_sun, aregime where the very existence of nuclear super-massive black holes (smbhs) isdebated. out of 100 objects, 32 show a nuclear x-ray source, including 6 hybridnuclei which also host a massive nuclear cluster as visible from archival hstimages. after carefully accounting for contamination from nuclear low-massx-ray binaries based on the shape and normalization of their x-ray luminosityfunction, we conclude that between 24-34% of the galaxies in our sample host ax-ray active smbh (at the 95% c.l.). this sets a firm lower limit to the blackhole occupation fraction in nearby bulges within a cluster environment. at facevalue, the active fraction -down to our luminosity limit- is found to increasewith host stellar mass. however, taking into account selection effects, we findthat the average eddington-scaled x-ray luminosity scales with black hole massas m_bh^(-0.62^{+0.13}_{-0.12}), with an intrinsic scatter of0.46^({+0.08}_{-0.06}) dex. this finding can be interpreted as observationalevidence for `down-sizing' of black hole accretion in local early types, thatis, low mass black holes shine relatively closer to their eddington limit thanhigher mass objects. as a consequence, the fraction of active galaxies, definedas those above a fixed x-ray eddington ratio, decreases with increasing blackhole mass.

1004.0252	the lick agn monitoring project: the mbh - sigma relation for  reverberation-mapped active galaxies	(abridged) to investigate the black hole mass (mbh) vs. stellar velocitydispersion relation of active galaxies, we measured the velocity dispersions ofa sample of local seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we have recently determined mbhusing reverberation mapping. for most objects, velocity dispersions weremeasured from high s/n ratio optical spectra centered on the ca ii tripletregion (~8500 a), obtained at the keck, palomar, and lick observatories. fortwo objects, in which the ca ii triplet region was contaminated by nuclearemission, the measurement was based on high-quality h-band spectra obtainedwith the osiris at the keck-ii telescope. combining our new measurements withdata from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies withstellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based mbh measurements in therange of black hole mass 10^6&lt;mbh/m_sun&lt;10^9. we use this sample to obtainreverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of them-sigma relation of active galaxies. assuming a constant virial coefficient ffor the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60and the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log(mbh/m_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those foundfor quiescent galaxies. we derive an updated value of the virial coefficient fby finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreementwith the m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent m-sigmarelation determined by gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with anintrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. the uncertainty of the virial coefficientremains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole massdeterminations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epochspectroscopic estimates of mbh in active galaxies.

1004.1331	keck spectroscopy of z&gt;1 field spheroidals: dynamical constraints on the  growth rate of red "nuggets"	we present deep keck spectroscopy for 17 morphologically-selected fieldspheroidals in the redshift range 1.05&lt;z&lt;1.60 in order to investigate thecontinuity in physical properties between the claimed massive compact redgalaxies ("nuggets") at z~2 and well-established data for massive spheroidalgalaxies below z~1. by combining keck-based stellar velocity dispersions withhst-based sizes, we find that the most massive systems (mdyn &gt; 10^11 msol) grewin size over 0&lt;z&lt;1.6 as (1+z)^(-0.75 +- 0.10) (i.e., x2 since z=1.5) whereasintermediate mass systems (10^11 msol &gt; mdyn &gt; 10^10 msol) did not growsignificantly. these trends are consistent with a picture in which more massivespheroidals formed at higher redshift via "wetter" mergers involving greaterdissipation. to examine growth under the favored "dry" merger hypothesis, wealso examine size growth at a fixed velocity dispersion. this test, uniquelypossible with our dynamical data, allows us to consider the effects of"progenitor bias." above our completeness limit (sigma &gt; 200 km/s), we findsize growth consistent with that inferred for the mass-selected sample, thusruling out strong progenitor bias. to maintain continuity in the growth ofmassive galaxies over the past 10 gyr, our new results imply that sizeevolution over 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.3, a period of 1.9 gyr, must have been even moredramatic than hitherto claimed if the red sources at z&gt;2 are truly massive andcompact.

1009.0532	the lick agn monitoring project: alternate routes to a broad-line region  radius	it is now possible to estimate black hole masses across cosmic time, usingbroad emission lines in active galaxies. this technique informs our views ofhow galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. unfortunately, there aremany outstanding uncertainties associated with these "virial" mass estimates.one of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for thebroad-line region. incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity activegalaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at lick observatory, werecalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretionluminosity other than the optical continuum. we find that the radius of thebroad-line region scales as the square root of the x-ray and hbetaluminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. on the other hand, thescaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. this isconsistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line tox-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. the radius of the broad-lineregion correlates most tightly with hbeta luminosity, while the x-ray andnarrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two. thesecorrelations provide useful alternative virial bh masses in objects with nodetectable optical/uv continuum emission, such as high-redshift galaxies withbroad emission lines, radio-loud objects, or local active galaxies withgalaxy-dominated continua.

1101.3553	the dark matter distribution in abell 383: evidence for a shallow  density cusp from improved lensing, stellar kinematic and x-ray data	we extend our analyses of the dark matter (dm) distribution in relaxedclusters to the case of abell 383, a luminous x-ray cluster at z=0.189 with adominant central galaxy and numerous strongly-lensed features. following ourearlier papers, we combine strong and weak lensing constraints secured withhubble space telescope and subaru imaging with the radial profile of thestellar velocity dispersion of the central galaxy, essential for separating thebaryonic mass distribution in the cluster core. hydrostatic mass estimates fromchandra x-ray observations further constrain the solution. these combineddatasets provide nearly continuous constraints extending from 2 kpc to 1.5 mpcin radius, allowing stringent tests of results from recent numericalsimulations. two key improvements in our data and its analysis make this themost robust case yet for a shallow slope \beta of the dm density profile\rho_dm ~ r^-\beta on small scales. first, following deep keck spectroscopy, wehave secured the stellar velocity dispersion profile to a radius of 26 kpc forthe first time in a lensing cluster. secondly, we improve our previous analysisby adopting a triaxial dm distribution and axisymmetric dynamical models. wedemonstate that in this remarkably well-constrained system, the logarithmicslope of the dm density at small radii is \beta &lt; 1.0 (95% confidence). animproved treatment of baryonic physics is necessary, but possibly insufficient,to reconcile our observations with the recent results of high-resolutionsimulations.

1101.4952	geometric and dynamical models of reverberation mapping data	we present a general method to analyze reverberation mapping data thatprovides both estimates for the black hole mass and for the geometry anddynamics of the broad line region (blr) in active galactic nuclei (agn). ourmethod directly infers the spatial and velocity distribution of the blr fromthe data, allowing us to easily derive a velocity-resolved transfer functionand allowing for a self-consistent estimate of the black hole mass without avirial coefficient. we obtain estimates and reasonable uncertainties of the blrmodel parameters by implementing a markov chain monte carlo algorithm using theformalism of bayesian probability theory. we use gaussian processes tointerpolate the the continuum light curve data and create mock light curvesthat can be fitted to the data. we test our method by creating simulatedreverberation mapping data-sets with known true parameter values and by tryingto recover these parameter values using our models. we are able to recover theparameters with realistic uncertainties that depend upon the variability of theagn and the quality of the reverberation mapping campaign. with a geometrymodel we can recover the mean radius of the blr to within ~0.1dex randomuncertainty for simulated data with an integrated line flux uncertainty of1.5%, while with a dynamical model we can recover the black hole mass and themean radius to within ~0.05dex random uncertainty, for simulated data with aline profile average signal to noise ratio of 4 per spectral pixel. theseuncertainties do not include modeling errors, which are likely to be present inthe analysis of real data, and should therefore be considered as lower limitsto the accuracy of the method.

0710.1839	comparing and calibrating black hole mass estimators for distant active  galactic nuclei	black hole mass is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (agns).in the distant universe, black hole mass is commonly estimated using the mgii,hbeta, or halpha emission line widths and the optical/uv continuum or lineluminosities, as proxies for the characteristic velocity and size of thebroad-line region. although they all have a common calibration in the localuniverse, a number of different recipes are currently used in the literature.it is important to verify the relative accuracy and consistency of the recipes,as systematic changes could mimic evolutionary trends when comparing varioussamples. at z=0.36, all three lines can be observed at optical wavelengths,providing a unique opportunity to compare different empirical recipes. we usespectra from the keck telescope and the sloan digital sky survey to compareblack hole mass estimators for a sample of nineteen agns at this redshift. wecompare popular recipes available from the literature, finding that massestimates can differ up to 0.38+-0.05 dex in the mean (or 0.13+-0.05 dex, ifthe same virial coefficient is adopted). finally, we provide a set of 30internally self consistent recipes for determining black hole mass from avariety of observables. the intrinsic scatter between cross-calibrated recipesis in the range 0.1-0.3 dex. this should be considered as a lower limit to theuncertainty of the black hole mass estimators.

1110.1637	can minor merging account for the size growth of quiescent galaxies? new  results from the candels survey	the presence of extremely compact galaxies at z~2 and their subsequent growthin physical size has been the cause of much puzzlement. we revisit the questionusing deep infrared wide field camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame opticalstructure of 935 host galaxies selected with 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 and stellar masses m* &gt;10^10.7 msol using optical and near-infrared photometry in the ukirt ultra deepsurvey and goods-south fields of the candels survey. at each redshift, the mostcompact sources are those with little or no star formation, and we find thatthe mean size of these systems grows by a factor of 3.5 +- 0.3 over thisredshift interval. the new data are sufficiently deep to enable us to identifycompanions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller, whilestill yielding suitably accurate photometric redshifts to define a likelyphysical association. by searching for faint companions around 404 quiescenthosts within a projected physical annulus 10 &lt; r &lt; 30 kpc/h, we estimate theminor merger rate over the redshift range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2. after correcting forcontamination from projected pairs, we find that 13-18% of quiescent hosts havelikely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. mergersof these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6+-2% per mergertimescale. we estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain thedeclining abundance of compact galaxies. using a simple model of mergingmotivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers ofthe faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimalrate. we find that mergers with mass ratios &gt; 0.1 may explain most of the sizeevolution observed at z &gt;~ 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed,but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additionalphysical processes.

1111.4215	evidence for dark matter contraction and a salpeter imf in a massive  early-type galaxy	stars and dark matter account for most of the mass of early-type galaxies,but uncertainties in the stellar population and the dark matter profile make itchallenging to distinguish between the two components. nevertheless, preciseobservations of stellar and dark matter are extremely valuable for testing themany models of structure formation and evolution. we present a measurement ofthe stellar mass and inner slope of the dark matter halo of a massiveearly-type galaxy at $z=0.222$. the galaxy is the foreground deflector of thedouble einstein ring gravitational lens system sdssj0946+1006, also known asthe "jackpot". by combining the tools of lensing and dynamics, we firstconstrain the mean slope of the total mass density profile($\rho_{\rm{tot}}\propto r^{-\gamma'}$) within the radius of the outer ring tobe $\gamma' = 1.98\pm0.02\pm0.01$. then we obtain a bulge-halo decomposition,assuming a power-law form for the dark matter halo. our analysis yields$\gamma_{\rm{dm}} = 1.7\pm0.2$ for the inner slope of the dark matter profile,in agreement with theoretical findings on the distribution of dark matter inellipticals, and a stellar mass from lensing and dynamics $m_*^{\rm{ld}} =5.5_{-1.3}^{+0.4}\times10^{11}m_\sun$. by comparing this measurement withstellar masses inferred from stellar population synthesis fitting we find thata salpeter imf provides a good description of the stellar population of thelens while the probability of the imf being heavier than chabrier is 95%. ourdata suggest that growth by accretion of small systems from a compact rednugget is a plausible formation scenario for this object.

0711.0888	two-dimensional kinematics of slacs lenses: i. phase-space analysis of  the early-type galaxy sdss j2321-097 at z=0.1	we present the first results of a combined vlt vimos integral-field unit andhubble space telescope (hst)/acs study of the early-type lens galaxy sdssj2321-097 at z=0.0819, extending kinematic studies to a look-back time of 1gyr. this system, discovered in the sloan lens acs survey (slacs), has beenobserved as part of a vlt large programme with the goal of obtainingtwo-dimensional stellar kinematics of 17 early-type galaxies to z~0.35 and keckspectroscopy of an additional dozen lens systems. bayesian modelling of boththe surface brightness distribution of the lensed source and thetwo-dimensional measurements of velocity and velocity dispersion has allowedus, under the only assumptions of axisymmetry and a two-integral stellardistribution function (df) for the lens galaxy, to dissect this galaxy in threedimensions and break the classical mass--anisotropy, mass-sheet andinclination--oblateness degeneracies. our main results are that the galaxy (i)has a total density profile well described by a single power-law rho proptor^{-gamma'} with gamma'=2.06^{+0.03}_{-0.06}; (ii) is a very slow rotator(specific stellar angular momentum parameter lambda_r = 0.075); (iii) showsonly mild anisotropy (delta ~ 0.15); and (iv) has a dark matter contribution of~30 per cent inside the effective radius. our first results from this largecombined imaging and spectroscopic effort with the vlt, keck and hst show thatthe structure of massive early-type galaxies beyond the local universe can nowbe studied in great detail using the combination of stellar kinematics andgravitational lensing. extending these studies to look-back times whereevolutionary effects become measurable holds great promise for theunderstanding of formation and evolution of early-type galaxies.

1205.3789	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: dynamical modeling of the broad  line region in mrk 50	we present dynamical modeling of the broad line region (blr) in the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 50 using reverberation mapping data taken as part of the lick agnmonitoring project (lamp) 2011. we model the reverberation mapping datadirectly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the blr, as well asderiving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizingfactor or virial coefficient. we find that the geometry of the blr in mrk 50 isa nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, awidth of the blr of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of25\pm10 degrees above the plane. we also constrain the inclination angle to be9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. finally, the black hole mass of mrk 50 isinferred to be log10(m(bh)/msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). by comparison to thevirial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mappinganalysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f)= 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74based on aligning the m(bh)-{\sigma}* relation for agn and quiescent galaxies.while our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflowin the blr, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.

0711.2073	amuse-virgo i. super-massive black holes in low-mass spheroids	we present the first results from the agn multiwavelength survey ofearly-type galaxies in the virgo cluster (amuse-virgo). this large programtargets 100 early-type galaxies with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer onboard the chandra x-ray observatory and the multi-band imaging photometer onboard the spitzer space telescope, with the aim of providing an unbiased censusof low-level super-massive black hole (smbh) activity in the local universe.here we report on the chandra observations of the first 16 targets, and combinethem with results from archival data of another, typically more massive, 16targets. point-like x-ray emission from a position coincident with the opticalnucleus is detected in 50% of the galaxies (down to our completeness limit of~4e+38 erg/sec). two of the x-ray nuclei are hosted by galaxies (vcc1178=n4464and vcc1297=n4486b) with absolute b magnitudes fainter than -18, where nuclearstar clusters are known to become increasingly common. after carefullyaccounting for possible contamination from low mass x-ray binaries, we arguethat the detected nuclear x-ray sources are most likely powered by low-levelaccretion on to a smbh, with a &lt;11% chance contamination in vcc1178, where astar cluster is barely resolvable in archival hubble space telescope images.based on black hole mass estimates from the global properties of the hostgalaxies, all the detected nuclei are highly sub-eddington, with luminositiesin the range -8.4&lt;log(l_0.3-10kev/l_edd)&lt;-5.9. the incidence of nuclear x-rayactivity increases with the stellar mass m_star of the host galaxy: onlybetween 3-44% of the galaxies with m_star&lt;1e+10 m_sun harbor an x-ray activesmbh. the fraction rises to between 49-87% in galaxies with stellar mass above1e+10 m_sun (at the 95% confidence level).

1209.1391	the density profiles of massive, relaxed galaxy clusters. i. the total  density over three decades in radius	clusters of galaxies are excellent locations to probe the distribution ofbaryons and dark matter (dm) over a wide range of scales. we study a sample ofseven massive, relaxed galaxy clusters with centrally-located brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) at z=0.2-0.3. using the observational tools of strong and weakgravitational lensing, combined with resolved stellar kinematics within thebcg, we measure the total radial density profile, comprising both dark andbaryonic matter, over scales of ~3-3000 kpc. lensing-derived mass profilestypically agree with independent x-ray estimates within ~15%, suggesting thatdepartures from hydrostatic equilibrium are small and that the clusters in oursample (except a383) are not strongly elongated along the line of sight. theinner logarithmic slope gamma_tot of the total density profile measured overr/r200=0.003-0.03, where rho_tot ~ r^(-gamma_tot), is found to be nearlyuniversal, with a mean &lt;gamma_tot&gt; = 1.16 +- 0.05 (random) +0.05-0.07(systematic) and an intrinsic scatter of &lt; 0.13 (68% confidence). this isfurther supported by the very homogeneous shape of the observed velocitydispersion profiles, obtained via keck spectroscopy, which are mutuallyconsistent after a simple scaling. remarkably, this slope agrees closely withnumerical simulations that contain only dark matter, despite the significantcontribution of stellar mass on the scales we probe. the navarro-frenk-whiteprofile characteristic of collisionless cold dark matter is a betterdescription of the total mass density at radii &gt;~ 5-10 kpc than that of darkmatter alone. hydrodynamical simulations that include baryons, cooling, andfeedback currently provide a poorer match. we discuss the significance of ourfindings for understanding the assembly of bcgs and cluster cores, particularlythe influence of baryons on the inner dm halo.

1209.1392	the density profiles of massive, relaxed galaxy clusters. ii. separating  luminous and dark matter in cluster cores	we present stellar and dark matter (dm) density profiles for a sample ofseven massive, relaxed galaxy clusters derived from strong and weakgravitational lensing and resolved stellar kinematic observations within thecentrally-located brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). in paper i of the series,we demonstrated that the total density profile derived from these data, whichspan 3 decades in radius, is consistent with numerical dm-only simulations atradii &gt;~ 5-10 kpc, despite the significant contribution of stellar material inthe core. here we decompose the inner mass profiles of these clusters intostellar and dark components. parametrizing the dm density profile as a powerlaw rho_dm ~ r^{-\beta} on small scales, we find a mean slope &lt;\beta&gt; = 0.50 +-0.10 (random) +0.14-0.13 (systematic). alternatively, cored navarro-frenk-white(nfw) profiles with &lt;log r_core/kpc&gt; = 1.14 +- 0.13 (random) +0.14-0.22(systematic) provide an equally good description. these density profiles aresignificantly shallower than canonical nfw models at radii &lt;~ 30 kpc,comparable to the effective radii of the bcgs. the inner dm profile iscorrelated with the distribution of stars in the bcg, suggesting a connectionbetween the inner halo and the assembly of stars in the central galaxy. thestellar mass-to-light ratio inferred from lensing and stellar dynamics isconsistent with that inferred using stellar population synthesis models if asalpeter initial mass function is adopted. we compare these results to theoriesdescribing the interaction between baryons and dm in cluster cores, includingadiabatic contraction models and the possible effects of galaxy mergers andactive galactic nucleus feedback, and evaluate possible signatures ofalternative dm candidates.

1209.3773	recalibration of the virial factor and m-sigma relation for local active  galaxies	determining the virial factor of the broad-line region (blr) gas is crucialfor calibrating agn black hole mass estimators, since the measuredline-of-sight velocity needs to be converted into the intrinsic virialvelocity. the average virial factor has been empirically calibrated based onthe m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies, but the claimed values differ by afactor of two in recent studies. we investigate the origin of the difference bymeasuring the m-sigma relation using an updated galaxy sample from theliterature, and explore the dependence of the virial factor on various fittingmethods. we find that the discrepancy is primarily caused by the sampleselection, while the difference stemming from the various regression methods ismarginal. however, we generally prefer the fitexy and bayesian estimators basedon monte carlo simulations for the m-sigma relation. in addition, the choice ofindependent variable in the regression leads to ~0.2 dex variation in thevirial factor inferred from the calibration process. based on the determinedvirial factor, we present the updated m-sigma relation of local activegalaxies.

1303.1742	the low-luminosity end of the radius-luminosity relationship for active  galactic nuclei	we present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between thehbeta broad-line region (blr) radius and the luminosity of the active galacticnucleus (agn). specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surfacebrightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new agns imaged with thehubble space telescope wide field camera 3. the surface brightnessdecompositions allow us to create "agn-free" images of the galaxies, from whichwe measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measuredthrough the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. we also incorporate 20 newreverberation-mapping measurements of the hbeta time lag, which is assumed toyield the average hbeta blr radius. the final sample includes 41 agns coveringfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. the additions and updates incorporatedhere primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the r-l relationship. the bestfit to the relationship using a bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simplephotoionization arguments. only two agns appear to be outliers from therelationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubtregarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. the scatter around therelationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. a large fraction of theremaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distancesto the agn host galaxies. our results help support the possibility that the r-lrelationship could potentially be used to turn the blrs of agns intostandardizable candles. this would allow the cosmological expansion of theuniverse to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a largerrange of redshifts.

1303.3588	improving the precision of time-delay cosmography with observations of  galaxies along the line of sight	in order to use strong gravitational lens time delays to measure precise andaccurate cosmological parameters the effects of mass along the line of sightmust be taken into account. we present a method to achieve this by constrainingthe probability distribution function of the effective line of sightconvergence k_ext. the method is based on matching the observed overdensity inthe weighted number of galaxies to that found in mock catalogs with k_extobtained by ray-tracing through structure formation simulations. we exploreweighting schemes based on projected distance, mass, luminosity, and redshift.this additional information reduces the uncertainty of k_ext from sigma_k $0.06to ~0.04 for very overdense lines of sight like that of the system b1608+656.for more common lines of sight, sigma_k is reduced to ~&lt;0.03, corresponding toan uncertainty of ~&lt;3% on distance. this uncertainty has comparable effects oncosmological parameters to that arising from the mass model of the deflectorand its immediate environment. photometric redshifts based on g, r, i and kphotometries are sufficient to constrain k_ext almost as well as withspectroscopic redshifts. as an illustration, we apply our method to the systemb1608+656. our most reliable k_ext estimator gives sigma_k=0.047 down from0.065 using only galaxy counts. although deeper multi-band observations of thefield of b1608+656 are necessary to obtain a more precise estimate, we concludethat grik photometry, in addition to spectroscopy to characterize the immediateenvironment, is an effective way to increase the precision of time-delaycosmography.

1303.4389	the bulge-halo conspiracy in massive elliptical galaxies: implications  for the stellar initial mass function and halo response to baryonic processes	recent studies have shown that massive elliptical galaxies have total massdensity profiles within an effective radius that can be approximated as\rho_{tot}\propto r^{-\gamma'}, with mean slope &lt;\gamma'&gt;=2.08 \pm 0.03 andscatter \sigma_\gamma'=0.16 \pm 0.02. the small scatter of the slope (known asthe bulge-halo conspiracy) is not generic in lcdm based models and thereforecontains information about the galaxy formation process. we compute thedistribution of \gamma' for lcdm-based models that reproduce the observedcorrelations between stellar mass, velocity dispersion, and effective radius ofearly-type galaxies in the sdss. the models have a range of stellar initialmass functions (imfs) and dark halo responses to galaxy formation. the observeddistribution of \gamma' is well reproduced by a model with cosmologicallymotivated but uncontracted dark matter haloes, and a salpeter-type imf. othermodels are on average ruled out by the data, even though they may happen inindividual cases. models with adiabatic halo contraction (and lighter imfs)predict too small values of \gamma'. models with halo expansion, ormass-follows-light predict too high values of \gamma'. our study shows that thenon-homologous structure of massive early-type galaxies can be preciselyreproduced by lcdm models if the imf is not universal and if mechanisms such asfeedback from active galactic nuclei, or dynamical friction, effectively onaverage counterbalance the contraction of the halo expected as a result ofbaryonic cooling.

(2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

[...] we consider whetherthis configuration can be used to constrain cosmological parameters exploitingangular distance ratios entering the lens equations. constraints forsdssj0946+1006, are uninteresting due to the sub-optimal lens and sourceredshifts. we then consider the perturbing effect of the mass associated withring 1 building a double lens plane compound lens model. this introduces minorchanges to the mass of the main lens and allows to estimate the mass of ring 1$(\sigma_{sie,s1}=94\pm30\kms)$. we examine the prospects of doing cosmographywith a sample of 50 double lenses, expected from future space based surveyssuch as dune or jdem. taking full account of the model uncertainties, such asample could be used to measure $\omega_m$ and $w$ with 10% accuracy, for aflat cosmology.

1310.3280	purely dry mergers do not explain the observed evolution of massive  early-type galaxies since z = 1	several studies have suggested that the observed size evolution of massiveearly-type galaxies (etgs) can be explained as a combination of dry mergers andprogenitor bias, at least since z\sim1. in this paper we carry out a new testof the dry-merger scenario based on recent lensing measurements of theevolution of the mass density profile of etgs. we construct a theoretical modelfor the joint evolution of the size and mass density profile slope \gamma'driven by dry mergers occurring at rates given by cosmological simulations.such dry-merger model predicts a strong decrease of \gamma' with cosmic time,inconsistent with the almost constant \gamma' inferred from observations in theredshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1. we then show with a simple toy model that a modest amountof cold gas in the mergers -- consistent with the upper limits on recent starformation in etgs -- is sufficient to reconcile the model with measurements of\gamma'. by fitting for the amount of gas accreted during mergers, we find thatmodels with dissipation are consistent with observations of the evolution inboth size and density slope, if \sim4% of the total final stellar mass arisesfrom the gas accreted since z\sim1. purely dry merger models are ruled out at &gt;99% cl. we thus suggest a scenario where the outer regions of massive etgs growby accretion of stars and dark matter, while small amounts of dissipation andnuclear star formation conspire to keep the mass density profile constant andapproximately isothermal.

1310.4830	strong lens time delay challenge: i. experimental design	the time delays between point-like images in gravitational lens systems canbe used to measure cosmological parameters. the number of lenses with measuredtime delays is growing rapidly; the upcoming \emph{large synoptic surveytelescope} (lsst) will monitor $\sim10^3$ strongly lensed quasars. in an effortto assess the present capabilities of the community to accurately measure thetime delays, and to provide input to dedicated monitoring campaigns and futurelsst cosmology feasibility studies, we have invited the community to take partin a "time delay challenge" (tdc). the challenge is organized as a set of"ladders," each containing a group of simulated datasets to be analyzed blindlyby participating teams. each rung on a ladder consists of a set of realisticmock observed lensed quasar light curves, with the rungs' datasets increasingin complexity and realism. the initial challenge described here has twoladders, tdc0 and tdc1. tdc0 has a small number of datasets, and is designed tobe used as a practice set by the participating teams. the (non-mandatory)deadline for completion of tdc0 was the tdc1 launch date, december 1, 2013. thetdc1 deadline was july 1 2014. here we give an overview of the challenge, weintroduce a set of metrics that will be used to quantify the goodness-of-fit,efficiency, precision, and accuracy of the algorithms, and we present theresults of tdc0. thirteen teams participated in tdc0 using 47 differentmethods. seven of those teams qualified for tdc1, which is described in thecompanion paper ii.

1310.5177	the swells survey. vi. hierarchical inference of the initial mass  functions of bulges and discs	the long-standing assumption that the stellar initial mass function (imf) isuniversal has recently been challenged by a number of observations. severalstudies have shown that a "heavy" imf (e.g., with a salpeter-like abundance oflow mass stars and thus normalisation) is preferred for massive early-typegalaxies, while this imf is inconsistent with the properties of less massive,later-type galaxies. these discoveries motivate the hypothesis that the imf mayvary (possibly very slightly) across galaxies and across components ofindividual galaxies (e.g. bulges vs discs). in this paper we use a sample of 19late-type strong gravitational lenses from the swells survey to investigate theimfs of the bulges and discs in late-type galaxies. we perform a joint analysisof the galaxies' total masses (constrained by strong gravitational lensing) andstellar masses (constrained by optical and near-infrared colours in the contextof a stellar population synthesis [sps] model, up to an imf normalisationparameter). using minimal assumptions apart from the physical constraint thatthe total stellar mass within any aperture must be less than the total masswithin the aperture, we find that the bulges of the galaxies cannot have imfsheavier (i.e. implying high mass per unit luminosity) than salpeter, while thedisc imfs are not well constrained by this data set. we also discuss thenecessity for hierarchical modelling when combining incomplete informationabout multiple astronomical objects. this modelling approach allows us to placeupper limits on the size of any departures from universality. more data,including spatially resolved kinematics (as in paper v) and stellar populationdiagnostics over a range of bulge and disc masses, are needed to robustlyquantify how the imf varies within galaxies.

(2) anir echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existingdust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to haveejected another 10 msun shell about 1500 yr before the sn.

1403.4246	x-ray constraints on the local supermassive black hole occupation  fraction	distinct seed formation mechanisms are imprinted upon the fraction of dwarfgalaxies currently containing a central supermassive black hole. seeding by popiii remnants is expected to produce a higher occupation fraction than isgenerated with direct gas collapse precursors. chandra observations of nearbyearly-type galaxies can directly detect even low-level supermassive black holeactivity, and the active fraction immediately provides a firm lower limit tothe occupation fraction. here, we use the volume-limited amuse surveys of ~200optically-selected early-type galaxies to characterize simultaneously, for thefirst time, the occupation fraction and the scaling of nuclear x-ray luminositywith stellar mass, accounting for intrinsic scatter, measurement uncertainties,and x-ray limits. for early-type galaxies with log(m_star/m_sun)&lt;10, we obtaina lower limit to the occupation fraction of &gt;20% (at 95% confidence), but fulloccupation cannot be excluded. the preferred dependence of log(l_x) uponlog(m_star) has a slope of about 0.7-0.8, consistent with the "downsizing"trend previously identified from the amuse dataset, and a uniform eddingtonefficiency is disfavored at ~2 sigma. we provide guidelines for the futureprecision with which these parameters may be refined with larger or moresensitive samples.

1406.6697	amuse-field ii. nucleation of early-type galaxies in the field vs.  cluster environment	the optical light profiles of nearby early type galaxies are known to exhibita smooth transition from nuclear light deficits to nuclear light excesses withdecreasing galaxy mass, with as much as 80 per cent of the galaxies withstellar masses below 10^10 msun hosting a massive nuclear star cluster. at thesame time, while all massive galaxies are thought to harbor nuclearsuper-massive black holes (smbhs), observational evidence for smbhs is slim atthe low end of the mass function. here, we explore the environmental dependenceof the nucleation fraction by comparing two homogeneous samples of nearby fieldvs. cluster early type galaxies with uniform hubble space telescope (hst)coverage. existing chandra x-ray telescope data for both samples yieldcomplementary information on low-level accretion onto nuclear smbhs.specifically, we report on dual-band (f475w &amp; f850lp) advanced camera forsurveys (acs) imaging data for 28 out of the 103 field early type galaxies thatcompose the amuse-field chandra survey, and compare our results against thecompanion hst and chandra surveys for a sample of 100 virgo cluster early types(acs virgo cluster and amuse-virgo surveys, respectively). we model thetwo-dimensional light profiles of the field targets to identify andcharacterize nscs, and find a field nucleation fraction of 26% (+17%, -11%; atthe 1-sigma level), consistent with the measured virgo nucleation fraction of30% (+17%, -12%), across a comparable mass distribution. coupled with thechandra result that smbh activity is higher for the field, our findingsindicate that, since the last epoch of star formation, the funneling of gas tothe nuclear regions has been inhibited more effectively for virgo galaxies,arguably via ram pressure stripping.

1410.1881	the sl2s galaxy-scale lens sample. v. dark matter halos and stellar imf  of massive early-type galaxies out to redshift 0.8	we investigate the cosmic evolution of the internal structure of massiveearly-type galaxies over half of the age of the universe. we perform a jointlensing and stellar dynamics analysis of a sample of 81 strong lenses from thesl2s and slacs surveys and combine the results with a hierarchical bayesianinference method to measure the distribution of dark matter mass and stellarimf across the population of massive early-type galaxies. lensing selectioneffects are taken into account. we find that the dark matter mass projectedwithin the inner 5 kpc increases for increasing redshift, decreases forincreasing stellar mass density, but is roughly constant along the evolutionarytracks of early-type galaxies. the average dark matter slope is consistent withthat of an nfw profile, but is not well constrained. the stellar imfnormalization is close to a salpeter imf at $\log{m_*} = 11.5$ and scalesstrongly with increasing stellar mass. no dependence of the imf on redshift orstellar mass density is detected. the anti-correlation between dark matter massand stellar mass density supports the idea of mergers being more frequent inmore massive dark matter halos.

1410.4565	data mining for gravitationally lensed quasars	gravitationally lensed (gl) quasars are brighter than their unlensedcounterparts and produce images with distinctive morphological signatures. pastsearches and target selection algorithms, in particular the sloan quasar lenssearch (sqls), have relied on basic morphological criteria, which were appliedto samples of bright, spectroscopically confirmed quasars. the sqls techniquesare not sufficient for searching into new surveys (e.g. des, ps1, lsst),because spectroscopic information is not readily available and the large datavolume requires higher purity in target/candidate selection. we carry out asystematic exploration of machine learning techniques and demonstrate that atwo step strategy can be highly effective. in the first step we usecatalog-level information ($griz$+wise magnitudes, second moments) to preselecttargets, using artificial neural networks. the accepted targets are theninspected with pixel-by-pixel pattern recognition algorithms (gradient-boostedtrees), to form a final set of candidates. the results from this procedure canbe used to further refine the simpler sqls algorithms, with a twofold (orthreefold) gain in purity and the same (or $80\%$) completeness attarget-selection stage, or a purity of $70\%$ and a completeness of $60\%$after the candidate-selection step. simpler photometric searches in $griz$+wisebased on colour cuts would provide samples with $7\%$ purity or less. ourtechnique is extremely fast, as a list of candidates can be obtained from astage iii experiment (e.g. des catalog/database) in {a few} cpu hours.  the techniques are easily extendable to stage iv experiments like lsst withthe addition of time domain information.

1410.7402	understanding the unique assembly history of central group galaxies	central galaxies (cgs) in massive halos live in unique environments withformation histories closely linked to that of the host halo. in local clustersthey have larger sizes ($r_e$) and lower velocity dispersions (sigma) at fixedstellar mass m_star, and much larger r_e at a fixed $\sigma$ than field andsatellite galaxies (non-cgs). using spectroscopic observations of groupgalaxies selected from the cosmos survey, we compare the dynamical scalingrelations of early-type cgs and non-cgs at z~0.6, to distinguish possiblemechanisms that produce the required evolution. cgs are systematically offsettowards larger r_e at fixed $\sigma$ compared to non-cgs with similar m_star.the cg r_e-m_star relation also shows differences, primarily driven by asub-population (~15%) of galaxies with large $r_e$, while the m_star-sigmarelations are indistinguishable. these results are accentuated when doublesersic profiles, which better fit light in the outer regions of galaxies, areadopted. they suggest that even group-scale cgs can develop extended componentsby these redshifts that can increase total $r_e$ and m_star estimates byfactors of ~2. to probe the evolutionary link between our sample and clustercgs, we also analyze two cluster samples at z~0.6 and z~0. we find similarresults for the more massive halos at comparable z, but much more distinct cgscaling relations at low-z. thus, the rapid, late-time accretion of outercomponents, perhaps via the stripping and accretion of satellites, would appearto be a key feature that distinguishes the evolutionary history of cgs.

1412.4133	scaling relations between black holes and their host galaxies: comparing  theoretical and observational measurements, and the impact of selection  effects	we use the high-resolution simulation massiveblackii to examine scalingrelations between black hole mass (mbh) and host galaxy properties (sigma, m*,and lv), finding good agreement with observational data, especially at thehigh-mass end. the simulations have less intrinsic scatter than observations,and the mbh-lv correlation has the largest scatter, suggesting it may the theleast fundamental of the three relations. we find gaussian scatter about allthree relations, except among the highest mass galaxies, which host moremassive black holes. below z~2 the slopes for the full population remainroughly z-independent, and only steepen by 50% by z~4. the normalization of thesigma, lv relations evolve by 0.3, 0.43 dex, while the mbh correlation does notevolve to at least z~2. testing for selection biases, we find samples selectedby mbh or m* have steeper slopes than randomly selected samples. if unaccountedfor, such a selection function would find faster evolution than inferred from arandomly selected sample, as objects at the highend of the relation tend toevolve more rapidly. we find a potential bias among high-lbh subsamples(tending to reside in higher mass galaxies), but these bright-agn exhibit nointrinsic bias relative to fainter ones in equivalent-mass hosts, nor is therea significant difference between active- and inactive-samples. finally wecharacterize the evolution of individual black holes along the scaling planes.below the local relation, black holes grow faster than their host (72% of blackholes 0.3 dex below the mean relation have a mbh-m* trajectory steeper than thelocal relation), while those above have shallower trajectories (only 14% aresteeper than local). black holes tend to grow faster than their hosts untilsurpassing the local relation, at which point their growth is suppressed whiletheir hosts continue to grow, returning them to the mean relation.

1412.6916	gravitational lensing - einstein's unfinished symphony	gravitational lensing - the deflection of light rays by gravitating matter -has become a major tool in the armoury of the modern cosmologist. proposednearly a hundred years ago as a key feature of einstein's theory of generalrelativity, we trace the historical development since its verification at asolar eclipse in 1919. einstein was apparently cautious about its practicalutility and the subject lay dormant observationally for nearly 60 years.nonetheless there has been rapid progress over the past twenty years. thetechnique allows astronomers to chart the distribution of dark matter on largeand small scales thereby testing predictions of the standard cosmological modelwhich assumes dark matter comprises a massive weakly-interacting particle. bymeasuring distances and tracing the growth of dark matter structure over cosmictime, gravitational lensing also holds great promise in determining whether thedark energy, postulated to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion, is avacuum energy density or a failure of general relativity on large scales. weillustrate the wide range of applications which harness the power ofgravitational lensing, from searches for the earliest galaxies magnified bymassive clusters to those for extrasolar planets which temporarily brighten abackground star. we summarise the future prospects with dedicated ground andspace-based facilities designed to exploit this remarkable physical phenomenon.

1502.02031	constraints on the broad line region from regularized linear inversion:  velocity-delay maps for five nearby active galactic nuclei	reverberation mapping probes the structure of the broad emission-line region(blr) in active galactic nuclei (agn). the kinematics of the blr gas can beused to measure the mass of the central supermassive black hole. the mainuncertainty affecting black hole mass determinations is the structure of theblr. we present a new method for reverberation mapping based on regularizedlinear inversion (rli) that includes modelling of the agn continuum lightcurves. this enables fast calculation of velocity-resolved response maps toconstrain blr structure. rli allows for negative response, such as when someareas of the blr respond in inverse proportion to a change in ionizingcontinuum luminosity. we present time delays, integrated response functions,and velocity-delay maps for the $\rm{h}\,\beta$ broad emission line in fivenearby agn, as well as for $\rm{h}\,\alpha$ and $\rm{h}\,\gamma$ in arp 151,using data from the lick agn monitoring project 2008. we find indications ofprompt response in three of the objects (arp 151, ngc 5548 and sbs 1116+583a)with additional prompt response in the red wing of $\rm{h}\,\beta$. in sbs1116+583a we find evidence for a multimodal broad prompt response followed by asecond narrow response at 10 days. we find no clear indications of negativeresponse. the results are complementary to, and consistent with, other methodssuch as cross correlation, maximum entropy and dynamical modelling. regularizedlinear inversion with continuum light curve modelling provides a fast,complementary method for velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and issuitable for use on large datasets.

1502.03795	correcting the z~8 galaxy luminosity function for gravitational lensing  magnification bias	we present a bayesian framework to account for the magnification bias fromboth strong and weak gravitational lensing in estimates of high-redshift galaxyluminosity functions. we illustrate our method by estimating the $z\sim8$ uvluminosity function using a sample of 97 y-band dropouts (lyman break galaxies)found in the brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) survey and from theliterature. we find the luminosity function is well described by a schechterfunction with characteristic magnitude of $m^\star = -19.85^{+0.30}_{-0.35}$,faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.72^{+0.30}_{-0.29}$, and number density of$\log_{10} \psi^\star [\textrm{mpc}^{-3}] = -3.00^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$. theseparameters are consistent within the uncertainties with those inferred from thesame sample without accounting for the magnification bias, demonstrating thatthe effect is small for current surveys at $z\sim8$, and cannot account for theapparent overdensity of bright galaxies compared to a schechter function foundrecently by bowler et al. (2014a,b) and finkelstein et al. (2014). we estimatethat the probability of finding a strongly lensed $z\sim8$ source in our sampleis in the range $\sim 3-15 \%$ depending on limiting magnitude. we identify onestrongly-lensed candidate and three cases of intermediate lensing in borg(estimated magnification $\mu&gt;1.4$) in addition to the previously knowncandidate group-scale strong lens. using a range of theoretical luminosityfunctions we conclude that magnification bias will dominate wide field surveys-- such as those planned for the euclid and wfirst missions -- especially at$z&gt;10$. magnification bias will need to be accounted for in order to deriveaccurate estimates of high-redshift luminosity functions in these surveys andto distinguish between galaxy formation models.

1503.05282	luminous and dark matter profiles from galaxies to clusters: bridging  the gap with group-scale lenses	observations of strong gravitational lensing, stellar kinematics, andlarger-scale tracers enable accurate measures of the distribution of darkmatter (dm) and baryons in massive early-type galaxies (etgs). while suchtechniques have been applied to galaxy-scale and cluster-scale lenses, thepaucity of intermediate-mass systems with high-quality data has precluded auniform analysis of mass-dependent trends. with the aim of bridging this gap,we present new observations and analyses of 10 group-scale lenses at &lt;z&gt;=0.36characterized by einstein radii theta_ein=2.5"-5.1" and a mean halo mass ofm_200=10^14.0 msol. we measure a mean concentration c_200=5.0+-0.8 consistentwith unmodified cold dark matter halos. by combining our data with other lenssamples, we analyze the mass structure of etgs in 10^13 msol-10^15 msol halosusing homogeneous techniques. we show that the slope of the total densityprofile gamma_tot within the effective radius depends on the stellar surfacedensity, as demonstrated previously, but also on the halo mass. we analyzethese trends using halo occupation models and resolved stellar kinematics withthe goal of testing the universality of the dm profile. whereas the centralgalaxies of clusters require a shallow inner dm density profile, group-scalelenses are consistent with a navarro-frenk-white profile or one that isslightly contracted. the largest uncertainties arise from the sample size andlikely radial gradients in stellar populations. we conclude that the net effectof baryons on the dm distribution may not be universal, but more likely varieswith halo mass due to underlying trends in star formation efficiency andassembly history.

0806.2320	revealing the properties of dark matter in the merging cluster  macsj0025.4-1222	we constrain the physical nature of dark matter using the newly identifiedmassive merging galaxy cluster macsj0025.4-1222. as was previously shown by theexample of the bullet cluster (1e0657-56), such systems are ideal laboratoriesfor detecting isolated dark matter, and distinguishing between cold dark matter(cdm) and other scenarios (e.g. self-interacting dark matter, alternativegravity theories). macsj0025.4-1222 consists of two merging subclusters ofsimilar richness at z=0.586. we measure the distribution of x-ray emitting gasfrom chandra x-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from thedistribution of galaxies. a strong (information from highly distorted arcs) andweak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensinganalysis based on hubble space telescope observations and keck arc spectroscopyconfirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. the total mass distributionin each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at &gt;4sigma significance) from thepeak of the hot x-ray emitting gas (the main baryonic component), but alignedwith the distribution of galaxies. we measure the fractions of mass in hot gas(0.09^{+0.07}_{-0.03}) and stars (0.010^{+0.007}_{-0.004}), consistent withthose of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributorto the gravitational field. under the assumption that the subclustersexperienced a head-on collision in the plane of the sky, we obtain anorder-of-magnitude estimate of the dark matter self-interaction cross-sectionof sigma/m &lt; 4cm^2/g, re-affirming the results from the bullet cluster on thecollisionless nature of dark matter.

astro-ph;0202342	the internal structure and formation of early-type galaxies: the  gravitational--lens system mg2016+112 at z=1.004	[abridged] we combine our measurements of the velocity dispersion and thesurface brightness profile of the lens galaxy d in the system mg2016+112(z=1.004) with constraints from gravitational lensing to study its internalmass distribution. we find that: (i) dark matter accounts for &gt;50% of the totalmass within the einstein radius (99% cl), excluding at the 8-sigma level thatmass follows light inside the einstein radius with a constant mass-to-lightratio (m/l). (ii) the total mass distribution inside the einstein radius iswell-described by a density profile ~r^-gamma' with an effective slopegamma'=2.0+-0.1+-0.1, including random and systematic uncertainties. (iii) theoffset of galaxy d from the local fundamental plane independently constrainsthe stellar m/l, and matches the range derived from our models, leading to amore stringent lower limit of &gt;60% on the fraction of dark matter within theeinstein radius (99%cl).  under the assumption of adiabatic contraction, the inner slope of the darkmatter halo before the baryons collapsed is gamma_i&lt;1.4 (68 cl), marginallyconsistent with the highest-resolution cold dark matter simulations thatindicate gamma_i~1.5. this might indicate that either adiabatic contraction isa poor description of e/s0 formation or that additional processes play a roleas well. indeed, the apparently isothermal density distribution inside theeinstein radius, is not a natural outcome of adiabatic contraction models,where it appears to be a mere coincidence. by contrast, we argue thatisothermality might be the result of a stronger coupling between luminous anddark-matter, possibly the result of (incomplete) violent relaxation processes.hence, we conclude that galaxy d appears already relaxed 8 gyr ago.

(2003). one possible lyman-alpha emitter atz=6.24 is found in the goods-n field (although identification of thisspatially-offset emission line is ambiguous). using the rest-frame uv continuumfrom our 6 candidate z~6 galaxies from the goods-n field, we determine a lowerlimit to the unobscured volume-averaged global star formation rate at z~6 of(5.4+/-2.2)x10^-4 h_70 m_sun/yr/mpc^3. we find that the cosmic star formationdensity in galaxies with unobscured star formation rates 15m_sun/yr/h_70^2falls by a factor of 8 between z~3 and z~6. hence the luminosity function oflbgs must evolve in this redshift interval: a constant integrated starformation density at $z&gt;3$ requires a much steeper faint-end slope, or abrighter characteristic luminosity. this result is in agreement with ourprevious measurement from the chandra deep field south (stanway et al. 2003),indicating that cosmic variance is not a dominant source of uncertainty.

astro-ph;0309465	the dark matter distribution in the central regions of galaxy clusters:  implications for cdm	we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey of gravitational arcs in acarefully chosen sample of six clusters each containing a dominant brightestcluster galaxy. we use these systems to study the relative distributions ofdark and baryonic material in the central regions. three clusters present bothradial and tangential arcs and provide particularly strong constraints on themass profiles, whereas the other three display only tangential arcs and act asa control set. we analyze stellar velocity dispersion data for the brightestcluster galaxies in conjunction with the arc redshifts and lens models toconstrain the dark and baryonic mass profiles jointly. for the systemscontaining radial arcs we find that the inner dark matter density profile isconsistent with a 3-d distribution, rho_{dm} propto r^-beta, with logarithmicslope &lt;beta&gt;=0.52^{+0.05}_{-0.05} (68% cl). similarly, we find that thetangential arc sample gives an upper limit, beta&lt;0.57 (99% cl). taking the 6clusters together, the mean dark matter distribution is quite inconsistent withthe standard navarro, frenk &amp; white (1997) value, beta=1.0, at &gt;99% confidence.in addition, we find considerable cosmic scatter in the beta (delta beta ~0.3)values of the radial arc sample. we find no evidence that systems with radialarcs preferentially yield flatter dark matter profiles as might be expected ifthey were a biased subset. we discuss the validity of our 1-d massreconstruction method and verify its conclusions by comparing with results of amore rigorous ray-tracing lensing code. our results extend and strengthen theearlier conclusions presented by sand et al.

(iii) the inner power-law slope of the dark-matter halois constrained to be &lt;\gamma&gt;=1.3(+0.2/-0.4) (68% cl) for the isotropic modelor an upper limit of \gamma&lt;0.6, if the galaxies are radially anisotropic(r_i=r_e). this is consistent with numerical simulations only for an isotropicvelocity ellipsoid and if baryonic collapse and star-formation do not steependark-matter density profiles.

astro-ph;0403455	evolution since z=1 of the morphology-density relation of galaxies	we measure the morphology-density relation of galaxies at z=1 across the fullthree orders of magnitude in projected galaxy density available in low-redshiftstudies. our study adopts techniques that are comparable with those applied atlower redshifts, allowing a direct investigation of how the morphologicalsegregation of galaxies has evolved over the last 8 gyr. although themorphology-density relation, as described by the fraction of early-type (e+s0)galaxies, was in place at z=1, its form differs from that observed at both z=0and z=0.5. in the highest density regions the early-type fraction has increasedsteadily with time from f(e+s0)=0.7+/-0.1 at z=1 to f(e+s0)=0.9+/-0.1 at thepresent epoch. however, in intermediate density regions corresponding to groupsand the accretion regions of rich clusters, significant evolution appears tobegin only after z=0.5. finally, at the lowest densities, no evolution isobserved for the early-type fraction of field galaxies which remains constantat f(e+s0)=0.4+/-0.1 at all epochs. we examine a simple picture consistent withthese observations where the early-type population at z=1 is comprised largelyof elliptical galaxies. subsequent evolution in both intermediate and denseregions is attributed to the transformation of spirals into lenticulars.further progress in verifying our hypothesis may be achieved throughdistinguishing ellipticals and lenticulars at these redshifts through resolveddynamical studies of representative systems.

astro-ph;0603648	cosmic evolution of black holes and spheroids. i: the m_bh-sigma  relation at z=0.36	we test the evolution of the correlation between black hole mass and bulgevelocity dispersion (m$_{\rm bh}-\sigma$), using a carefully selected sample of14 seyfert 1 galaxies at $z=0.36\pm0.01$. we measure velocity dispersion fromstellar absorption lines around mgb (5175\aa) and fe (5270\aa) using high s/nkeck spectra, and estimate black hole mass from the h$\beta$ line width and theoptical luminosity at 5100\aa, based on the empirically calibratedphoto-ionization method. we find a significant offset from the local relation,in the sense that velocity dispersions were smaller for given black hole massesat $z=0.36$ than locally. we investigate various sources of systematicuncertainties and find that those cannot account for the observed offset. themeasured offset is $\delta \log m_{\rm bh}=0.62 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.25$, i.e.$\delta \log \sigma=0.15 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.06$, where the error bars include arandom component and an upper limit to the systematics. at face value, thisresult implies a substantial growth of bulges in the last 4 gyr, assuming thatthe local m$_{\rm bh}-\sigma$ relation is the universal evolutionary end-point.along with two samples of active galaxies with consistently determined blackhole mass and stellar velocity dispersion taken from the literature, wequantify the observed evolution with the best fit linear relation, $\delta \logm_{\rm bh} = (1.66\pm0.43)z + (0.04\pm0.09)$ with respect to the localrelationship of tremaine et al. (2002), and $\delta \log m_{\rm bh} =(1.55\pm0.46)z + (0.01\pm0.12)$ with respect to that of ferrarese (2002). thisresult is consistent with the growth of black holes predating the final growthof bulges at these mass scales ($&lt;\sigma&gt;$=170 km s$^{-1}$).

astro-ph;0701114	the dynamical distinction between elliptical and lenticular galaxies in  distant clusters: further evidence for the recent origin of s0 galaxies	we examine resolved spectroscopic data obtained with the keck ii telescopefor 44 spheroidal galaxies in the fields of two rich clusters, cl0024+16(z=0.40) and ms0451-03 (z=0.54), and contrast this with similar data for 23galaxies within the redshift interval 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.65 in the goods northern field.for each galaxy we examine the case for systemic rotation, derive centralstellar velocity dispersions sigma and photometric ellipticities, epsilon.using morphological classifications obtained via hubble space telescope imagingas the basis, we explore the utility of our kinematic quantities indistinguishing between pressure-supported ellipticals androtationally-supported lenticulars (s0s). we demonstrate the reliability ofusing the v/(1-epsilon) vs sigma and v/sigma vs epsilon distributions asdiscriminators, finding that the two criteria correctly identify 63%+-3% and80%+-2% of s0s at z~0.5, respectively, along with 76%+8-3% and 79%+-2% ofellipticals. we test these diagnostics using equivalent local data in the comacluster, and find that the diagnostics are similarly accurate at z=0. ourmeasured accuracies are comparable to the accuracy of visual classification ofmorphologies, but avoid the band-shifting and surface brightness effects thathinder visual classification at high redshifts. as an example application ofour kinematic discriminators, we then examine the morphology-density relationfor elliptical and s0 galaxies separately at z~0.5. we confirm, from kinematicdata alone, the recent growth of rotationally-supported spheroidals. we discussthe feasibility of extending the method to a more comprehensive study ofcluster and field galaxies to z~1, in order to verify in detail the recentdensity-dependent growth of s0 galaxies.

astro-ph;0701156	dynamical evidence for environmental evolution of intermediate redshift  spiral galaxies	combining resolved optical spectroscopy with panoramic hst imaging, we studythe dynamical properties of spiral galaxies as a function of position acrosstwo intermediate redshift clusters, and we compare the cluster population tofield galaxies in the same redshift range. by modelling the observed rotationcurves, we derive maximal rotation velocities for 40 cluster spirals and 37field spirals, yielding one of the largest matched samples of cluster and fieldspirals at intermediate redshift. we construct the tully-fisher relation inboth v and k_s bands, and find that the cluster tully-fisher relation exhibitssignificantly higher scatter than the field relation, in both v and k_s bands.under the assumption that this increased scatter is due to an interaction withthe cluster environment, we examine several dynamical quantities (dynamicalmass, mass-to-light ratio, and central mass density) as a function of clusterenvironment. we find that the central mass densities of star-forming spiralsexhibit a sharp break near the cluster virial radius, with spirals in thecluster outskirts exhibiting significantly lower densities. we argue that thelower-density spirals in the cluster outskirts, combined with the high scatterin both k_s- and v-band tf relations, demonstrate that cluster spirals arekinematically disturbed by their environment, even as far as 2r_vir from thecluster center. we propose that such disturbances may be due to a combinationof galaxy merging and harassment.

astro-ph;0701589	the sloan lens acs survey. iv: the mass density profile of early-type  galaxies out to 100 effective radii	we present a weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 early-type strong lensgalaxies, based on deep hst images obtained as part of the sloan lens acssurvey. using the most advanced techniques to control systematic uncertaintiesrelated to the variable psf and charge transfer efficiency of the acs, wedetect weak lensing signal out to 300 kpc/h. we analyze blank control fieldsfrom the cosmos survey in the same manner, inferring that the residualsystematic uncertainty in the tangential shear is &lt;0.3%. a joint strong andweak lensing analysis shows that the average total mass density profile isconsistent with isothermal over two decades in radius (3-300 kpc/h,approximately 1-100 reff). this finding extends by over an order of magnitudein radius previous results, based on strong lensing and/or stellar dynamics,that luminous and dark component ``conspire'' to form an isothermal massdistribution. in order to disentangle the contributions of luminous and darkmatter, we fit a two-component mass model (r^1/4 + nfw) to the weak and stronglensing constraints. it provides a good fit to the data with only two freeparameters; i) the average stellar mass-to-light ratio m_*/l_v=4.48 +- 0.46hmo/lo, in agreement with that expected for an old stellar population; ii) theaverage virial mass-to-light ratio m_vir/l_v = 246+101-87 hmo/lo.

astro-ph;9907178	a nicmos search for high redshift elliptical galaxy candidates	we have collected optical follow-up observations from the ground and thehubble space telescope (hst) for 13.74 square ' of archival images taken withthe near infrared camera and multi object spectrograph (nicmos). we use twocriteria to select e/s0 galaxy candidates at z&gt;~1 and z&gt;~1.5 (hizecs) based oncolors and infrared morphology. the observed surface density of hizecs issignificantly smaller than what is predicted assuming the local luminosityfunction (lf) of e/s0, constant comoving density, and pure passive evolutionwith a high redshift of formation of the stellar populations (z&gt;~ 5). on theother hand, assuming a low redshift (z&lt;~2) of formation, not enough hizecs arepredicted. the data are very well matched assuming that a substantial fractionof present-day e/s0s (10-66%, depending on cosmology and on the local lf ofe/s0s) formed at z = 3 or higher and then evolved passively. the rest of thecurrent e/s0 population may have formed at lower redshift, or may have beenrejected by the selection criteria because of interactions or more recentepisodes of star-formation (disturbed morphology and/or bluer colors).

0809.4260	the nature of dusty starburst galaxies in a rich cluster at z=0.4: the  progenitors of lenticulars?	we present the results of a spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) survey of24um-selected luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs, l_ir &gt; 10^11 l_sun) in therich cluster cl0024+16 at z=0.4. optically, these lirgs resemble unremarkablespiral galaxies with e(a)/e(c) spectral classifications and [oii]-derived starformation rates (sfrs) of &lt;2 m_sun/yr, generally indistinguishable from the'quiescent' star forming population in the cluster. our irs spectra show thatthe majority of the 24um-detected galaxies exhibit polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission with implied sfrs ~30-60 m_sun/yr, with only one(&lt;10%) of the sample displaying unambiguous evidence of an active galacticnucleus in the mid-infrared. this confirms the presence of a large populationof obscured starburst galaxies in distant clusters, which comprise the bulk ofthe star formation occurring in these environments at z~0.5. we suggest that,although several mechanisms could be at play, these dusty starbursts could bethe signature of an important evolutionary transition converting gas-richspiral galaxies in distant clusters into the passive, bulge-dominatedlenticular galaxies that become increasingly abundant in the cores of richclusters in the ~4gyr to the present day.

0810.3004	first results from the lick agn monitoring project: the mass of the  black hole in arp 151	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 13 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun. we present here the first results fromthis project -- the mass of the central black hole in arp 151. strongvariability throughout the campaign led to an exceptionally clean hbeta lagmeasurement in this object of 4.25(+0.68/-0.66) days in the observed frame.coupled with the width of the hbeta emission line in the variable spectrum, wedetermine a black hole mass of (7.1 +/- 1.2)x10^6 m_sun, assuming the onken etal. normalization for reverberation-based virial masses. we also findvelocity-resolved lag information within the hbeta emission line which clearlyshows infalling gas in the hbeta-emitting region. further detailed analysis maylead to a full model of the geometry and kinematics of broad line region gasaround the central black hole in arp 151.

0810.3934	enhanced lensing rate by clustering of massive galaxies: newly  discovered systems in the slacs fields	[abridged] we exploit the clustering of massive galaxies to perform a highefficiency imaging search for gravitational lenses. our dataset comprises 44fields imaged by the hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera for surveys(acs), each of which is centered on a lens discovered by the strong lens acssurvey (slacs). we compare four different search methods: 1) automateddetection with the hst archive galaxy-scale gravitational lens survey (haggles)robot, 2) examining cutout images of bright galaxies (bgs) after subtraction ofa smooth galaxy light distribution, 3) examining the unsubtracted bg cutouts,and 4) performing a full-frame visual inspection of the acs images. we computepurity and completeness and consider investigator time for the four algorithms,using the main slacs lenses as a testbed. the first and second algorithmsperform the best. we present the four new lens systems discovered during thiscomprehensive search, as well as one other likely candidate. for each new lenswe use the fundamental plane to estimate the lens velocity dispersion andpredict, from the resulting lens geometry, the redshifts of the lensed sources.two of these new systems are found in galaxy clusters, which include the slacslenses in the two respective fields. overall we find that the enhanced lensabundance (30^{+24}_{-8} lenses/degree^2) is higher than expected for randomfields (12^{+4}_{-2} lenses/degree^2 for the cosmos survey). additionally, wefind that the gravitational lenses we detect are qualitatively different fromthose in the parent slacs sample: this imaging survey is largely probinghigher-redshift, and lower-mass, early-type galaxies.

0706.0519	cosmic evolution of black holes and spheroids. ii: scaling relations at  z=0.36	we combine hubble space telescope images of a sample of 20 seyfert galaxiesat z=0.36 with spectroscopic information from the keck telescope to determinethe black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation (m-l), the fundamental plane(fp) of the host galaxies and the m-sigma relation. assuming pure luminosityevolution, we find that the host spheroids had smaller luminosity and stellarvelocity dispersion than today for a fixed m. the offsets correspond to deltalog l_b,0=0.40+-0.11+-0.15 (delta log m = 0.51+-0.14+-0.19) and delta log sigma= 0.13+-0.03+-0.05 (delta log m = 0.54+-0.12+-0.21), respectively for the m-land m-sigma relation. a detailed analysis of known systematic errors andselection effects shows that they cannot account for the observed offset. thedata are inconsistent with pure luminosity evolution and the existence ofuniversal and tight scaling relations. to obey the three local scalingrelations by z=0 the distant spheroids have to grow their stellar mass byapproximately 60% (\delta log m_sph=0.20+-0.14) in the next 4 billion years.the measured evolution can be expressed as m/ m_sph ~ (1+z)^{1.5+-1.0}. basedon the disturbed morphologies of a fraction of the sample (6/20) we suggestcollisional mergers with disk-dominated systems as evolutionary mechanism.
