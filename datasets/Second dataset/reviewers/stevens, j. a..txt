0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0908.0819	a 100-kpc inverse compton x-ray halo around 4c60.07 at z=3.79	we analyse a 100-ks chandra observation of the powerful radio galaxy, 4c60.07at z=3.79. we identify extended x-ray emission with lx~10^45 erg/s across a~90-kpc region around the radio galaxy. the energetics of this x-ray halo andits morphological similarity to the radio emission from the galaxy suggest thatit arises from inverse compton (ic) scattering, by relativistic electrons inthe radio jets, of cosmic microwave background photons and potentiallyfar-infrared photons from the dusty starbursts around this galaxy. the x-rayemission has a similar extent and morphology to the ly-alpha halo around thegalaxy, suggesting that it may be ionising this halo. indeed we find that theghz-radio and x-ray and ly-alpha luminosities of the halo around 4c60.07 areidentical to those of 4c41.17 (also at z=3.8) implying that these threecomponents are linked by a single physical process. this is only the secondexample of highly-extended ic emission known at z&gt;3, but it underlines thepotential importance of ic emission in the formation of the most massivegalaxies at high redshifts. in addition, we detect two x-ray luminous activegalactic nuclei (agn) within ~30kpc of the radio galaxy. these two companionagn imply that the radio and starburst activity in the radio galaxy istriggered through multiple mergers of massive progenitors on a short timescale,~100myrs. these discoveries demonstrate the wealth of information whichsensitive x-ray observations can yield into the formation of massive galaxiesat high redshifts.

1001.5419	the environments of z~1 active galactic nuclei at 3.6um	we present an analysis of a large sample of agn environments at z~1 usingstacked spitzer data at 3.6um. the sample contains type-1 and type-2 agn in theform of quasars and radio galaxies, and spans a large range in both optical andradio luminosity. we find, on average, that 2 to 3 massive galaxies containinga substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300 kpc radius of theagn, constituting a &gt;8-sigma excess relative to the field. secondly, we findevidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radioluminosity of agn, but not with black-hole mass. this is shown first bydividing the agn into their classical agn types, where we see more significantover-densities in the fields of the radio-loud agn. if instead we dispense withthe classical agn definitions, we find that the source over-density as afunction of radio luminosity for all our agn exhibits a positive correlation.one interpretation of this result is that the mpc-scale environment is in someway influencing the radio emission that we observe from agn. this could beexplained by the confinement of radio jets in dense environments leading toenhanced radio emission or, alternatively, may be linked to more rapidblack-hole spin brought on by galaxy mergers.

1003.2166	an excess of star-forming galaxies in the fields of high-redshift qsos	we present submillimetre and mid-infrared imaging observations of five fieldscentred on quasi-stellar objects (qsos) at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.8. all 5 qsos were detectedpreviously at submillimetre wavelengths. at 850 (450) um we detect 17 (11)submillimetre galaxies (smgs) in addition to the qsos. the total area mapped at850 um is ~28 arcmin^2 down to rms noise levels of 1-2 mjy/beam, depending onthe field. integral number counts are computed from the 850 um data using thesame analytical techniques adopted by `blank-field' submillimetre surveys. wefind that the `qso-field' counts show a clear excess over the blank-fieldcounts at deboosted flux densities of 2-4 mjy; at higher flux densities thecounts are consistent with the blank-field counts. robust mid-infraredcounterparts are identified for all four submillimetre detected qsos and ~60per cent of the smgs. the mid-infrared colours of the qsos are similar to thoseof the local ulirg/agn mrk 231 if placed at 1&lt;z&lt;3 whilst most of the smgs havecolours very similar to those of the local ulirg arp 220 at 1&lt;z&lt;3. mid-infrareddiagnostics therefore find no strong evidence that the smgs host buried agnalthough we cannot rule out such a possibility. taken together our resultssuggest that the qsos sit in regions of the early universe which are undergoingan enhanced level of major star-formation activity, and should evolve to becomesimilarly dense regions containing massive galaxies at the present epoch.finally, we find evidence that the level of star-formation activity inindividual galaxies appears to be lower around the qsos than it is around morepowerful radio-loud agn at higher redshifts.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.5390	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared--radio correlation at z&lt;0.5	we use data from the herschel-atlas to investigate the evolution of thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5. using thetotal far-infrared luminosity of all &gt;5sigma sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field and cross-matching these data with radio data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimetres (first) survey and thenrao vla northern sky survey (nvss), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to theherschel sources. with these data we find no evidence for evolution in thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5, where themedian value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rmir}$, over this range is $q_{\rm ir} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rmir}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both thelocal value determined from {\em iras} and values derived from surveystargeting the high-redshift universe. by comparing the radio fluxes of oursample measured from both first and nvss we show that previous resultssuggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm ir}$ from high to low redshiftmay be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshiftsources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although agncontamination could still play a significant role.  we also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust isheated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formationrate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or theradio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individualgalaxies.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.2757	a strongly starforming group: three massive galaxies associated with a  qso	we present here photometric redshift confirmation of the presence of largescale structure around the z=1.82 qso rxj0941, which shows an overdensity ofsubmm sources. radio imaging confirms the presence of the submm sources andpinpoints their likely optical-nir counterparts. four of the five submm sourcespresent in this field (including the qso) have counterparts with redshiftscompatible with z=1.82. we show that our photometric redshifts are robustagainst the use of different spectral templates. we have measured the galaxystellar mass of the submm galaxies from their rest-frame k-band luminosityobtaining log(m*/msun)~11.5+-0.2, slightly larger than the schechter mass ofpresent day galaxies, and hence indicating that most of the stellar mass isalready formed. we present optical-to-radio spectral energy distributions(seds) of the five scuba sources. the emission of rxj0941 is dominated byreprocessed agn emission in the observed mir range, while the starburstcontribution completely dominates in the submm range. the seds of the otherthree counterparts are compatible with a dominant starburst contribution above~24um, with star formation rates sfr~2000msun/yr, central dust masseslog(mdust/msun)~9+-0.5 and hence central gas masses log(mgas/msun)~10.7. thereis very little room for an agn contribution. from x-ray upper limits and theobserved 24um flux, we derive a maximum 2-10kev x-ray luminosity of 1e44 erg/sfor any putative agn, even if they are heavily obscured. this in turn points torelatively small black holes with log(mbh/msun)&lt;~8 and hence stellar-to-blackhole mass ratios about one order of magnitude higher than those observed in thepresent universe: most of their central black hole masses are still to beaccreted. local stellar-to-black hole masses ratios can be reached if ~1.3% ofthe available nuclear gas mass is accreted.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1106.2797	the nature of x-ray absorbed qsos	there exists a significant population of broad line, z~2 qsos which haveheavily absorbed x-ray spectra. follow up observations in the submillimetreshow that these qsos are embedded in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlikemost unabsorbed qsos at the same redshifts and luminosities. here we presentx-ray spectra from xmm-newton for a sample of 5 such x-ray absorbed qsos thathave been detected at submillimetre wavelengths. we also present spectra in therestframe ultraviolet from ground based telescopes. all 5 qsos are found toexhibit strong c iv absorption lines in their ultraviolet spectra withequivalent width &gt; 5 angstroms. the x-ray spectra are inconsistent with thehypothesis that these objects show normal qso continua absorbed bylow-ionization gas. instead, the spectra can be modelled successfully withionized absorbers, or with cold absorbers if they posess unusually flat x-raycontinuum shapes and unusual optical to x-ray spectral energy distributions. weshow that the ionized absorber model provides the simplest, mostself-consistent explanation for their observed properties. we estimate that thefraction of radiated power that is converted into kinetic luminosity of theoutflowing winds is typically ~4 per cent, in agreement with recent estimatesfor the kinetic feedback from qsos required to produce the m - sigma relation,and consistent with the hypothesis that the x-ray absorbed qsos represent thetransition phase between obscured accretion and the luminous qso phase in theevolution of massive galaxies.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1209.0670	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared properties and star-formation rates of  broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects	we have used data from the herschel-atlas at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m todetermine the far-infrared (fir) properties of 50 broad absorption line quasars(bal qsos). our sample contains 49 high-ionization bal qsos (hibals) and 1low-ionization bal qso (lobal) which are compared against a sample of 329non-bal qsos. these samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z &lt;2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq m_{i} \leq -24. ofthese, 3 bal qsos (hibals) and 27 non-bal qsos are detected at the &gt; 5 sigmalevel. we calculate star-formation rates (sfr) for our individually detectedhibal qsos and the non-detected lobal qso as well as average sfrs for the baland non-bal qso samples based on stacking the herschel data. we find nodifference between the hibal and non-bal qso samples in the fir, even whenseparated based on differing bal qso classifications. using mrk 231 as atemplate, the weighted mean sfr is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 m_{\odot}yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upperlimit if agn-heated dust makes a contribution to the fir emission. despitetentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc c\,iv}equivalent width on fir emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflowin these objects is not linked to their fir output. these results stronglysuggest that bal qsos (more specifically hibals) can be accommodated within asimple agn unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersectsoutflowing material. models in which hibals are caught towards the end of aperiod of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a windterminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed firproperties.

1210.6361	the herschel view of the environment of the radio galaxy 4c+41.17 at z =  3.8	we present herschel observations at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 micron of theenvironment of the radio galaxy 4c+41.17 at z = 3.792. about 65% of theextracted sources are securely identified with mid-ir sources observed with thespitzer space telescope at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24 micron. we derive simplephotometric redshifts, also including existing 850 micron and 1200 micron data,using templates of agn, starburst-dominated systems and evolved stellarpopulations. we find that most of the herschel sources are foreground to theradio galaxy and therefore do not belong to a structure associated with4c+41.17. we do, however, find that the sed of the closest (~ 25" offset)source to the radio galaxy is fully consistent with being at the same redshiftas 4c+41.17. we show that finding such a bright source that close to the radiogalaxy at the same redshift is a very unlikely event, making the environment of4c+41.17 a special case. we demonstrate that multi-wavelength data, inparticular on the rayleigh-jeans side of the spectral energy distribution,allow us to confirm or rule out the presence of protocluster candidates thatwere previously selected by single wavelength data sets.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1304.0770	galaxy clusters around radio-loud agn at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 as seen by  spitzer	we report the first results from the clusters around radio-loud agn (carla)program, a cycle 7 and 8 spitzer space telescope snapshot program toinvestigate the environments of a large sample of obscured and unobscuredluminous radio-loud agn at 1.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. these data, obtained for 387 fields,reach 3.6 and 4.5 um depths of [3.6] (ab) = 22.6 and [4.5] (ab) = 22.9 at the95% completeness level, which is two to three times fainter than l* in thisredshift range. by using the color cut [3.6]-[4.5] &gt; -0.1 (ab), whichefficiently selects high-redshift (z &gt; 1.3) galaxies of all types, we identifygalaxy cluster member candidates in the fields of the radio-loud agn. the localdensity of these irac-selected sources is compared to the density of similarlyselected sources in blank fields. we find that 92% of the radio-loud agn residein environments richer than average. the majority (55%) of the radio-loud agnfields are found to be overdense at a &gt; 2 {\sigma} level; 10% are overdense ata &gt; 5 {\sigma} level. a clear rise in surface density of irac-selected sourcestowards the position of the radio-loud agn strongly supports an association ofthe majority of the irac-selected sources with the radio-loud agn. our resultsprovide solid statistical evidence that radio-loud agn are likely beacons forfinding high-redshift galaxy (proto-)clusters. we investigate how environmentdepends on agn type (unobscured radio-loud quasars vs. obscured radiogalaxies), radio luminosity and redshift, finding no correlation with eitheragn type or radio luminosity. we find a decrease in density with redshift,consistent with galaxy evolution for this uniform, flux-limited survey. theseresults are consistent with expectations from the orientation-driven agnunification model, at least for the high radio luminosity regimes considered inthis sample.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1409.1218	why z &gt; 1 radio-loud galaxies are commonly located in proto-clusters	distant powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (rlagn) tend to reside indense environments and are commonly found in proto-clusters at z &gt; 1.3. weexamine whether this occurs because rlagn are hosted by massive galaxies, whichpreferentially reside in rich environments. we compare the environments ofpowerful rlagn at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 from the carla survey to a sample ofradio-quiet galaxies matched in mass and redshift. we find the environments ofrlagn are significantly denser than those of radio-quiet galaxies, implyingthat not more than 50% of massive galaxies in this epoch can host powerfulradio-loud jets. this is not an observational selection effect as we find noevidence to suggest it is easier to observe the radio emission when the galaxyresides in a dense environment. we therefore suggest that the dense mpc-scaleenvironment fosters the formation of a radio-jet from an agn. we show that thenumber density of potential rlagn host galaxies is consistent with every &gt;10^14 solar mass cluster having experienced powerful radio-loud feedback ofduration ~60 myr during 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. this feedback could heat theintracluster medium to the extent of 0.5-1 kev per gas particle, which couldlimit the amount of gas available for further star formation in theproto-cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;0302289	the nature of x-ray selected eros	we report on the x-ray, optical, near-infrared, submillimetre and radioproperties of five extremely red objects (eros) selected at x-ray wavelengthsby xmm-newton in the lockman hole field. they all have enough counts in thex-ray band to allow spectral fitting: four are most probably obscured,compton-thin agn with redshift dependent absorbing column densities of 10^22 -10^24 cm-2, whilst the fifth is best fitted by a thermal spectrum and is likelyto be a massive elliptical galaxy in a deep gravitational potential. theiroptical/near-infrared colours and sizes suggest that x-ray selected eroscomprise a mixture of dusty 'starburst' galaxies and non-dusty galaxies thatare dominated by either star-light or light from an active nucleus. the colourdiagnostics are supported by the submillimetre and radio data: the two agn with'starburst' colours have submillimetre or radio flux densities that imply largestar-formation rates, whilst those with 'elliptical' colours do not. the onesource detected in the submillimetre waveband has narrow emission lines at aredshift of 1.45. although the bulk of its radio emission originates fromprocesses other than star formation, it is most probably a radio-quietultraluminous infrared galaxy.

astro-ph;0307560	chandra detections of scuba galaxies around high-z radio sources	the most massive galaxies in the present day universe are the giantellipticals found in the centers of rich clusters. these have old, coevalstellar populations, suggesting they formed at high redshift, and are expectedto host supermassive black holes (smbhs). the recent detection of severalhigh-redshift radio galaxies (hzrgs) at submm wavelengths confirms that indeedsome massive galaxies may have formed the bulk of their stellar populations inspectacular dust-enshrouded starbursts at high-z. in this letter we comparesensitive chandra x-ray images - which identify actively-fueled smbhs - andsubmm observations - capable of detecting obscured activity in luminousgalaxies at high redshift - of the environments of three hzrgs. theseobservations exhibit overdensities of x-ray sources in all 3 fields and a closecorrespondence between the chandra and scuba populations. this suggests thatboth substantial star formation and nuclear activity may be occuring in theseregions. we identify possible pairs of chandra sources with each of 2 scubasources, suggesting that their ultraluminous activity may be triggered by theinteraction of two massive galaxies, each of which hosts an accreting smbh. thepresence of two smbhs in the resulting remanent is predicted to produce aflattened stellar core in the galaxy, a morphological signature frequently seenin luminous cluster ellipticals. hence the confirmation of pairs of chandrasources within individual, luminous scuba galaxies would provide additionalevidence that these galaxies at z~2-4 are the progenitors of the giantelliptical galaxies found in clusters at the present-day.

astro-ph;0402098	a filamentary structure of massive star-forming galaxies associated with  an x-ray absorbed qso at z=1.8	the genesis of spheroids is central to our understanding of galaxy formation-- they are relatively simple systems, containing about half the stellar massof the universe. a major subset of spheroids, massive elliptical galaxies, arepreferentially found in clusters where they exhibit old, coeval stellarpopulations suggesting that they formed synchronously at early epochs. here wereport scuba submillimeter imaging of a region around a z=1.8 x-ray selectedqso. the image reveals a remarkable 400 kiloparsec long chain of galaxies eachwith an obscured star-formation rate sufficiently high to build a massivespheroid in less than 1 gyr. the large over-density of these galaxies relativeto expectations for a random field implies they probably reside in a structureassociated with the qso. we suggest that this star formation is associated withgalaxy mergers or encounters within the filament, such as those predicted bythe popular hierarchical model of galaxy formation. our observations suggestthat strong absorption in the x-ray spectra of qsos at high-redshifts mayresult from a veil of gas thrown up by a merger or merger-induced activity,rather than an orientation-dependent obscuring torus. it is argued that thesesystems are the precursors of elliptical galaxies found today in the coreregions of all rich galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0405361	a 1200 micron mambo survey of elais n2 and the lockman hole: i. maps,  sources and number counts	we present a deep, new 1200 micron survey of the elais n2 and lockman holefields using the max planck millimeter bolometer array (mambo). the areassurveyed are 160 arcmin^2 in elais n2 and 197 arcmin^2 in the lockman hole,covering the entire scuba `8 mjy survey'. in total, 27 (44) sources have beendetected at a significance &gt;=4.0sigma (&gt;=3.5sigma). we present the 1200 micronnumber counts and find evidence of a fall at bright flux levels. employingparametric models for the evolution of the local 60 micron iras luminosityfunction (lf), we are able to account simultaneously for the 1200 and 850micron counts, suggesting that the mambo and scuba sources trace the sameunderlying population of high-redshift, dust-enshrouded galaxies. from anearest-neighbour clustering analysis we find tentative evidence that the mostsignificant mambo sources come in pairs, typically separated by ~23". our mamboobservations unambiguously confirm around half of the scuba sources. in arobust sub-sample of 13 smgs detected by both mambo and scuba at a significance&gt;=3.5sigma, only one has no radio counterpart. furthermore, the distribution of850/1200 micron flux density ratios for this sub-sample is consistent with thespectroscopic redshift distribution of radio-detected smgs (chapman et al.2003). finally, we have searched for evidence of a high-redshift tail of smgsamongst the 18 mambo sources which are not detected by scuba. while we cannotrule out that some of them are scuba drop-outs at z &gt;&gt; 3, their overall850-to-1200 micron flux distribution is statistically indistinguishable fromthat of the 13 smgs which were robustly identified by both mambo and scuba.

astro-ph;0407171	the evolutionary sequence of active galactic nuclei and galaxy formation  revealed	today, almost every galaxy spheroid contains a massive black hole: a remnantof, and testament to, a period in its evolution when it contained an activegalactic nucleus (agn). however, the sequence and timescales of the formationof the black hole and surrounding spheroid of stars are completely unknown,leaving a large gap in our knowledge of how the universe attained its presentappearance. here we present submillimeter observations of matched samples ofx-ray absorbed and unabsorbed agn which have luminosities and redshiftscharacteristic of the sources responsible for most of the mass in present dayblack holes. strong submillimeter emission, an isotropic signature of copiousstar formation, is found only in the x-ray absorbed sample, ruling outorientation effects as the cause of the absorption. the space density andluminosity range of the x-ray absorbed agn indicate that they are undergoingthe transition between a hidden growth phase and an unabsorbed agn phase, andimplies that the x-ray absorbed period in the agn's evolution coincides withthe formation of the galaxy spheroid.

astro-ph;0503618	submillimetre photometry of x-ray absorbed qsos: their formation and  evolutionary status	we present an analysis of the submillimetre/x-ray properties of 19 x-rayabsorbed, compton-thin quasi-stellar objects (qsos) selected to haveluminosities and redshifts which represent the peak of cosmic qso activity.i.e. ~l* objects at 1&lt;z&lt;3. of these, we present new data for 11 objects notpreviously observed at submillimetre wavelengths and additional data for afurther 3. the detection rate is 42 per cent, much higher than typicallyreported for samples of qsos. detection statistics show (at the 3-4 sigmalevel) that this sample of absorbed qsos has a higher submillimetre output thana matched sample of unabsorbed qsos. we argue that the far-infrared luminosityis produced by massive star formation. in this case, the correlation foundbetween far-infrared luminosity and redshift can be interpreted as cosmologicalevolution of the star-formation rate in the qso host galaxies. since thesubmillimetre luminous phase is confined to z&gt;1.5, the high star formationrates are consistent with a scenario in which the qsos evolve to become localluminous elliptical galaxies.  combining these results with previously published data for x-ray unabsorbedqsos and submillimetre-selected galaxies we propose the following evolutionarysequence: the forming galaxy is initially far-infrared luminous but x-ray weaksimilar to the sources discovered by the submillimetre common-user bolometerarray; as the black hole and spheroid grow with time a point is reached whenthe central qso becomes powerful enough to terminate the star formation andeject the bulk of the fuel supply (the compton-thin absorbed qso phase); thistransition is followed by a period of unobscured qso activity whichsubsequently declines to leave a quiescent spheroidal galaxy.

astro-ph;0509364	350 micron sharc-ii imaging of luminous high-z radio galaxies	using the filled bolometer array sharc-ii on the caltech submillimeterobservatory (cso), we have obtained deep (rms ~ 15mjy/beam), high-quality 350micron maps of five of the most luminous high-z radio galaxies known. in allcases the central radio galaxy is detected at the &gt;3sigma level, and in somecases the high resolution of sharc-ii (fwhm ~ 9") allows us to confirm thespatially extended nature of the dust emission. in pks1138-262 (z=2.156),8c1909+722 (z=3.538) and 4c41.17 (z=3.792), additional sources -- firstdiscovered by scuba at 850 micron and believed to be dusty, merging systemsassociated with the central radio galaxy -- are detected at 350 micron.furthermore, in pks1138 and 4c41.17 additional sharc-ii sources are seen whichwere not detected at 850 micron, although the reality of these sources willhave to be confirmed by independent submm observations. thus, our observationsseem to support the notion of extended star formation taking place in radiogalaxies at high redshifts, and that these systems sit at the centers ofoverdense regions harbouring a complexity of dusty and vigorously star formingsystems. at the redshift of the radio galaxies, the 350 micron observationssample very close to the rest-frame dust peak (typically at ~100 micron), andthey therefore contribute a particularly important point to the spectral energydistributions of these sources, which we use this in conjunction with existing(sub)millimeter data to derive fir luminosities, dust temperatures and spectralemissivities of the central radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0509898	a robust sample of submillimetre galaxies: constraints on the prevalence  of dusty, high-redshift starbursts	the modest significance of most sources detected in current submm surveys canpotentially compromise some analyses due to the inclusion of spurious sourcesin catalogues typically selected at &gt;3.0-3.5sigma. here, we develop and apply adual-survey extraction technique to scuba and mambo images of the lockman hole.cut above 5sigma, our catalogue of smgs is more robust than previous samples,with a reduced likelihood of real, but faint smgs (beneath and around theconfusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. the effective fluxlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-ghz image. the former issensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latterprobes the z&lt;3 regime. a high fraction of our robust smgs (~80%) have radiocounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggeststhat very distant smgs (z&gt;&gt;3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of thebright smg population. this implies that almost all of the bright smgpopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. we usethese radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positionaluncertainty in smg catalogues. we then go on to outline the acquisition ofredshifts for radio-identified smgs, from sample selection in the submm, tocounterpart selection in the radio and optical/ir, to slit placement onspectrograph masks. we determine a median of z=2.05 +/- 0.41 from a sample ofsix secure redshifts for unambigious radio-identified submm sources and z=2.14+/- 0.27 when we include submm sources with multiple radio counterparts and/orless reliable redshifts. these figures are consistent with previous estimates,suggesting that our knowledge of the median redshift of bright smgs populationhas not been biased by the low significance of the source catalogues employed.

astro-ph;0511747	the nature of x-ray absorbed starburst qsos and the qso evolutionary  scheme	in contradiction to the simple agn unification schemes, there exists asignificant population of broad line, z~2 qsos which have heavily absorbedx-ray spectra. these objects have luminosities and redshifts characteristic ofthe sources that produce the bulk of the qso luminosity in the universe. ourfollow up observations in the submillimetre show that these qsos are embeddedin ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike most unabsorbed qsos at the sameredshifts and luminosities. the radically different star formation propertiesbetween the absorbed and unabsorbed qsos implies that the x-ray absorption isunrelated to the torus invoked in agn unification schemes. the most puzzlingquestion about these objects is the nature of the x-ray absorber. we presentour study of the x-ray absorbers based on deep (50-100ks) xmm-newtonspectroscopy. the hypothesis of a normal qso continuum, coupled with a neutralabsorber is strongly rejected. we consider the alternative hypotheses for theabsorber, originating either in the qso or in the surrounding starburst.finally we discuss the implications for qso/host galaxy formation, in terms ofan evolutionary sequence of star formation and black hole growth. we proposethat both processes occur simultaneously in the gas-and-dust-rich heavilyobscured centres of young galaxies, and that absorbed qsos form a transitionalstage, between the main obscured growth phase, and the luminous qso.

astro-ph;0610229	x-ray absorbed qsos and the qso evolutionary sequence	unexpected in the agn unified scheme, there exists a population of broad-linez~2 qsos which have heavily absorbed x-ray spectra. these objects constitute10% of the population at luminosities and redshifts characteristic of the mainproducers of qso luminosity in the universe. our follow up observations in thesubmm show that these qsos are often embedded in ultraluminous starburstgalaxies, unlike most qsos at the same redshifts and luminosities. theradically different star formation properties between the absorbed andunabsorbed qsos implies that the x-ray absorption is unrelated to the torusinvoked in agn unification schemes. instead, these results suggest that theobjects represent a transitional phase in an evolutionary sequence relating thegrowth of massive black holes to the formation of galaxies. the most puzzlingquestion about these objects has always been the nature of the x-ray absorber.we present our study of the x-ray absorbers based on deep (50-100ks) xmm-newtonspectroscopy. we show that the absorption is most likely due to a dense ionisedwind driven by the qso. this wind could be the mechanism by which the qsoterminates the star formation in the host galaxy, and ends the supply ofaccretion material, to produce the present day black hole/spheroid mass ratio.
