0901.1943	comparative analysis of the diffuse radio emission in the galaxy  clusters a1835, a2029, and ophiuchus	we recently performed a study of a sample of relaxed, cooling core galaxyclusters with deep very large array observations at 1.4 ghz. we find that inthe central regions of a1835, a2029, and ophiuchus the dominant radio galaxy issurrounded by a diffuse low-brightness radio emission that takes the form of amini-halo. here we present the results of the analysis of the extended diffuseradio emission in these mini-halos. in order to investigate the morphologicalproperties of the diffuse radio emission in clusters of galaxies we propose tofit their azimuthally averaged brightness profile with an exponential,obtaining the central brightness and the e-folding radius from which the radioemissivity can be calculated. we investigate the radio properties of themini-halos in a1835, a2029, and ophiuchus in comparison with the radioproperties of a representative sample of mini-halos and halos already known inthe literature. we find that radio halos can have quite different length-scalesbut their emissivity is remarkably similar from one halo to the other. incontrast, mini-halos span a wide range of radio emissivity. some of them, likethe perseus mini-halos, are characterized by a radio emissivity which is morethan 100 times greater than that of radio halos. on the other hand, the newmini-halos in cooling core clusters analyzed in this work, namely a2029,ophiuchus, and a1835, have a radio emissivity which is much more typical ofhalos in merging clusters rather than similar to that of the other mini-halospreviously known.

0902.3709	diffuse baryonic matter beyond 2020	the hot, diffuse gas that fills the largest overdense structures in theuniverse -- clusters of galaxies and a web of giant filaments connecting them-- provides us with tools to address a wide array of fundamental astrophysicaland cosmological questions via observations in the x-ray band. clusters aresensitive cosmological probes. to utilize their full potential for precisioncosmology in the following decades, we must precisely understand their physics-- from their cool cores stirred by jets produced by the central supermassiveblack hole (itself fed by inflow of intracluster gas), to their outskirts,where the infall of intergalactic medium (igm) drives shocks and acceleratescosmic rays. beyond the cluster confines lies the virtually unexplored warmigm, believed to contain most of the baryonic matter in the present-dayuniverse. as a depository of all the matter ever ejected from galaxies, itcarries unique information on the history of energy and metal production in theuniverse. currently planned major observatories, such as astro-h and ixo, willmake deep inroads into these areas, but to see the most interesting parts ofthe picture will require an almost science-fiction-grade facility with tens ofm^2 of effective area, subarcsecond angular resolution, a matching imagingcalorimeter and a super high-dispersion spectrograph, such as generation-x.

0903.0388	towards the 2020 vision of the baryon content of galaxy groups and  clusters	groups and clusters of galaxies occupy a special position in the hierarchy oflarge-scale cosmic structures because they are the largest and the most massive(from ~10^13 msun to over 10^15 msun) objects in the universe that have hadtime to undergo gravitational collapse. the large masses of clusters imply thattheir contents have been accreted from regions of ~8-40 comoving mpc in sizeand should thus be representative of the mean matter content of the universe.during the next decade sensitive multi-wavelength observations should be ableto map the radial distributions of all main mass components (stars, cold, warm,and hot gas and total mass) at z&lt;~ 1 out to the virial radius. at the sametime, comparative studies of real and simulated cluster samples sould allow usto use clusters as veritable astrophysical laboratories for studying galaxyformation, as well as testing our theoretical models of structure formation andunderlying assumptions about fundamental physics governing the universe.

0904.0610	gas sloshing and bubbles in the galaxy group ngc 5098	we present results from chandra observations of the galaxy pair andassociated galaxy group ngc 5098, and find evidence for both gas sloshing andagn heating. the x-ray brightness images show diffuse emission with a spiralstructure, centered on ngc 5098a, and a sharp edge in the diffuse emissionsurrounding much of the galaxy at about 30 kpc. the spiral structure in thex-ray surface brightness and temperature maps, the offset between the peak ofthe cool gas and the central agn, and the structure of the cold front edges allsuggest gas sloshing in the core. the most likely perturber is the nearbygalaxy ngc 5098b, which has been stripped of its gaseous atmosphere. detailedimages of the core reveal several x-ray cavities, two of which, just north andsoutheast of the central agn, correlate with radio emission and have brightx-ray rims, similar to buoyant bubbles seen in the icm of other systems. weestimate the pressures in the bubbles and rims and show that they are roughlyequal, consistent with these being young features, as suggested by their closeproximity to the central agn. we assume that the other x-ray cavities in thecore, which show no correlation with existing radio observations, are ghostcavities from previous agn outbursts. an estimate of the mechanical energyrequired to inflate the cavities indicates that it is sufficient to offsetradiative cooling of the gas for 15 myr. therefore, for a typical cycle time of10^7 yrs, the central agn energy output is enough to balance cooling over longtimescales.

0912.0237	stirring up the pot: can cooling flows in galaxy clusters be quenched by  gas sloshing?	x-ray observations of clusters of galaxies reveal the presence of edges insurface brightness and temperature, known as "cold fronts". in relaxed clusterswith cool cores, these commonly observed edges have been interpreted asevidence for the "sloshing" of the core gas in the cluster's gravitationalpotential. such sloshing may provide a source of heat to the cluster core bymixing hot gas from the cluster outskirts with the cool core gas. usinghigh-resolution $n$-body/eulerian hydrodynamics simulations, we model gassloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by mergers with subclusters. thesimulations include merger scenarios with gas-filled and gasless subclusters.the effect of changing the viscosity of the intracluster medium is alsoexplored. we find that sloshing can facilitate heat inflow to the cluster core,provided that there is a strong enough disturbance. in adiabatic simulations,we find that sloshing can raise the entropy floor of the cluster core by nearlyan order of magnitude in the strongest cases. if the icm is viscous, the mixingof gases with different entropies is decreased and consequently the heat fluxto the core is diminished. in simulations where radiative cooling is included,we find that though eventually a cooling flow develops, sloshing can preventthe significant buildup of cool gas in the core for times on the order of a gyrfor small disturbances and a few gyr for large ones. if repeated encounterswith merging subclusters sustain the sloshing of the central core gas as isobserved, this process can provide a relatively steady source of heat to thecore, which can help to prevent a significant cooling flow.

0708.3253	complex x-ray morphology of abell 3128: a distant cluster behind a  disturbed cluster	we present here the results of a detailed study of the x-ray properties ofthe cluster of galaxies abell 3128 (z=0.06), based on the analysis of deep (100ks) xmm-newton data. the most obvious feature of the x-ray morphology of a3128is the presence of two x-ray peaks separated by ~12'. by detecting theredshifted fe k line, we find that the northeast (ne) x-ray peak observedtoward a3128 is a distant luminous cluster of galaxies at redshift z=0.44. oursubsequent optical spectroscopic observation of a distant radio bright galaxyin the centre of the ne x-ray peak with the magellan telescope also revealed aredshift of z=0.44, confirming the association of the galaxy with the clusterseen in x-rays. we detect a gravitational arc around the galaxy. the propertiesof this galaxy indicate that it is the cd galaxy of the cluster in thebackground. the properties of the southwest x-ray peak suggest that it is thecore of a group merging with a3128 along our line of sight. based on 2d maps ofthermodynamic properties of the intra-cluster medium determined aftersubtracting a model for the background cluster, we conclude that an enhancedsurface brightness region at a distance of ~2.8' from the centre of the galaxydistribution is the centre of the gravitational potential of the cluster a3128.the unrelaxed nature of a3128 can be attributed to its location in the highdensity environment of the horologium-reticulum supercluster.

1011.0567	dying radio sources in clusters	we present the study of five `dying' nearby radio galaxies belonging to thewenss minisurvey and to the b2 bright catalogs: wnb1734+6407, wnb1829+6911,wnb1851+5707, b2 0120+33, and b2 1610+29. these sources have been selected onthe basis of their extremely steep broad-band radio spectra. the modeling ofthe integrated spectra and the deep spectral index images obtained with the vlaconfirmed that in these sources the central engine has ceased to be active fora significant fraction of their lifetime although their extended lobes have notyet completely faded away. we found that wnb1851+5707 is in reality composed bytwo distinct dying galaxies, which appear blend together as a single source inthe wenss. in the cases of wnb1829+6911 and b2 0120+33, the fossil radio lobesare seen in conjunction with a currently active core. a very faint core isdetected also in a merlin image of wnb1851+5707a, one of the two dying sourcescomposing wnb1851+5707. we found that all sources of our sample are located (atleast in projection) at the center of an x-ray emitting cluster. our resultssuggest that the duration of the dying phase for a radio source in cluster canbe significantly higher with respect to that of a radio galaxy in the field.the simplest interpretation is that the low-frequency emission from the fadingradio lobes last longer if their expansion is somewhat reduced or even stopped.another possibility is that the occurrence of dying sources is higher in galaxyclusters. radio sources in dense environment, like e.g. the center of coolingcore clusters, may have a peculiar accretion mode which results in a burstingduty cycle sequence of active and quiescent periods. this result could haveimportant implications for theories of the life cycles of radio sources and agnfeedback in clusters of galaxies but awaits confirmation from futureobservations of larger samples of objects.

1011.3141	a radio minihalo in the extreme cool-core galaxy cluster rxcj1504.1-0248	aims. we report the discovery of a radio minihalo in rxcj1504.1-0248, amassive galaxy cluster that has an extremely luminous cool core. to date, only9 radio minihalos are known, thus the discovery of a new one, in one of themost luminous cool-core clusters, provides important information on thispeculiar class of sources and sheds light on their origin. methods. the diffuseradio source is detected using gmrt at 327 mhz and confirmed by pointed vladata at 1.46 ghz. the minihalo has a radius of $\sim$140 kpc. a chandra gastemperature map shows that the minihalo emission fills the cluster cool coreand has some morphological similarities to it, as has been previously observedfor other minihalos. results. the chandra data reveal two subtle cold fronts inthe cool core, likely created by sloshing of the core gas, as observed in mostcool-core clusters. following previous work, we speculate that the origin ofthe minihalo is related to sloshing. sloshing may result in particleacceleration by generating turbulence and/or amplifying the magnetic field inthe cool core, leading to the formation of a minihalo.

1108.4427	sloshing of the magnetized cool gas in the cores of galaxy clusters	x-ray observations of many clusters of galaxies reveal the presence of edgesin surface brightness and temperature, known as "cold fronts". in relaxedclusters with cool cores, these edges have been interpreted as evidence for the"sloshing" of the core gas in the cluster's gravitational potential. thesmoothness of these edges has been interpreted as evidence for the stabilizingeffect of magnetic fields "draped" around the front surfaces. to check thishypothesis, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulations ofmagnetized gas sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by encounters withsubclusters. we go beyond previous works on the simulation of cold fronts in amagnetized intracluster medium by simulating their formation in realistic,idealized mergers with high resolution ({\delta}x ~ 2 kpc). our simulationssample a parameter space of plausible initial magnetic field strengths andfield configurations. in the simulations, we observe strong velocity shearsassociated with the cold fronts amplifying the magnetic field along the coldfront surfaces, increasing the magnetic field strength in these layers by up toan order of magnitude, and boosting the magnetic pressure up tonear-equipartition with thermal pressure in some cases. in these layers, themagnetic field becomes strong enough to stabilize the cold fronts againstkelvin-helmholtz instabilities, resulting in sharp, smooth fronts as those seenin observations of real clusters. these magnetic fields also result in strongsuppression of mixing of high and low-entropy gas in the cluster, seen in oursimulations of mergers in the absence of a magnetic field. as a result, theheating of the core due to sloshing is very modest and is unable to stave off acooling catastrophe.

1204.6005	cold fronts and gas sloshing in galaxy clusters with anisotropic thermal  conduction	(abridged) cold fronts in cluster cool cores should be erased on shorttimescales by thermal conduction, unless protected by magnetic fields that are"draped" parallel to the front surfaces, suppressing conduction perpendicularto the fronts. we present mhd simulations of cold front formation in the coreof a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameterspace of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines.including conduction has a strong effect on the temperature of the core and thecold fronts. though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the frontsurfaces, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. thefield geometry is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can beconnected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directionsperpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of thefront which are not perfectly draped. this results in the heating of this gasbelow the front on a timescale of a gyr, but the sharpness of the density andtemperature jumps may still be preserved. by modifying the density distributionbelow the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities. if conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we findthat the characteristic sharp jumps in x-ray emission seen in observations ofclusters do not form. this suggests that the presence of sharp cold fronts inhot clusters could be used to place upper limits on conduction in the {\itbulk} of the icm. finally, the combination of sloshing and anisotropic thermalconduction can result in a larger flux of heat to the core than either processin isolation. while still not sufficient to prevent a cooling catastrophe inthe very central ($r \sim$ 5 kpc) regions of the cool core, it reducessignificantly the mass of cool gas that accumulates outside those radii.

1302.0696	shock heating of the merging galaxy cluster a521	a521 is an interacting galaxy cluster located at z=0.247, hosting a lowfrequency radio halo connected to an eastern radio relic. previous chandraobservations hinted at the presence of an x-ray brightness edge at the positionof the relic, which may be a shock front. we analyze a deep observation of a521recently performed with xmm-newton in order to probe the cluster structure upto the outermost regions covered by the radio emission. the cluster atmosphereexhibits various brightness and temperature anisotropies. in particular, twocluster cores appear to be separated by two cold fronts. we find two shockfronts, one that was suggested by chandra and that is propagating to the east,and another to the southwestern cluster outskirt. the two main interactingclusters appear to be separated by a shock heated region, which exhibits aspatial correlation with the radio halo. the outer edge of the radio reliccoincides spatially with a shock front, suggesting this shock is responsiblefor the generation of cosmic ray electrons in the relic. the propagationdirection and mach number of the shock front derived from the gas density jump,m = 2.4 +/- 0.2, are consistent with expectations from the radio spectralindex, under the assumption of fermi i acceleration mechanism.

1306.4379	revisiting scaling relations for giant radio halos in galaxy clusters	many galaxy clusters host megaparsec-scale radio halos, generated byultrarelativistic electrons in the magnetized intracluster medium. correlationsbetween the power of radio halos and the thermal properties of the hostingclusters were established in the last decade, including the connection betweenthe presence of a halo and cluster mergers. the x-ray luminosity and redshiftlimited extended gmrt radio halo survey provides a rich and unique dataset forstatistical studies of the halos. we uniformly analyze the radio and x-ray datafor the gmrt cluster sample, and use the new planck sz catalog, to revisit thecorrelations between the power of halos and the thermal properties of galaxyclusters. we find that the radio power of halos at 1.4 ghz scales with thecluster x-ray (0.1--2.4 kev) luminosity computed within r_500 as p_1.4l_500^2.0. our bigger and more homogenous sample confirms that the x-rayluminous (l_500 &gt; 5x10^44 erg/s) clusters branch into two populations --- radiohalos lie on the correlation, while clusters with upper limits to radio-haloemission are well below that correlation. this bimodality remains if we excisecool cores from the x-ray luminosities. correlating with planck data, we findthat p_1.4 scales with the cluster integrated sz signal within r_500 as p_1.4y_500^2.1, in line with previous findings. however, contrary to previousstudies that were limited by incompleteness and small sample size, we find thatthe "sz-luminous" y_500 &gt; 6x10^-5 mpc^2 clusters show a bimodal behaviorsimilar to that in the radio-x-ray diagram. bimodality of both correlations canbe traced to clusters dynamics, with radio halos found exclusively in mergingclusters. these results confirm the key role of mergers for the origin of giantradio halos, suggesting that they trigger the relativistic particleacceleration.

1406.4031	the effect of anisotropic viscosity on cold fronts in galaxy clusters	cold fronts -- contact discontinuities in the intracluster medium (icm) ofgalaxy clusters -- should be disrupted by kelvin-helmholtz (k-h) instabilitiesdue to the associated shear velocity. however, many observed cold fronts appearstable. this opens the possibility to place constraints on microphysicalmechanisms that stabilize them, such as the icm viscosity and/or magneticfields. we performed exploratory high-resolution simulations of cold frontsarising from subsonic gas sloshing in cluster cores using the grid-based athenamhd code, comparing the effects of isotropic spitzer and anisotropic braginskiiviscosity (expected in a magnetized plasma). magnetized simulations with fullbraginskii viscosity or isotropic spitzer viscosity reduced by a factor f ~ 0.1are both in qualitative agreement with observations in terms of suppressing k-hinstabilities. the rms velocity of turbulence within the sloshing region isonly modestly reduced by braginskii viscosity. we also performed unmagnetizedsimulations with and without viscosity and find that magnetic fields have asubstantial effect on the appearance of the cold fronts, even if the initialfield is weak and the viscosity is the same. this suggests that determining thedominant suppression mechanism of a given cold front from x-ray observations(e.g. viscosity or magnetic fields) by comparison with simulations is notstraightforward. finally, we performed simulations including anisotropicthermal conduction, and find that including braginskii viscosity in thesesimulations does not significant affect the evolution of cold fronts; they arerapidly smeared out by thermal conduction, as in the inviscid case.

1412.5940	cluster radio halos at the crossroads between astrophysics and cosmology  in the ska era	giant radio halos (rh) are diffuse, mpc-sized, synchrotron radio sourcesobserved in a fraction of merging galaxy clusters. the current scenario for theorigin of rhs assumes that turbulence generated during cluster mergersre-accelerates pre-existing fossil and/or secondary electrons in theintra-cluster-medium (icm) to the energies necessary to produce the observedradio emission. moreover, more relaxed clusters could host diffuse "off state"halos produced by secondary electrons. in this chapter we use monte carlosimulations, that combine turbulent-acceleration physics and the generation ofsecondaries in the icm, to calculate the occurrence of rhs in the universe,their spectral properties and connection with properties of the hostingclusters. predictions for ska1 surveys are presented at low (100-300 mhz) andmid (1-2 ghz) frequencies assuming the expected sensitivities and spatialresolutions of ska1. ska1 will step into an unexplored territory allowing us tostudy the formation and evolution of rhs in a totally new range of clustermasses and redshift, allowing firm tests of the current theoretical hypothesis.in particular, the combination of ska1-low and sur will allow the discovery of~1000 ultrasteep- spectrum halos and to detect for the very first time "offstate" rhs. we expect that at least ~2500 giant rhs will be discovered byska1-low surveys up to z~0.6. remarkably these surveys will be sensitive to rhsin a cluster mass range (down to ~10^14 solar masses) and redshifts (up to ~1)that are unexplored by current observations. ska1 surveys will be highlycompetitive with present and future sz-surveys in the detection ofhigh-redshift massive objects.

astro-ph;0008499	chandra estimate of the magnetic field strength near the cold front in  a3667	we use the chandra observation of the cold front in the intracluster gas ofa3667 to estimate the magnetic field strength near the front. the front is seenin the chandra data as a sharp discontinuity in the gas density whichdelineates a large body of dense cool gas moving with the near-sonic velocitythrough the less dense, hotter gas. without a magnetic field, the front shouldbe quickly disturbed by the kelvin-helmholtz instability arising fromtangential motion of gas layers. however, chandra image shows that the front isstable within a +-30deg sector in the direction of the cloud motion, beyondwhich it gradually disappears. we suggest that the kelvin-helmholtz instabilitywithin the +-30deg sector is suppressed by surface tension of the magneticfield whose field lines are parallel to the front. the required field strengthis b ~ 10 mug. magnetic field near the front is expected to be stronger andhave very different structure compared to the bulk of the intergalactic medium,because the field lines are stretched by the tangential gas motions. such amagnetic configuration, once formed, would effectively stop the plasmadiffusion and heat conduction across the front, and may inhibit gas mixingduring the subcluster merger. we note that even the increased magnetic fieldnear the front contributes only 10-20% to the total gas pressure, and thereforemagnetic pressure is unimportant for hydrostatic cluster mass estimates.

astro-ph;0101412	temperature and total mass profiles of the a3571 cluster of galaxies	we present bepposax results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis ofa3571, a relaxed nearby cluster of galaxies. in the central 2' (130/h_50 kpc)radius the metal abundance is 0.49 +- 0.08 solar and the absorption (1.13+-0.28) x 10^21 atom/cm^2 whereas elsewhere within an 8'(520/h_50 kpc) radiusthe abundance is 0.32 \+- 0.05 solar and the absorption consistent with thegalactic value of 4.4 x 10^20 atom/cm2. the significant central metal abundanceenhancement is consistent with the supernova enrichment scenario. the excessabsorption may be attributed to the cooling flow, whose mass flow rate is 80 +-40 m_sun/yr from our spectral fit. the bepposax and asca radial temperatureprofiles agree over the entire overlapping radial range r &lt; 25' = 1.6/h_50 mpc.the combined bepposax and asca temperature profile exhibits a constant valueout to a radius of 10' (650/h_50 kpc) and a significant decrease (t proptor^-0.55, corresponding to gamma=1.28) at larger radii. these temperature dataare used to derive the total mass profile. the best fit nfw dark matter densitymodel results in a temperature profile that is not convectively stable, but themodel is acceptable within the uncertainties of the data. the temperatureprofile is acceptably modeled with a ``core'' model for the dark matterdensity, consisting of a core radius with a constant slope at larger radii.with this model the total mass and formal 90% confidence errors within thevirial radius r_178 (2.5/h_50 mpc) are 9.1+3.6-1.5 x 10^14 h_50^-1 m_sun, by afactor of 1.4 smaller than the isothermal value. the gas mass fractionincreases with radius, reaching f_gas(r_178) = 0.26+0.05-0.10 x h_50^-3/2.assuming that the measured gas mass fraction is the lower limit to theprimordial baryonic fraction gives omega_m &lt; 0.4 at 90% confidence.

astro-ph;0102291	chandra observation of rxj1720.1+2638: a nearly relaxed cluster with a  fast moving core?	we have analyzed the chandra observation of the distant (z=0.164) galaxycluster rxj1720.1+2638 in which we find sharp features in the x-ray surfacebrightness on opposite sides of the x-ray peak: an edge at about 250 h_50^{-1}kpc to the south-east and a plateau at about 130 h_50^{-1} kpc to thenorth-west. the surface brightness edge and the plateau can be modeled as a gasdensity discontinuity (jump) and a slope change (break). the temperatureprofiles suggest that the jump and the break are the boundaries of a central,group-size (d=380h_50^{-1} kpc), dense, cold (t=4 kev) gas cloud, embedded in adiffuse hot (t=10 kev) intracluster medium. the density jump and thetemperature change across the discontinuity are similar to the ``cold fronts''discovered by chandra in a2142 and a3667, and suggest subsonic motion of thiscentral gas cloud with respect to the cluster itself. the most naturalexplanation is that we are observing a merger in the very last stage before thecluster becomes fully relaxed. however, the data are also consistent with analternative scenario in which rxj1720.1+2638 is the result of the collapse oftwo co-located density perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbationcollapse followed by a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse thatsurrounded, but did not destroy, the first one. we also show that, because ofthe core motion, the total mass inside the cluster core, derived under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, may underestimate the true cluster mass.if widespread, such motion may partially explain the discrepancy between x-rayand the strong lensing mass determinations found in some clusters.

astro-ph;0103103	chandra observtaion of a2256 - a cluster at the early stage of merging	we present here \chandra observations of the rich cluster of galaxies a2256.in addition to the known cool subcluster, a new structure was resolved 2$'$east of the peak of the main cluster. its position is roughtly at the center ofa low-brightness radio halo. spectral analysis shows that the "shoulder" hashigh iron abundance ($\sim$ 1). we suggest that this structure is eitheranother merging component or an internal structure of the main cluster. thex-ray redshifts of several regions were measured. the results agree with theoptical ones and suggest that the main cluster, the subcluster and the"shoulder" are physically associated and interacting. the subcluster has lowtemperature ($\sim$ 4.5 kev) and high iron abundance ($\sim$ 0.6) in thecentral 150 kpc. the \chandra image shows a relatively sharp brightnessgradient at the south of the subcluster peak running south-south-east (sse). atemperature jump was found across the edge, with higher temperature ahead ofthe edge in the low density region. this phenomenon is qualitatively similar tothe "cold fronts" found in a2142 and a3667. if the "shoulder" is ignored, thetemperature map resembles those simulations at the early stage of merging whilethe subcluster approached the main cluster from somewhere west. this fact andthe observed edge, in combination with the clear iron abundance contrastbetween the center of the subcluster ($\sim$ 0.6) and the main cluster ($\sim$0.2), all imply that the ongoing merger is still at the early stage. at leastthree member galaxies, including a radio head-tail galaxy, were found to havecorresponding x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0108476	chandra observation of ms 1455.0+2232: cold fronts in a massive cooling  flow cluster?	we present the chandra observation of the cluster of galaxies ms 1455.0+2232.  from previous asca and rosat observations, this cluster was identified as a``relaxed'' cluster that hosts one of the most massive cooling flows detected.with higher angular resolution, the chandra x-ray image shows the presence oftwo surface brightness edges on opposite sides of the x-ray peak: the first at190 kpc to the north and the second at 450 kpc to the south. even though thelow exposure of this observation limits our ability to constrain thetemperature jump across both edges, we show that the northern edge is likely tobe a ``cold front'' similar to others observed recently by chandra in theclusters a2142, a3667, rx j1720.1+2638, and a2256. the observed cold front ismost likely produced by the motion, from south to north, of a group-size darkmatter halo. the most natural explanation for the presence of this observedmoving subclump is that ms 1455.0+2232 is a merger cluster in the very laststage before it becomes fully relaxed. this scenario, however, appears to beunlikely as the cluster shows no further sign of ongoing merger. moreover, itis not clear if a massive cooling flow could have survived this kind of merger.we propose an alternative scenario in which, as for rx j1720.1+2638, ms1455.0+2232 is the result of the hierarchical collapse of two co-locateddensity perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbation collapse followedby a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse that surrounded, but did notdestroy, the first. we suggest that a cooling flow may have begun inside thealready collapsed group-scale perturbation and may have been later amplified bythe gas compression induced by the infall of the overlying main cluster mass.

astro-ph;0108520	non-hydrostatic gas in the core of the relaxed galaxy cluster a1795	chandra data on a1795 reveal a mild edge-shaped discontinuity in the gasdensity and temperature in the southern sector of the cluster at r=60/h kpc.the gas inside the edge is 1.3-1.5 times denser and cooler than outside, whilethe pressure is continuous, indicating that this is a "cold front", the surfaceof contact between two moving gases. the continuity of the pressure indicatesthat the current relative velocity of the gases is near zero, making the edgeappear to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. however, a total mass profile derivedfrom the data in this sector under the equilibrium assumption, exhibits anunphysical jump by a factor of 2, with the mass inside the edge being lower. wepropose that the cooler gas is "sloshing" in the cluster gravitationalpotential well and is now near the point of maximum displacement, where it haszero velocity but nonzero centripetal acceleration. the distribution of thisnon-hydrostatic gas should reflect the reduced gravity force in theaccelerating reference frame, resulting in the apparent mass discontinuity.assuming that the gas outside the edge is hydrostatic, the acceleration of themoving gas can be estimated from the mass jump, a ~ 800 h km/s/(10^8 yr). thegravitational potential energy of this gas that is available for dissipation isabout half of its current thermal energy. the length of the cool filamentextending from the cd galaxy (fabian et al.) may give the amplitude of the gassloshing, 30-40/h kpc. such gas bulk motion might be caused by a disturbance ofthe central gravitational potential by past subcluster infall.

astro-ph;0109420	chandra observations of cold fronts in cluster of galaxies	high-resolution chandra images of several clusters of galaxies reveal sharp,edge-like discontinuities in their gas density. the gas temperature is higherin front of the edge where the density is low, corresponding to approximatelycontinuous pressure across the edge. this new phenomenon was called ``coldfronts'', to contrast it to shock fronts that should look similar in x-rayimages but where the temperature should jump in the opposite direction. thefirst cold fronts were discovered in merging clusters, where they appear todelineate the boundaries of dense cool subcluster remnants moving through andbeing stripped by the surrounding shock-heated gas. later, chandra revealedcold fronts in the central regions of several apparently relaxed clusters. toexplain the gas bulk motion in these clusters, we propose either a peculiarcluster formation history that resulted in an oscillating core, or gas sloshing(without the involvement of the underlying dark matter peak) caused by pastsubcluster infall or central agn activity. we review these observations anddiscuss their implications for the x-ray cluster mass estimates.

astro-ph;0110468	a textbook example of a bow shock in the merging galaxy cluster  1e0657-56	the chandra image of the merging, hot galaxy cluster 1e0657-56 reveals a bowshock propagating in front of a bullet-like gas cloud just exiting thedisrupted cluster core. this is the first clear example of a shock front in acluster. from the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock, themach number of the bullet-like cloud is 2-3. this corresponds to a velocity of3000-4000 km/s relative to the main cluster, which means that the cloudtraversed the core just 0.1-0.2 gyr ago. the 6-7 kev "bullet" appears to be aremnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a mergingsubcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure. the bullet'sshape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by rampressure and gas dynamic instabilities, as the subcluster galaxies move wellahead of the cool gas. the unique simplicity of the shock front and bulletgeometry in 1e0657-56 may allow a number of interesting future measurements.the cluster's average temperature is 14-15 kev but shows large spatialvariations. the hottest gas (t&gt;20 kev) lies in the region of the radio haloenhancement and extensive merging activity involving subclusters other than thebullet.

astro-ph;0208208	a high resolution picture of the intracluster gas	chandra has significantly advanced our knowledge of the processes in theintracluster gas. the discovery of remarkably regular ``cold fronts'', orcontact discontinuities, in merging clusters showed that gas dynamicinstabilities at the boundaries between the moving gases are often suppressed,most likely by specially structured magnetic fields.  cold fronts are not limited to mergers -- chandra observed them in the coresof more than 2/3 of the cooling flow clusters, where they often divide the coolcentral and the hotter ambient gas phases. the natural state of the low-entropycentral gas in clusters thus appears to be to slosh subsonically in the centralpotential well, with several interesting implications. hydrostatic equilibriumis not reached and the hydrostatic total mass estimates cannot be valid atsmall radii (r&lt;100 kpc). the kinetic energy dissipated by the sloshing gas maybe sufficient to compensate for radiative cooling. in the absence of a recentmerger, the cause of such sloshing is unclear. it might be related to themechanical energy generated by the central agn, evidence of which (the bubbles)is also observed by chandra in a large fraction of the cooling flow clusters.  heat conduction across cold fronts is suppressed completely. in the bulk ofthe gas, it is reduced by a factor of ~10 or more relative to the classicvalue, as shown by merger temperature maps. a spatial correlation between thegas temperature maps and the radio halo maps is observed in several mergers,which may provide clues for the relativistic particle acceleration mechanisms.

astro-ph;0209441	chandra spectra of the soft x-ray diffuse background	we present an exploratory chandra acis-s3 study of the diffuse component ofthe cosmic x-ray background in the 0.3-7 kev band for four directions at highgalactic latitudes, with emphasis on details of the acis instrumentalbackground modeling. observations of the dark moon are used to model thedetector background. a comparison of the moon data and the data obtained withacis stowed outside the focal area showed that the dark moon does not emitsignificantly in our band. point sources down to 3 10^-16 erg/s/cm2 in the0.5-2 kev band are excluded in our two deepest observations. we estimate thecontribution of fainter, undetected sources to be less than 20% of theremaining cxb flux in this band in all four pointings. in the 0.3-1 kev band,the diffuse signal varies strongly from field to field and contributes between55% and 90% of the total cxb signal. it is dominated by emission lines that canbe modeled by a kt=0.1-0.4 kev plasma. in particular, the two fields locatedaway from bright galactic features show a prominent line blend at e=580 ev (ovii + o viii) and a possible line feature at e~300 ev. the two pointings towardthe north polar spur exhibit a brighter o blend and additional bright lines at730-830 ev (fe xvii). we measure the total 1-2 kev flux of (1.0-1.2 +-0.2)10^-15 erg/s/cm2/arcmin (mostly resolved), and the 2-7 kev flux of (4.0-4.5+-1.5) 10^-15 erg/s/cm2/arcmin. at e&gt;2 kev, the diffuse emission is consistentwith zero, to an accuracy limited by the short moon exposure and systematicuncertainties of the s3 background. assuming galactic or local origin of theline emission, we put an upper limit of 3 10^-15 erg/s/cm2/arcmin on the 0.3-1kev extragalactic diffuse flux.

astro-ph;0209551	a cold front in a3667: hydrodynamics and magnetic field in the  intracluster medium	this conference presentation discusses a chandra observation of the coldfront in abell 3667. we first review our earlier results which include ameasurement of the front velocity, m~1, using the ratio of exterior andinterior gas pressures; observations of the hydrodynamic effects expected for atransonic front motion (weak bow shock and gas compression near the leadingedge of the front); direct observation of the suppressed diffusion across thefront, and estimate of the magnetic field strength near the front fromsuppression of the kelvin-helmholtz instabilities.  the new results include using the 2-dimensional brightness distributioninside the cold front (a) to show that the front is stable and (b) to map themass distribution in the gas cloud. this analysis confirms the existence of adark matter subcluster traveling with the front. we also fix an algebraic errorin our published calculations for the growth rate of the kh instability anddiscuss an additional effect which could stabilize the front against thesmall-scale perturbations. these updates only strengthen our conclusionsregarding the importance of the magnetic fields for the front dynamics.

astro-ph;0301367	chandra temperature map of abell 754 and constraints on thermal  conduction	we use chandra data to derive a detailed gas temperature map of the nearby,hot, merging galaxy cluster a754. combined with the x-ray and optical images,the map reveals a more complex merger geometry than previously thought,possibly involving more than two subclusters or a cool gas cloud sloshingindependently from its former host subcluster. in the cluster central region,we detect spatial variations of the gas temperature on all linear scales, from100 kpc (the map resolution) and up, which likely remain from a merger shockpassage. these variations are used to derive an upper limit on effectivethermal conductivity on a 100 kpc scale, which is at least an order ofmagnitude lower than the spitzer value. this constraint pertains to the bulk ofthe intracluster gas, as compared to the previously reported estimates for coldfronts (which are rather peculiar sites). if the conductivity in a tangledmagnetic field is at the recently predicted higher values (i.e., about 1/5 ofthe spitzer value), the observed suppression can be achieved, for example, ifthe intracluster gas consists of magnetically isolated domains.

astro-ph;0304310	chandra observation of the merging cluster abell 2034	we present an analysis of a chandra observation of abell 2034. the clusterhas multiple signatures of an ongoing merger, including a cold front andprobable significant heating of the intracluster medium above its equilibriumtemperature. we find no evidence for the large cooling rate previouslydetermined for the cluster, and in fact find it to be roughly isothermal,though with numerous small-scale inhomogeneities, out to a radius of ~700 kpc.the cold front appears to be in the process of being disrupted by gas dynamicinstability and perhaps by shock heating. we find weak evidence for inversecompton hard x-ray emission from the radio relic suspected to be associatedwith the cold front. finally, we study the emission to the south of thecluster, which was previously thought to be a merging subcluster. we find noevidence that this "subcluster" is interacting with the main abell 2034cluster. on the other hand, the properties of this region are inconsistent withan equilibrium cluster at the redshift of abell 2034 or less. we explore thepossibility that it is a disrupted merging subcluster, but find its luminosityto be significantly lower than expected for such a scenario. we suggest thatthe emission to the south of the cluster may actually be a moderate to highredshift (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.25) background cluster seen in projection against abell2034.

astro-ph;0312576	reflections of agn outbursts in the gaseous atmosphere of m87	we combined deep chandra, rosat hri, and xmm-newton observations of m87 tostudy the impact of agn outbursts on its gaseous atmosphere. many x-rayfeatures appear to be a direct result of repetitive agn outbursts. inparticular, the x-ray cavities around the jet and counter jet are likely due tothe expansion of radio plasma, while rings of enhanced emission at 14 and 17kpc are probably shock fronts associated with outbursts that began1-2\times10^7 years ago. the effects of these shocks are also seen inbrightenings within the prominent x-ray arms. on larger scales, ~50 kpc fromthe nucleus, depressions in the surface brightness may be remnants of earlieroutbursts. as suggested for the perseus cluster (fabian et al.), our analysisof the energetics of the m87 outbursts argues that shocks may be the mostsignificant channel for agn energy input into the cooling flow atmospheres ofgalaxies, groups, and clusters. for m87, the mean power driving the shockoutburst, 2.4\times 10^{43} ergs/sec, is three times greater than the radiativelosses from the entire ``cooling flow''. thus, even in the absence of otherenergy inputs, outbursts every 3\times10^7 years are sufficient to quench theflow.

astro-ph;0402247	chandra observations of the "dark" moon and geocoronal solar-wind charge  transfer	we have analyzed data from two sets of calibration observations of the moonmade by the chandra x-ray observatory. in addition to obtaining a spectrum ofthe bright side that shows several distinct fluorescence lines, we also clearlydetect time-variable soft x-ray emission, primarily o vii ka and o viii lya,when viewing the optically dark side. the apparent dark-side brightness variedby at least an order of magnitude, up to 2x10^-6 phot/s/arcmin^2/cm^2 between500 and 900 ev, which is comparable to the typical 3/4-kev-band backgroundemission measured in the rosat all-sky survey. the spectrum is also verysimilar to background spectra recorded by chandra in low or moderate-brightnessregions of the sky. over a decade ago, rosat also detected soft x-rays from thedark side of the moon, which were tentatively ascribed to continuum emissionfrom energetic solar wind electrons impacting the lunar surface. the chandraobservations, however, with their better spectral resolution, combined withcontemporaneous measurements of solar-wind parameters, strongly favor chargetransfer between highly charged solar-wind ions and neutral hydrogen in theearth's geocorona as the mechanism for this emission. we present a theoreticalmodel of geocoronal emission and show that predicted spectra and intensitiesmatch the chandra observations very well. we also model the closely relatedprocess of heliospheric charge transfer and estimate that the total chargetransfer flux observed from earth amounts to a significant fraction of the softx-ray background, particularly in the rosat 3/4-kev band.

astro-ph;0408159	infall of the elliptical galaxy ngc 1404 into the fornax cluster	we use three chandra observations, totalling 134.3 ks, to constrain thedynamical motion of ngc1404 falling towards the dominant elliptical ngc1399through the fornax icm. ngc1404's surface brightness profile shows a sharp edge\~8 kpc from its center in the direction of ngc 1399, characteristic ofjump-like temperature and density discontinuities from ram-pressure strippingof the galaxy gas. we find the temperature of the galaxy gas inside the edge is\~2.8 times cooler (kt=0.55^{+0.01}_{-0.02} kev; abundance a =0.73^{+0.65}_{-0.16} solar) than the cluster gas (kt,a = 1.53^{+0.10}_{-0.13}kev, 0.42^{+0.2}_{-0.13} solar). we use the shape of the surface brightnessprofile to fit the edge position, power law index of the density distributioninside the edge, and density discontinuity at the edge. the electron densityinside the edge (3.9-4.3 x 10^{-3} cm^{-3}) depends strongly on the gasabundance; while the density of the icm (7-8 x10^{-4} cm^{-3}) depends stronglyon the assumed relative distance between ngc1404 and ngc1399. the pressure jump(1.7-2.1) across the edge and the cluster free-stream region implies a machnumber 0.83-1.03 and velocity 531-657 km/s for ngc1404 relative to the icm. theinclination angle of the motion inferred using the relative radial velocitybetween ngc1404 and ngc1399 as representative of that between ngc1404 and theicm, is uncomfortably large (&gt;40 deg.) given the sharpness of the edge,suggesting either a non-zero impact parameter between the galaxies, or thatngc1399 is moving radially with respect to the cluster icm.

astro-ph;0412451	bow shock and radio halo in the merging cluster a520	chandra observations of the merging galaxy cluster a520 reveal a prominentbow shock with m=2.1+0.4-0.3. this is only the second clear example of asubstantially supersonic merger shock front in clusters. comparison of thex-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidenceof the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock, offering an interestingexperimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halogeneration. the halo in a520 apparently consists of two spatially distinctparts, the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structurerelated to the shock, where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons forsubsequent turbulent re-acceleration. the radio edge may be caused by electronacceleration by the shock. if so, the synchrotron spectrum should have a slopeof 1.2 right behind the edge with quick steepening further away from the edge.alternatively, if shocks are inefficient accelerators, the radio edge may beexplained by an increase in the magnetic field and density of pre-existingrelativistic electrons due to gas compression. in the latter model, thereshould be radio emission in front of the shock with the same spectrum as thatbehind it, but 10-20 times fainter. if future sensitive radio measurements donot find such pre-shock emission, then the electrons are indeed accelerated (orre-accelerated) by the shock, and one will be able to determine itsacceleration efficiency. we also propose a method to estimate the magneticfield strength behind the shock, based on measuring the dependence of the radiospectral slope upon the distance from the shock. in addition, the radio edgeprovides a way to constrain the diffusion speed of the relativistic electrons.

astro-ph;0504362	xmm-newton epic background modeling for extended sources	we use xmm-newton blank-sky and closed-cover background data to explore thebackground subtraction methods for large extended sources filling the epicfield of view, such as nearby galaxy clusters, for which local backgroundestimation is difficult. we find that to keep the 0.8-7.0 kev band backgroundmodeling uncertainty tolerable, one has to use a much more restrictive filterthan that commonly applied. in particular, because flares have highly variablespectra, not all of them are identified by filtering the e&gt;10 kev light curve.we tried using the outer part of the epic fov for monitoring the background ina softer band (1-5 kev). we find that one needs to discard the time periodswhen either the hard-band or the soft-band rate exceeds the nominal value bymore than 20% in order to limit the 90% cl background uncertainty to between 5%at e=4-7 kev and 20% at e=0.8-1 kev, for both mos and pn. this compares to a10-30% respective pn uncertainty when only the hard-band light curve is usedfor filtering, and to a 15-45% pn uncertainty when applying the commonly used2-3 sigma filtering method. we illustrate our method on a nearby cluster a1795.the above background uncertainties convert into the systematic temperatureuncertainties between 1% at r=3-4 arcmin and 20--25% (~1 kev for a1795) atr=10-15 arcmin. for comparison, the commonly applied 2-3 sigma clipping of thehard-band light curve misses a significant amount of flares, rendering thetemperatures beyond r=10 arcmin unconstrained. thus, the backgrounduncertainties do not prohibit the epic temperature profile analysis oflow-brightness regions, like outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided aconservative flare filtering such as the double filtering method with 20%limits is used.

astro-ph;0507092	chandra sample of nearby relaxed galaxy clusters: mass, gas fraction,  and mass-temperature relation	we present gas and total mass profiles for 13 low-redshift, relaxed clustersspanning a temperature range 0.7-9 kev, derived from all available chandra dataof sufficient quality. in all clusters, gas temperature profiles are measuredto large radii (vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates arepossible to nearly r_500 or beyond. the gas density was accurately traced tolarger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta-model, showingcontinuous steepening with radius. the derived rho_tot profiles and theirscaling with mass generally follow the navarro-frenk-white model withconcentration expected for dark matter halos in lambdacdm cosmology. in theinner region (r&lt;0.1r_500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibitsignificant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similarat larger radii. correspondingly, we find that the slope of themass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement withthe simple self-similar behavior, m_500 ~ t^alpha, where alpha=(1.5-1.6)+-0.1,if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. thenormalization of this m-t relation is significantly, by =~ 30%, higher thanmost previous x-ray determinations. we derive accurate gas mass fractionprofiles, which show increase both with radius and cluster mass. the enclosedf_gas profiles within r_2500 =~ 0.4 r_500 have not yet reached any asymptoticvalue and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2) from the universal baryonfraction according to the cmb observations. the f_gas trends become weaker andits values closer to universal at larger radii, in particular, in sphericalshells r_2500&lt;r&lt;r_500.

astro-ph;0604583	filaments, bubbles, and weak shocks in the gaseous atmosphere of m87	we present the first results from a 500 ksec chandra acis-i observation ofm87. at soft energies (0.5-1.0 kev), we detect filamentary structuresassociated with the eastern and southwestern x-ray and radio arms. manyfilaments are spatially resolved with widths of ~300 pc. this filamentarystructure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest thefilaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whoseages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. these x-ray structures may be influenced bymagnetic filamentation. at hard energies (3.5-7.5 kev), we detect a nearlycircular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguoussignature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the smbh. the densityrise in the shock is ~1.3 (mach number, m~1.2). the observed spectral hardeningin the ring corresponds to a temperature rise t_shock / t_0 ~ 1.2, or m~1.2, inagreement with the mach number derived independently from the gas density.thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumpsassociated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive blackhole. we also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressureenhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. the ~0.6' feature may beover-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radiococoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of agn activity. theover-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. the ~1' feature may bean additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. in an earlier episode, the``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.

astro-ph;9506090	abell 2163: temperature, mass, and hydrostatic equilibrium	using asca data, we have measured the electron temperature in a2163 out to1.5h^{-1} mpc (10a_x) from the center, in three radial bins. the temperaturesare 12.2+1.9-1.2 kev, 11.5+2.7-2.9 kev and 3.8+1.1-0.9 kev (90%) in the 0-3 a_x(0-3.5'), 3-6 a_x and 6-13 a_x spherical shells, respectively. applying thehydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry assumptions and using these datatogether with the ginga spectral and the rosat imaging data, we were able toseverely limit the possible binding mass distribution of the generic formrho=rho_0 (1+r^2/a_b^2)^{-n/2}. all the allowed binding mass profiles aresteeper than the gas density profiles and mass profiles with the same slope asgas are excluded at a greater than 99% confidence. the total mass inside0.5h^{-1} mpc is 4.3+-0.5 10^14 h^{-1} msun, of which 0.074 h^{-3/2} is gaswhile inside 1.5h^{-1} mpc the mass is 1.07+-0.13 10^15 h^{-1} msun.  we note that in the cluster outer part, the timescale for electron-iontemperature equlibration is comparable to the merger timescale, so the measuredelectron temperature may give an underestimate of the gas pressure there.otherwise, if our low temperature is indeed representative of the gastemperature in the outer shell, the cluster atmosphere should be convectionallyunstable and gas turbulence should exist. bulk motions of the gas are alsoexpected during the merger. their existense would increase the total gaspressure above that indicated by the observed temperature. thus, failure of the"gas follows dark matter" model, favored by hydrodynamic simulations, may bedue to the neglect of these phenomena, leading to an underestimate of the totaldensity at large radii.

astro-ph;9705145	dark matter and baryon fraction at the virial radius in abell 2256	we combine asca and rosat x-ray data to constrain the radial dark matterdistribution in the primary cluster of a2256, free from the isothermalityassumption. both instruments indicate that the temperature declines withradius. the region including the central galaxy has a multicomponent spectrum,which results in a wide range of allowed central temperatures. we find that thesecondary subcluster has a temperature and luminosity typical of a richcluster; however, the asca temperature map shows no signs of an advancedmerger. it is therefore assumed that the primary cluster is in hydrostaticequilibrium. the data then require dark matter density profiles steeper thanrho ~ r^-2.5 in its outer part. acceptable models have a total mass withinr=1.5 mpc (the virial radius) of 6.0+-1.5 10^14 msun at the 90% confidence,about 1.6 times smaller than the mass derived assuming isothermality. near thecenter, dark matter profiles with and without central cusps are consistent withthe data. total mass inside the x-ray core (r=0.26 mpc) is 1.28+-0.08 10^14msun, which exceeds the isothermal value by a factor of 1.4. although theconfidence intervals above may be underestimates since they do not includepossible asymmetry and departures from hydrostatic equilibrium, the behavior ofthe mass distribution, if applicable to other clusters, can bring into betteragreement x-ray and lensing mass estimates, but aggravate the ``baryoncatastrophe''. the observed considerable increase in the gas content withradius, not anticipated by simulations, may imply that a significant fractionof thermal gas energy comes from sources other than gravity and merger shocks.

astro-ph;9711289	the temperature structure of 30 nearby clusters observed with asca.  similarity of temperature profiles	we present asca temperature profiles and, when possible, crude temperaturemaps for a sample of bright clusters with 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.09. together with severalpreviously published clusters, the sample includes a85, a119, a399, a401, a478,a644, a754, a780, a1650, a1651, a1795, a2029, a2065, a2142, a2256, a2319,a2597, a2657, a3112, a3266, a3376, a3391, a3395, a3558, a3571, a3667, a4059,cygnus a, mkw3s, and triangulum australis. nearly all clusters show asignificant radial temperature decline. for a typical 7 kev cluster, thetemperature decline between 1 and 6 x-ray core radii (0.15 and 0.9/h mpc) canbe approximately quantified by a polytropic index of 1.2-1.3. assuming such apolytropic temperature profile, the gravitating mass within 1 and within 6 coreradii is approximately 1.35 and 0.7 times the isothermal beta-model estimates,respectively.  most interestingly, we find that temperature profiles, excluding those forthe most asymmetric clusters, appear remarkably similar when plotted againstradius in units of the estimated virial radius. we compare the compositetemperature profile to the published hydrodynamic simulations. the observedprofiles appear steeper than those in most lagrangian simulations (evrard etal1996; eke etal 1997). the predictions for omega=1 models are most discrepant,while models with low omega are closer to our data. we note, however, that atleast one omega=1 lagrangian simulation (katz &amp; white 1993) and the recenthigh-resolution eulerian simulation (bryan &amp; norman 1997) produced clusterswith temperature profiles similar to or steeper than those observed. ourresults thus provide a new constraint for adjusting numerical simulations and,potentially, discriminating among models of cluster formation.

astro-ph;9809380	a hot spot in coma	we study the temperature structure of the central part (r&lt;18' ~0.7 h50**-1mpc) of the coma cluster of galaxies using asca data. two different analysismethods produce results in good agreement with each other and reveal thepresence of interesting structures in the gas temperature distribution.globally, the average temperature in the center of the cluster is 9.0 +/- 0.6kev in good agreement with previous results. superimposed on this, we find acool area with temperatures of 4-6 kev associated with a filament of x-rayemission extending southeast from the cluster center detected by vikhlinin andcoworkers. we also find a hot spot with a temperature of around 13 kevdisplaced north from the central peak of emission. the distribution of the gastemperatures and relative specific entropies suggests that the cool featuresare most likely gas stripped from a galaxy group centered on ngc 4874 fallingtoward the core from outside, while the hot spot located ``ahead'' of thisin-falling gas is due to shock heating. thus our results suggest that we areobserving coma during a minor merger with a small group of galaxies associatedwith ngc 4874 shortly before the initial core passage.

astro-ph;9812005	physics of the merging clusters cygnus a, a3667, and a2065	we present asca gas temperature maps of the nearby merging galaxy clusterscygnus a, a3667, and a2065. cygnus a appears to have a particularly simplemerger geometry that allows an estimate of the subcluster collision velocityfrom the observed temperature variations. we estimate it to be ~2000 km/s.interestingly, this is similar to the free-fall velocity that the two cygnus asubclusters should have achieved at the observed separation, suggesting thatmerger has been effective in dissipating the kinetic energy of gas halos intothermal energy, without channeling its major fraction elsewhere (e.g., intoturbulence). in a3667, we may be observing a spatial lag between the shockfront seen in the x-ray image and the corresponding rise of the electrontemperature. a lag of the order of hundreds of kiloparsecs is possible due tothe combination of thermal conduction and a finite electron-ion equilibrationtime. forthcoming better spatial resolution data will allow a directmeasurement of these phenomena using such lags. a2065 has gas density peakscoincident with two central galaxies. a merger with the collision velocityestimated from the temperature map should have swept away such peaks if thesubcluster total mass distributions had flat cores in the centers. the factthat the peaks have survived (or quickly reemerged) suggests that thegravitational potential also is strongly peaked. finally, the observed specificentropy variations in a3667 and cygnus a indicate that energy injection from asingle major merger may be of the order of the full thermal energy of the gas.we hope that these order of magnitude estimates will encourage further work onhydrodynamic simulations, as well as more quantitative representation of thesimulation results.

astro-ph;9904382	mass profiles of the typical relaxed galaxy clusters a2199 and a496	we present maps and radial profiles of the gas temperature in the nearbygalaxy clusters a2199 and a496, which have the most accurate asca spectral datafor all hot clusters. these clusters are relaxed and can provide reliable x-raymass measurements under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. the clusteraverage temperatures corrected for the presence of cooling flows are 4.8+-0.2kev and 4.7+-0.2 kev (90% errors), respectively. outside the central coolingflow regions, the radial temperature profiles are similar to those of themajority of nearby relaxed clusters. they are accurately described bypolytropic models with gamma=1.17+-0.07 for a2199 and gamma=1.24+-0.09 fora496. we use these polytropic models to derive accurate total mass profiles.within r=0.5/h mpc, which corresponds to a radius of overdensity 1000, thetotal mass values are 1.45+-0.15 10^14 /h msun and 1.55+-0.15 10^14 /h msun.these values are 10% lower than those obtained assuming constant temperature.the values inside a gas core radius (0.07-0.13/h mpc) are a factor of &gt;1.5higher than the isothermal values. the gas mass fraction increases with radius(by a factor of 3 between the x-ray core radius and r_1000) and at r_1000reaches values of 0.057+-0.005 and 0.056+-0.006 h^-3/2 for the two clusters,respectively. our mass profiles within r_1000 are remarkably well approximatedby the nfw "universal" profile. since a2199 and a496 are typical relaxedclusters, the above findings should be relevant for most such systems. inparticular, the similarity of the temperature profiles in nearby clustersappears to reflect the underlying "universal" dark matter profile. the upwardrevision of mass at small radii will resolve most of the discrepancy betweenthe x-ray and strong lensing mass estimates.

astro-ph;9906286	the baryonic and dark matter distributions in abell 401	we combine spatially resolved asca temperature data with rosat imaging datato constrain the total mass distribution in the cluster a401, assuming that thecluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium. we obtain a total mass within the x-raycore (290/h_50 kpc) of 1.2[+0.1,-0.5] 10^14 /h_50 msun at the 90% confidencelevel, 1.3 times larger than the isothermal estimate. the total mass withinr_500 (1.7/h_50 mpc) is m_500 = 0.9[+0.3,-0.2] 10^15/ h_50 msun at 90%confidence, in agreement with the optical virial mass estimate, and 1.2 timessmaller than the isothermal estimate. our m_500 value is 1.7 times smaller thanthat estimated using the mass-temperature scaling law predicted by simulations.the best fit dark matter density profile scales as r^{-3.1} at large radii,which is consistent with the navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) ``universal profile''as well as the king profile of the galaxy density in a401. from the imagingdata, the gas density profile is shallower than the dark matter profile,scaling as r^{-2.1} at large radii, leading to a monotonically increasing gasmass fraction with radius. within r_500 the gas mass fraction reaches a valueof f_gas = 0.21[+0.06,-0.05] h_50^{-3/2} (90% confidence errors). assuming thatf_gas (plus an estimate of the stellar mass) is the universal value of thebaryon fraction, we estimate the 90% confidence upper limit of the cosmologicalmatter density to be omega_m &lt; 0.31.

(1996) that are frequently used formass-temperature scaling. the higher-temperature subsample (kt &gt; 4 kev) isconsistent with m propto t^{3/2}, allowing the possibility that theself-similar scaling breaks down at low temperatures, perhaps due to heating bysupernovae that is more important for low-temperature groups and galaxies assuggested by earlier works.

0810.4288	a low-frequency radio halo associated with a cluster of galaxies	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in theuniverse, containing about 10^15 solar masses of hot (10^8 k) gas, galaxies anddark matter in a typical volume of about 10 mpc^3. magnetic fields andrelativistic particles are mixed with the gas as revealed by giant radiohaloes, which arise from diffuse, megaparsec-scale synchrotron radiation atcluster center. radio haloes require that the emitting electrons areaccelerated in situ (by turbulence), or are injected (as secondary particles)by proton collisions into the intergalactic medium. they are found only in afraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics, which suggests aconnection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. here we report a radiohalo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster abell 521. thishalo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequencycut-off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4 ghz(the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied).the spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of therelativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, whichsuggests that many radio haloes in the universe should emit mainly at lowfrequencies.
