0903.2770	the extremely collimated bipolar h_2o jet from the ngc 1333-iras 4b  protostar	we have performed observations of water maser emission towards a sample oflow-mass protostars, in order to investigate the properties of jets associatedwith the earliest stages of star formation and their interaction with thesurrounding medium. the main aim is to measure the absolute positions andproper motions of the h_2o spots in order to investigate the kinematics of theregion from where the jet is launched. we imaged the protostars in the nearbyregion ngc 1333-iras 4 in the water maser line at 22.2 ghz by using the vlba inphase-reference mode at the milliarcsecond scale over four epochs, spaced byone month to measure proper motions. two protostars (a2 and b) were detected ina highly variable h_2o maser emission, with an active phase shorter than fourweeks. the h_2o maps allow us to trace the fast jet driven by the b protostar:we observed both the red- and blue-shifted lobes very close to the protostar,=&lt; 35 au, moving away with projected velocities of ~10-50 km/s. the comparisonwith the molecular outflow observed at larger scale suggests a jet precessionwith a 18'/yr rate. by measuring the positional spread of the h_2o spots weestimate a jet width of ~2 au at a distance of ~12 au from the drivingprotostar.

0908.1176	cch in prestellar cores	we study the abundance of cch in prestellar cores both because of its role inthe chemistry and because it is a potential probe of the magnetic field. wealso consider the non-lte behaviour of the n=1-0 and n=2-1 transitions of cchand improve current estimates of the spectroscopic constants of cch. we usedthe iram 30m radiotelescope to map the n=1-0 and n=2-1 transitions of cchtowards the prestellar cores l1498 and cb246. towards cb246, we also mapped the1.3 mm dust emission, the j=1-0 transition of n2h+ and the j=2-1 transition ofc18o. we used a monte carlo radiative transfer program to analyse the cchobservations of l1498. we derived the distribution of cch column densities andcompared with the h2 column densities inferred from dust emission. we find thatwhile non-lte intensity ratios of different components of the n=1-0 and n=2-1lines are present, they are of minor importance and do not impede cch columndensity determinations based upon lte analysis. moreover, the comparison of ourmonte-carlo calculations with observations suggest that the non-lte deviationscan be qualitatively understood. for l1498, our observations in conjunctionwith the monte carlo code imply a cch depletion hole of radius 9 x 10^{16} cmsimilar to that found for other c-containing species. we briefly discuss thesignificance of the observed cch abundance distribution. finally, we used ourobservations to provide improved estimates for the rest frequencies of all sixcomponents of the cch(1-0) line and seven components of cch(2-1). based onthese results, we compute improved spectroscopic constants for cch. we alsogive a brief discussion of the prospects for measuring magnetic field strengthsusing cch.

1004.2822	chemical study of intermediate-mass (im) class 0 protostars. co  depletion and n2h+ deuteration	we are carrying out a physical and chemical study of the protostellarenvelopes in a representative sample of im class 0 protostars. in our firstpaper (crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. here, westudy the co depletion and n2h+ deuteration. we observed the millimeter linesof c18o, c17o, n2h+ and n2d+ toward the protostars using the iram 30mtelescope. based on these observations, we derived the c18o, n2h+ and n2d+radial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfercode. in addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. allthe c18o 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the c18o abundance decreasesinwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the coevaporation temperature, 20-25k, where the co is released back to the gasphase. the n2h+ deuterium fractionation in class 0 ims is[n2d+]/[n2h+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental[d/h] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than inpre-stellar clumps. chemical models account for the c18o and n2h+ observationsif we assume the co abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in theinner envelope. this could be the consequence of the co being converted intoch3oh on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or thephotodissociation of co by the stellar uv radiation. the deuteriumfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. this discrepancy is very likelycaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry andneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and uvradiation from the star. more important, the deuterium fractionation isdependent on the ortho-to-para h2 ratio, which is not likely to reach thesteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1111.0461	water emission from the chemically rich outflow l1157	in the framework of the herschel-wish key program, several ortho-h2o andpara-h2o emission lines, in the frequency range from 500 to 1700 ghz, wereobserved with the hifi instrument in two bow-shock regions (b2 and r) of thel1157 cloud. the primary aim is to analyse water emission lines as a diagnosticof the physical conditions in the blue (b2) and red-shifted (r) lobes tocompare the excitation conditions. a total of 5 ortho- and para-h216o plus oneo-h218o transitions were observed in b2 and r with a wide range of excitationenergies (27 k&lt;=eu&lt;=215 k). the h2o spectra, observed in the two shockedregions, show that the h2o profiles are markedly different in the two regions.in particular, at the bow-shock r, we observed broad (~30 km s-1 with respectto the ambient velocity) red-shifted wings where lines at different excitationpeak at different red-shifted velocities. the b2 spectra are associated with anarrower velocity range (~6 km s-1), peaking at the systemic velocity. theexcitation analysis suggests, for b2, low values of column density nh2o&lt;=5{\times}1013 cm-2, a density range of 105 &lt;=nh2 &lt;=107 cm-3, and warmtemperatures (&gt;=300 k). the presence of the broad red-shifted wings andmultiple peaks in the spectra of the r region, prompted the modelling of twocomponents. high velocities are associated with relatively low temperatures(~100k),nh2o{\simeq}5{\times}1012-5{\times}1013 cm-2 and densitiesnh2{\simeq}106-108 cm-3.lower velocities are associated with higher excitationconditions with tkin&gt;=300 k, very dense gas (nh2 ~108 cm-3) and low columndensity (nh2o&lt;5{\times}1013 cm-2).

1111.6016	the herschel hifi water line survey in the low-mass proto-stellar  outflow l1448	as part of the wish (water in star-forming regions with herschel) keyproject, we report on the observations of several ortho- and para-h2o linesperformed with the hifi instrument towards two bright shock spots (r4 and b2)along the outflow driven by the l1448 low-mass proto-stellar system, located inthe perseus cloud. these data are used to identify the physical conditionsgiving rise to the h2o emission and infer any dependence with velocity. theseobservations provide evidence that the observed water lines probe a warm(t_kin~400-600 k) and very dense (n 10^6 - 10^7 cm^-3) gas, not traced by othermolecules, such as low-j co and sio, but rather traced by mid-ir h2 emission.in particular, h2o shows strong differences with sio in the excitationconditions and in the line profiles in the two observed shocked positions,pointing to chemical variations across the various velocity regimes andchemical evolution in the different shock spots. physical and kinematicaldifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. at the r4 position, twovelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with thecomponent at higher velocity (r4-hv) being less extended and less dense thanthe low velocity component (r4-lv). h2o column densities of about 2 10^13 and 410^14 cm^-2 have been derived for the r4-lv and the r4-hv components,respectively. the conditions inferred for the b2 position are similar to thoseof the r4-hv component, with h2o column density in the range 10^14 - 5 10^14cm^-2, corresponding to h2o/h2 abundances in the range 0.5 - 1 10^-5. theobserved line ratios and the derived physical conditions seem to be moreconsistent with excitation in a low velocity j-type shock with largecompression rather than in a stationary c-shock, although none of thesestationary models seems able to reproduce all the characteristics of theobserved emission.

1204.0009	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish): ii. evolution of 557  ghz 110-101 emission in low-mass protostars	(abridged) water is a key tracer of dynamics and chemistry in low-massprotostars, but spectrally resolved observations have so far been limited insensitivity and angular resolution. in this first systematic survey ofspectrally resolved water emission in low-mass protostellar objects, h2o wasobserved in the ground-state transition at 557 ghz with hifi on herschel in 29embedded class 0 and i protostars. complementary far-ir and sub-mm continuumdata (including pacs data from our program) are used to constrain the spectralenergy distribution of each source. h2o intensities are compared to inferredenvelope and outflow properties and co 3-2 emission. h2o emission is detectedin all objects except one. the line profiles are complex and consist of severalkinematic components. the profiles are typically dominated by a broad gaussianemission feature, indicating that the bulk of the water emission arises inoutflows, not the quiescent envelope. several sources show multiple shockcomponents in either emission or absorption, thus constraining the internalgeometry of the system. furthermore, the components include inverse p-cygniprofiles in 7 sources (6 class 0, 1 class i) indicative of infalling envelopes,and regular p-cygni profiles in 4 sources (3 class i, 1 class 0) indicative ofexpanding envelopes. "bullets" moving at &gt;50 km/s are seen in 4 class 0sources; 3 of these are new detections. in the outflow, the h2o/co abundanceratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasingfrom 10^-3 at &lt;5 km/s to &gt;10^-1 at &gt;10 km/s. the h2o abundance in the outerenvelope is low, ~10^-10. the different h2o profile components show a clearevolutionary trend: in the class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflowcomponents originating inside an infalling envelope. when the infall diminishesduring the class i phase, the outflow weakens and h2o emission disappears.

1209.0294	h2o line mapping at high spatial and spectral resolution - herschel  observations of the vla1623 outflow	apart from being an important coolant, h2o is known to be a tracer ofhigh-velocity molecular gas. recent models predict relatively high abundancesbehind interstellar shockwaves. the dynamical and physical conditions of theh2o emitting gas, however, are not fully understood yet. we aim to determinethe abundance and distribution of h2o, its kinematics and the physicalconditions of the gas responsible for the h2o emission. the observed lineprofile shapes help us understand the dynamics in molecular outflows. we mappedthe vla1623 outflow, in the ground-state transitions of o-h2o, with the hifiand pacs instruments. we also present observations of higher energy transitionsof o-h2o and p-h2o obtained with hifi and pacs towards selected outflowpositions. from comparison with non-lte radiative transfer calculations, weestimate the physical parameters of the water emitting regions. the observedwater emission line profiles vary over the mapped area. spectral features andcomponents, tracing gas in different excitation conditions, allow us toconstrain the density and temperature of the gas. the h2o emission originatesin a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm h2 gas(t\gtrsim200k). thus, the h2o emission traces a gas component significantlywarmer than the gas responsible for the low-j co emission. the h2o columndensities at the co peak positions are low, i.e. n(h2o) \simeq (0.03-10)x10e14cm-2. the h2o abundance with respect to h2 in the extended outflow is estimatedat x(h2o)&lt;1x10e-6, significantly lower than what would be expected from mostrecent shock models. the h2o emission traces a gas component moving atrelatively high velocity compared to the low-j co emitting gas. however, otherdynamical quantities such as the momentum rate, energy and mechanicalluminosity are estimated to be the same, independent of the molecular tracerused, co or h2o.

[oi] and some of the oh emission probe dissociative shocks in theinner envelope. the total far-infrared cooling is dominated by h2o and co, with[oi] increasing for class i sources.

1502.05762	shedding light on the formation of the pre-biotic molecule formamide  with asai	formamide (nh2cho) has been proposed as a pre-biotic precursor with a keyrole in the emergence of life on earth. while this molecule has been observedin space, most of its detections correspond to high-mass star-forming regions.motivated by this lack of investigation in the low-mass regime, we searched forformamide, as well as isocyanic acid (hnco), in 10 low- and intermediate-masspre-stellar and protostellar objects. the present work is part of the iramlarge programme asai (astrochemical surveys at iram), which makes use ofunbiased broadband spectral surveys at millimetre wavelengths. we detected hncoin all the sources and nh2cho in five of them. we derived their abundances andanalysed them together with those reported in the literature for high-masssources. for those sources with formamide detection, we found a tight andalmost linear correlation between hnco and nh2cho abundances, with their ratiobeing roughly constant -between 3 and 10- across 6 orders of magnitude inluminosity. this suggests the two species are chemically related. the sourceswithout formamide detection, which are also the coldest and devoid of hotcorinos, fall well off the correlation, displaying a much larger amount of hncorelative to nh2cho. our results suggest that, while hnco can be formed in thegas phase during the cold stages of star formation, nh2cho forms mostefficiently on the mantles of dust grains at these temperatures, where itremains frozen until the temperature rises enough to sublimate the icy grainmantles. we propose hydrogenation of hnco as a likely formation route leadingto nh2cho.

astro-ph;0005525	l483: a protostar in transition from class 0 to class i	we present molecular-line observations toward the dense core in l483 and itsbipolar outflow powered by the class 0 object iras 18148-0440. co (carbonmonoxide) maps show that the outflow is well collimated and asymmetric, andthat its gas is warmer than the surrounding cloud by at least a factor of 2.h2co (formaldehyde) lines toward the outflow show prominent high-velocity wingsand evidence for an h2co abundance enhancement of a factor of 20. at ambientvelocities, these lines show strong self-absorption and a brighter blue peak, acharacteristic signature of inward motions. finally, and in contrast with theoutflows from other class 0 objects, the ch3oh (methanol) lines in l483 do notshow high velocity wings, and no evidence for abundance enhancement is found inthis molecule or in sio (silicon monoxide). comparing the physical and chemicalproperties of the outflow in l483 with those of other outflows from class 0 andclass i sources, we find that the l483 outflow is somewhat intermediate betweenthese types. this suggests that the l483 central source has already started itstransition between class 0 and class i, and that its mixed propertiesillustrate how this transition occurs.

astro-ph;0109023	molecular ions in l1544. ii. the ionization degree	the maps presented in paper i are here used to infer the variation of thecolumn densities of hco+, dco+, n2h+, and n2d+ as a function of distance fromthe dust peak. these results are interpreted with the aid of a crude chemicalmodel which predicts the abundances of these species as a function of radius ina spherically symmetric model with radial density distribution inferred fromthe observations of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths and dust absorptionin the infrared. our main observational finding is that the n(n2d+)/n(n2h+)column density ratio is of order 0.2 towards the l1544 dust peak as compared ton(dco+)/n(hco+) = 0.04. we conclude that this result as well as the generalfinding that n2h+ and n2d+ correlate well with the dust is caused by co beingdepleted to a much higher degree than molecular nitrogen in the high densitycore of l1544. depletion also favors deuterium enhancement and thus n2d+, whichtraces the dense and highly co-depleted core nucleus, is much more enhancedthan dco+. our models do not uniquely define the chemistry in the high densitydepleted nucleus of l1544 but they do suggest that the ionization degree is afew times 10^{-9} and that the ambipolar diffusion time scale is locallysimilar to the free fall time. it seems likely that the lower limit which oneobtains to ionization degree by summing all observable molecular ions is not agreat underestimate of the true ionization degree. we predict that atomicoxygen is abundant in the dense core and, if so, h3o+ may be the main ion inthe central highly depleted region of the core.

astro-ph;0112487	systematic molecular differentiation in starless cores	(abridged) we present evidence that low-mass starless cores, the simplestunits of star formation, are systematically differentiated in their chemicalcomposition. molecules including co and cs almost vanish near the core centers,where the abundance decreases by one or two orders of magnitude. at the sametime, n2h+ has a constant abundance, and the fraction of nh3 increases towardthe core center. our conclusions are based on a study of 5 mostly-roundstarless cores (l1498, l1495, l1400k, l1517b, and l1544), which we havemappedin c18o(1-0), c17o(1-0), cs(2-1), c34s(2-1), n2h+(1-0), nh3(1,1) and(2,2), and the 1.2 mm continuum. for each core we have built a model that fitssimultaneously the radial profile of all observed emission and the centralspectrum for the molecular lines. the observed abundance drops of co and cs arenaturally explained by the depletion of these molecules onto dust grains atdensities of 2-6 10^4 cm-3. n2h+ seems unaffected by this process up todensities of several 10^5, while the nh3 abundance may be enhanced by reactionstriggered by the disappearance of co from the gas phase. with the help of ourmodels, we show that chemical differentiation automatically explains thediscrepancy between the sizes of cs and nh3 maps, a problem which has remainedunexplained for more than a decade. our models, in addition, show that acombination of radiative transfer effects can give rise to the previouslyobserved discrepancy in the linewidth of these two tracers. although thisdiscrepancy has been traditionally interpreted as resulting from a systematicincrease of the turbulent linewidth with radius, our models show that it canarise in conditions of constant gas turbulence.

astro-ph;0210081	inner structure of protostellar collapse candidate b335 derived from  millimeter-wave interferometry	we present a study of the density structure of the protostellar collapsecandidate b335 using continuum observations from the iram plateau de bureinterferometer made at wavelengths of 1.2mm and 3.0mm. we analyze these data,which probe spatial scales from 5000 au to 500 au, directly in the visibilitydomain by comparison to synthetic observations constructed from models thatassume different physical conditions. this approach allows for much morestringent constraints to be derived from the data than from analysis of images.a single radial power law in density provides a good description of the data,with best fit power law index p=1.65+/-0.05. through simulations, we quantifythe sensitivity of this result to various model uncertainties, includingassumptions of temperature distribution, outer boundary, dust opacity spectralindex, and an unresolved central component. the largest uncertainty comes fromthe unknown presence of a centralized point source. a point source with 1.2mmflux of f=12+/-7 mjy reduces the density index to p=1.47+/-0.07. the remainingsources of systematic uncertainty, the most important of which is thetemperature distribution, likely contribute a total uncertainty of &lt; 0.2. wetherefore find strong evidence that the power law index of the densitydistribution within 5000 au is significantly less than the value at largerradii, close to 2.0 from previous studies of dust emission and extinction.these results conform well to the generic paradigm of isolated, low-mass starformation which predicts a power law density index close to p=1.5 for an innerregion of gravitational free fall onto the protostar.

astro-ph;0302477	dust emission from young outflows: the case of l1157	we present new high-sensitivity 1.3 mm bolometer observations of the youngoutflow l1157. these data show that the continuum emission arises from fourdistinct components: a circumstellar disk, a protostellar envelope, an extendedflattened envelope --the dense remnant of the molecular cloud in which theprotostar was formed--, and the outflow itself, which represents ~20% of thetotal flux. the outflow emission exhibits two peaks that are coincident withthe two strong shocks in the southern lobe of l1157. we show that the mmcontinuum is dominated by thermal dust emission arising in the high velocitymaterial. the spectral index derived from the new 1.3 mm data and 850 muobservations from shirley et al. (2000), is ~5 in the outflow, significantlyhigher than in the protostellar envelope (~3.5). this can be explained by animportant line contamination of the 850 mu map, and/or by different dustcharacteristics in the two regions, possibly smaller grains in the post-shocksregions of the outflow. our observations show that bipolar outflows can presentcompact emission peaks which must not be misinterpreted as protostellarcondensations when mapping star forming regions.

astro-ph;0401148	on the internal structure of starless cores. i. physical conditions and  the distribution of co, cs, n2h+, and nh3 in l1498 and l1517b	we have characterized the physical structure and chemical composition of twoclose-to-round starless cores in taurus-auriga, l1498 and l1517b. our analysisis based on high angular resolution observations in at least two transitions ofnh3, n2h+, cs, c34s, c18o, and c17o, together with maps of the 1.2 mmcontinuum. for both cores, we derive radial profiles of constant temperatureand constant turbulence, together with density distributions close to those ofnon-singular isothermal spheres. using these physical conditions and a montecarlo radiative transfer model, we derive abundance profiles for all speciesand model the strong chemical differentiation of the core interiors. accordingto our models, the nh3 abundance increases toward the core centers by a factorof several while n2h+ has a constant abundance over most of the cores. incontrast, both c18o and cs (and isotopomers) are strongly depleted in the coreinteriors, most likely due to their freeze out onto grains at densities of afew 10^4 cm^{-3}. concerning the kinematics of the dense gas, we find (inaddition to constant turbulence) a pattern of internal motions at the level of0.1 km s^{-1}. these motions seem correlated with asymmetries in the pattern ofmolecular depletion, and we interpret them as residuals of core contraction.their distribution and size suggest that core formation occurs in a ratherirregular manner and with a time scale of a myr. a comparison of our derivedcore properties with those predicted by supersonic turbulence models of coreformation shows that our taurus cores are much more quiescent thanrepresentative predictions from these models.

astro-ph;0402039	l1521e: the first starless core with no molecular depletion	l1521e seems unique among starless cores. it stands out in a distribution ofa ratio (r) that we define to asses core evolution, and which compares theemission of the easily-depleted c18o molecule with that of the hard to deplete,late-time species n2h+. while all cores we have studied so far have r ratiolower than 1, l1521e has an r value of 3.4, which is 8 times the mean of theother cores. to understand this difference, we have modeled the c18o and n2h+abundance profiles in l1521e using a density distribution derived from 1.2mmcontinuum data. our model shows that the c18o emission in this core isconsistent with constant abundance, and this makes l1521e the first core withno c18o depletion. our model also derives an unusually low n2h+ abundance.these two chemical peculiarities suggest that l1521e has contracted to itspresent density very recently, and it is therefore an extremely young starlesscore. comparing our derived abundances with a chemical model, we estimate atentative age of 1.5 x 10^5 yr, which is too short for ambipolar diffusionmodels.

astro-ph;0403517	observations of l1521f: a highly evolved starless core	we observed the pre-stellar core l1521f in dust emission at 1.2mm and in twotransitions each of n2h+, n2d+, c18o, and c17o in order to increase the sampleof well studied centrally concentrated and chemically evolved starless cores,likely on the verge of star formation, and to determine the initial conditionsfor low--mass star formation in the taurus molecular cloud. we derived in thisobject a molecular hydrogen number density n(h2) ~ 10^6 cm-3 and a co depletionfactor, integrated along the line of sight, fd ~ 15 in the central 20'',similar to the pre-stellar core l1544. however, the n(n2d+)/n(n2h+) columndensity ratio is ~0.1, a factor of about 2 lower than that found in l1544. theobserved relation between the deuterium fractionation and the integrated codepletion factor across the core can be reproduced by chemical models if n2h+is slightly (factor of ~2 in fractional abundance) depleted in the central 3000au. the n2h+ and n2d+ linewidths in the core center are ~0.3 km/s,significantly larger than in other more quiescent taurus starless cores butsimilar to those observed in the center of l1544. the kinematical behaviour ofl1521f is more complex than seen in l1544, and a model of contraction due toambipolar diffusion is only marginally consistent with the present data. othervelocity fields, perhaps produced by unresolved substructure, are present. bothchemical and kinematical analyses suggest that l1521f is less evolved thanl1544, but, in analogy with l1544, it is approaching the ``critical'' state.

astro-ph;0409529	probing the evolutionary status of starless cores through n2h+ and n2d+  observations	we have undertaken a survey of n2h+ and n2d+ towards 31 low-mass starlesscores using the iram 30m telescope. our main objective has been to determinethe abundance ratio of n2d+ and n2h+ towards the nuclei of these cores and thusto obtain estimates of the degree of deuterium enrichment, a symptom ofadvanced chemical evolution according to current models. we find that then(n2d+)/n(n2h+) ratio is larger in more "centrally concentrated cores" withlarger peak h2 and n2h+ column density than the sample mean. the deuteriumenrichment in starless cores is presently ascribed to depletion of co in thehigh density (&gt; 3*10^4 cm-3) core nucleus. to substantiate this picture, wecompare our results with observations in dust emission at 1.2 mm and in twotransitions of c18o. we find a good correlation between deuterium fractionationand n(c18o)/n(h2) for the nuclei of 14 starless cores. we, thus, identified aset of properties that characterize the most evolved, or "pre-stellar",starless cores. these are: higher n2h+ and n2d+ column densities, highern(n2d+)/n(n2h+), more pronounced co depletion, broader n2h+ lines with infallasymmetry, higher central h2 column densities and a more compact densityprofile than in the average core. we conclude that this combination ofproperties gives a reliable indication of the evolutionary state of the core.seven cores in our sample (l1521f, ophd, l429, l694, l183, l1544 and tmc2) showthe majority of these features and thus are believed to be closer to forming aprotostar than are the other members of our sample. finally, we note that thesubsample of taurus cores behaves more homogeneously than the total sample, anindication that the external environment could play an important role in thecore evolution.

astro-ph;0512500	observations of pre-stellar cores	our understanding of the physical and chemical structure of pre-stellarcores, the simplest star-forming sites, has significantly improved since thelast iau symposium on astrochemistry (south korea, 1999). research done overthese years has revealed that major molecular species like co and cssystematically deplete onto dust grains at the interior of pre-stellar cores,while species like n2h+ and nh3 survive in the gas phase and can usually bedetected towards the core centers. such a selective behaviour of molecularspecies gives rise to a differentiated (onion-like) chemical composition, andmanifests itself in molecular maps as a dichotomy between centrally peaked andring-shaped distributions. from the point of view of star-formation studies,the identification of molecular inhomogeneities in cores helps to resolve pastdiscrepancies between observations made using different tracers, and brings thepossibility of self-consistent modelling of the core internal structure. here ipresent recent work on determining the physical and chemical structure of twopre-stellar cores, l1498 and l1517b, using observations in a large number ofmolecules and monte carlo radiative transfer analysis. these two cores aretypical examples of the pre-stellar core population, and their chemicalcomposition is characterized by the presence of large freeze out holes in mostmolecular species. in contrast with these chemically processed objects, a newpopulation of chemically young cores has started to emerge. the characteristicsof its most extreme representative, l1521e, are briefly reviewed.
