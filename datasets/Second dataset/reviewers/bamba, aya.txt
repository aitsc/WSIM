0901.0419	modeling and reproducibility of suzaku hxd pin/gso background	suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) achieved the lowest background level thanany other previously or currently operational missions sensitive in the energyrange of 10--600 kev, by utilizing pin photodiodes and gso scintillatorsmounted in the bgo active shields to reject particle background andcompton-scattered events as much as possible. because it does not have imagingcapability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity islimited by the reproducibility of the non x-ray background (nxb) model. wemodeled the hxd nxb, which varies with time as well as other satellites with alow-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitorcounts and satellite orbital/attitude information. the model background issupplied as an event file in which the background events are generated byrandom numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. thereproducibility of the nxb model depends on the event selection criteria (suchas cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigmasystematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (pin 15--40 kev) and 1% (gso50--100 kev) for more than 10 ksec exposure.

0902.3446	an antarctic ice core recording both supernovae and solar cycles	ice cores are known to be rich in information regarding past climates, andthe possibility that they record astronomical phenomena has also beendiscussed. rood et al. were the first to suggest, in 1979, that nitrate ion(no3-) concentration spikes observed in the depth profile of a south pole icecore might correlate with the known historical supernovae (sne), tycho (ad1572), kepler (ad 1604), and sn 1181 (ad 1181). their findings, however, werenot supported by subsequent examinations by different groups using differentice cores, and the results have remained controversial and confusing. here wepresent a precision analysis of an ice core drilled in 2001 at dome fujistation in antarctica. it revealed highly significant three no3- spikes datingfrom the 10th to the 11th century. two of them are coincident with sn 1006 (ad1006) and the crab nebula sn (ad 1054), within the uncertainty of our absolutedating based on known volcanic signals. moreover, by applying time-seriesanalyses to the measured no3- concentration variations, we discovered veryclear evidence of an 11-year periodicity that can be explained by solarmodulation. this is one of the first times that a distinct 11-year solar cyclehas been observed for a period before the landmark studies of sunspots bygalileo galilei with his telescope. these findings have significantconsequences for the dating of ice cores and galactic sn and solar activityhistories.

0706.4146	x-ray spectroscopy of sn 1006 with suzaku	we report on observations of sn 1006 with the x-ray imaging spectrometers(xis) on board suzaku. we firmly detected k-shell emission from fe, for thefirst time, and find that the fe ionization state is quite low. the broad bandspectrum extracted from the southeast of the remnant is well fitted with amodel consisting of three optically thin thermal non-equilibrium ionizationplasmas and a power-law component. two of the thermal models are highlyoverabundant in heavy elements and, hence, are likely due to ejecta. thesecomponents have different ionization parameters: $n_et \sim 1.4\times 10^{10}$cm$^{-3}$ s and $n_et \sim 7.7\times 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ s and it is the later onethat produces the fe-k emission. this suggests that fe has been heated by thereverse shock more recently than the other elements, consistent with a picturewhere the ejecta are stratified by composition with fe in the interior. on theother hand, the third thermal component is assumed to be solar abundance, andwe associate it with emission from the interstellar medium (ism). the electrontemperature and ionization parameter are $kt_e \sim $0.5 kev and $n_et \sim5.8\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ s. the electron temperature is lower than thatexpected from the shock velocity which suggests a lack of collisionlesselectron heating at the forward shock. the extremely low ionization parameterand extreme non-equilibrium state are due to the low density of the ambientmedium.

0708.2002	measuring the broad-band x-ray spectrum from 400 ev to 40 kev in the  southwest part of the supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946	we report on results from suzaku broadband x-ray observations of thesouthwest part of the galactic supernova remnant (snr) rx j1713.7-3946 with anenergy coverage of 0.4-40 kev. the x-ray spectrum, presumably of synchrotronorigin, is known to be completely lineless, making this snr ideally suited fora detailed study of the x-ray spectral shape formed through efficient particleacceleration at high speed shocks. with a sensitive hard x-ray measurement fromthe hxd pin on board suzaku, we determine the hard x-ray spectrum in the 12--40kev range to be described by a power law with photon index gamma = 3.2+/- 0.2,significantly steeper than the soft x-ray index of gamma = 2.4+/- 0.05 measuredpreviously with asca and other missions. we find that a simple power law failsto describe the full spectral range of 0.4-40 kev and instead a power-law withan exponential cutoff with hard index gamma = 1.50+/- 0.09 and high-energycutoff epsilon_c = 1.2+/- 0.3 kev formally provides an excellent fit over thefull bandpass. if we use the so-called srcut model, as an alternative model, itgives the best-fit rolloff energy of epsilon_{roll} = 0.95+/- 0.04 kev.together with the tev gamma-ray spectrum ranging from 0.3 to 100 tev obtainedrecently by hess observations, our suzaku observations of rx j1713.7-3946provide stringent constraints on the highest energy particles accelerated in asupernova shock.

1007.4393	suzaku observations of the supernova remnant n23 in the large magellanic  cloud	x-ray emission from the supernova remnant n23 in the large magellanic cloud(lmc) is studied using the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) onboard suzaku.thanks to superior energy resolution of the xis in the soft x-ray band, weresolved h-like and he-like oxygen k\alpha emission lines from n23 withunprecedentedly high quality, and as a result, identified a new optically thinthermal emission component with a temperature ~0.2 kev, as well as that with atemperature of ~0.5-0.7 kev previously known. this alters the estimate of theionization timescale net from ~10^{10-11} cm^-3s to &gt;~10^{12} cm^{-3}s. underthe assumption that n23 is still in the sedov phase, its age evaluated from thenewly discovered low temperature component is ~8000 yr, although it is possiblethat n23 has already moved into the radiative phase. the abundances of theheavy elements are found to be roughly consistent with those of the lmcaverage, which indicates that the origin of the x-ray emission of n23 isswept-up ambient material, as expected from its ionization timescale.

1009.6031	expansion velocity of ejecta in tycho's supernova remnant measured by  doppler broadened x-ray line emission	we show that the expansion of ejecta in tycho's supernova remnant (snr) isconsistent with a spherically symmetric shell, based on suzaku measurements ofthe doppler broadened x-ray emission lines. all the strong k_alpha lineemission show broader widths at the center than at the rim, while the centroidenergies are constant across the remnant (except for ca). this is the patternexpected for doppler broadening due to expansion of the snr ejecta in aspherical shell. to determine the expansion velocities of the ejecta, weapplied a model for each emission line feature having two gaussian componentsseparately representing red- and blue-shifted gas, and inferred the dopplervelocity difference between these two components directly from the fittedcentroid energy difference. taking into account the effect of projecting athree-dimensional shell to the plane of the detector, we derived averagespherical expansion velocities independently for the k_alpha emission of si, s,ar, and fe, and k_beta of si. we found that the expansion velocities of si, s,and ar ejecta of 4700+/-100 km/s are distinctly higher than that obtained fromfe k_alpha emission, 4000+/-300 km/s, which is consistent with segregation ofthe fe in the inner ejecta. combining the observed ejecta velocities with theejecta proper-motion measurements by chandra, we derived a distance to thetycho's snr of 4+/-1 kpc.

0709.1580	suzaku detection of extended/diffuse hard x-ray emission from the  galactic center	five on-plane regions within +/- 0.8deg of the galactic center were observedwith the hard x-ray detector (hxd) and the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis)onboard suzaku. from all regions, significant hard x-ray emission was detectedwith hxd-pin up to 40 kev, in addition to the extended plasma emission which isdominant in the xis band. the hard x-ray signals are inferred to come primarilyfrom a spatially extended source, rather than from a small number of brightdiscrete objects. contributions to the hxd data from catalogued x-ray sources,typically brighter than 1 mcrab, were estimated and removed using informationfrom suzaku and other satellites. even after this removal, the hard x-raysignals remained significant, exhibiting a typical 12--40 kev surfacebrightness of 4e-10 erg cm-2 s-1 deg-2 and power-law-like spectra with a photonindex of 1.8. combined fittings to the xis and hxd-pin spectra confirm that aseparate hard tail component is superposed onto the hot thermal emission,confirming a previous report based on the xis data. over the 5--40 kev band,the hard tail is spectrally approximated by a power law of photon index ~2, butbetter by those with somewhat convex shapes. possible origins of the extendedhard x-ray emission are discussed.

0709.3151	suzaku observation of the rcw86 northeastern shell	this paper reports the suzaku results on the northeast shell of rcw 86. withthe spatial and spectral analysis, we separated the x-rays into three distinctcomponents; low (kt_e~0.3kev) and high (kt_e~1.8kev) temperature plasmas and anon-thermal component, and discovered their spatial distributions are differentfrom each other. the low temperature plasma is dominated at the east rim,whereas the non-thermal emission is the brightest at the northeast rim which isspatially connected from the east rim. the high temperature plasma, found tocontain the ~6.42kev line (k alpha of low-ionized iron), is enhanced at theinward region with respect to the east rim and has no spatial correlation withthe non-thermal x-ray (the northeast). the fe-kalpha line, therefore, is notrelated to the non-thermal emission but originates from fe-rich ejecta heatedto the high temperatures by the reverse shock. since the metal abundances ofthe low temperature plasma are sub-solar, the most possible origin of thiscomponent is interstellar medium heated by a blast wave. the non-thermal x-ray,which has a power-law index of ~2.8, is likely to be synchrotron emission. apossible scenario to explain these morphologies and spectra is: a fast movingblast wave in a thin cavity of ob association collided with a denseinterstellar medium or cloud at the east region very recently. as the result,the reverse shock in this interior decelerated, and arrived at the fe-richregion of the ejecta and heated it. in the northeast rim, on the other hand,the blast wave is still moving fast, and accelerated high energy electrons toemit synchrotron x-rays.

1106.0376	suzaku observation of the unidentified vhe gamma-ray source hess  j1702-420	a deep x-ray observation of the unidentified very high energy (vhe) gamma-raysource hess j1702-420, for the first time, was carried out by suzaku. no brightsources were detected in the xis field of view (fov) except for two faintpoint-like sources. the two sources, however, are considered not to be relatedto hess j1702-420, because their fluxes in the 2-10 kev band (~ 10^-14 erg s^-1cm^-2) are ~ 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the vhe gamma-ray flux in the1-10 tev band (f_{tev} = 3.1 x 10^-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2). we compared the energyspectrum of diffuse emission, extracted from the entire xis fov with those fromnearby observations. if we consider the systematic error of backgroundsubtraction, no significant diffuse emission was detected with an upper limitof f_x &lt;2.7 x 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 2-10 kev band for an assumedpower-law spectrum of \gamma=2.1 and a source size same as that in the vheband. the upper limit of the x-ray flux is twelve times as small as the vhegamma-ray flux. the large flux ratio (f_{tev}/f_x) indicates that hessj1702-420 is another example of a "dark" particle accelerator. if we use asimple one-zone leptonic model, in which vhe gamma-rays are produced throughinverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background and interstellarfar-infrared emission, and the x-rays via the synchrotron mechanism, an upperlimit of the magnetic field (1.7 \mu g) is obtained from the flux ratio.because the magnetic field is weaker than the typical value in the galacticplane (3-10 \mu g), the simple one-zone model may not work for hess j1702-420and a significant fraction of the vhe gamma-rays may originate from protons.

0711.2716	suzaku discovery of hard x-ray pulsations from the rotating magnetized  white dwarf, ae aquarii	the fast rotating magnetized white dwarf, ae aquarii, was observed withsuzaku, in october 2005 and october 2006 with exposures of 53.1 and 42.4 ks,respectively. in addition to clear spin modulation in the 0.5--10 kev band ofthe xis data at the barycentric period of 33.0769 \pm 0.0001 s, the 10--30 kevhxd data in the second half of the 2005 observation also showed statisticallysignificant periodic signals at a consistent period. on that occasion, thespin-folded hxd light curve exhibited two sharp spikes separated by about 0.2cycles in phase, in contrast to approximately sinusoidal profiles observed inenergies below about 4 kev. the folded 4--10 kev xis light curves areunderstood as a superposition of those two types of pulse profiles. the phaseaveraged 1.5--10 kev spectra can be reproduced by two thermal components withtemperatures of $2.90_{-0.16}^{+0.20}$ kev and $0.53_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ kev, butthe 12-25 kev hxd data show a significant excess above the extrapolated model.this excess can be explained by either a power-law model with photon index of$1.12_{-0.62}^{+0.63}$ or a third thermal component with a temperature of$54_{-47}^{+26}$ kev. at a distance of 102 pc, the 4--30 kev luminosities ofthe thermal and the additional components become $1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.3}$ and$5.3_{-0.3}^{+15.3} \times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. the lattercorresponds to 0.09% of the spin down energy of the object. possible emissionmechanisms of the hard pulsations are discussed, including in particularnon-thermal ones.

1207.5577	search for diffuse x-rays from the bow shock region of runaway star  bd+43$^\circ$3654 with suzaku	the bow shocks of runaway stars with strong stellar winds of over 2000 kms$^{-1}$ can serve as particle acceleration sites. the conversion from stellarwind luminosity into particle acceleration power has an efficiency of the sameorder of magnitude as those in supernova remnants, based on the radio emissionfrom the bow shock region of runaway star bd+43$^\circ$3654\citep{benaglia10}.if this object exhibits typical characteristics, thenrunaway star systems can contribute a non-negligible fraction of galacticcosmic-ray electrons. to constrain the maximum energy of accelerated particlesfrom measurements of possible non-thermal emissions in the x-ray band, suzakuobserved bd+43$^\circ$3654 in april 2011 with an exposure of 99 ks. because theonboard instruments have a stable and low background level, suzaku detected apossible enhancement over the background of $7.6\pm 3.4$ cnt arcmin$^{-2}$ atthe bow shock region, where the error represents the 3 sigma statistics only.however, the excess is not significant within the systematic errors ofnon-x-ray and cosmic-ray backgrounds of the x-ray imaging spectrometer, whichare $\pm 6.0$ and $\pm 34$ cnt arcmin$^{-2}$, respectively, and the 3-sigmaupper limit in the x-ray luminosity from the shock region, which is $1.1 \times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ per 41.2 arcmin$^2$ in the 0.5 to 10 kev band. thisresult leads to three conclusions: (1) a shock-heating process is inefficienton this system; (2) the maximum energy of electrons does not exceed $\sim$ 10tev, corresponding to a lorentz factor of less than $10^7$; and (3) themagnetic field in the shock acceleration site might not be as turbulent asthose in pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants.

1301.7499	synchrotron x-ray diagnostics of cutoff shape of nonthermal electron  spectrum at young supernova remnants	synchrotron x-rays can be a useful tool to investigate electron accelerationat young supernova remnants (snrs). at present, since the magnetic fieldconfiguration around the shocks of snrs is uncertain, it is not clear whetherelectron acceleration is limited by snr age, synchrotron cooling, or evenescape from the acceleration region. we study whether the accelerationmechanism can be constrained by the cutoff shape of the electron spectrumaround the maximum energy. we derive analytical formulae of the cutoff shape ineach case where the maximum electron energy is determined by snr age,synchrotron cooling and escape from the shock. they are related to the energydependence of the electron diffusion coefficient. next, we discuss whetherinformation on the cutoff shape can be provided by observations in the nearfuture which will simply give the photon indices and the flux ratios in thesoft and hard x-ray bands. we find that if the power-law index of the electronspectrum is independently determined by other observations, then we canconstrain the cutoff shape by comparing theoretical predictions of the photonindices and/or the flux ratios with observed data which will be measured bynustar and/or astro-h. such study is helpful in understanding the accelerationmechanism. in particular, it will supply another independent constraint on themagnetic field strength around the shocks of snrs.

1303.7109	spectral variation of the hard x-ray emission from the crab nebula with  the suzaku hard x-ray detector	the crab nebula is one of the brightest and most stable sources in the x-raysky. year-scale flux variation from the object was recently revealed in thehard x-ray band by four satellites. this marked the first detection ofyear-scale variability from pulsar wind nebulae in the hard x-ray band. thecrab nebula has been observed at least once a year for calibration purposeswith the suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) since its launch in 2005. in order toinvestigate possible spectral changes as well as flux variation, the archivaldata of the hxd were analyzed. the flux variation reported by other instrumentswas confirmed in the 25 -- 100 kev band by the hxd in a few percent level, butflux above 100 kev did not follow the trend in variation below 100 kev. thehardness ratios produced utilizing the pin and gso sensors installed in the hxdexhibit significant scattering, thereby indicating spectral variations in thehard x-ray. the spectral changes are quantified by spectral fitting with abroken power-law model. the difference between the two photon indexes of thebroken power-law model in harder and softer energy bands is in the range of &lt;2.54. taking into account flux variation of 6.3% and spectral variationtime-scale of a few days, multi components of the broken power-law-shapedsynchrotron emission with different cooling times are suggested.

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

1403.2455	long-lasting x-ray emission from type iib supernova 2011dh and mass-loss  history of the yellow supergiant progenitor	type iib supernova (sn) 2011dh, with conclusive detection of an unprecedentedyellow supergiant (ysg) progenitor, provides an excellent opportunity to deepenour understanding on the massive star evolution in the final centuries towardthe sn explosion. in this paper, we report on detection and analyses of thermalx-ray emission from sn iib 2011dh at ~500 days after the explosion on chandraarchival data, providing a solidly derived mass loss rate of an ysg progenitorfor the first time. we find that the circumstellar media (csm) should be dense,more than that expected from a wolf-rayet (wr) star by one order of magnitude.the emission is powered by a reverse shock penetrating into an outer envelope,fully consistent with the ysg progenitor but not with a wr progenitor. thedensity distribution at the outermost ejecta is much steeper than that expectedfrom a compact wr star, and this finding must be taken into account in modelingthe early uv/optical emission from sne iib. the derived mass loss rate is 3 x10^{-6} msun/year for the mass loss velocity of ~20 km/s in the final ~1,300years before the explosion. the derived mass loss properties are largelyconsistent with the standard wind mass loss expected for a giant star. this isnot sufficient to be a main driver to expel nearly all the hydrogen envelope.therefore, the binary interaction, with a huge mass transfer having taken placeat &gt;1,300 years before the explosion, is a likely scenario to produce the ysgprogenitor.

1404.5434	the many sides of rcw 86: a type ia supernova remnant evolving in its  progenitor's wind bubble	we present the results of a detailed investigation of the galactic supernovaremnant rcw 86 using the xmm-newton x-ray telescope. rcw 86 is the probableremnant of sn 185 a.d, a supernova that likely exploded inside a wind-blowncavity. we use the xmm-newton reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) to deriveprecise temperatures and ionization ages of the plasma, which are an indicationof the interaction history of the remnant with the presumed cavity. we findthat the spectra are well fitted by two non-equilibrium ionization models,which enables us to constrain the properties of the ejecta and interstellarmatter plasma. furthermore, we performed a principal component analysis on epicmos and pn data to find regions with particular spectral properties. we presentevidence that the shocked ejecta, emitting fe-k and si line emission, areconfined to a shell of approximately 2 pc width with an oblate spheroidalmorphology. using detailed hydrodynamical simulations, we show that generaldynamical and emission properties at different portions of the remnant can bewell-reproduced by a type ia supernova that exploded in a non-sphericallysymmetric wind-blown cavity. we also show that this cavity can be created usinggeneral wind properties for a single degenerate system. our data andsimulations provide further evidence that rcw 86 is indeed the remnant of sn185, and is the likely result of a type ia explosion of single degenerateorigin.

0806.1490	study of nonthermal emission from snr rx j1713.7-3946 with suzaku	we present results obtained from a series of observations of the supernovaremnant rx j1713.7-3946 by the suzaku satellite. the observations cover abouttwo-thirds of the remnant surface. we successfully detected hard x-rays up to ~40 kev from each pointing. the hard x-ray spectra are described by power-lawfunctions with photon indices of ~ 3.0, which are larger than those in theenergy region below 10 kev. connection of the spatially-integrated xis and hxdspectra clearly reveals a spectral cutoff in the 0.4--40 kev x-ray spectrum.this cutoff is interpreted to correspond to the maximum acceleration energy ofelectrons emitting synchrotron radiation. the wide-band coverage of suzaku forthe first time allows us to derive the parent electron spectrum in the cutoffregion, which shows good agreement with theoretical predictions. the inferredcutoff energy in the spatially-integrated x-ray spectrum indicates thatparticle acceleration in the remnant is so efficient that it is almost at thetheoretical limit, the so-called bohm limit. based on the suzaku data, wepresent results of multi-wavelength studies from spectral and morphologicalpoints of view. the spectral energy distribution favors the hadronic scenariorather than the leptonic scenario. for the morphology studies, we compare thesurface brightness maps from the suzaku xis and the h.e.s.s. telescope. weconfirm the strong correlation between x-ray and tev gamma-ray emission. inaddition to the correlation, we found that in the bright western rim regionsthe x-ray emission is brighter than expected from the general x-ray togamma-ray correlation.

1511.05580	radioactive decay products in neutron star merger ejecta: heating  efficiency and $\gamma$-ray emission	the radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized $r$-process nuclei ejectedin compact binary mergers power optical/infrared macronovae (kilonovae) thatfollow these events. the light curves depend critically on the energy partitionamong the different products of the radioactive decay and this plays animportant role in estimates of the amount of ejected $r$-process elements froma given observed signal. we study the energy partition and $\gamma$-rayemission of the radioactive decay. we show that $20$-$50\%$ of the totalradioactive energy is released in $\gamma$-rays on timescales from hours to amonth. the number of emitted $\gamma$-rays per unit energy interval has roughlya flat spectrum between a few dozen kev and $1$ mev so that most of this energyis carried by $\sim 1$ mev $\gamma$-rays. however at the peak of macronovaemission the optical depth of the $\gamma$-rays is $\sim 0.02$ and most of the$\gamma$-rays escape. the loss of these $\gamma$-rays reduces the heatdeposition into the ejecta and hence reduces the expected macronova signals ifthose are lanthanides dominated. this implies that the ejected mass is largerby a factor of $2$-$3$ than what was previously estimated. spontaneous fissionheats up the ejecta and the heating rate can increase if a sufficient amount oftransuranic nuclei are synthesized. direct measurements of these escaping$\gamma$-rays may provide the ultimate proof for the macronova mechanisms andan identification of the $r$-process nucleosynthesis sites. however, thechances to detect these signals are slim with current x-ray and $\gamma$-raymissions. new detectors, more sensitive by at least a factor of ten, are neededfor a realistic detection rate.

astro-ph;0411326	a spatial and spectral study of nonthermal filaments in historical  supernova remnants: observational results with chandra	the outer shells of young supernova remnants (snrs) are the most plausibleacceleration sites of high-energy electrons with the diffusive shockacceleration (dsa) mechanism. we studied spatial and spectral properties closeto the shock fronts in four historical snrs (cas a, kepler's remnant, tycho'sremnant, and rcw 86) with excellent spatial resolution of {\it chandra}. in allof the snrs, hard x-ray emissions were found on the rims of the snrs, whichconcentrate in very narrow regions (so-called "filaments"); apparent scalewidths on the upstream side are below or in the order of the point spreadfunction of {\it chandra}, while 0.5--40 arcsec (0.01--0.4 pc) on thedownstream side with most reliable distances. the spectra of these filamentscan be fitted with both thermal and nonthermal (power-law and {\tt srcut})models. the former requires unrealistic high temperature ($\ga$2 kev) and lowabundances ($\la$1 solar) for emission from young snrs and may be thusunlikely. the latter reproduces the spectra with best-fit photon indices of2.1--3.8, or roll-off frequencies of (0.1--28)$\times 10^{17}$ hz, whichreminds us of the synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated via dsa. weconsider various physical parameters as functions of the snr age, including theprevious results on sn 1006 \citep{bamba2003b}; the filament width on thedownstream side increases with the snr age, and the spectrum becomes softerkeeping a nonthermal feature. it was also found that a function, that is theroll-off frequency divided by the square of the scale width on the downstreamside, shows negative correlation with the age, which might provide us someinformation on the dsa theory.

astro-ph;0506331	chandra observations of a galactic supernova remnant vela jr.: a new  sample of thin filaments emitting synchrotron x-rays	a galactic supernova remnant (snr) vela jr. (rx j0852.0$-$4622, g266.6$-$1.2)shows sharp filamentary structure on the north-western edge of the remnant inthe hard x-ray band. the filaments are so smooth and located on the most outerside of the remnant. we measured the averaged scale width of the filaments($w_u$ and $w_d$) with excellent spatial resolution of {\it chandra}, which arein the order of the size of the point spread function of {\it chandra} on theupstream side and 49.5 (36.0--88.8) arcsec on the downstream side,respectively. the spectra of the filaments are very hard and have no line-likestructure, and were well reproduced with an absorbed power-law model with$\gamma = $2.67 (2.55--2.77), or a {\tt srcut} model with $\nu_{rolloff}$ = 4.3(3.4--5.3)$\times 10^{16}$ hz under the assumption of $p=0.3$. these resultsimply that the hard x-rays are synchrotron radiation emitted by acceleratedelectrons, as mentioned previously. using a correlation between a function${\cal b} \equiv \nu_{rolloff}/w_d^2$ and the snr age, we estimated thedistance and the age of vela jr.: the estimated distance and age are 0.33(0.26--0.50) kpc and 660 (420--1400) years, respectively. these results areconsistent with previous reports, implying that ${\cal b}$--age relation may bea useful tool to estimate the distance and the age of synchrotron x-rayemitting snrs.

astro-ph;0601065	a detailed observation of a lmc supernova remnant dem l241 with  xmm-newton	we report on an {\it xmm-newton} observation of the supernova remnant (snr)\object{dem l241} in the large magellanic cloud. in the soft band image, theemission shows an elongated structure, like a killifish, with a central compactsource. the compact source is point-like, and named as xmmu j053559.3$-$673509.the source spectrum is well reproduced with a power-law model with a photonindex of $\gamma = 1.57$ (1.51--1.62) and the intrinsic luminosity is$2.2\times 10^{35} \mathrm{ergs s^{-1}}$ in the 0.5--10.0 kev band, with theassumed distance of 50 kpc. the source has neither significant coherentpulsations in $2.0\times 10^{-3}$ hz--8.0 hz, nor time variabilities. itsluminosity and spectrum suggest that the source might be a pulsar wind nebula(pwn) in dem l241. the spectral feature classifies this source into ratherbright and hard pwn, which is similar to those in kes 75 and b0540$-$693. theelongated diffuse structure can be divided into a ``head'' and ``tail'', andboth have soft and line-rich spectra. their spectra are well reproduced by aplane-parallel shock plasma ({\it vpshock}) model with a temperature of0.3--0.4 kev and over-abundance in o and ne and a relative under-abundance infe. such an abundance pattern and the morphology imply that the emission isfrom the ejecta of the snr, and that the progenitor of dem l241 is a verymassive star, more than 20 m\sun. this result is also supported by theexistence of the central point source and an ob star association, lh 88. thetotal thermal energy and plasma mass are $\sim 4\times 10^{50}$ ergs and $\sim200$ m\sun, respectively.

astro-ph;0601704	tev gamma-rays from old supernova remnants	we study the emission from an old supernova remnant (snr) with an age ofaround 10^5 yrs and that from a giant molecular cloud (gmc) encountered by thesnr. when the snr age is around 10^5 yrs, proton acceleration is efficientenough to emit tev gamma-rays both at the shock of the snr and that in the gmc.the maximum energy of primarily accelerated electrons is so small that tevgamma-rays and x-rays are dominated by hadronic processes, pi^0-decay andsynchrotron radiation from secondary electrons, respectively. however, if thesnr is older than several 10^5 yrs, there are few high-energy particlesemitting tev gamma-rays because of the energy loss effect and/or the wavedamping effect occurring at low-velocity isothermal shocks. for old snrs orsnr-gmc interacting systems capable of generating tev gamma-ray emittingparticles, we calculated the ratio of tev gamma-ray (1-10 tev) to x-ray (2-10kev) energy flux and found that it can be more than ~10^2. such a sourceshowing large flux ratio may be a possible origin of recently discoveredunidentified tev sources.

astro-ph;0608191	discovery of a compact x-ray source in the lmc supernova remnant n23  with chandra	an x-ray compact source was discovered with chandra in a supernova remnant(snr) n23, located in the large magellanic cloud. the compact source (cxouj050552.3-680141) is seen in only the hard band (&gt; 2 kev) image of n23, whilethe soft band image (&lt; 2 kev) shows diffuse emission of the snr, with an extentof ~60 arcsec times ~80 arcsec. the compact source is located at almost thecenter of n23, and there is no identifiable object for the source from previousobservations at any other wavelength. the source spectrum is best explained bya power-law model with a photon index of 2.2 (1.9-2.7) and anabsorption-corrected luminosity of 1.0 x 10^34 ergs s^-1 in the 0.5--10 kevband for a distance of 50 kpc. neither pulsation nor time variability of thesource was detected with this observation with a time resolution of 3.2 sec.these results correspond with those of hughes et al. (2006) who carried outanalysis independently around the same time as our work. based on informationfrom the best-fit power-law model, we suggest that the source emission is mostlikely from a rotation-powered pulsar and/or a pulsar wind nebula. it isgenerally inferred that the progenitor of n23 is a core-collapsed massive star.  based on information from the best-fit power-law model, we suggest that thesource emission is most likely from a rotation-powered pulsar and/or a pulsarwind nebula. it is generally inferred that the progenitor of n23 is acore-collapsed massive star.

astro-ph;0608310	discovery of a possible x-ray counterpart to hess j1804-216	suzaku deep observations have discovered two highly significant nonthermalx-ray sources, suzaku j1804$-$2142 (src 1) and suzaku j1804$-$2140 (src 2),positionally coincident with the unidentified tev $\gamma$-ray source, hessj1804$-$216. the x-ray sources are not time variable and show no counterpart inother wavebands, except for the tev source. src 1 is unresolved at suzakuspatial resolution, whereas src 2 is extended or composed of multiple sources.the x-ray spectra are highly absorbed, hard, and featureless, and are wellfitted by absorbed power-law models with best-fit photon indices and absorptioncolumns of $-0.3_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ and $0.2_{-0.2}^{+2.0}\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$for src 1, and $1.7_{-1.0}^{+1.4}$ and $1.1_{-0.6}^{+1.0}\times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$ for src 2. the measured x-ray absorption to the latter source issignificantly larger than the total galactic neutral hydrogen column in thatdirection. the unabsorbed 2--10 kev band luminosities are $7.5\times10^{32}(d/{\rm 5 kpc})^2$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (src 1) and $1.3\times 10^{33}(d/{\rm 5kpc})^2$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (src 2), where $d$ is the source distance. among thehandful of tev sources with known x-ray counterparts, hess j1804$-$216 has thelargest ratio of tev $\gamma$-ray to hard x-ray fluxes. we discuss the natureof the emission and propose the suzaku sources as plausible counterparts to thetev source, although further observations are necessary to confirm this.

astro-ph;0610391	a suzaku observation of the low-ionization fe-line emission from rcw 86	the newly operational x-ray satellite suzaku observed the southwesternquadrant of the supernova remnant (snr) rcw 86 in february 2006 to study thenature of the 6.4 kev emission line first detected with the advanced satellitefor cosmology and astronomy (asca). the new data confirm the existence of theline, localizing it for the first time; most of the line emission is adjacentand interior to the forward shock and not at the locus of the continuum hardemission. we also report the first detection of a 7.1 kev line that weinterpret as the k-beta emission from low-ionization iron. the fe-k linefeatures are consistent with a non-equilibrium plasma of fe-rich ejecta withn_{e}t &lt;~ 10^9 cm^-3 s and kt_{e} ~ 5 kev. this combination of low n_{e}t andhigh kt_{e} suggests collisionless electron heating in an snr shock. the fek-alpha line shows evidence for intrinsic broadening, with a width of 47(34--59) ev (99% error region). the difference of the spatial distributions ofthe hard continuum above 3 kev and the fe-k line emission support a synchrotronorigin for the hard continuum.

0810.1594	x-ray observation of very high energy gamma-ray source, hess j1745-303,  with suzaku	suzaku observations of a tev unidentified (unid) source, hess j1745-303, arepresented. a possible excess of neutral iron line emission is discovered, andis likely associated with the main part of hess j1745-303, named "region a". itmay be an x-ray reflection nebula where the x-rays from previous galacticcenter (gc) activity are reflected by a molecular cloud. this result furtherstrengthens the assumption that the molecular cloud which is spatiallycoincident with region a of hess j1745-303 is located in the gc region. the tevemission from molecular clouds is reminiscent of the diffuse tev gamma-raysfrom the gc giant molecular clouds, and it could have the same emissionmechanism. with deep exposure mapping observations by suzaku, a tightupper-limit on the 2-10 kev continuum diffuse emission from region a isobtained, as 2.1x10^-13ergs s^-1cm^-2. the flux ratio between 1-10 tev and 2-10kev is larger than 4. possible scenarios to reproduce wide-band spectra fromkev to tev are examined. thermal x-rays from nearby two old supernova remnants,g359.0-0.9 and g359.1-0.5, are detected, and their emission properties are welldetermined in the present study with deep exposure.

0810.3745	x-ray studies of hess j1837--069 with suzaku and asca: a vhe gamma-ray  source originated from the pulsar wind nebula	we present the asca and suzaku studies of the tev source hess j1837--069,which has not been identified in other wave-lengths. we confirm the presence oftwo x-ray sources in the suzaku xis image, ax j1838.0--0655 and axj1837.3--0652, near both ends of the elongated tev emission region. the xisspectra of the two sources are reproduced by an absorbed power-law model, whoseparameters are all consistent with those determined by the asca data. recently,70.5 ms x-ray pulsation has been detected with rxte in the sky region includinghess j1837--069 (2008, apj, 681, 515). using the asca gis data which has bothtiming and imaging capabilities, we identified the pulsation source as axj1838.0--0655. the pulse periods determined by asca and suzaku, and thatreported with rxte indicate steady spin-down at $\dot{p} = 4.917(4) \times10^{-14}$ s s$^{-1}$. these results suggest that ax j1838.0--0655 is anintrinsically stable source, and presumably a pulsar wind nebula (pwn). wediscuss the possibility that ax j1838.0--0655 is associated with hessj1837--069 and the vhe gamma-ray emission is originated from the pwn.
