0903.3871	a spitzer study of asymptotic giant branch stars. iii. dust production  and gas return in local group dwarf irregular galaxies	we present the third and final part of a census of asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars in local group dwarf irregular galaxies. papers i and ii presentedthe results for wlm and ic 1613. included here are phoenix, lgs 3, ddo 210, leoa, pegasus dirr, and sextans a. spitzer photometry at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 arepresented, along with a more thorough treatment of background galaxycontamination than was presented in papers i and ii. we find that at least asmall population of completely optically obscured agb stars exists in eachgalaxy, regardless of the galaxy's metallicity, but that higher-metallicitygalaxies tend to harbor more stars with slight ir excesses. the opticalincompleteness increases for the redder agb stars, in line with the expectationthat some agb stars are not detected in the optical due to large amounts ofextinction associated with in situ dust production. overall, there is anunderrepresentation of 30% - 40% in the optical agb within the 1 sigma errorsfor all of the galaxies in our sample. this undetected population is largeenough to affect star formation histories derived from optical color-magnitudediagrams. as measured from the [3.6] - [4.5] color excesses, we find averagestellar mass-loss rates ranging from 3.1e-7 - 6.6e-6 solar masses per year, andintegrated galaxy mass-loss rates ranging from 4.4e-5 - 1.4e-3 solar masses peryear. the integrated mass-loss rate is sufficient to sustain the current starformation rate in only lgs 3 and ddo 210, requiring either significantnon-dusty mass loss or gas accretion in phoenix, leo a, pegasus dirr, sextansa, wlm, and ic 1613 if they are to maintain their status as gas-rich galaxies.

0905.3654	detailed maps of interstellar clouds in front of omega centauri:  small-scale structures in the galactic disc-halo interface	we used the multiplex capabilities of the aaomega spectrograph at theanglo-australian telescope to create a half-square-degree map of the neutraland low-ionized ism in front of the nearby (~5 kpc), most massive galacticglobular cluster, omega centauri. its redshifted, metal-poor and hot horizontalbranch stars probe the medium-strong ca ii k and na i d2 line absorption, andweak absorption in the lambda5780 and lambda5797 diffuse interstellar bands(dibs), on scales around a parsec. the kinematical and thermodynamical pictureemerging from these data is that we predominantly probe the warm neutral mediumand weakly-ionized medium of the galactic disc-halo interface, ~0.3-1 kpc abovethe mid-plane. a comparison with spitzer space telescope 24-micron anddirbe/iras maps of the warm and cold dust emission confirms that both na i andca ii trace the overall column density of the warm neutral and weakly-ionizedmedium. clear signatures are seen of the depletion of calcium atoms from thegas phase into dust grains. curiously, the coarse dirbe/iras map is a morereliable representation of the relative reddening between sightlines than thena i and ca ii absorption-line measurements, most likely because the latter aresensitive to fluctuations in the local ionization conditions. the behaviour ofthe dibs is consistent with the lambda5780 band being stronger than thelambda5797 band in regions where the ultraviolet radiation level is relativelyhigh, as in the disc-halo interface. this region corresponds to a sigma-typecloud. in all, our maps and simple analytical model calculations show inunprecedented detail that small-scale density and/or ionization structuresexist in the extra-planar gas of a spiral galaxy.

0908.2275	infrared dark clouds in the small magellanic cloud?	we have applied the unsharp-masking technique to the 24 $\mu$m image of thesmall magellanic cloud (smc), obtained with the spitzer space telescope, tosearch for high-extinction regions. this technique has been used to locate verydense and cold interstellar clouds in the galaxy, particularly infrared darkclouds (irdcs). fifty five candidate regions of high-extinction, namelyhigh-contrast regions (hcrs), have been identified from the generateddecremental contrast image of the smc. most hcrs are located in the southernbar region and mainly distributed in the outskirts of co clouds, but mostlikely contain a significant amount of h2. hcrs have a peak-contrast at 24$\mu$m of 2 - 2.5 % and a size of 8 - 14 pc. this corresponds to the size oftypical and large galactic irdcs, but galactic irdcs are 2 - 3 times darker at24 $\mu$m than our hcrs. to constrain the physical properties of the hcrs, wehave performed nh3, n2h+, hnc, hco+, and hcn observations toward one of thehcrs, hcr lirs36-east, using the australia telescope compact array and themopra single-dish radio telescope. we did not detect any molecular lineemission, however, our upper limits to the column densities of molecularspecies suggest that hcrs are most likely moderately dense with n ~ 10^{3}cm-3. this volume density is in agreement with predictions for the cool atomicphase in low metallicity environments. we suggest that hcrs may be tracingclouds at the transition from atomic to molecule-dominated medium, and could bea powerful way to study early stages of gas condensation in low metallicitygalaxies. alternatively, if made up of dense molecular clumps &lt; 0.5 pc in size,hcrs could be counterparts of galactic irdcs, and/or regions with highlyunusual abundance of very small dust grains.

0909.5154	dust production and mass loss in the galactic globular cluster ngc 362	we investigate dust production and stellar mass loss in the galactic globularcluster ngc 362. due to its close proximity to the small magellanic cloud(smc), ngc 362 was imaged with the irac and mips cameras onboard the spitzerspace telescope as part of the surveying the agents of galaxy evolution(sage-smc) spitzer legacy program. we detect several cluster members near thetip of the red giant branch that exhibit infrared excesses indicative ofcircumstellar dust and find that dust is not present in measurable quantitiesin stars below the tip of the red giant branch. we modeled the spectral energydistribution (sed) of the stars with the strongest ir excess and find a totalcluster dust mass-loss rate of 3.0(+2.0/-1.2) x 10^-9 solar masses per year,corresponding to a gas mass-loss rate of 8.6(+5.6/-3.4) x 10^-6 solar massesper year, assuming [fe/h] = -1.16. this mass loss is in addition to anydust-less mass loss that is certainly occurring within the cluster. the twomost extreme stars, variables v2 and v16, contribute up to 45% of the totalcluster dust-traced mass loss. the seds of the more moderate stars indicate thepresence of silicate dust, as expected for low-mass, low-metallicity stars.surprisingly, the sed shapes of the stars with the strongest mass-loss ratesappear to require the presence of amorphous carbon dust, possibly incombination with silicate dust, despite their oxygen-rich nature. these resultscorroborate our previous findings in omega centauri.

1001.4032	the onfp class in the magellanic clouds	the onfp class of rotationally broadened, hot spectra was defined some timeago in the galaxy, where its membership to date numbers only eight. theprincipal defining characteristic is a broad, centrally reversed he ii$\lambda$4686 emission profile; other emission and absorption lines are alsorotationally broadened. recent surveys in the magellanic clouds (mcs) havebrought the class membership there, including some related spectra, to 28. wepresent a survey of the spectral morphology and rotational velocities, as afirst step toward elucidating the nature of this class. evolved, rapidlyrotating hot stars are not expected theoretically, because the stellar windsshould brake the rotation. luminosity classification of these spectra is notpossible, because the principal criterion (he ii $\lambda$4686) is peculiar;however, the mcs provide reliable absolute magnitudes, which show that theyspan the entire range from dwarfs to supergiants. the onfp line-broadeningdistribution is distinct and shifted toward larger values from those of normalo dwarfs and supergiants with &gt;99.99% confidence. all cases with multipleobservations show line-profile variations, which even remove some objects fromthe class temporarily. some of them are spectroscopic binaries; it is possiblethat the peculiar profiles may have multiple causes among different objects.the origin and future of these stars are intriguing; for instance, they couldbe stellar mergers and/or gamma-ray-burst progenitors.

1009.0717	askap and meerkat surveys of the magellanic clouds	the magellanic clouds are a stepping stone from the overwhelming detail ofthe milky way in which we are immersed, to the global characteristics ofgalaxies both in the nearby and distant universe. they are interacting,gas-rich dwarf galaxies of sub-solar metallicity, not unlike the buildingblocks that assembled the large galaxies that dominate groups and clusters, andrepresentative of the conditions at the height of cosmic star formation. thesquare kilometre array (ska) can make huge strides in understanding galacticmetabolism and the ecological processes that govern star formation, byobservations of the magellanic clouds and other, nearby magellanic-typeirregular galaxies. two programmes with ska pathfinders attempt to pave theway: the approved galactic askap spectral line survey (gaskap) includes a deepsurvey in hi and oh of the magellanic clouds, whilst magikat is proposed toperform more detailed studies of selected regions within the magellanic clouds- also including faraday rotation measurements and observations at higherfrequencies. these surveys also close the gap with the revolutionizing surveysat far-ir wavelengths with the spitzer space telescope and herschel spaceobservatory.

0709.2353	a spectral atlas of post-main-sequence stars in omega centauri:  kinematics, evolution, enrichment and interstellar medium	we present a spectral atlas of the post-main-sequence population of the mostmassive galactic globular cluster, omega centauri. spectra were obtained ofmore than 1500 stars selected as uniformly as possible from across the (b, b-v)colour-magnitude diagram of the proper motion cluster member candidates of vanleeuwen et al. (2000). the spectra were obtained with the 2df multi-fibrespectrograph at the anglo australian telescope, and cover the approximate rangelambda~3840-4940 angstroem. we measure the radial velocities, effectivetemperatures, metallicities and surface gravities by fitting atlas9 stellaratmosphere models. we analyse the cluster membership and stellar kinematics,interstellar absorption in the ca ii k line at 3933 angstroem, the rr lyraeinstability strip and the extreme horizontal branch, the metallicity spread andbimodal cn abundance distribution of red giants, nitrogen and s-processenrichment, carbon stars, pulsation-induced balmer line emission on theasymptotic giant branch (agb), and the nature of the post-agb and uv-brightstars. membership is confirmed for the vast majority of stars, and the radialvelocities clearly show the rotation of the cluster core. we identifylong-period rr lyrae-type variables with low gravity, and low-amplitudevariables coinciding with warm rr lyrae stars. a barium enhancement in thecoolest red giants indicates that 3rd dredge-up operates in agb stars in omegacen. this is distinguished from the pre-enrichment by more massive agb stars,which is also seen in our data. the properties of the agb, post-agb anduv-bright stars suggest that rgb mass loss may be less efficient at very lowmetallicity, [fe/h]&lt;&lt;-1, increasing the importance of mass loss on the agb. thecatalogue and spectra are made available via cds.

1104.5155	spitzer spectra of evolved stars in omega centauri and their  low-metallicity dust production	dust production is explored around 14 metal-poor ([fe/h] = -1.91 to -0.98)giant stars in the galactic globular cluster omega centauri using new spitzerirs spectra. this sample includes the cluster's post-agb and carbon stars andis thus the first representative spectral study of dust production in ametal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -1) population. only the more metal rich stars v6 and v17([fe/h] = -1.08, -1.06) exhibit silicate emission, while the five other starswith mid-infrared excess show only a featureless continuum which we argue iscaused by metallic iron dust grains. we examine the metallicity of v42, andfind it is likely part of the metal-rich population ([fe/h] ~ -0.8). aside fromthe post-agb star v1, we find no star from the cluster's bulk, metal-poor([fe/h] &lt; -1.5) population - including the carbon stars - to be producingdetectable amounts of dust. we compare the dust production to the stars'h-alpha line profiles obtained at the magellan/clay telescope at las campanasobservatory, finding pulsation shocking in the strongest pulsators (v6, v17 andv42), but evidence of outflow in all other stars. we conclude that the onset ofdust production does not signify a fundamental change in the material leavingthe star. our data add to a growing body of evidence that metallic irondominates dust production in metal-poor, oxygen-rich stars, but that dust isprobably not the primary accelerant of winds in this mass-metallicity regime.

1107.1323	the remnant of sn1987a revealed at (sub-)mm wavelengths	context: supernova 1987a (sn1987a) exploded in the large magellanic cloud(lmc). its proximity and rapid evolution makes it a unique case study of theearly phases in the development of a supernova remnant. one particular aspectof interest is the possible formation of dust in sn1987a, as sne couldcontribute significantly to the dust seen at high redshifts. aims: we explorethe properties of sn1987a and its circumburst medium as seen at mm and sub-mmwavelengths, bridging the gap between extant radio and infrared (ir)observations of respectively the synchrotron and dust emission. methods:sn1987a was observed with the australia telescope compact array (atca) at 3.2mm in july 2005, and with the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex) at 0.87 mmin may 2007. we present the images and brightness measurements of sn1987a atthese wavelengths for the first time. results: sn1987a is detected as anunresolved point source of 11.2 +/- 2.0 mjy at 3.2 mm (5" beam) and 21 +/- 4mjy at 0.87 mm (18" beam). these flux densities are in perfect agreement withextrapolations of the powerlaw radio spectrum and modified-blackbody dustemission, respectively. this places limits on the presence of free-freeemission, which is similar to the expected free-free emission from the ionizedejecta from sn1987a. adjacent, fainter emission is observed at 0.87 mmextending ~0.5' towards the south-west. this could be the impact of thesupernova progenitor's wind when it was still a red supergiant upon a densemedium. conclusions: we have established a continuous spectral energydistribution for the emission from sn1987a and its immediate surroundings,linking the ir and radio data. this places limits on the contribution fromionized plasma. our sub-mm image reveals complexity in the distribution of colddust surrounding sn1987a, but leaves room for freshly synthesized dust in thesn ejecta.

0710.1491	dust, pulsation, chromospheres and their role in driving mass loss from  red giants in galactic globular clusters	context: mass loss from red giants in old globular clusters affects thehorizontal branch (hb) morphology and post-hb stellar evolution including theproduction of ultraviolet-bright stars, dredge up of nucleosynthesis productsand replenishment of the intra-cluster medium. studies of mass loss in globularclusters also allows one to investigate the metallicity dependence of the massloss from cool, low-mass stars down to very low metallicities.  aims: we present an analysis of new vlt/uves spectra of 47 red giants in thegalactic globular clusters 47 tuc (ngc 104), ngc 362, omega cen (ngc 5139), ngc6388, m54 (ngc 6715) and m15 (ngc 7078). the spectra cover the wavelengthregion 6100-9900a at a resolving power of r = 110,000. some of these stars areknown to exhibit mid-infrared excess emission indicative of circumstellar dust.our aim is to detect signatures of mass loss, identify the mechanism(s)responsible for such outflows, and measure the mass-loss rates.  methods: we determine for each star its effective temperature, luminosity,radius and escape velocity. we analyse the h-alpha and near-infrared calciumtriplet lines for evidence of outflows, pulsation and chromospheric activity,and present a simple model for estimating mass-loss rates from the h-alpha lineprofile. we compare our results with a variety of other, independent methods.  results: we argue that a chromosphere persists in galactic globular clustergiants and controls the mass-loss rate to late-k/early-m spectral types, wherepulsation becomes strong enough to drive shock waves at luminosities above thergb tip. this transition may be metallicity-dependent. we find mass-loss ratesof ~10^-7 to 10^-5 solar masses per year, largely independent of metallicity.

0710.4468	dust mass-loss rates from agb stars in the fornax and sagittarius dwarf  spheroidal galaxies	to study the effect of metallicity on the mass-loss rate of asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars, we have conducted mid-infrared photometric measurements ofsuch stars in the sagittarius (sgr dsph) and fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxieswith the 10-$\mu$m camera visir at the vlt. we derive mass-loss rates for 29agb stars in sgr dsph and 2 in fornax. the dust mass-loss rates are estimatedfrom the $k-[9]$ and $k-[11]$ colours. radiative transfer models are used tocheck the consistency of the method. published iras and spitzer data confirmthat the same tight correlation between $k-[12]$ colour and dust mass-lossrates is observed for agb stars from galaxies with different metallicities,i.e. the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.  the derived dust mass-loss rates are in the range 5$\times10^{-10}$ to3$\times10^{-8}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the observed agb stars in sgr dsphand around 5$\times10^{-9}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for those in fornax; whilevalues obtained with the two different methods are of the same order ofmagnitude. the mass-loss rates for these stars are higher than the nuclearburning rates, so they will terminate their agb phase by the depletion of theirstellar mantles before their core can grow significantly. some observed starshave lower mass-loss rates than the minimum value predicted by theoreticalmodels.

1203.4975	zooming in on supernova 1987a at sub-mm wavelengths	supernova 1987a (sn1987a) in the neighbouring large magellanic cloud offers asuperb opportunity to follow the evolution of a supernova and its remnant inunprecedented detail. recently, far-infrared (far-ir) and sub-mm emission wasdetected from the direction of sn1987a, which was interpreted as due to theemission from dust, possibly freshly synthesized in the sn ejecta. to betterconstrain the location and hence origin of the far-ir and sub-mm emission insn1987a, we have attempted to resolve the object in that part of theelectro-magnetic spectrum. we observed sn1987a during july-september 2011 withthe atacama pathfinder experiment (apex), at a wavelength of 350 micron withthe submillimetre apex bolometer camera (saboca) and at 870 micron with thelarge apex bolometer camera (laboca). the 350-micron image has superior angularresolution (8") over that of the herschel space observatory 350-micron image(25"). the 870-micron observation (at 20" resolution) is a repetition of asimilar observation made in 2007. in both images, at 350 and 870 micron,emission is detected from sn1987a, and the source is unresolved. the fluxdensities in the new (2011) measurements are consistent with those measuredbefore with herschel at 350 micron (in 2010) and with apex at 870 micron (in2007). a higher dust temperature (approximately 33 k) and lower dust mass mightbe possible than what was previously thought. the new measurements, at thehighest angular resolution achieved so far at far-ir and sub-mm wavelengths,strengthen the constraints on the location of the emission, which is thought tobe close to the site of sn1987a and its circumstellar ring structures. thesemeasurements set the stage for upcoming observations at even higher angularresolution with the atacama large millimeter array (alma).

1210.7812	the spatial distribution of dust and stellar emission of the magellanic  clouds	we study the emission by dust and stars in the large and small magellanicclouds, a pair of low-metallicity nearby galaxies, as traced by their spatiallyresolved spectral energy distributions (seds). this project combines herschelspace observatory pacs and spire far-infrared photometry with other data atinfrared and optical wavelengths. we build maps of dust and stellar luminosityand mass of both magellanic clouds, and analyze the spatial distribution ofdust/stellar luminosity and mass ratios. these ratios vary considerablythroughout the galaxies, generally between the range $0.01\leq l_{\rmdust}/l_\ast\leq 0.6$ and $10^{-4}\leq m_{\rm dust}/m_\ast\leq 4\times10^{-3}$.we observe that the dust/stellar ratios depend on the interstellar medium (ism)environment, such as the distance from currently or previously star-formingregions, and on the intensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf). inaddition, we construct star formation rate (sfr) maps, and find that the sfr iscorrelated with the dust/stellar luminosity and dust temperature in bothgalaxies, demonstrating the relation between star formation, dust emission andheating, though these correlations exhibit substantial scatter.

1304.3782	the uk infrared telescope m33 monitoring project. iii. feedback from  dusty stellar winds in the central square kiloparsec	we have conducted a near-infrared monitoring campaign at the uk infraredtelescope (ukirt), of the local group spiral galaxy m33 (triangulum). the mainaim was to identify stars in the very final stage of their evolution, and forwhich the luminosity is more directly related to the birth mass than the morenumerous less-evolved giant stars that continue to increase in luminosity. inthis third paper of the series, we measure the dust production and rates ofmass loss by the pulsating asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and redsupergiants. to this aim, we combined our time-averaged near-ir photometry withthe multi-epoch mid-ir photometry obtained with the spitzer space telescope.the mass-loss rates are seen to increase with increasing strength of pulsationand with increasing bolometric luminosity. low-mass stars lose most of theirmass through stellar winds, but even super-agb stars and red supergiants lose$\sim40$% of their mass via a dusty stellar wind. more than three-quarters ofthe dust return is oxygenous. we construct a 2-d map of the mass-return rate,showing a radial decline but also local enhancements due to agglomerations ofmassive stars. we estimate a total mass-loss rate of 0.004--0.005 m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, increasing to $\sim0.006$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$when accounting for eruptive mass loss (e.g., supernov{\ae}); comparing this tothe current star formation rate of $\sim0.03$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ weconclude that star formation in the central region of m\,33 can only besustained if gas is accreted from further out in the disc or fromcircum-galactic regions.

1305.4954	dusty ob stars in the small magellanic cloud - ii: extragalactic disks  or examples of the pleiades phenomenon?	we use mid-infrared spitzer spectroscopy and far-infrared herschel photometryfor a sample of twenty main sequence o9--b2 stars in the small magellanic cloud(smc) with strong 24 micron excesses to investigate the origin of the mid-iremission. either debris disks around the stars or illuminated patches of denseinterstellar medium (ism) can cause such mid-ir emission. in a companion paper,paper i, we use optical spectroscopy to show that it is unlikely for any ofthese sources to be classical be stars or herbig ae/be stars. we focus ouranalysis on debris disks and cirrus hot spots. we find three out of twentystars to be significantly extended in the mid-ir, establishing them as cirrushot spots. we then fit the ir spectral energy distributions to determine dusttemperatures and masses. we find the dust masses in the smc stars to be largerthan for any known debris disks, although this evidence against the debris diskhypothesis is circumstantial. finally, we created a local comparison sample ofbright mid-ir ob stars in the milky way (mw) by cross-matching the wise andhipparcos catalogs. all such local stars in the appropriate luminosity rangethat can be unambiguously classified are young stars with optical emissionlines or are spatially resolved by wise with sizes too large to be plausibledebris disk candidates. we conclude that the very strong mid-ir flux excessesare most likely explained as cirrus hot spots, although we cannot rigorouslyrule out that a small fraction of the sample is made up of debris disks ortransition disks. we present suggestive evidence that bow-shock heating aroundrunaway stars may be a contributing mechanism to the interstellar emission.these sources, interpreted as cirrus hot spots, offer a new localised probe ofdiffuse interstellar dust in a low metallicity environment.

1403.0618	spitzer view of massive star formation in the tidally stripped  magellanic bridge	the magellanic bridge is the nearest low-metallicity, tidally strippedenvironment, offering a unique high-resolution view of physical conditions inmerging and forming galaxies. in this paper we present analysis of candidatemassive young stellar objects (ysos), i.e., {\it in situ, current} massive starformation (msf) in the bridge using {\it spitzer} mid-ir and complementaryoptical and near-ir photometry. while we definitely find ysos in the bridge,the most massive are $\sim10 m_\odot$, $\ll45 m_\odot$ found in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc). the intensity of msf in the bridge also appearsdecreasing, as the most massive ysos are less massive than those formed in thepast. to investigate environmental effects on msf, we have compared propertiesof massive ysos in the bridge to those in the lmc. first, ysos in the bridgeare apparently less embedded than in the lmc: 81% of bridge ysos show opticalcounterparts, compared to only 56% of lmc sources with the same range of mass,circumstellar dust mass, and line-of-sight extinction. circumstellar envelopesare evidently more porous or clumpy in the bridge's low-metallicityenvironment. second, we have used whole samples of ysos in the lmc and thebridge to estimate the probability of finding ysos at a given \hi\ columndensity, n(hi). we found that the lmc has $\sim3\times$ higher probability thanthe bridge for n(hi) $&gt;10\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, but the trend reverses atlower n(hi). investigating whether this lower efficiency relative to hi is dueto less efficient molecular cloud formation, or less efficient cloud collapse,or both, will require sensitive molecular gas observations.

1407.7658	molecular hydrogen emission in the interstellar medium of the large  magellanic cloud	we present the detection and analysis of molecular hydrogen emission towardten interstellar regions in the large magellanic cloud. we examinedlow-resolution infrared spectral maps of twelve regions obtained with thespitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the pure rotational 0--0 transitions ofh$_2$ at 28.2 and 17.1${\,\rm \mu m}$ are detected in the irs spectra for tenregions. the higher level transitions are mostly upper limit measurementsexcept for three regions, where a 3$\sigma$ detection threshold is achieved forlines at 12.2 and 8.6${\,\rm \mu m}$. the excitation diagrams of the detectedh$_2$ transitions are used to determine the warm h$_2$ gas column density andtemperature. the single-temperature fits through the lower transition linesgive temperatures in the range $86-137\,{\rm k}$. the bulk of the excited h$_2$gas is found at these temperatures and contributes $\sim$5-17% to the total gasmass. we find a tight correlation of the h$_2$ surface brightness withpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and total infrared emission, which is a clearindication of photo-electric heating in photodissociation regions. we find theexcitation of h$_2$ by this process is equally efficient in both atomic andmolecular dominated regions. we also present the correlation of the warm h$_2$physical conditions with dust properties. the warm h$_2$ mass fraction andexcitation temperature show positive correlations with the average starlightintensity, again supporting h$_2$ excitation in photodissociation regions.

1409.0790	the star formation history of the magellanic clouds derived from  long-period variable star counts	we present the first reconstruction of the star formation history (sfh) ofthe large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc) using long period variablestars. these cool evolved stars reach their peak luminosity in thenear-infrared; thus, their k-band magnitudes can be used to derive their birthmass and age, and hence the sfh can be obtained. in the lmc, we found a 10-gyrold single star formation epoch at a rate of $\sim1.5$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,followed by a relatively continuous sfr of $\sim0.2$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,globally. in the core of the lmc (lmc bar), a secondary, distinct episode isseen, starting 3 gyr ago and lasting until $\sim0.5$ gyr ago. in the smc, twoformation epochs are seen, one $\sim6$ gyr ago at a rate of $\sim0.28$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and another only $\sim0.7$ gyr ago at a rate of $\sim0.3$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. the latter is also discernible in the lmc and may thus belinked to the interaction between the magellanic clouds and/or milky way, whilethe formation of the lmc bar may have been an unrelated event. star formationactivity is concentrated in the central parts of the magellanic clouds now, andpossibly has always been if stellar migration due to dynamical relaxation hasbeen effective. the different initial formation epochs suggest that the lmc andsmc did not form as a pair, but at least the smc formed in isolation.

1409.7811	spectral and morphological analysis of the remnant of supernova 1987a  with alma &amp; atca	we present a comprehensive spectral and morphological analysis of the remnantof supernova (sn) 1987a with the australia telescope compact array (atca) andthe atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma). the non-thermal andthermal components of the radio emission are investigated in images from 94 to672 ghz ($\lambda$ 3.2 mm to 450 $\mu$m), with the assistance of ahigh-resolution 44 ghz synchrotron template from the atca, and a dust templatefrom alma observations at 672 ghz. an analysis of the emission distributionover the equatorial ring in images from 44 to 345 ghz highlights a gradualdecrease of the east-to-west asymmetry ratio with frequency. we attribute thisto the shorter synchrotron lifetime at high frequencies. across the transitionfrom radio to far infrared, both the synchrotron/dust-subtracted images and thespectral energy distribution (sed) suggest additional emission beside the mainsynchrotron component ($s_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-0.73}$) and the thermal componentoriginating from dust grains at $t\sim22$ k. this excess could be due tofree-free flux or emission from grains of colder dust. however, a secondflat-spectrum synchrotron component appears to better fit the sed, implyingthat the emission could be attributed to a pulsar wind nebula (pwn). theresidual emission is mainly localised west of the sn site, as the spectralanalysis yields $-0.4\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-0.1$ across the western regions,with $\alpha\sim0$ around the central region. if there is a pwn in the remnantinterior, these data suggest that the pulsar may be offset westward from the snposition.

1410.5709	the influence of supernova remnants on the interstellar medium in the  large magellanic cloud seen at 20--600 $\mu$m wavelengths	we present the analysis of supernova remnants (snrs) in the large magellaniccloud (lmc) and their influence on the environment at far-infrared (fir) andsubmillimeter wavelengths. we use new observations obtained with the {\itherschel} space observatory and archival data obtained with the {\it spitzer}space telescope, to make the first fir atlas of these objects. the snrs are notclearly discernible at fir wavelengths, however their influence becomesapparent in maps of dust mass and dust temperature, which we constructed byfitting a modified black-body to the observed spectral energy distribution ineach sightline. most of the dust that is seen is pre-existing interstellar dustin which snrs leave imprints. the temperature maps clearly reveal snrs heatingsurrounding dust, while the mass maps indicate the removal of3.7$^{+7.5}_{-2.5}$ m$_{\odot}$ of dust per snr. this agrees with thecalculations by others that significant amounts of dust are sputtered by snrs.under the assumption that dust is sputtered and not merely pushed away, weestimate a dust destruction rate in the lmc of $0.037^{+0.075}_{-0.025}$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ due to snrs, yielding an average lifetime for interstellardust of $2^{+4.0}_{-1.3}\times10^7$ yr. we conclude that sputtering of dust bysnrs may be an important ingredient in models of galactic evolution, thatsupernovae may destroy more dust than they produce, and that they therefore maynot be net producers of long lived dust in galaxies.

1507.07003	identification of a class of low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars  struggling to become carbon stars in the magellanic clouds	we have identified a new class of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in thesmall and large magellanic clouds (smc/lmc) using optical to infraredphotometry, light curves, and optical spectroscopy. the strong dust productionand long-period pulsations of these stars indicate that they are at the veryend of their agb evolution. period-mass-radius relations for thefundamental-mode pulsators give median current stellar masses of 1.14 m_sun inthe lmc and 0.94 m_sun in the smc (with dispersions of 0.21 and 0.18 m_sun,respectively), and models suggest initial masses of &lt;1.5 m_sun and &lt;1.25 m_sun,respectively. this new class of stars includes both o-rich and c-richchemistries, placing the limit where dredge-up allows carbon star productionbelow these masses. a high fraction of the brightest among them should show sstar characteristics indicative of atmospheric c/o ~ 1, and many will formo-rich dust prior to their c-rich phase. these stars can be separated fromtheir less-evolved counterparts by their characteristically red j-[8] colors.

1510.07647	the vmc survey - xvii. the proper motion of the small magellanic cloud  and of the milky way globular cluster 47 tucanae	in this study we use multi-epoch near-infrared observations from the vistasurvey of the magellanic cloud system (vmc) to measure the proper motion ofdifferent stellar populations in a tile of 1.5 deg sq. in size in the directionof the galactic globular cluster 47 tuc. we obtain the proper motion of thecluster itself, of the small magellanic cloud (smc), and of the field milky waystars. stars of the three main stellar components are selected from theirspatial distribution and their distribution in colour-magnitude diagrams. theiraverage coordinate displacement is computed from the difference betweenmultiple ks-band observations for stars as faint as ks=19 mag. proper motionsare derived from the slope of the best-fitting line among 10 vmc epochs over atime baseline of ~1 yr. background galaxies are used to calibrate the absoluteastrometric reference frame. the resulting absolute proper motion of 47 tuc is(mu_alpha cos(delta), mu_delta)=(+7.26+/-0.03, -1.25+/-0.03) mas/yr. thismeasurement refers to about 35000 sources distributed between 10 and 60 arcminfrom the cluster centre. for the smc we obtain (mu_alpha cos(delta),mu_delta)=(+1.16+/-0.07, -0.81+/-0.07) mas/yr from about 5250 red clump and redgiant branch stars. the absolute proper motion of the milky way population inthe line-of-sight (l =305.9, b =-44.9) of this vista tile is (mu_alphacos(delta), mu_delta)=(+10.22+/-0.14, -1.27+/-0.12) mas/yr and results fromabout 4000 sources. systematic uncertainties associated to the astrometricreference system are 0.18 mas/yr. thanks to the proper motion we detect 47 tucstars beyond its tidal radius.

1511.07257	probing the local bubble with diffuse interstellar bands (dibs)	the sun lies in the middle of an enormous cavity of a million degree gas,known as the local bubble. the local bubble is surrounded by a wall of denserneutral and ionized gas. the local bubble extends around 100 pc in the plane ofgalaxy and hundreds of parsecs vertically, but absorption-line surveys ofneutral sodium and singly-ionized calcium have revealed a highly irregularstructure and the presence of neutral clouds within an otherwise tenuous andhot gas. we have undertaken an all-sky, european-iranian survey of the localbubble in the absorption of a number of diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) tooffer a novel view of our neighbourhood. our dedicated campaigns with eso's newtechnology telescope and the ing's isaac newton telescope comprise highsignal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectra, concentrating on the 5780 and 5797\aa\ bands which trace ionized/irradiated and neutral/shielded environments,respectively; their carriers are unknown but likely to be large carbonaceousmolecules. with about 660 sightlines towards early-type stars distributed overdistances up to about 200 pc, our data allow us to reconstruct the first ever3d dib map of the local bubble, which we present here. while we confirm ourexpectations that the 5780 \aa\ dib is relatively strong compared to the 5797\aa\ dib in hot/irradiated regions such as which prevail within the localbubble and its walls, and the opposite is true for cooler/shielded regionsbeyond the confines of the local bubble, we unexpectedly also detect dibcloudlets inside of the local bubble. these results reveal new insight into thestructure of the local bubble, as well as helping constrain our understandingof the carriers of the dibs.

0806.3557	molecules and dust production in the magellanic clouds	we present eso/vlt spectra in the 2.9-4.1 micron range for a large sample ofinfrared stars in the small magellanic cloud (smc), mainly carbon stars,massive oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars, and red supergiants.strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) is detected in thespectrum of the post-agb object msx smc 29. water ice is detected in at leastone young stellar object, iras 01042-7215, for the first time in the smc. thestrength and shapes of the molecular bands detected in the evolved stars arecompared with similar data for stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc).absorption from acetylene in carbon stars is found to be equally strong in thesmc as in the lmc, but the lmc stars show stronger dust emission in theirinfrared colours and veiling of the molecular bands. this suggests that acritical link exists in the formation of dust from the molecular atmosphere incarbon stars which scales with the initial metallicity. nucleation seeds basedon a secondary element such as titanium or silicon provide a plausibleexplanation. in oxygen-rich stars, both the nucleation seeds and molecularcondensates depend on secondary elements (in particular titanium, silicon,and/or aluminium). data for pulsating dusty agb stars and supergiants in thelmc are used to show that pulsation is likely the critical factor in drivingmass loss, as long as dust forms, rather than the stellar luminosity. finally,we suggest that the reduced dust production and consequently slower winds ofmetal-poor agb stars and red supergiants are more likely to result in chemicalinhomogeneities and small-scale structure in the interstellar medium.(abridged)

astro-ph;0101107	the peculiar cluster hs 327 in the large magellanic cloud: can oh/ir  stars and carbon stars be twins?	the obscured oh/ir star iras05298-6957 in the lmc was recently noticed to bemember of the small double cluster hs 327 that also contains a carbon star (vanloon et al., 1998, a&amp;a 329, 169). hence they are coeval and have (nearly) thesame progenitor mass, which can only be understood if hot bottom burning (hbb)has prevented iras05298-6957 from being a carbon star. we present extensivevisual and near-ir photometric data for &gt;10^4 stars in and around hs 327, andspectroscopic data for some of the brightest agb stars amongst these.colour-magnitude diagrams are used to estimate the age for the cluster and itsmembers, and luminosities are derived for the stars for which spectra have beenobtained. the age for iras05298-6957 and the carbon star is estimated to beabout 200 myr. this corresponds to a main-sequence progenitor mass of about 4.0m_sun --- the first direct measurement of the lower mass threshold for hbb.this agrees with stellar evolution models that, however, fail to reproduce thelow luminosity of the carbon star.

astro-ph;0101125	circumstellar masers in the magellanic clouds	we have searched for 22 ghz h2o and 43/86/129 ghz sio masers in bright iraspoint sources in the smc and lmc, to test whether the kinematics of the massloss from these stars depends on metallicity. h2o masers were detected in thered supergiants iras04553-6825 and iras05280-6910, and tentatively in theluminous ir object iras05216-6753 and the agb star iras05329-6708. sio maserswere detected in iras04553-6825. the outflow velocity increases between the h2omasing zone near the dust-formation region and the more distant oh masing zonefrom 18 to 26 km/s for iras04553-6825 and from 6 to 17 km/s for iras05280-6910.the total sample of lmc targets is analysed in comparison with circumstellarmasers in the galactic centre. the photon fluxes of circumstellar masers in thelmc are very similar to those in the galactic centre. the expansion velocitiesin the lmc appear to be 20% lower than for similarly bright oh masers in thegalactic centre, but the data are consistent with no difference in expansionvelocity. oh/ir stars in the lmc appear to have slower accelerating envelopesthan oh/ir stars in the galactic centre. masers in the lmc have blue-asymmetricemission profiles. this may be due to the amplification of stellar and/orfree-free radiation, rather than the amplification of dust emission, and may bemore pronounced in low metallicity envelopes. sio maser strength increases withthe photometric amplitude at 2.2 micron but is independent of the photometricamplitude at 10 micron. this suggests a strong connection between shocks in thedust-free sio masing zone and the dust formation process. appendices describeh2o maser emission from r dor in the milky way, optical echelle spectroscopy ofiras04553-6825, and the properties of masers in the galactic centre (abridged).

astro-ph;0107067	modelling the orbital modulation of ultraviolet resonance lines in  high-mass x-ray binaries	the stellar-wind structure in high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs) isinvestigated through modelling of their ultraviolet (uv) resonance lines. forthe ob supergiants in two systems, vela x-1 and 4u1700-37, high-resolution uvspectra are available; for cyg x-1, smc x-1, and lmc x-4 low-resolution spectraare used. in order to account for the non-monotonic velocity structure of thestellar wind, a modified version of the sobolev exact integration (sei) methodby lamers et al. (1987) is applied. the orbital modulation of the uv resonancelines provides information on the size of the stroemgren zone surrounding thex-ray source. the amplitude of the observed orbital modulation (known as thehatchett-mccray effect), however, also depends on the density- and velocitystructure of the ambient wind. model profiles are presented that illustrate theeffect on the appearance of the hm effect by varying stellar-wind parameters.the q parameter of hatchett &amp; mccray (1977), as well as other parametersdescribing the supergiant's wind structure, are derived for the 5 systems. thex-ray luminosity needed to create the observed size of the stroemgren zone isconsistent with the observed x-ray flux. the derived wind parameters arecompared to those determined in single ob supergiants of similar spectral type.our models naturally explain the observed absence of the hm effect in4u1700-37. the orbital modulation in vela x-1 indicates that besides thestroemgren zone other structures are present in the stellar wind (such as aphoto-ionization wake). the ratio of the wind velocity and the escape velocityis found to be lower in ob supergiants in hmxbs than in single ob supergiantsof the same effective temperature.

astro-ph;0210073	infrared stellar populations in the central parts of the milky way  galaxy	near- and mid-ir survey data from denis and isogal are used to investigatethe structure and formation history of the inner 10 degree (1.4 kpc) of themilky way galaxy. synthetic bolometric corrections and extinction coefficientsin the near- and mid-ir are derived for stars of different spectral types, toallow the transformation of theoretical isochrones into observablecolour-magnitude diagrams. the observed ir colour-magnitude diagrams are usedto derive the extinction, metallicity and age for individual stars. the innergalaxy is dominated by an old population (&gt; 7 gyr). in addition, anintermediate-age population (200 myr to 7 gyr) is detected, which is consistentwith the presence of a few hundred asymptotic giant branch stars with heavymass loss. furthermore, young stars (&lt; 200 myr) are found across the innerbulge. the metallicities of these stellar population components are discussed.these results can be interpreted in terms of an early epoch of intense starformation and chemical enrichment which shaped the bulk of the bulge andnucleus, and a more continuous star formation history which gradually shapedthe disk from the accretion of sub-solar metallicity gas from the halo. apossible increase in star formation about 200 myr ago might have been triggeredby a minor merger. ever since the formation of the first stars, mechanisms havebeen at play that mix the populations from the nucleus, bulge and disk.luminosity functions across the inner galactic plane indicate the presence ofan inclined (bar) structure at &gt; 1 kpc from the galactic centre, near the innerlindblad resonance. the innermost part of the bulge, within about 1 kpc fromthe galactic centre, seems azimuthally symmetric.

astro-ph;0302246	obscured asymptotic giant branch variables in the large magellanic cloud  and the period-luminosity relation	the characteristics of oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, large amplitude (dk&gt;0.4mag), asymptotic giant branch variables in the large magellanic clouds arediscussed, with an emphasis on those obscured by dust. near-infraredphotometry, obtained over about 8 years, is combined with publishedmid-infrared observations from iras and iso to determine bolometric magnitudesfor 42 stars. pulsation periods of the o-rich stars are in the range 116&lt;p&lt;1393days, while those for c-rich stars have 298&lt;p&lt;939 days. in addition to theregular pulsations, one o-rich star and four c-rich stars show large amplitude,dk&gt; 0.6 mag, secular or very long period variations which may be associatedwith changes in their mass-loss rates. we discuss and compare various methodsof determining the bolometric magnitudes and show, perhaps surprisingly, thatmost of the very long period stars seem to follow an extrapolation of theperiod-luminosity relation determined for stars with shorter periods - althoughthe details do depend on how the bolometric magnitudes are calculated. threestars with thin shells, which are clearly more luminous than the obscured agbstars, are undergoing hot bottom burning, while other stars with similarluminosities have yet to be investigated in sufficient detail to determinetheir status in this regard. we suggest that an apparent change in slope of theperiod luminosity relation around 400-420 days is caused by variables withluminosities brighter than the predictions of the core-mass luminosityrelation, due to excess flux from hot bottom burning.

astro-ph;0402078	mid-infrared observations of young stellar objects in the vicinity of  sigma orionis	we present new mid-infrared observations of objects in the vicinity of theo-star sigma orionis, obtained with timmi-2 at eso. by constraining their near-and mid-infrared spectral energy distributions, we established the nature ofpreviously known iras sources and identified new mid-infrared sources as youngstellar objects with circumstellar disks, likely massive members of the sigmaori cluster. for two of these objects we have obtained spectroscopy in the 8-13micron range in order to investigate the chemistry of the dust grains. tx oriexhibits a typical silicate emission feature at 10 micron, with a feature atabout 11.2 micron that we identify as due to crystalline olivine. the iras05358-0238 spectrum is very unusual, with a weak silicate feature and structurein the range 10-12 micron that may be explained as due to self-absorbedforsterite. we also provide the first evidence for the presence ofcircumstellar disks in the jet sources haro 5-39/hh 447, v510 ori/hh 444 andv603 ori/hh 445.

astro-ph;0410120	the agb superwind speed at low metallicity	we present the results of a survey for oh maser emission at 1612 mhz fromdust-enshrouded agb stars and supergiants in the lmc and smc, with the parkesradio telescope, aimed at deriving the speed of the superwind from thedouble-peaked oh maser profiles. out of 8 targets in the lmc we detected 5, ofwhich 3 are new detections - no maser emission was detected in the two smctargets. we detected for the first time the redshifted components of the ohmaser profile in the extreme red supergiant iras 04553-6825, confirming thesuspicion that its wind speed had been severely underestimated. despite a muchimproved spectrum for iras 04407-7000, which was known to exhibit asingle-peaked oh maser, no complementary peak could be detected. the newdetection in iras 05003-6712 was also single-peaked, but for two other newdetections, iras 04498-6842 and iras 05558-7000, wind speeds could bedetermined from their double-peaked maser profiles. the complete sample ofknown oh/ir stars in the lmc is compared with a sample of oh/ir stars in thegalactic centre. the lmc sources generally show a pronounced asymmetry betweenthe bright blueshifted maser emission and weaker redshifted emission, which weattribute to the greater contribution of amplification of radiation comingdirectly from the star itself as the lmc sources are both more luminous andless dusty than their galactic centre counterparts. we confirm that the ohmaser strength is a measure of the dust (rather than gas) mass-loss rate. at agiven luminosity or pulsation period, the wind speed in lmc sources is lowerthan in galactic centre sources, and the observed trends confirm simpleradiation-driven wind theory if the dust-to-gas ratio is approximatelyproportional to the metallicity.

astro-ph;0507571	dust-enshrouded giants in clusters in the magellanic clouds	we present the results of an investigation of post-main sequence mass lossfrom stars in clusters in the magellanic clouds, based around an imaging surveyin the l'-band (3.8 micron) performed with the vlt at eso. the data arecomplemented with jhks and mid-ir photometry. the goal is to determine theinfluence of initial metallicity and initial mass on the mass loss andevolution during the latest stages of stellar evolution. dust-enshrouded giantsare identified by their reddened near-ir colours and thermal-ir dust excessemission. most of these objects are asymptotic giant branch (agb) carbon starsin intermediate-age clusters, with progenitor masses between 1.3 and about 5msun. red supergiants with circumstellar dust envelopes are found in youngclusters, and have progenitor masses between 13 and 20 msun. post-agb objects(e.g., planetary nebulae) and massive stars with detached envelopes and/or hotcentral stars are found in several clusters. we model the spectral energydistributions of the cluster ir objects to estimate their bolometricluminosities and mass-loss rates. the ir objects are the most luminous clusterobjects, and have luminosities as expected for their initial mass andmetallicity. they experience mass-loss rates in the range from a few 1e-6 up to1e-4 msun/yr (or more), with most of the spread being due to evolutionaryeffects and only a weak dependence on progenitor mass and/or initialmetallicity. about half of the mass lost by 1.3--3 msun stars is shed duringthe superwind phase, which lasts of order 1e5 yr. objects with detached shellsare found to have experienced the highest mass-loss rates, and are thereforeinterpreted as post-superwind objects. we also propose a simple method tomeasure the cluster mass from l'-band images.

astro-ph;0602531	a spitzer mid-infrared spectral survey of mass-losing carbon stars in  the large magellanic cloud	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic survey of mass-losingcarbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the large magellanic cloud. thespectra cover the wavelength range 5--38 micron. they show varying combinationsof dust continuum, dust emission features (sic, mgs) and molecular absorptionbands (c2h2, hcn). a set of four narrow bands, dubbed the manchester system, isused to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. the relationsbetween the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecularfeatures are studied, and are compared to galactic stars of similar colours.the circumstellar 7-micron c2h2 band is found to be stronger at lowermetallicity, from a comparison of stars in the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.this is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher c/o ratios at lowmetallicity (less o). a possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in ourspectra may be due to c3. this band has also been identified with interstellarsilicate or silicon-nitrite dust. the line-to-continuum ratio of thesic and mgsbands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. the mgs band isonly seen at dust temperatures below 600 k. we discuss the selection of carbonversus oxygen-rich agb stars using the j-k vs. k-a colours, and show that thesecolours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. metal-poor carbon starsform amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. the formation efficiencyof oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity. we suggest that inlower-metallicity environments, the dust input into the interstellar medium byagb stars is efficient but may be strongly biassed towards carbonaceous dust,as compare to the galaxy.

astro-ph;0609230	iso mid-infrared spectroscopy of galactic bulge agb stars	to study the nature of bulge agb stars and in particular their circumstellardust, we have analysed mid-infrared spectra obtained with the isocam cvfspectrometer in three bulge fields. the isocam 5-16.5 micron cvf spectra wereobtained as part of the isogal infrared survey of the inner galaxy. aclassification of the shape of the 10 micron dust feature was made for eachcase. the spectra of the individual sources were modelled using a radiativetransfer model. different combinations of amorphous silicates andaluminium-oxide dust were used in the modelling. spectra were obtained for 29sources of which 26 are likely to be bulge agb stars. our modelling shows thatthe stars suffer mass loss rates in the range of 10^{-8} - 5 x 10^{-7} msun /yr, which is at the low end of the mass-loss rates experienced on the thermallypulsing agb. the luminosities range from 1,700 to 7,700 lsun as expected for apopulation of agb stars with minit of 1.5 - 2msun. in agreement with thecondensation sequence scenario, we find that the dust content is dominated byal_2o_3 grains in this sample of low mass-loss rate stars.

astro-ph;0611071	spitzer spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we present spitzer space telescope spectroscopic observations of 14carbon-rich agb stars in the small magellanic cloud. sic dust is seen in mostof the carbon-rich stars but it is weak compared to lmc stars. the sic featureis strong only for stars with significant dust excess, opposite to what isobserved for galactic stars. we argue that in the smc, sic forms at lowertemperature than graphite dust, whereas the reverse situation occurs in thegalaxy where sic condenses at higher temperatures and forms first. dust inputinto the interstellar medium by agb stars consists mostly of carbonaceous dust,with little sic or silicate dust. only the two coolest stars show a 30-micronband due to mgs dust. we suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the smc,mass-losing agb stars generally have low circumstellar (dust) optical depth andtherefore effective heating of dust by the central star does not allowtemperatures below the 650 k necessary for mgs to exist as a solid. gas phasec$_2$h$_2$ bands are stronger in the smc than in the lmc or galaxy. this isattributed to an increasing c/o ratio at low metallicity. we present acolour-colour diagram based on spitzer irac and mips colours to discriminatebetween o- and c-rich stars. we show that agb stars in the smc become carbonstars early in the thermal-pulsing agb evolution, and remain optically visiblefor $\sim 6 \times 10^5$ yr. for the lmc, this lifetime is $\sim 3 \times 10^5$yr. the superwind phase traced with spitzer lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr. spitzerspectra of a k supergiant and a compact hii region are also given.

astro-ph;9601041	discovery of the first extra-galactic sio maser	we report on the detection of sio j=2--1 v=1 (86 ghz) maser emission from thered supergiant iras04553--6825 in the lmc. it has thereby become the firstknown source of sio maser emission outside the milky way. we used theswedish-eso submm telescope at the european southern observatory at la silla.with the help of good atmospheric conditions, the excellent performance of thebrand new 3~mm sis receiver, and 26 hours total observing time we reduced thenoise level to only 63~mjy rms. this allowed us to detect the 0.28~jy maserpeak. integrating the flux of the maser profile resulted in a 6.9~${\sigma}$detection. the sio maser peak was situated 16~km~s$^{-1}$ redward of the centerof the already known, double peaked oh maser emission. we argue that the siomaser peak velocity coincides with the stellar velocity, which is supported bya spectrum of h$\alpha$ that we took four months later. this would mean thatthe outflow velocity of the circumstellar matter around iras04553--6825 isv$_{\rm exp} \sim 26$~km~s$^{-1}$, which is typical for galactic redsupergiants, instead of the abnormally low 11~km~s$^{-1}$ inferred from the ohdata alone. the peak intensity of the sio maser emission is not incompatiblewith ranges found in galactic rsgs, but the total integrated photon flux islower than expected for this extremely red and luminous supergiant.

astro-ph;9704201	obscured asymptotic giant branch stars in the magellanic clouds iii. new  iras counterparts	we have searched for near-infrared stellar counterparts of iras point sourcesin the large magellanic cloud (lmc), in j and k-bands. this resulted in thedetection of 21 counterparts, of which 19 are new discoveries. usingcolour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams, we identify 13 asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars with thick circumstellar dust envelopes, 7 possible earlypost-agb stars or stars recovering from a thermal pulse, and 1 red supergiantor foreground star. for 10 of the iras targets we do not succeed in detectingand/or identifying a near-infrared counterpart. we serendipitously detect 14other red sources, of which 2 are known long period variables, and a fewgalaxies. the near-infrared and optical colours of the galaxies may indicateconsiderable interstellar extinction through the lmc, as much as a_v about 2-4mag. the relative number of agb carbon stars over oxygen stars is shown todecrease as the luminosity increases. yet amongst the faintest mass-losing agbstars oxygen-rich stars still exist, which puts constraints on currentconvection theories that predict the occurrence of third dredge-up and hotbottom burning. we investigate the nature of some lmc stars that have infraredproperties very similar to suspected galactic post-agb stars.

astro-ph;9709119	obscured asymptotic giant branch stars in the magellanic clouds iv.  carbon stars and oh/ir stars	we present n-band photometry for a sample of 21 dust- enshrouded agb stars inthe large magellanic cloud, and three additional sources in the smallmagellanic cloud. together with near-ir photometry, this is used to give atentative classification into carbon and oxygen-rich atmospheres. bolometricluminosities are also estimated for these stars. in addition, we present theresults of a survey for oh masers in the lmc, which resulted in the discoveryof oh maser emission from iras04407-7000. spectra between 600 and 1000 nm havebeen obtained for two heavily obscured agb stars in the lmc, confirming them tobe highly reddened very late m-type giants. because the dust-enshrouded starsare clearly undergoing heavy mass loss they are assumed to be very near thetermination of their respective asymptotic giant branch phases. the fraction ofmass-losing carbon stars decreases with increasing luminosity, as expected fromhot bottom burning. the best candidate carbon star, with m_bol = -6.8 mag, isthe most luminous mass-losing carbon star in the magellanic clouds, and amongstthe most luminous agb stars. at lower luminosities (m_bol = -5 mag) both oxygenand carbon stars are found. this may be explained by a range in metallicity ofthe individual mass-losing agb stars.

astro-ph;9902284	luminous carbon stars in the magellanic clouds	we present ground-based 3 micron spectra of obscured asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars in the magellanic clouds (mcs). we identify the carbon stars on thebasis of the 3.1 micron absorption by hcn and c2h2 molecules.  we show evidence for the existence of carbon stars up to the highest agbluminosities (mbol=-7 mag, for a distance modulus to the lmc of 18.7 mag). thisproves that hot bottom burning (hbb) cannot, in itself, prevent massive agbstars from becoming carbon star before leaving the agb. it also sets an upperlimit to the distance modulus of the large magellanic cloud of 18.8 mag.  the equivalent width of the absorption band decreases with redder (k-l)colour when the dust continuum emission becomes stronger than the photosphericemission. carbon stars with similar (k-l) appear to have equally strong 3micron absorption in the mcs and the milky way. we discuss the implications forthe carbon and nitrogen enrichment of the stellar photosphere of carbon stars.

astro-ph;9909416	mass-loss rates and luminosity functions of dust-enshrouded agb stars  and red supergiants in the lmc	a radiative transfer code is used to model the spectral energy distributionsof 57 mass-losing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and red supergiants(rsgs) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) for which iso spectroscopic andphotometric data are available. as a result we derive mass-loss rates andbolometric luminosities.  a gap in the luminosity distribution around m_bol = -7.5 mag separates agbstars from rsgs. the luminosity distributions of optically bright carbon stars,dust-enshrouded carbon stars and dust-enshrouded m-type stars have only littleoverlap, suggesting that the dust-enshrouded agb stars are at the very tip ofthe agb and will not evolve significantly in luminosity before mass loss endstheir agb evolution.  derived mass-loss rates span a range from mdot about 10^-7 to 10^-3 m_sun/yr.more luminous and cooler stars are found to reach higher mass-loss rates. thehighest mass-loss rates exceed the classical limit set by the momentum of thestellar radiation field, l/c, by a factor of a few due to multiple scatteringof photons in the circumstellar dust envelope. mass-loss rates are lower thanthe mass consumption rate by nuclear burning, mdot_nuc, for most of the rsgs.two rsgs have mdot &gt;&gt; mdot_nuc, however, suggesting that rsgs shed most oftheir stellar mantles in short phases of intense mass loss. stars on thethermal pulsing agb may also experience episodes of intensified mass loss, buttheir quiescent mass-loss rates are usually already higher than mdot_nuc.

0812.0326	giants in the globular cluster omega centauri: dust production, mass  loss and distance	we present spectral energy distribution modelling of 6875 stars in omegacentauri, obtaining stellar luminosities and temperatures by fitting literaturephotometry to state-of-the-art marcs stellar models. by comparison to fourdifferent sets of isochrones, we provide a new distance estimate to the clusterof 4850 +/- 200 (random) +/- 120 (systematic error) pc, a reddening of e(b-v) =0.08 +/- 0.02 +/- 0.02 mag and a differential reddening of delta[e(b-v)] &lt; 0.02mag for an age of 12 gyr. several new post-early-agb candidates are also found.infra-red excesses of stars were used to measure total mass-loss rates forindividual stars down to ~7 x 10^-8 msun/yr. we find a total dust mass-lossrate from the cluster of 1.3 (+0.8/-0.5) x 10^-9 msun/yr, with the total gasmass-loss rate being &gt; 1.2 (+0.6/-0.5) x 10^-6 msun/yr. half of the cluster'sdust production and 30% of its gas production comes from the two most extremestars - v6 and v42 - for which we present new gemini/t-recs mid-infraredspectroscopy, possibly showing that v42 has carbon-rich dust. the cluster'sdust temperatures are found to be typically &gt;~550 k. mass loss apparently doesnot vary significantly with metallicity within the cluster, but shows somecorrelation with barium enhancement, which appears to occur in cooler stars,and especially on the anomalous rgb. limits to outflow velocities, dust-to-gasratios for the dusty objects and the possibility of short-timescale mass-lossvariability are also discussed in the context of mass loss from low-metallicitystars. the ubiquity of dust around stars near the rgb-tip suggests significantdusty mass loss on the rgb; we estimate that typically 0.20--0.25 msun of massloss occurs on the rgb. from observational limits on intra-cluster material, wesuggest the dust is being cleared on a timescale of &lt;~10^5 years.
