0901.0919	a multi-parameter investigation of gravitational slip	a detailed analysis of gravitational slip, a new post-general relativitycosmological parameter characterizing the degree of departure of the laws ofgravitation from general relativity on cosmological scales, is presented. thisphenomenological approach assumes that cosmic acceleration is due to newgravitational effects; the amount of spacetime curvature produced per unit massis changed in such a way that a universe containing only matter and radiationbegins to accelerate as if under the influence of a cosmological constant.changes in the law of gravitation are further manifest in the behavior of theinhomogeneous gravitational field, as reflected in the cosmic microwavebackground, weak lensing, and evolution of large-scale structure. the newparameter, $\varpi_0$, is naively expected to be of order unity. however, amultiparameter analysis, allowing for variation of all the standardcosmological parameters, finds that $\varpi_0 = 0.09^{+0.74}_{-0.59} (2\sigma)$where $\varpi_0=0$ corresponds to a $\lambda$cdm universe under generalrelativity. future probes of the cosmic microwave background (planck) andlarge-scale structure (euclid) may improve the limits by a factor of four.

0903.5331	eso 381-47, an early-type galaxy with extended hi and a star forming  ring	eso 381-47 is an early type galaxy with an extended hi disk. galex and verydeep optical images reveal a distinct stellar ring far outside the optical bodywith a diameter of ~30 kpc, which has undergone recent star formation at 1.8 x10^-4 msun/yr/kpc^-2, consistent with other new results which detect low levelstar formation below the traditional kennicutt relation in the outer parts ofspiral galaxies. the morphology of this galaxy resembles the recentlyidentified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, orxuv-disks. new hi observations of this galaxy taken at the atca and in the cnbarray at the vla show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~90 kpc)ring around the central s0 galaxy. the hi data cube can be well modeled by awarped ring. the faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy iskinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibitvelocities consistent with the rotation of the hi ring at larger radius. thepeak of the stellar ring, as seen in the optical and uv, is slightly displacedto the inside relative to the peak of the hi ring. we discuss the manner inwhich this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wavethrough an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision atthe center of the disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up atearly times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. gas accretion andresonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered toexplain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the galex and deepoptical data.

0907.4051	a measurement of primordial non-gaussianity using wmap 5-year  temperature skewness power spectrum	we constrain the primordial non-gaussianity parameter of the local modelf_{nl} using the skewness power spectrum associated with the two-to-onecumulant correlator of cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies.this bispectrum-related power spectrum was constructed after weighting thetemperature map with the appropriate window functions to form an estimator thatprobes the multipolar dependence of the underlying bispectrum associated withthe primordial non-gaussianity. we also estimate a separate skewness powerspectrum sensitive more strongly to unresolved point sources. when compared toprevious attempts at measuring the primordial non-gaussianity with wmap data,our estimators have the main advantage that we do not collapse information to asingle number. when model fitting the two-to-one skewness power spectrum wemake use of bispectra generated by the primordial non-gaussianity, radio pointsources, and lensing-secondary correlation. we analyze q, v and w-band wmap5-year data using the kq75 mask out to l_{max}=600. using v and w-band data andmarginalizing over model parameters related to point sources andlensing-secondary bispectrum, our overall and preferred constraint on f_{nl} is11.0\pm23.7 at the 68% confidence level (-36.4 &lt; f_{nl} &lt; 58.4 at 95%confidence). we find no evidence for a non-zero value of f_{nl} even marginallyat the 1\sigma level.

0909.1837	non-gaussianity in wmap data due to the correlation of cmb lensing  potential with secondary anisotropies	we measure the skewness power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) anisotropies optimized for a detection of the secondary bispectrumgenerated by the correlation of the cmb lensing potential with integratedsachs-wolfe effect and the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. the covariance of ourmeasurements is generated by monte-carlo simulations of gaussian cmb fieldswith noise properties consistent with wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap) 5-year data. when interpreting multi-frequency measurements we also takeinto account the confusion resulting from unresolved radio point sources. weanalyze q, v and w-band wmap 5-year raw and foreground-cleaned maps using thekq75 mask out to l_max=600. we find no significant evidence for a non-zeronon-gaussian signal from the lensing-secondary correlation in all three bandsand we constrain the overall amplitude of the cross power spectrum between cmblensing potential and the sum of sz and isw fluctuations to be 0.42 \pm 0.86and 1.19 \pm 0.86 in combined v and w-band raw and foreground-cleaned mapsprovided by the wmap team, respectively. the point source amplitude at thebispectrum level measured with this skewness power spectrum is higher thanprevious measurements of point source non-gaussianity. we also consider ananalysis where we also account for the primordial non-gaussianity in additionto lensing-secondary bispectrum and point sources. the focus of this paper ison secondary anisotropies. consequently the estimator is not optimised forprimordial non-gaussianity and the limit we find on local non-gaussianity fromthe foreground-cleaned v+w maps is f_nl = -13 \pm 62, when marginalized overpoint sources and lensing-isw/sz constributions to the total bispectrum.

0910.2416	cold gas and young stars in tidally-disturbed ellipticals at z=0	we present an analysis of the neutral hydrogen and stellar populations ofelliptical galaxies in the tal et al. (2009) sample. our aim is to test theirconclusion that the continuing assembly of these galaxies at z~0 is essentiallygas-free and not accompanied by significant star formation. in order to do so,we make use of hi data and line-strength indices available in the literature.we look for direct and indirect evidence of the presence of cold gas during therecent assembly of these objects and analyse its relation to galaxymorphological fine structure.  we find that &gt;25% of ellipticals contain hi at the level of m(hi)&gt;10^8m(sun), and that m(hi) is of the order of a few percent of the total stellarmass. available data are insufficient to establish whether galaxies with adisturbed stellar morphology are more likely to contain hi. however, hiinterferometry reveals very disturbed gas morphology/kinematics in all but oneof the detected systems, confirming the continuing assembly of many ellipticalsbut also showing that this is not necessarily gas-free. we also find that allvery disturbed ellipticals have a single-stellar-population-equivalent age &lt;4gyr. we interpret this as evidence that ~0.5-5% of their stellar mass iscontained in a young population formed during the past ~1 gyr. overall, a largefraction of ellipticals seem to have continued their assembly over the past fewgyr in the presence of a mass of cold gas of the order of 10% of the galaxystellar mass. this material is now observable as neutral hydrogen and youngstars.

0910.3693	new optimised estimators for the primordial trispectrum	cosmic microwave background studies of non-gaussianity involving higher-ordermultispectra can distinguish between early universe theories that predictnearly identical power spectra. however, the recovery of higher-ordermultispectra is difficult from realistic data due to their complex response toinhomogeneous noise and partial sky coverage, which are often difficult tomodel analytically. a traditional alternative is to use one-point cumulants ofvarious orders, which collapse the information present in a multispectrum toone number. the disadvantage of such a radical compression of the data is aloss of information as to the source of the statistical behaviour. a recentstudy by munshi &amp; heavens (2009) has shown how to define the skew spectrum (thepower spectra of a certain cubic field, related to the bispectrum) in anoptimal way and how to estimate it from realistic data. the skew spectrumretains some of the information from the full configuration-dependence of thebispectrum, and can contain all the information on non-gaussianity. in thepresent study, we extend the results of the skew spectrum to the case of twodegenerate power-spectra related to the trispectrum. we also explore therelationship of these power-spectra and cumulant correlators previously used tostudy non-gaussianity in projected galaxy surveys or weak lensing surveys. weconstruct nearly optimal estimators for quick tests and generalise them toestimators which can handle realistic data with all their complexity in acompletely optimal manner. we show how these higher-order statistics and therelated power spectra are related to the taylor expansion coefficients of thepotential in inflation models, and demonstrate how the trispectrum canconstrain both the quadratic and cubic terms.

1005.4208	a collisional origin for the leo ring	extended hi structures around galaxies are of prime importance to probegalaxy formation scenarios. the giant hi ring in the leo group is one of thelargest and most intriguing hi structures in the nearby universe. whether itconsists of primordial gas, as suggested by the apparent absence of any opticalcounterpart and the absence of an obvious physical connection to nearbygalaxies, or of gas expelled from a galaxy in a collision is actively debated.we present deep wide field-of-view optical images of the ring region obtainedwith megacam on the cfht. they reveal optical counterparts to several hi and uvcondensations along the ring, in the g', r', and i' bands, which likelycorrespond to stellar associations formed within the gaseous ring. analyzingthe spectral energy distribution of one of these star-forming regions, we foundit to be typical for a star-forming region in pre-enriched tidal debris. wethen use simulations to test the hypothesis that the leo ring results from ahead-on collision between leo group members ngc 3384 and m96. according to ourmodel which is able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main observationalproperties of the system, the leo ring is consistent with being a collisionalring. it is thus likely another example of extended intergalactic gas made-upof pre-enriched collisional debris.

1012.1600	a constraint on the integrated mass power spectrum out to z = 1100 from  lensing of the cosmic microwave background	the temperature fluctuations and polarization of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) are now a well-known probe of the universe at an infant age of400,000 years. during the transit to us from the surface of last scattering,the cmb photons are expected to undergo modifications induced by theintervening large-scale structure. among the expected secondary effects is theweak gravitational lensing of the cmb by the foreground dark matterdistribution. we derive a quadratic estimator that uses the non-gaussianitiesgenerated by the lensing effect at the four-point function level to extract thepower spectrum of lensing potential fluctuations integrated out to z ~ 1100with peak contributions from potential fluctuations at z of 2 to 3. using wmap7-year temperature maps, we report the first direct constraints of this lensingpotential power spectrum and find that it has an amplitude of a_l = 0.96 +/-0.60, 1.06 +/- 0.69 and 0.97 +/- 0.47 using the w, v and w+v bands,respectively.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1107.0002	the atlas3d project - x. on the origin of the molecular and ionised gas  in early-type galaxies	we make use of interferometric co and hi observations, and opticalintegral-field spectroscopy to probe the origin of the molecular and ionisedinterstellar medium (ism) in local early-type galaxies (etgs). we find that36\pm5% of our sample of fast rotating etgs have their ionised gaskinematically misaligned with respect to the stars, setting a strong lowerlimit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and coldaccretion). slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicatingthat the dominant source of gas is external. the molecular, ionised and atomicgas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even whenthey are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases ofthe ism share a common origin. in addition, we find that the origin of the coldand warm gas in fast-rotating etgs is strongly affected by environment, despitethe molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent ofgroup/cluster membership. galaxies in dense groups and the virgo cluster nearlyalways have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellarkinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin. in the field, however,kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicatethat &gt;46% of local fast-rotating etgs have their gas supplied from externalsources. we discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmentaldichotomy, but find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematicmisalignment difference and the constant detection rate. furthermore, ourresults suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factorassociated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotatinggalaxies in our sample (m_k&lt;-24 mag; stellar mass of &gt;8x10^10 msun) alwayshaving kinematically aligned gas.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1112.3093	basic testing of the duchamp source finder	this paper presents and discusses the results of basic source finding testsin three dimensions (using spectroscopic data cubes) with duchamp, the standardsource finder for the australian ska pathfinder. for this purpose, we generateddifferent sets of unresolved and extended hi model sources. these models werethen fed into duchamp, using a range of different parameters and methodsprovided by the software. the main aim of the tests was to study theperformance of duchamp on sources with different parameters and morphologiesand assess the accuracy of duchamp's source parametrisation. overall, we findduchamp to be a powerful source finder capable of reliably detecting sourcesdown to low signal-to-noise ratios and accurately measuring their position andvelocity. in the presence of noise in the data, duchamp's measurements of basicsource parameters, such as spectral line width and integrated flux, areaffected by systematic errors. these errors are a consequence of the effect ofnoise on the specific algorithms used by duchamp for measuring sourceparameters in combination with the fact that the software only takes intoaccount pixels above a given flux threshold and hence misses part of the flux.in scientific applications of duchamp these systematic errors would have to becorrected for. alternatively, duchamp could be used as a source finder only,and source parametrisation could be done in a second step using moresophisticated parametrisation algorithms.

1201.0885	simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the link with fast rotators,  slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies (etgs) through mergers with asample of 70 high-resolution numerical simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies. these simulations encompass various mass ratios, initial conditionsand orbital parameters. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with massratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators accordingto the atlas3d criterion: they preserve the structure of the input fastrotating spiral progenitors. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1)lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the slow rotators hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. the mass ratio of theprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators inbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitorgalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. the importance of theinitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxymergers of the galmer project.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1203.5803	asymmetric dark matter and dark radiation	asymmetric dark matter (adm) models invoke a particle-antiparticle asymmetry,similar to the one observed in the baryon sector, to account for the darkmatter (dm) abundance. both asymmetries are usually generated by the samemechanism and generally related, thus predicting dm masses around 5 gev inorder to obtain the correct density. the main challenge for successful modelsis to ensure efficient annihilation of the thermally produced symmetriccomponent of such a light dm candidate without violating constraints fromcollider or direct searches. a common way to overcome this involves a lightmediator, into which dm can efficiently annihilate and which subsequentlydecays into standard model particles. here we explore the scenario where thelight mediator decays instead into lighter degrees of freedom in the darksector that act as radiation in the early universe. while this assumption makesindirect dm searches challenging, it leads to signals of extra radiation at bbnand cmb. under certain conditions, precise measurements of the number ofrelativistic species, such as those expected from the planck satellite, canprovide information on the structure of the dark sector. we also discuss theconstraints of the interactions between dm and dark radiation from theirimprint in the matter power spectrum.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1303.3538	the bluedisks project, a study of unusually hi-rich galaxies: i. hi  sizes and morphology	we introduce the "bluedisk" project, a large program at the westerborksynthesis radio telescope (wsrt) that has mapped the hi in a sample of 23nearby galaxies with unusually high hi mass fractions, along with asimilar-sized sample of control galaxies matched in stellar mass, size,inclination and redshift. this paper presents the sample selection,observational set-up, data reduction strategy, and a first analysis of thesizes and structural properties of the hi disks. we find that the hi-richgalaxies lie on the same hi mass versus hi size relation as normal spiralgalaxies, extending it to total hi masses of $2 \times 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ andradii r1 of $\sim 100$ kpc (where r1 is defined as the radius where the hicolumn density reaches 1 $m_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). hi-rich galaxies havesignificantly larger values of hi-to-optical size ratio at fixed stellar mass,concentration index, stellar and star formation rate surface density comparedto the control sample. the disks of hi-rich galaxies are also significantlymore clumpy (i.e. have higher hi gini and $\delta$area coefficient) than thoseof normal spirals. there is no evidence that the disks of hi-rich galaxies aremore disturbed: hi-rich galaxies exhibit no difference with respect to controlsamples in their distributions of hi asymmetry indices or optical/hi diskposition angle differences. in fact, the center of the hi distributioncorresponds more closely with the center of the optical light in the hi-richgalaxies than in the controls. all these results argue against a scenario inwhich new gas has been brought in by mergers. it is possible that they may bemore consistent with cooling from a surrounding quasi-static halo of warm/hotgas.

1305.4973	the atlas3d project -- xxiii. angular momentum and nuclear surface  brightness profiles	[abridged and edited] we investigate nuclear light profiles in 135 atlas3dgalaxies for which the hubble space telescope (hst) imaging is available andcompare them to the large scale kinematics obtained with the sauronintegral-field spectrograph. specific angular momentum, lambda_r, correlateswith the shape of nuclear light profiles, where cores are typically found inslow rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. cores are found only inmassive galaxies and only in systems with the stellar mass m&gt;8x10^10 msun.based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal distribution ofnuclear slopes. the best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellarvelocity dispersion within an effective radius, sigma_e, and specific angularmomentum, where cores are found for lambda_r&lt;0.25 and sigma_e&gt;160 km/s. weestimate that only about 10% of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores.furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators withcores. we also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematicallyand dynamically different from core slow rotators. the cores of fast rotatorscould harbour black holes of similar masses to those in core slow rotators, buttypically more massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. core-lessgalaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are under-luminous in thediffuse x-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high x-rayluminosities. we postulate a possible population of core-less galaxies amongslow rotators, which can not be explained as face-on discs, but comprise agenuine sub-population of slow rotators. these galaxies are typically lessmassive and flatter than core slow rotators, and show evidence for dynamicalcold structures and exponential photometric components. we discuss possibleprocesses for formation of cores and their subsequent preservation.

1311.6469	ngc1266 as a local candidate for rapid cessation of star formation	we present new spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae(sauron) integral-field spectroscopy and swift ultraviolet optical telescope(uvot) observations of molecular outflow host galaxy ngc 1266 that indicate ngc1266 has experienced a rapid cessation of star formation. both the sauron mapsof stellar population age and the swift uvot observations demonstrate thepresence of young ($&lt; 1$ gyr) stellar populations within the central 1 kpc,while existing combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma)co(1--0) maps indicate that the sites of current star formation are constrainedto the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy only. the optical spectrum ofngc 1266 from moustakas &amp; kennicutt (2006) reveal a characteristicpost-starburst (k+a) stellar population and davis et al. (2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1401.3180	the atlas3d project - xxvi. hi discs in real and simulated fast and slow  rotators	one quarter of all nearby early-type galaxies (etgs) outside virgo host adisc/ring of hi with size from a few to tens of kpc and mass up to ~1e+9 solarmasses. here we investigate whether this hi is related to the presence of astellar disc within the host making use of the classification of etgs in fastand slow rotators (fr/sr). we find a large diversity of hi masses andmorphologies within both families. surprisingly, srs are detected as often,host as much hi and have a similar rate of hi discs/rings as frs. accretion ofhi is therefore not always linked to the growth of an inner stellar disc. theweak relation between hi and stellar disc is confirmed by their frequentkinematical misalignment in frs, including cases of polar and counterrotatinggas. in srs the hi is usually polar. this complex picture highlights adiversity of etg formation histories which may be lost in the relativesimplicity of their inner structure and emerges when studying their outerregions.  we find that lcdm hydrodynamical simulations have difficulties reproducingthe hi properties of etgs. the gas discs formed in simulations are either toomassive or too small depending on the star formation feedback implementation.kinematical misalignments match the observations only qualitatively. the mainpoint of conflict is that nearly all simulated frs and a large fraction of allsimulated srs host corotating hi. this establishes the hi properties of etgs asa novel challenge to simulations.

1401.8164	an observational and theoretical view of the radial distribution of hi  gas in galaxies	we analyze the radial distribution of hi gas for 23 disk galaxies withunusually high hi content from the bluedisk sample, along with a similar-sizedsample of "normal" galaxies. we propose an empirical model to fit the radialprofile of the hi surface density, an exponential function with a depressionnear the center. the radial hi surface density profiles are very homogeneous inthe outer regions of the galaxy; the exponentially declining part of theprofile has a scale-length of $\sim 0.18$ r1, where r1 is the radius where thecolumn density of the hi is 1 m$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. this holds for allgalaxies, independent of their stellar or hi mass. the homogenous outerprofiles, combined with the limited range in hi surface density in thenon-exponential inner disk, results in the well-known tight relation between hisize and hi mass. by comparing the radial profiles of the hi-rich galaxies withthose of the control systems, we deduce that in about half the galaxies, mostof the excess gas lies outside the stellar disk, in the exponentially decliningouter regions of the hi disk. in the other half, the excess is more centrallypeaked. we compare our results with existing smoothed-particle hydrodynamicalsimulations and semi-analytic models of disk galaxy formation in a $\lambda$cold dark matter universe. both the hydro simulations and the semi-analyticmodels reproduce the hi surface density profiles and the hi size-mass relationwithout further tuning of the simulation and model inputs. in the semi-analyticmodels, the universal shape of the outer hi radial profiles is a consequence ofthe {\em assumption} that infalling gas is always distributed exponentially.the conversion of atomic gas to molecular form explains the limited range of hisurface densities in the inner disk. these two factors produce the tight himass-size relation.

1403.0626	identification of old tidal dwarfs near early-type galaxies from deep  imaging and hi observations	it has recently been proposed that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies located inthe local group disks of satellites (doss) may be tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs)born in a major merger at least 5 gyr ago. whether tdgs can live that long isstill poorly constrained by observations. as part of deep optical and hisurveys with the cfht megacam camera and westerbork synthesis radio telescopemade within the atlas3d project, and follow-up spectroscopic observations withthe gemini-north telescope, we have discovered old tdg candidates aroundseveral early-type galaxies. at least one of them has an oxygen abundance closeto solar, as expected for a tidal origin. this confirmed pre-enriched object islocated within the gigantic, but very low surface brightness, tidal tail thatemanates from the elliptical galaxy, ngc 5557. an age of 4 gyr estimated fromits sed fitting makes it the oldest securely identified tdg ever found so far.we investigated the structural and gaseous properties of the tdg and of acompanion located in the same collisional debris, and thus most likely of tidalorigin as well. despite several gyr of evolution close to their parentgalaxies, they kept a large gas reservoir. their central surface brightness islow and their effective radius much larger than that of typical dwarf galaxiesof the same mass. this possibly provides us with criteria to identify tidalobjects which can be more easily checked than the traditional ones requiringdeep spectroscopic observations. in view of the above, we discuss the survivaltime of tdgs and question the tidal origin of the doss.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

0803.4194	weak lensing of the primary cmb bispectrum	the cosmic microwave background (cmb) bispectrum is a well-known probe of thenon-gaussianity of primordial perturbations. just as the interveninglarge-scale structure modifies the cmb angular power spectrum through weakgravitational lensing, the cmb primary bispectrum generated at the lastscattering surface is also modified by lensing. we discuss the lensingmodification to the cmb bispectrum and show that lensing leads to an overalldecrease in the amplitude of the primary bispectrum at multipoles of interestbetween 100 and 2000 through additional smoothing introduced by lensing. sinceweak lensing is not accounted for in current estimators of the primordialnon-gaussianity parameter, the existing measurements of $f_{\rm nl}$ of thelocal model with wmap out to $l_{\rm max} \sim 750$ is biased low by about 6%.for a high resolution experiment such as planck, the lensing modification tothe bispectrum must be properly included when attempting to estimate theprimordial non-gaussianity or the bias will be at the level of 30%. for planck,weak lensing increases the minimum detectable value for the non-gaussianityparameter of the local type $f_{\rm nl}$ to 7 from the previous estimate ofabout 5 without lensing. the minimum detectable value of $f_{\rm nl}$ for acosmic variance limited experiment is also increased from less than 3 to $\sim$5.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1505.02797	gas-phase metallicity profiles of the bluedisk galaxies: is metallicity  in a local star-formation regulated equilibrium?	as part of the bluedisk survey we analyse the radial gas-phase metallicityprofiles of 50 late-type galaxies we compare the metallicity profiles of asample of hi-rich galaxies against a control sample of hi-'normal' galaxies. wefind the metallicity gradient of a galaxy to be strongly correlated with its himass fraction (m(hi) / mstar). we note that some galaxies exhibit a steepermetallicity profile in the outer disc than in the inner disc. these galaxiesare found in both the hi-rich and control samples. this contradicts a previousindication that these outer drops are exclusive to hi-rich galaxies. theseeffects are not driven by bars, although we do find some indication that barredgalaxies have flatter metallicity profiles. by applying a simple analyticalmodel we are able to account for the variety of metallicity profiles that thetwo samples present. the success of this model implies that the metallicity inthese isolated galaxies may be in a local equilibrium, regulated by starformation. this insight could provide an explanation of the observed localmass-metallicity relation.

1505.02981	star formation in the outer regions of the early type galaxy ngc 4203	ngc 4203 is a nearby early-type galaxy surrounded by a very large,low-column-density hi disc. in this paper we study the star formationefficiency in the gas disc of ngc 4203 by using the uv, deep optical imagingand infrared data. we confirm that the hi disc consists of two distinctcomponents: an inner star forming ring with radius from $\sim$ 1 to $\sim$ 3r$_{eff}$, and an outer disc. the outer hi disc is 9 times more massive thanthe inner hi ring. at the location of the inner hi ring we detect spiral-likestructure both in the deep $g'-r'$ image and in the 8 $\mu$m $spitzer$-iracimage, extending in radius up to $\sim$ 3 r$_{eff}$. these two gas componentshave a different star formation efficiency likely due to the differentmetallicity and dust content. the inner component has a star formationefficiency very similar to the inner regions of late-type galaxies. althoughthe outer component has a very low star formation efficiency, it is similar tothat of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and dwarfs. we suggest that thesedifferences can be explained with different gas origins for the two componentssuch as stellar mass loss for the inner hi ring and accretion from the intergalactic medium (igm) for the outer hi disc. the low level star formationefficiency in the outer hi disc is not enough to change the morphology of ngc4203, making the depletion time of the hi gas much too long.

1509.05236	the hi tully-fisher relation of early-type galaxies	we study the hi k-band tully-fisher relation and the baryonic tully-fisherrelation for a sample of 16 early-type galaxies, taken from the atlas3d sample,which all have very regular hi disks extending well beyond the optical body (&gt;5 r_eff). we use the kinematics of these disks to estimate the circularvelocity at large radii for these galaxies. we find that the tully-fisherrelation for our early-type galaxies is offset by about 0.5-0.7 magnitudes fromthe relation for spiral galaxies. the residuals with respect to the spiraltully-fisher relation correlate with estimates of the stellar mass-to-lightratio, suggesting that the offset between the relations is mainly driven bydifferences in stellar populations. we also observe a small offset between ourtully-fisher relation with the relation derived for the atlas3d sample based onco data representing the galaxies' inner regions (&lt; 1 r_eff). this indicatesthat the circular velocities at large radii are systematically 10% lower thanthose near 0.5-1 r_eff, in line with recent determinations of the shape of themass profile of early-type galaxies. the baryonic tully-fisher relation of oursample is distinctly tighter than the standard one, in particular when usingmass-to-light ratios based on dynamical models of the stellar kinematics. wefind that the early-type galaxies fall on the spiral baryonic tully-fisherrelation if one assumes m/l_k = 0.54 m_sun/l_sun for the stellar populations ofthe spirals, a value similar to that found by recent studies of the dynamics ofspiral galaxies. such a mass-to-light ratio for spiral galaxies would implythat their disks are 60-70% of maximal. our analysis increases the range ofgalaxy morphologies for which the baryonic tully-fisher relations holds,strengthening previous claims that it is a more fundamental scaling relationthan the classical tully-fisher relation.

0806.1742	impact of point source clustering on cosmological parameters with cmb  anisotropies	the faint radio point sources that are unresolved in cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropy maps are likely to be a biased tracer of thelarge-scale structure dark matter distribution. while the shot-noisecontribution to the angular power spectrum of unresolved radio point sources isincluded either when optimally constructing the cmb angular power spectrum, aswith wmap data, or when extracting cosmological parameters, we suggest thatclustering part of the point source power spectrum should also be included.this is especially necessary at high frequencies above 150 ghz, where theclustering of far-ir sources is expected to dominate the shot-noise level ofthe angular power spectrum at tens of arcminute angular scales of both radioand sub-mm sources. we make an estimate of source clustering of unresolvedradio sources in both wmap and acbar, and marginalize over the amplitude ofsource clustering in each cmb data set when model fitting for cosmologicalparameters. for the combination of wmap 5-year data and acbar, we find that thespectral index changes from the value of $0.963 \pm 0.014$ to $0.959 \pm 0.014$(at 68% c.l.) when the clustering power spectrum of point sources is includedin model fits. while we find that the differences are marginal with and withoutsource clustering in current data, it may be necessary to account for sourceclustering with future datasets such as planck, especially to properly modelfit anisotropies at arcminute angular scales. if clustering is not accountedand point sources are modeled with a shot-noise only out to $l \sim 2000$, thespectral index will be biased by about 1.5$\sigma$.

astro-ph;0610343	on the interpretation of age and chemical composition of composite  stellar populations determined with line-strength indices	we study the simple-stellar-population-equivalent (ssp-equivalent) age andchemical composition measured from the lick/ids line-strength indices ofcomposite stellar populations (csp). we build two sets of ~30000 csp modelsusing stellar populations synthesis models, combining an old population and ayoung population with a range of ages and chemical compositions representativeof early-type galaxies. we investigate how the ssp-equivalent stellarparameters of the csp's depend on the stellar parameters of the two inputpopulations; how they depend on v-band luminosity-weighted stellar parameters;and how ssp-equivalent parameters derived from different balmer-line indicescan be used to reveal the presence of a young population on top of an old one.we find that the ssp-equivalent age depends primarily on the age of the youngpopulation and on the mass fraction of the two populations, and that thessp-equivalent chemical composition depends mainly on the chemical compositionof the old population. furthermore, while the ssp-equivalent chemicalcomposition tracks quite closely the v-band luminosity weighted one, thessp-equivalent age does not and is strongly biased towards the age of the youngpopulation. in this bias the age of the young population and the mass fractionbetween old and young population are degenerate. finally, assuming typicalerror bars, we find that a discrepancy between the ssp-equivalent parametersdetermined with different balmer-line indices can reveal the presence of ayoung stellar population on top of an old one as long as the age of the youngpopulation is less than ~2.5 gyr and the mass fraction of young to oldpopulation is between 1% and 10%. such disrepancy is larger at supersolarmetallicities.
