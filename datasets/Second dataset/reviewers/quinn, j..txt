0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

0911.0873	a connection between star formation activity and cosmic rays in the  starburst galaxy m 82	although galactic cosmic rays (protons and nuclei) are widely believed to bedominantly accelerated by the winds and supernovae of massive stars, definitiveevidence of this origin remains elusive nearly a century after their discovery[1]. the active regions of starburst galaxies have exceptionally high rates ofstar formation, and their large size, more than 50 times the diameter ofsimilar galactic regions, uniquely enables reliable calorimetric measurementsof their potentially high cosmic-ray density [2]. the cosmic rays produced inthe formation, life, and death of their massive stars are expected toeventually produce diffuse gamma-ray emission via their interactions withinterstellar gas and radiation. m 82, the prototype small starburst galaxy, ispredicted to be the brightest starburst galaxy in gamma rays [3, 4]. here wereport the detection of &gt;700 gev gamma rays from m 82. from these data wedetermine a cosmic-ray density of 250 ev cm-3 in the starburst core of m 82, orabout 500 times the average galactic density. this result strongly supportsthat cosmic-ray acceleration is tied to star formation activity, and thatsupernovae and massive-star winds are the dominant accelerators.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1006.5955	veritas search for vhe gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies	indirect dark matter searches with ground-based gamma-ray observatoriesprovide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter thatis complementary to that of direct search or accelerator productionexperiments. we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies draco, ursa minor, bootes 1, and willman 1 conducted by veritas. thesegalaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distanceof several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of thedark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. since theconventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from theseobjects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for thesecondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matterparticles. no significant gamma-ray flux above 200 gev was detected from thesefour dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. the 95% confidenceupper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12photons cm^-2s^-1. we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints onthe thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section andthe relative velocity of the wimps. the limits are obtained under conservativeassumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and areapproximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoreticalprediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as wellas the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions couldfurther lower the limits.

1008.0651	the unification of asymmetry signatures of type ia supernovae	we present a compilation of the geometry measures acquired using optical andir spectroscopy and optical spectropolarimetry to probe the explosion geometryof type ia sne. polarization measurements are sensitive to asymmetries in theplane of the sky, whereas line profiles in nebular phase spectra are expectedto trace asymmetries perpendicular to the plane of the sky. the combination ofthese two measures can overcome their respective projection effects, completelyprobing the 3d structures of these events. for 9 normal type ia sne, we findthat the polarization of \ion{si}{2} $\lambda 6355$ at 5 days before maximum($p_{si\,ii}$) is well correlated with its velocity evolution ($\dot{\rmv}_{si\,ii}$), implying $\dot{\rm v}_{si\,ii}$ is predominantly due to theasymmetry of the sne. we find only a weak correlation between the polarizationof \ion{si}{2} and the reported velocities (${\rm v}_{neb}$) for peak emissionof optical \ion{fe}{2} and \ion{ni}{2} lines in nebular spectra. our sample isbiased, with polarization measurements being only available for normal snewhich subsequently exhibited positive (i.e. redshifted) ${\rm v}_{neb}$. inunison these indicators are consistent with an off-centre delayed detonation,in which the outer layers are dominated by a spherical oxygen layer, mixed withan asymmetric distribution of intermediate mass elements. the combination ofspectroscopic and spectropolarimetric indicators suggests a single geometricconfiguration for normal type ia sne, with some of the diversity of observedproperties arising from orientation effects.

1202.2144	veritas deep observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy segue 1	the veritas array of cherenkov telescopes has carried out a deepobservational program on the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy segue 1. we reporton the results of nearly 48 hours of good quality selected data, taken betweenjanuary 2010 and may 2011. no significant $\gamma$-ray emission is detected atthe nominal position of segue 1, and upper limits on the integrated flux arederived. according to recent studies, segue 1 is the most dark matter-dominateddwarf spheroidal galaxy currently known. we derive stringent bounds on variousannihilating and decaying dark matter particle models. the upper limits on thevelocity-weighted annihilation cross-section are $\mathrm{&lt;\sigma v &gt;^{95% cl}\lesssim 10^{-23} cm^{3} s^{-1}}$, improving our limits from previousobservations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies by at least a factor of two for darkmatter particle masses $\mathrm{m_{\chi}\gtrsim 300 gev}$. the lower limits onthe decay lifetime are at the level of $\mathrm{\tau^{95% cl} \gtrsim 10^{24}s}$. finally, we address the interpretation of the cosmic ray lepton anomaliesmeasured by atic and pamela in terms of dark matter annihilation, and show thatthe veritas observations of segue 1 disfavor such a scenario.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1212.4739	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from cta 1 by veritas	we report the discovery of tev gamma-ray emission coincident with theshell-type radio supernova remnant (snr) cta 1 using the veritas gamma-rayobservatory. the source, ver j0006+729, was detected as a 6.5 standarddeviation excess over background and shows an extended morphology, approximatedby a two-dimensional gaussian of semi-major (semi-minor) axis 0.30 degree (0.24degree) and a centroid 5' from the fermi gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 andits x-ray pulsar wind nebula (pwn). the photon spectrum is well described by apower-law dn/de = n_0 (e/3 tev)^(-\gamma), with a differential spectral indexof \gamma = 2.2 +- 0.2_stat +- 0.3_sys, and normalization n_0 = (9.1 +-1.3_stat +- 1.7_sys) x 10^(-14) cm^(-2) s^(-1) tev^(-1). the integral flux,f_\gamma = 4.0 x 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) above 1 tev, corresponds to 0.2%of the pulsar spin-down power at 1.4 kpc. the energetics, co-location with thesnr, and the relatively small extent of the tev emission strongly argue for thepwn origin of the tev photons. we consider the origin of the tev emission incta 1.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7144	the most powerful flaring activity from the nlsy1 pmn j0948+0022	we report on multifrequency observations performed during 2012 december-2013august of the first narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy detected in gamma rays, pmnj0948+0022 ($z$ = 0.5846). a gamma-ray flare was observed by the large areatelescope on board fermi during 2012 december-2013 january, reaching a dailypeak flux in the 0.1-100 gev energy range of (155 $\pm$ 31) $\times$10$^{-8}$ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on 2013 january 1, corresponding to an apparent isotropicluminosity of about 1.5$\times$10$^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the gamma-ray flaringperiod triggered swift and veritas observations in addition to radio andoptical monitoring by ovro, mojave, and crts. a strong flare was observed inoptical, uv, and x-rays on 2012 december 30, quasi-simultaneously to thegamma-ray flare, reaching a record flux for this source from optical to gammarays. veritas observations at very high energy (e &gt; 100 gev) during 2013january 6-17 resulted in an upper limit of f (&gt; 0.2 tev) &lt;4.0$\times$10$^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. we compared the spectral energydistribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2013 january with that of anintermediate state observed in 2011. the two seds, modelled as synchrotronemission and an external compton scattering of seed photons from a dust torus,can be modelled by changing both the electron distribution parameters and themagnetic field.

1411.1439	veritas observations of the bl lac object pg 1553+113	we present results from veritas observations of the bl lac object pg 1553+113spanning the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. the time-averaged spectrum, measuredbetween 160 and 560\,gev, is well described by a power law with a spectralindex of $4.33 \pm 0.09$. the time-averaged integral flux above $200\,$gevmeasured for this period was $(1.69 \pm 0.06) \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{ph} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, corresponding to 6.9\% of the crab nebulaflux. we also present the combined $\gamma$-ray spectrum from the fermi largearea telescope and veritas covering an energy range from 100~mev to 560~gev.the data are well fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff at $\rm {101.9\pm 3.2 \, \mathrm{gev}} $. the origin of the cutoff could be intrinsic topg~1553+113 or be due to the $\gamma$-ray opacity of our universe through pairproduction off the extragalactic background light (ebl). given lower limits tothe redshift of $\rm z \negthinspace &gt; \negthinspace 0.395$ based on optical/uvobservations of pg~1553+113, the cutoff would be dominated by ebl absorption.conversely, the small statistical uncertainties of the veritas energy spectrumhave allowed us to provide a robust upper limit on the redshift of pg 1553+113of $z \negthinspace \leq \negthinspace 0.62$. a strongly-elevated mean flux of$(2.50 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{ph} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (10.3\% of the crab nebula flux) was observed during 2012,with the daily flux reaching as high as $(4.44 \pm 0.71) \times 10^{-11} \,\mathrm{ph} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (18.3\% of the crab nebulaflux) on mjd 56048. the light curve measured during the 2012 observing seasonis marginally inconsistent with a steady flux, giving a $\chi^2$ probabilityfor a steady flux of 0.03\%.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1506.06246	veritas detection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac  object 1es 1727+502 during bright moonlight observations	during moonlit nights, observations with ground-based cherenkov telescopes atvery high energies (vhe, $e&gt;100$ gev) are constrained since the photomultipliertubes (pmts) in the telescope camera are extremely sensitive to the backgroundmoonlight. observations with the veritas telescopes in the standardconfiguration are performed only with a moon illumination less than 35$\%$ offull moon. since 2012, the veritas collaboration has implemented a newobserving mode under bright moonlight, by either reducing the voltage appliedto the pmts (reduced-high-voltage configuration, rhv), or by utilizinguv-transparent filters. while these operating modes result in lower sensitivityand increased energy thresholds, the extension of the available observing timeis useful for monitoring variable sources such as blazars and sources requiringspectral measurements at the highest energies. in this paper we report thedetection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac object 1es 1727+502during rhv observations. this detection represents the first evidence of vhevariability from this blazar. the integral flux is$(1.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 250 gev, which is aboutfive times higher than the low-flux state. the detection triggered additional\veritas\ observations during standard dark-time. multiwavelength observationswith the flwo 48" telescope, and the swift and fermi satellites are presentedand used to produce the first spectral energy distribution (sed) of this objectduring $\gamma$-ray flaring activity. the sed is then fitted with a standardsynchrotron-self-compton model, placing constraints on the properties of theemitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of therelativistic particle population in the jet.

astro-ph;0207184	discovery of spectral variability of markarian 421 at tev energies	the detection of spectral variability of the gamma-ray blazar mrk 421 at tevenergies is reported. observations with the whipple observatory 10m gamma-raytelescope taken in 2000/2001 revealed exceptionally strong and long-lastingflaring activity.  flaring levels of 0.4 to 13 times that of the crab nebula flux providedsufficient statistics for a detailed study of the energy spectrum between 380gev and 8.2 tev as a function of flux level. these spectra are well describedby a power law with an exponential cutoff. there is no evidence for variationin the cutoff energy with flux, and all spectra are consistent with an averagevalue for the cutoff energy of 4.3 tev. the spectral index varies between 1.89in a high flux state and 2.72 in a low state.  the correlation between spectral index and flux is tight when averaging overthe total 2000/2001 data set. spectral measurements of mrk~421 from previousyears (1995/96 and 1999) by the whipple collaboration are consistent with thisflux-spectral index correlation, which suggest that this may be a constant or along-term property of the source.  if a similar flux-spectral index correlation were found for other gamma-rayblazars, this universal property could help disentangle the intrinsic emissionmechanism from external absorption effects.

astro-ph;0508499	a very high energy gamma-ray spectrum of 1es 2344+514	the bl lacertae (bl lac) object 1es 2344+514 (1es 2344), at a redshift of0.044, was discovered as a source of very high energy (vhe) gamma rays by thewhipple collaboration in 1995 \citep{2344catanese98}. this detection wasrecently confirmed by the hegra collaboration \citep{2344hegra03}. as istypical for high-frequency peaked blazars, the vhe gamma-ray emission is highlyvariable. on the night of 20 december, 1995, a gamma-ray flare of 5.3-sigmasignificance was detected, the brightest outburst from this object to-date. theemission region is compatible with a point source. the spectrum between 0.8 tevand 12.6 tev can be described by a power law $\frac{\ud^3 n}{\ud e \ud a \udt}=(5.1\pm1.0_{st}\pm1.2_{sy})\times10^{-7} (e/ \mathrm{tev})^{-2.54\pm0.17_{st}\pm0.07_{sy}} \mathrm{\frac{1}{tev m^2 s}}$. comparing the spectralindex with that of the other five confirmed tev blazars, the spectrum of 1es2344 is similar to 1es 1959+650, located at almost the same distance. thespectrum of 1es 2344 is steeper than the brightest flare spectra of markarian421 (mrk~421) and markarian 501 (mrk~501), both located at a distance about 2/3that of 1es 2344, and harder than the spectra of pks 2155-304 and h~1426+428,which are located almost three times as far. this trend is consistent withattenuation caused by the infrared extragalactic background radiation.

astro-ph;9811014	a study of high energy emission from the tev blazar mrk 501 during  multiwavelength observations in 1996	we present the results of a multiwavelength campaign for mrk 501 performed inmarch 1996 with asca, egret, whipple, and optical telescopes. in the x-rayband, a spectral break was observed around 2 kev. we report here for the firsttime the detection of high-energy gamma-ray flux from mrk 501 with egret with3.5 sigma significance (e&gt;100 mev). higher flux was also observed in april/may1996, with 4.0 sigma significance for e&gt;100 mev, and 5.2 sigma significance fore&gt;500 mev. the gamma-ray spectrum was measured to be flatter than most of thegamma-ray blazars. we find that the multiband spectrum in 1996 is consistentwith that calculated from a one-zone ssc model in a homogeneous region. in thecontext of this model, we investigate the values of the magnetic field strengthand the beaming factor allowed by the observational results. we compare themarch 1996 multiwavelength spectrum with that in the flare state in april 1997.between these two epochs, the tev flux increase is well correlated with thatobserved in kev range. the kev and tev amplitudes during the april 1997 flareare accurately reproduced, assuming that the population of synchrotron photonsin 1996 are scattered by the newly injected relativistic electrons, havingmaximum energies of g_max = 6.0e6. however, the tev spectrum observed duringmarch 1996 campaign is flatter than predicted by our models. we find that thiscannot be explained by either higher order comptonization or the contributionof the `seed' ir photons from the host galaxy for the first-order externalradiation comptonization.

astro-ph;9903088	the flux variability of markarian 501 in very high energy gamma rays	the bl lacertae object markarian 501 was identified as a source of gamma-rayemission at the whipple observatory in march 1995. here we present a fluxvariability analysis on several times-scales of the 233 hour data setaccumulated over 213 nights (from march 1995 to july 1998) with the whippleobservatory 10 m atmospheric cherenkov imaging telescope. in 1995, with theexception of a single night, the flux from markarian 501 was constant on dailyand monthly time-scales and had an average flux of only 10% that of the crabnebula, making it the weakest vhe source detected to date. in 1996, the averageflux was approximately twice the 1995 flux and showed significantmonth-to-month variability. no significant day-scale variations were detected.the average gamma-ray flux above ~350 gev in the 1997 observing season rose to1.4 times that of the crab nebula -- 14 times the 1995 discovery level --allowing a search for variability on time-scales shorter than one day.significant hour-scale variability was present in the 1997 data, with theshortest, observed on mjd 50607, having a doubling time of ~2 hours. in 1998the average emission level decreased considerably from that of 1997 (to ~20% ofthe crab nebula flux) but two significant flaring events were observed. thus,the emission from markarian 501 shows large amplitude and rapid fluxvariability at very high energies as does markarian 421. it also shows largemean flux level variations on year-to-year time-scales, behaviour which has notbeen seen from markarian 421 so far.
