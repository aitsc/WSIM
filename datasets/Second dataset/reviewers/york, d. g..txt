0707.1700	a survey of metal lines at high-redshift (i) : sdss absorption line  studies - the methodology and first search results for ovi	we report the results of a systematic search for signatures of metal lines inquasar spectra of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 3(dr3),focusing on finding intervening absorbers via detection of their ovi doublet.here we present the search algorithm, and criteria for distinguishingcandidates from spurious lyman $\alpha${} forest lines. in addition, we compareour findings with simulations of the lyman $\alpha${} forest in order toestimate the detectability of ovi doublets over various redshift intervals. wehave obtained a sample of 1756 ovi doublet candidates with rest-frameequivalent width &gt; 0.05 \aa{} in 855 agn spectra (out of 3702 objects withredshifts in the accessible range for ovi detection). this sample is furthersubdivided into 3 groups according to the likelihood of being real and thepotential for follow-up observation of the candidate. the group with thecleanest and most secure candidates is comprised of 145 candidates. 69 of thesereside at a velocity separation &gt; 5000 km/s from the qso, and can therefore beclassified tentatively as intervening absorbers. most of these absorbers havenot been picked up by earlier, automated qso absorption line detectionalgorithms. this sample increases the number of known ovi absorbers atredshifts beyond z$_{abs} &gt; 2.7 substantially.

0910.2983	studies of the diffuse interstellar bands. iii. hd 183143	echelle spectra of hd 183143 [b7iae, e(b-v) = 1.27] were obtained on threenights, at a resolving power r = 38,000 and with a signal-to-noise ratio ~1000at 6400 a in the final, combined spectrum. a catalog is presented of 414diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) measured between 3900 and 8100 a in thisspectrum. the central wavelengths, the widths (fwhm), and the equivalent widthsof nearly all of the bands are tabulated, along with the minimum uncertaintiesin the latter. among the 414 bands, 135 (or 33%) were not reported in fourprevious, modern surveys of the dibs in the spectra of various stars, includinghd 183143. the principal result of this study is that the great majority of thebands in the catalog are very weak and fairly narrow. typical equivalent widthsamount to a few ma, and the bandwidths (fwhm) are most often near 0.7 a. nopreferred wavenumber spacings among the 414 bands are identified which couldprovide clues to the identities of the large molecules thought to cause thedibs. at generally comparable detection limits in both spectra, the populationof dibs observed toward hd 183143 is systematically redder, broader, andstronger than that seen toward hd 204827 (paper ii). in addition, interstellarlines of c2 molecules have not been detected toward hd 183143, while a veryhigh value of n(c2)/e(b-v) is observed toward hd 204827. therefore, either theabundances of the large molecules presumed to give rise to the dibs, or thephysical conditions in the absorbing clouds, or both, must differ significantlybetween the two cases.

0911.0423	optically selected bl lacertae candidates from the sloan digital sky  survey data release seven	we present a sample of 723 optically selected bl lac candidates from the sdssdr7 spectroscopic database encompassing 8250 deg^2 of sky; our sampleconstitutes one of the largest uniform bl lac samples yet derived. each bl laccandidate has a high-quality sdss spectrum from which we determinespectroscopic redshifts for ~60% of the objects. redshift lower limits areestimated for the remaining objects utilizing the lack of host galaxy fluxcontamination in their optical spectra; we find that objects lackingspectroscopic redshifts are likely at systematically higher redshifts.approximately 80% of our bl lac candidates match to a radio source infirst/nvss, and ~40% match to a rosat x-ray source. the homogeneousmultiwavelength coverage allows subdivision of the sample into 637 radio-loudbl lac candidates and 86 weak-featured radio-quiet objects. the radio-loudobjects broadly support the standard paradigm unifying bl lac objects withbeamed radio galaxies. we propose that the majority of the radio-quiet objectsmay be lower-redshift (z&lt;2.2) analogs to high-redshift weak line quasars (i.e.,agn with unusually anemic broad emission line regions). these would constitutethe largest sample of such objects, being of similar size and complementary inredshift to the samples of high-redshift weak line quasars previouslydiscovered by the sdss. however, some fraction of the weak-featured radio-quietobjects may instead populate a rare and extreme radio-weak tail of the muchlarger radio-loud bl lac population. serendipitous discoveries of unusual whitedwarfs, high-redshift weak line quasars, and broad absorption line quasars withextreme continuum dropoffs blueward of rest-frame 2800 angstroms are alsobriefly described.

1007.0288	gmrt mini-survey to search for 21-cm absorption in quasar-galaxy pairs  at z~0.1	we present the results from our 21-cm absorption survey of a sample of 5quasar-galaxy pairs (qgps), with the redshift of the galaxies in the range0.03&lt;zg&lt;0.18, selected from the sdss. the hi 21-cm absorption was searchedtowards the 9 sight lines with impact parameters ranging from 10 to 55 kpcusing gmrt. 21-cm absorption was detected only in one case i.e. towards thequasar (zq=2.625 sdss j124157.54+633241.6)-galaxy (zg=0.143 sdssj124157.26+633237.6) pair with the impact parameter 11 kpc. the quasar sightline in this case pierces through the stellar disk of a galaxy having nearsolar metallicity (i.e (o/h)+12=8.7) and star formation rate uncorrected fordust attenuation of 0.1 m_odot/yr. the quasar spectrum reddened by theforeground galaxy is well fitted with the milky way extinction curve (with anav of 0.44) and the estimated hi column density is similar to the valueobtained from 21-cm absorption assuming spin temperature of 100k. combining oursample with the z&lt;0.1 data available in the literature, we find thedetectability of 21-cm absorption with integrated optical depth greater than0.1 km\s to be 50% for the impact parameter less than 20 kpc. using the surfacebrightness profiles and relationship between the optical size and extent of thehi disk known for nearby galaxies, we conclude that in most of the cases of21-cm absorption non-detection, the sight lines may not be passing through thehi gas. we also find that in comparison to the absorption systems associatedwith these qgps, z&lt;1 dlas with 21-cm absorption detections have lower caiiequivalent widths despite having higher 21-cm optical depths and smaller impactparameters. this suggests that the current sample of dlas may be a biasedpopulation that avoids sight lines through dusty star-forming galaxies. asystematic survey of qgps is needed to confirm these findings and understandthe nature of 21-cm absorbers.

0709.1926	distances to galactic high-velocity clouds. i. cohen stream, complex  gcp, cloud g1	the high- and intermediate-velocity interstellar clouds (hvcs/ivcs) aretracers of energetic processes in and around the milky way. clouds withnear-solar metallicity about one kpc above the disk trace the circulation ofmaterial between disk and halo (the galactic fountain). the magellanic streamconsists of gas tidally extracted from the smc, tracing the dark matterpotential of the milky way. several other hvcs have low-metallicity and appearto trace the continuing accretion of infalling intergalactic gas. theseassertions are supported by the metallicities (0.1 to 1 solar) measured forabout ten clouds in the past decade. direct measurements of distances to hvcshave remained elusive, however. in this paper we present four new distancebrackets, using vlt observations of interstellar \caii h and k absorptiontoward distant galactic halo stars. we derive distance brackets of 5.0 to 11.7kpc for the cohen stream (likely to be an infalling low-metallicity cloud), 9.8to 15.1 kpc for complex gcp (also known as the smith cloud or hvc40-15+100 andwith still unknown origin), 1.0 to 2.7 kpc for an ivc that appears associatedwith the return flow of the fountain in the perseus arm, and 1.8 to 3.8 kpc forcloud g1, which appears to be in the outflow phase of the fountain. ourmeasurements further demonstrate that the milky way is accreting substantialamounts of gaseous material, which influences the galaxy's current and futuredynamical and chemical evolution.

0711.0005	the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer survey of ovi absorption in  the disk of the milky way	to probe the distribution and physical characteristics of interstellar gas attemperatures t ~ 3e5 k in the disk of the milky way, we have used the farultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) to observe absorption lines of ovitoward 148 early-type stars situated at distances 1 kpc. after subtracting offa mild excess of ovi arising from the local bubble, combining our new resultswith earlier surveys of ovi, and eliminating stars that show conspicuouslocalized x-ray emission, we find an average ovi mid-plane density n_0 = 1.3e-8cm^-3. the density decreases away from the plane of the galaxy in a way that isconsistent with an exponential scale height of 3.2 kpc at negative latitudes or4.6 kpc at positive latitudes. average volume densities of ovi along differentsight lines exhibit a dispersion of about 0.26 dex, irrespective of thedistances to the target stars. this indicates that ovi does not arise inrandomly situated clouds of a fixed size and density, but instead isdistributed in regions that have a very broad range of column densities, withthe more strongly absorbing clouds having a lower space density. line widthsand centroid velocities are much larger than those expected from differentialgalactic rotation, but they are nevertheless correlated with distance andn(ovi), which reinforces our picture of a diverse population of hot plasmaregions that are ubiquitous over the entire galactic disk. the velocityextremes of the ovi profiles show a loose correlation with those of very stronglines of less ionized species, supporting a picture of a turbulent, multiphasemedium churned by shock-heated gas from multiple supernova explosions.

1208.0836	broad absorption line disappearance on multi-year timescales in a large  quasar sample	we present 21 examples of c iv broad absorption line (bal) troughdisappearance in 19 quasars selected from systematic multi-epoch observationsof 582 bright bal quasars (1.9 &lt; z &lt; 4.5) by the sloan digital sky survey-i/ii(sdss-i/ii) and sdss-iii. the observations span 1.1-3.9 yr rest-frametimescales, longer than have been sampled in many previous bal variabilitystudies. on these timescales, ~2.3% of c iv bal troughs disappear and ~3.3% ofbal quasars show a disappearing trough. these observed frequencies suggest thatmany c iv bal absorbers spend on average at most a century along our line ofsight to their quasar. ten of the 19 bal quasars showing c iv bal disappearancehave apparently transformed from bal to non-bal quasars; these are the firstreported examples of such transformations. the bal troughs that disappear tendto be those with small-to-moderate equivalent widths, relatively shallowdepths, and high outflow velocities. other non-disappearing c iv bals in thosenine objects having multiple troughs tend to weaken when one of themdisappears, indicating a connection between the disappearing andnon-disappearing troughs, even for velocity separations as large as 10000-15000km/s. we discuss possible origins of this connection including disk-windrotation and changes in shielding gas.

1306.2680	broad absorption line quasars with redshifted troughs: high-velocity  infall or rotationally dominated outflows?	we report the discovery in the sloan digital sky survey and the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of seventeen broad absorption line(bal) quasars with high-ionization troughs that include absorption redshiftedrelative to the quasar rest frame. the redshifted troughs extend to velocitiesup to v=12,000 km/s and the trough widths exceed 3000 km/s in all but one case.approximately 1 in 1000 bal quasars with blueshifted c iv absorption also hasredshifted c iv absorption; objects with c iv absorption present only atredshifted velocities are roughly four times rarer. in more than half of ourobjects, redshifted absorption is seen in c ii or al iii as well as c iv,making low-ionization absorption at least ten times more common among balquasars with redshifted troughs than among standard bal quasars. however, the civ absorption equivalent widths in our objects are on average smaller thanthose of standard bal quasars with low-ionization absorption. we considerseveral possible ways of generating redshifted absorption. the two most likelypossibilities may be at work simultaneously, in the same objects or indifferent ones. rotationally dominated outflows seen against a quasar'sextended continuum source can produce redshifted and blueshifted absorption,but variability consistent with this scenario is seen in only one of the fourobjects with multiple spectra. the infall of relatively dense andlow-ionization gas to radii as small as 400 schwarzschild radii can inprinciple explain the observed range of trough profiles, but current models donot easily explain the origin and survival of such gas. whatever the origin(s)of the absorbing gas in these objects, it must be located at small radii toexplain its large redshifted velocities, and thus offers a novel probe of theinner regions of quasars.

0801.3905	average properties of a large sample of z_abs ~ z_em associated mg ii  absorption line systems	we have studied a sample of 415 associated (z_ab z_em; relative velocity withrespect to qso &lt;3000km/s) mg ii absorption systems with 1.0&lt;=z_ab&lt;=1.86, in thespectra of sdss dr3 qsos, to determine the dust content and ionization state inthe absorbers. we studied the dependence of these properties on the propertiesof the qsos and also, compared the properties with those of a similarlyselected sample of 809 intervening systems (apparent relative velocity withrespect to the qso of &gt;3000km/s), so as to understand their origin. from theanalysis of the composite spectra, as well as from the comparison of measuredequivalent widths in individual spectra, we conclude that the associated mg iiabsorbers have higher apparent ionization, measured by the strength of the c ivabsorption lines compared to the mg ii absorption lines, than the interveningabsorbers. the ionization so measured appears to be related to apparentejection velocity, being lower as the apparent ejection velocity is more andmore positive. there is clear evidence, from the composite spectra, for smclike dust attenuation in these systems; the 2175aa absorption feature is notpresent. the extinction is almost twice that observed in the similarly selectedsample of intervening systems. we reconfirm that qsos with non-zero first radioflux are intrinsically redder than the qsos with no detection in the firstsurvey. the incidence of associated mg ii systems in qsos with non-zero firstradio flux is 1.7 times that in the qsos with no detection in the first survey.the associated absorbers in radio-detected qsos which comprise about 12% of oursample, cause 3 times more reddening than the associated absorbers inradio-undetected qsos. this excess reddening possibly suggests an intrinsicnature for the associated absorbers in radio-detected qsos.

0802.2240	two more candidate am canum venaticorum (am cvn) binaries from the sloan  digital sky survey	am cvn systems are a select group of ultracompact binaries with the shortestorbital periods of any known binary subclass; mass-transfer is likely from alow-mass (partially-)degenerate secondary onto a white dwarf primary, driven bygravitational radiation. in the past few years, the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) has provided five new am cvns. here we report on two further candidatesselected from more recent sdss data. sdss j1208+3550 is similar to the earliersdss discoveries, recognized as an am cvn via its distinctive spectrum which isdominated by helium emission. from the expanded sdss data release 6 (dr6)spectroscopic area, we provide an updated surface density estimate for such amcvns of order 10^{-3.1} to 10^{-2.5} per deg^2 for 15&lt;g&lt;20.5. in addition, wepresent another new candidate am cvn, sdss j2047+0008, that was discovered inthe course of followup of sdss-ii supernova candidates. it shows nova-likeoutbursts in multi-epoch imaging data; in contrast to the other sdss am cvndiscoveries, its (outburst) spectrum is dominated by helium absorption lines,reminiscent of kl dra and 2003aw. the variability selection of sdss j2047+0008from the 300 deg^2 of sdss stripe 82 presages further am cvn discoveries infuture deep, multicolor, and time-domain surveys such as lsst. the newadditions bring the total sdss yield to seven am cvns thus far, a substantialcontribution to this rare subclass, versus the dozen previously known.

1402.4509	interstellar silicate dust in the z=0.685 absorber toward txs 0218+357	we report the detection of interstellar silicate dust in the z_abs=0.685absorber along the sightline toward the gravitationally lensed blazar txs0218+357. using spitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph data we detectthe 10 micron silicate absorption feature with a detection significance of10.7-sigma. we fit laboratory-derived silicate dust profile templates obtainedfrom literature to the observed 10 micron absorption feature, and find that thebest single-mineral fit is obtained using an amorphous olivine template with ameasured peak optical depth of tau_10=0.49+/-0.02, which rises totau_10~0.67+/-0.04 if the covering factor is taken into account. we alsodetected the 18 micron silicate absorption feature in our data with a &gt;3-sigmasignificance. due to the proximity of the 18 micron absorption feature to theedge of our covered spectral range, and associated uncertainty about the shapeof the quasar continuum normalization near 18 micron, we do not independentlyfit this feature. we find, however, that the shape and depth of the 18 micronsilicate absorption are well-matched to the amorphous olivine templateprediction, given the optical depth inferred for the 10 micron feature. themeasured 10 micron peak optical depth in this absorber is significantly higherthan those found in previously studied quasar absorption systems. thereddening, 21-cm absorption, and velocity spread of mg ii are not outliersrelative to other studied absorption systems, however. this high optical depthmay be evidence for variations in dust grain properties in the ism between thisand the previously studied high redshift galaxies.

1503.06741	characteristics of he ii proximity profiles	the proximity profile in the spectra of z~3 quasars, where fluxes extendblueward of the he ii lya wavelength 304 (1+z) a, is one of the most importantspectral features in the study of the intergalactic medium. based on the hstspectra of 24 he ii quasars, we find that the majority of them display aproximity profile, corresponding to an ionization radius as large as 20 mpc inthe source's rest frame. in comparison with those in the h i spectra of thequasars at z~6, the he ii proximity effect is more prominent and is observedover a considerably longer period of reionization. the he ii proximity zonesizes decrease at higher redshifts, particularly at z &gt; 3.3. this trend issimilar to that for h i, signaling an onset of he ii reionization at z~4.  for quasar sdss1253+6817 (z=3.48), the he ii absorption trough displays agradual decline and serves a good case for modeling the he ii reionization. tomodel such a broad profile requires a quasar radiation field whose distributionbetween 4 and 1 rydberg is considerably harder than normally assumed. the uvcontinuum of this quasar is indeed exceptionally steep, and the he iiionization level in the quasar vicinity is higher than the average level in theintergalactic medium. these results are evidence that a very hard euv continuumfrom this quasar produces a large ionized zone around it.  distinct exceptions are the two brightest he ii quasars at z~2.8, for whichno significant proximity profile is present, possibly implying that they areyoung.

astro-ph;0005011	fuse observations of the low-redshift lyman-beta forest	we describe a moderate-resolution (20-25 km/s) fuse study of the low-redshiftintergalactic medium. we report on studies of 7 extragalactic sightlines and 12ly-beta absorbers that correspond to ly-alpha lines detected by hst/ghrs andstis. these absorbers appear to contain a significant fraction of the low-zbaryons and were a major discovery of the hst spectrographs. using fuse data,with 40 ma (4-sigma) lyb detection limits, we have employed the equivalentwidth ratio of lyb/lya and occasionally higher lyman lines, to determine thedoppler parameter, b, and accurate column densities, n(hi), for moderatelysaturated lines. we detect lyb absorption corresponding to all lya lines withew &gt; 200 ma. the lyb/lya ratios yield a preliminary distribution function ofdoppler parameters, with mean &lt;b&gt; = 31.4 +/- 7.4 km/s and median b = 28 km/s,comparable to values at redshifts z = 2.0-2.5. if thermal, these b-valuescorrespond to t(hi) ~ 50,000 k, although the inferred doppler parameters areconsiderably less than the widths derived from lya profile fitting,&lt;b(dopp)/b(width)&gt; = 0.52. the typical increase in column density over thatderived from profile fitting is delta[log n(hi)] = 0.3, but ranges up to 1.0dex. our data suggest that the low-z lya absorbers contain sizable non-thermalmotions or velocity components in the line profile, perhaps arising fromcosmological expansion and infall.

astro-ph;0005012	fuse observations of o vi in high velocity clouds	we have used moderate-resolution (fwhm ~ 25 km/sec) spectra of agns and qsosobserved by the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) to make the firstdefinitive measurements of absorption by hot gas in high velocity clouds (hvcs)at large distances from the galactic plane. seven of the 11 sight lines studiedexhibit high velocity (|v(lsr)| &gt; 100 km/sec) o vi 1031.93 a absorption withlog n(o vi) = 13.79-14.62. high velocity o vi absorption is detected in thedistant gas of h i hvc complex c, the magellanic stream, several hvcs believedto be in the local group, and the outer galaxy. the fraction of o vi in hvcsalong the seven sight lines containing high velocity o vi averages about 30percent, with a full range of 10-70 percent. the o vi detections imply that hot(log t(k) = 5-6) collisionally-ionized gas is an important constituent of thehvcs since o vi is difficult to produce by photoionization unless the pathlengths over which the absorption occurs are very large (&gt;100 kpc). theassociation of o vi with h i hvcs in many cases suggests that the o vi may beproduced at interfaces or mixing layers between the h i clouds and hot, lowdensity gas in the galactic corona or local group. alternatively, the o vi mayoriginate within cooling regions of hot gas clouds as they are accreted ontothe galaxy.

astro-ph;0005247	five high-redshift quasars discovered in commissioning imaging data of  the sloan digital sky survey	we report the discovery of five quasars with redshifts of 4.67 - 5.27 andz'-band magnitudes of 19.5-20.7 m_b ~ -27. all were originally selected asdistant quasar candidates in optical/near-infrared photometry from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), and most were confirmed as probable high-redshiftquasars by supplementing the sdss data with j and k measurements. the quasarspossess strong, broad lyman-alpha emission lines, with the characteristic sharpcutoff on the blue side produced by lyman-alpha forest absorption. threequasars contain strong, broad absorption features, and one of them exhibitsvery strong n v emission. the amount of absorption produced by the lyman-alphaforest increases toward higher redshift, and that in the z=5.27 object (d_a ~0.7) is consistent with a smooth extrapolation of the absorption seen in lowerredshift quasars. the high luminosity of these objects relative to most otherknown objects at z &gt;~ 5 makes them potentially valuable as probes of earlyquasar properties and of the intervening intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0005408	fuse spectroscopy of high velocity cloud complex c	we present far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) observations of thesightline toward the seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 876, which passes through highvelocity cloud (hvc) complex c. this sight line demonstrates the ability offuse to measure ionic absorption lines in galactic hvcs. high velocityabsorption is clearly seen in both members of the o vi doublet. this is thefirst detection of o vi in a neutral hydrogen hvc. one component of hvc complexc is resolved in multiple fe ii lines from which we derive n(fe ii)/n(h i)=0.48(fe/h)_solar. this value of n(fe ii)/n(h i) implies that the metallicity ofcomplex c along this sightline may be higher than that along the mrk 290sightline (0.1 solar) found by wakker et al. (1999). on the other hand, if themetallicity of complex c is also 0.1 solar along this line of sight, theobserved value of n(fe ii)/(n(h i) suggests there may be a significan t amountof h+ along the line of sight. in any case, little, if any, iron can bedepleted into dust grains if the intrinsic metallicity of complex c issubsolar. absorption from complex c is also seen in c ii, n i, and n ii, andupper limits based on non-detections can be determined for ar i, p ii, and feiii. although molecular hydrogen in the milky way is obvious in the fuse data,no h_2 absorption is seen in the high velocity cloud to a limitn(h_2)&lt;2.0x10^14 cm^-2. future fuse observations of extragalactic objectsbehind galactic high velocity clouds will allow us to better constrain modelsof hvc origins.

astro-ph;0208009	the fuse survey of ovi absorption in and near the galaxy	we present fuse observations of ovi absorption in a sample of 100extragalactic targets and 2 distant halo stars. we describe the details of thecalibration, alignment in velocity, continuum fitting, and manner in whichcontaminants were removed (galactic h2, absorption intrinsic to the backgroundtarget and intergalactic ly-beta lines). we searched for ovi absorption in thevelocity range -1200 to 1200 km/s. with a few exceptions, we only find ovibetween -400 and 400 km/s; the exceptions may be intergalactic ovi. we discussthe separation of the observed ovi absorption into components associated withthe galactic halo and components at high-velocity, which are probably locatedin the neighborhood of the galaxy. we describe the measurements of equivalentwidth and column density, and we analyze the different contributions to theerrors. we conclude that low-velocity galactic ovi absorption occurs along allsightlines - the few non-detections only occur in noisy spectra. we furthershow that high-velocity ovi is very common, having equivalent width &gt;65 maa in50% of the sightlines and &gt;30 maa in 70% of the high-quality sightlines. thehigh-velocity ovi absorption has velocities relative to the lsr of+/-(100--330) km/s; there is no correlation between velocity and absorptionstrength. we present 50 km/s wide ovi channel maps. these show evidence for theimprint of galactic rotation. they also highlight two known hi high-velocityclouds (complex~c and the magellanic stream). the channel maps further showthat ovi at velocities &lt;-200 km/s occurs along all sightlines in the regionl=20-150, b&lt;-30, while ovi at velocities &gt;200 km/s occurs along all sightlinesin the region l=180-300, b&gt;20 (abbreviated).

astro-ph;0310336	the ensemble photometric variability of ~25000 quasars in the sloan  digital sky survey	using a sample of over 25000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars from thesloan digital sky survey, we show how quasar variability in the rest frameoptical/uv regime depends upon rest frame time lag, luminosity, restwavelength, redshift, the presence of radio and x-ray emission, and thepresence of broad absorption line systems. the time dependence of variability(the structure function) is well-fit by a single power law on timescales fromdays to years. there is an anti-correlation of variability amplitude with restwavelength, and quasars are systematically bluer when brighter at allredshifts. there is a strong anti-correlation of variability with quasarluminosity. there is also a significant positive correlation of variabilityamplitude with redshift, indicating evolution of the quasar population or thevariability mechanism. we parameterize all of these relationships. quasars withrass x-ray detections are significantly more variable (at optical/uvwavelengths) than those without, and radio loud quasars are marginally morevariable than their radio weak counterparts. we find no significant differencein the variability of quasars with and without broad absorption line troughs.models involving multiple discrete events or gravitational microlensing areunlikely by themselves to account for the data. so-called accretion diskinstability models are promising, but more quantitative predictions are needed.

astro-ph;0312427	a gravitationally lensed quasar with quadruple images separated by 14.62  arcseconds	gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution ofdark matter in the universe. the cold-dark-matter model of the formation oflarge-scale structures predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensedby concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would besplit by over 7 arcsec. numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasarshave, however, been unsuccessful. all of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known,including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that canbe explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter.although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known,quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of theresulting lens systems. here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, sdssj1004+4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominatedby dark matter. our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectationsbased on the cold-dark-matter model.

astro-ph;0403354	rosat-sdss galaxy clusters survey. i. the catalog and the correlation of  x-ray and optical properties	for a detailed comparison of the appearance of cluster of galaxies in x-raysand in the optical, we have compiled a comprehensive database of x-ray andoptical properties of a sample of clusters based on the largest available x-rayand optical surveys: the rosat all sky survey (rass) and the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). the x-ray galaxy clusters of this rass-sdss catalog cover a widerange of masses, from groups of 10^{12.5} solar masses to massive clusters of10^{15} solar masses in the redshift range from 0.002 to 0.45. the rass-sdsssample comprises all the x-ray selected objects already observed by the sloandigital sky survey (114 clusters). for each system we have uniformly determinedthe x-ray and optical properties. the total optical luminosity can bedetermined with a typical uncertainty of 20% with a result independent of thechoice of local or global background subtraction. we found that the z bandcluster luminosity determined within an aperture of 0.5 mpc h_{70}^(-1)provides the best correlation with the x-ray luminosity with a scatter of about60-70%. the scatter decreases to less than 40% if the correlation is limited tothe bright x-ray clusters. the resulting correlation of l_x and l_{op} in the zand i bands shows a logarithmic slope of 0.38, a value not consistent with theassumption of a constant m/l. consistency is found, however, for an increasingm/l with luminosity as suggested by other observations. we also investigatedthe correlation between l_{op} and the x-ray temperature obtaining the sameresult.

astro-ph;0408569	the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy correlation function	we study the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy 2-pointcorrelation function in the sloan digital sky survey, starting from a sample of200,000 galaxies over 2500 deg^2. we concentrate on the projected correlationfunction w(r_p), which is directly related to the real space \xi(r). theamplitude of w(r_p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeplyabove the characteristic luminosity l_*. redder galaxies exhibit a higheramplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. the correlationamplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but theluminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright redgalaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies morestrongly clustered at small scales. we interpret these results using halooccupation distribution (hod) models assuming concordance cosmologicalparameters. for most samples, an hod model with two adjustable parameters fitsthe w(r_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r_p ~ 1-3mpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of \xi(r). theimplied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminositythreshold l grows as m_min ~ l at low luminosities and more steeply above l_*.the mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than l ism_1 ~ 23 m_min(l). these results imply a conditional luminosity function (atfixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a schechter functionextrapolation of the satellite population. hod models nicely explain the jointluminosity-color dependence of w(r_p) in terms of the color fractions ofcentral and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. the inferred hodproperties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.

astro-ph;0605705	an orphan in the "field of streams"	we use sloan digital sky survey data release 5 photometry and spectroscopy tostudy a tidal stream that extends over 50 degrees in the north galactic cap.  from the analysis of the path of the stream and the colors and magnitudes ofits stars, the stream is about 20 kpc away at its nearest detection (thecelestial equator). we detect a distance gradient -- the stream is farther awayfrom us at higher declination. the contents of the stream are made up from apredominantly old and metal-poor population that is similar to the globularclusters m13 and m92. the integrated absolute magnitude of the stream stars isestimated to be m_r = -7.5. there istentative evidence for a velocitysignature, with the stream moving at -40 km/s at low declinations and +100 km/sat high declinations. the stream lies on the same great circle as complex a, aroughly linear association of hi high velocity clouds stretching over 30degrees on the sky, and as ursa major ii, a recently discovered dwarfspheroidal galaxy. lying close to the same great circle are a number ofanomalous, young and metal-poor globular clusters, including palomar 1 andruprecht 106.

astro-ph;0607561	metal-rich damped/sub-damped lyman-alpha quasar absorbers at z&lt;1	damped lyman-alpha absorbers (dlas), seen in absorption against a backgroundquasar, provide the most detailed probes available of element abundances in theuniverse over &gt; 90 % of its age. dlas can be used to observationally measurethe global mean metallicity in the universe and its evolution with time.paradoxically, these observations are more difficult at lower redshifts, wherethe absorber rest-frame uv spectra are cut-off due to the atmosphericabsorption. we present here high-resolution vlt/uves observations of severalelements contained in three dlas and one sub-dla with 0.6&lt;z_abs&lt;0.9. we detectmg i, mg ii, fe ii, zn ii, cr ii, mn ii, ti ii and ca ii. our observations morethan double the high-resolution sample of [zn/h] at z&lt;1. we also report thediscovery of three metal-rich systems, whereas most previous measurements showlow n(hi)-weighted mean metallicity projecting to about 1/6th solar level atz=0. we derive [zn/h]=-0.11+/-0.04 at z_abs=0.725, [zn/h]=-0.54+/-0.20 atz_abs=0.740 and [zn/h]=-0.49+/-0.22 at z_abs=0.652, plus one additional upperlimit ([zn/h]&lt;-0.36 at z_abs=0.842). these measurements confirm the existenceof quasar absorbers with relatively high metallicities based on abundanceestimates free from the effect of dust depletion. possible implications ofthese results for the metallicity of neutral gas phase in the past ~ 8 gyr arepresented and compared with models.

astro-ph;0608126	the role of sub-damped lyman-alpha absorbers in the cosmic evolution of  metals	observations of low mean metallicity of damped lyman-alpha (dla) quasarabsorbers at all redshifts studied appear to contradict the predictions for theglobal mean interstellar metallicity in galaxies from cosmic chemical evolutionmodels. on the other hand, a number of metal-rich sub-dla systems have beenidentified recently, and the fraction of metal-rich sub-dlas appears to beconsiderably larger than that of metal-rich dlas, especially at z &lt; 1.5. inview of this, here we investigate the evolution of metallicity in sub-dlas. wefind that the mean zn metallicity of the observed sub-dlas may be higher thanthat of the observed dlas, especially at low redshifts, reaching a near-solarlevel at z &lt;~ 1. this trend does not appear to be an artifact of sampleselection, the use of zn, the use of n_{hi}-weighting, or observationalsensitivity. while a bias against very low metallicity could be present in thesub-dla sample in some situations, this cannot explain the difference betweenthe dla and sub-dla metallicities at low z. the primary reason for thedifference between the dlas and sub-dlas appears to be the dearth of metal-richdlas. we estimate the sub-dla contribution to the total metal budget usingmeasures of their metallicity and comoving gas density. these calculationssuggest that at z &lt;~ 1, the contribution of sub-dlas to the total metal budgetmay be several times that of dlas. at higher redshifts also, there areindications that the sub-dlas may contribute significantly to the cosmic metalbudget.

astro-ph;0608557	abundances and behavior of 12co, 13co, and c2 in translucent sight lines	using uv spectra obtained with fuse, hst, and/or iue, we determineinterstellar column densities of 12co, 13co, and/or c_2 for ten galactic sightlines with 0.37&lt;e(b-v)&lt;0.72. the n(co)/n(h_2) ratio varies over a factor of 100in this sample, due primarily to differences in n(co). for a given n(h_2),published models of diffuse and translucent clouds predict less co than isobserved. the j=1-3 rotational levels of 12co are sub-thermally populated inthese sight lines, with t_ex typically between 3 and 7 k. in general, there isno significant difference between the excitation temperatures of 12co and 13co.fits to the higher resolution co line profiles suggest that co (like cn) isconcentrated in relatively cold, dense gas. we obtain c_2 column densities fromthe f-x (1-0) and (0-0) bands (1314 and 1341 a), the d-x (0-0) band (2313 a),and the a-x (3-0) and (2-0) bands (7719 and 8757 a). comparisons among thosen(c_2) yield a set of mutually consistent f-values for the uv and optical c_2bands, but also reveal some apparent anomalies within the f-x (0-0) band. boththe kinetic temperature inferred from the c_2 rotational populations (up toj=18) and the excitation temperature t_02(c_2) are generally smaller than thecorresponding t_01(h_2). incorporating additional data for k i, hd, ch, c_2,c_3, cn, and co from the literature (for a total sample of 74 sight lines), wefind that (1) co is most tightly correlated with cn; (2) the ratios 12co/h_2and 13co/h_2 both are fairly tightly correlated with the density indicatorcn/ch (but c_2/h_2 is not); and (3) the ratio 12co/13co is somewhatanti-correlated with both cn/ch and n(co). sight lines with 12co/13co below theaverage local galactic value of 12c/13c appear to sample colder, denser gas inwhich isotope exchange reactions have enhanced 13co, relative to 12co.

astro-ph;0611836	detecting cold gas at intermediate redshifts: gmrt survey using mg ii  systems	intervening hi 21-cm absorption systems at z &gt; 1.0 are very rare and only 4confirmed detections have been reported in the literature. despite theirscarcity, they provide interesting and unique insights into the physicalconditions in the interstellar medium of high-z galaxies. moreover, they canprovide independent constraints on the variation of fundamental constants. wereport 3 new detections based on our ongoing giant metrewave radio telescope(gmrt) survey for 21-cm absorbers at 1.10&lt; z_abs&lt; 1.45 from candidate dampedlyman_alpha systems. the 21-cm lines are narrow for the z_abs = 1.3710 systemtowards sdss j0108-0037 and z_abs = 1.1726 system toward sdss j2358-1020. basedon line full-width at half maximum, the kinetic temperatures are &lt;= 5200 k and&lt;=800 k, respectively. the 21-cm absorption profile of the third system, z_abs=1.1908 system towards sdss j0804+3012, is shallow, broad and complex,extending up to 100 km/s. the centroids of the 21-cm lines are found to beshifted with respect to the corresponding centroids of the metal lines derivedfrom sdss spectra. this may mean that the 21-cm absorption is not associatedwith the strongest metal line component.

astro-ph;9702013	large-scale structure as seen from qso absorption-line systems	we study clustering on very large scales -- from several tens to hundreds ofcomoving mpc -- using an extensive catalog of heavy-element qso absorption-linesystems. we find significant evidence that c iv absorbers are clustered oncomoving scales of 100 $h^{-1}$ mpc ($q_0=0.5$) and less. the superclusteringis present even at high redshift ($z\sim 3$); furthermore, it does not appearthat the superclustering scale (comoving) has changed significantly since then.our estimate of that scale increases to 240 $h^{-1}$ mpc if $q_0=0.1$, which islarger than the largest scales of clustering seen at the present epoch. thismay be indicative of a larger value of $q_0$, and hence $\omega_0$. we identify7 high-redshift supercluster candidates, with 2 at redshift $z\sim 2.8$. theevolution of the correlation function on 50 $h^{-1}$ mpc scales is consistentwith that expected in cosmologies with $\omega_0= $ ranging from 0.1 to 1.finally, we find no evidence for clustering on scales greater than 100 $h^{-1}$mpc ($q_0=0.5$) or 240 $h^{-1}$ mpc ($q_0=0.1$).

astro-ph;9905234	the diffuse interstellar clouds toward 23 orionis	spectra obtained with the hubble space telescope ghrs are combined withhigh-resolution optical spectra and uv spectra from copernicus to study theabundances and physical conditions in the diffuse interstellar clouds seenalong the line of sight to the star 23 ori. strong low-velocity (slv)absorption, due to cool, moderately dense neutral gas and representing about92% of the total n(h i), is seen for various neutral and singly ionized speciesat +20 km/s &lt; v &lt; +26 km/s. weaker low-velocity absorption, probably largelydue to warmer neutral gas, is seen primarily for various singly ionized speciesat 0 km/s &lt; v &lt; +30 km/s. absorption from a number of singly and doubly ionizedspecies, perhaps due to a radiative shock, is seen at -108 km/s &lt; v &lt; -83 km/s.weak absorption components from ionized gas are seen at intermediate velocities(-43 km/s &lt; v &lt; -4 km/s). the large range in n_e (from 0.04 cm^{-3} to 0.95cm^{-3}) derived independently from nine pairs of neutral and singly ionizedspecies in the slv gas suggests that additional processes besides simplephotoionization and radiative recombination affect the ionization balance. theadopted average slv electron density, n_e = 0.15+/-0.05 cm^{-3}, implies arelatively large n_e/n_h ~ 0.01, and thus some ionization of hydrogen in thesepredominantly neutral components. comparisons of the slv depletions and n_hwith those found for the strong ``component b'' (v ~ -14 km/s) blend towardzeta oph hint at a possible relationship between depletion and local densityfor relatively cold interstellar clouds. calcium appears to be more severelydepleted in warm, low density gas than has generally been assumed. an appendixsummarizes the most reliable oscillator strengths currently available for anumber of the interstellar absorption lines analyzed in this work.
