0904.1231	high redshift dust obscured galaxies, a morphology-sed connection  revealed by keck adaptive optics	a simple optical to mid-ir color selection, r-[24] &gt; 14, i.e. f_nu(24) /f_nu(r) &gt; 1000, identifies highly dust obscured galaxies (dogs) with typicalredshifts of z~2 +/- 0.5. extreme mid-ir luminosities (l_{ir} &gt; 10^{12-14})suggest that dogs are powered by a combination of agn and star formation,possibly driven by mergers. in an effort to compare their photometricproperties with their rest frame optical morphologies, we obtained high spatialresolution (0.05 -0.1") keck adaptive optics (ao) k'-band images of 15 dogs.the images reveal a wide range of morphologies, including: small exponentialdisks (8 of 15), small ellipticals (4 of 15), and unresolved sources (2 of 15).one particularly diffuse source could not be classified because of low signalto noise ratio. we find a statistically significant correlation between galaxyconcentration and mid-ir luminosity, with the most luminous dogs exhibitinghigher concentration and smaller physical size. dogs with high concentrationalso tend to have spectral energy distributions (seds) suggestive of agnactivity. thus central agn light may be biasing the morphologies of the moreluminous dogs to higher concentration. conversely, more diffuse dogs tend toshow an sed shape suggestive of star formation. two of fifteen in the sampleshow multiple resolved components with separations of ~1 kpc, circumstantialevidence for ongoing mergers.

0905.1058	spitzer-irs study of the antennae galaxies ngc 4038/39	using the infrared spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope, we observedthe antennae galaxies obtaining spectral maps of the entire central region andhigh signal-to-noise 5-38 um spectra of the two galactic nuclei and sixinfrared-luminous regions. the total infrared luminosity of our six ir peaksplus the two nuclei is l_ir = 3.8x10^10 l_o, with their derived star formationrates ranging between 0.2 and 2 m_o/yr, with a total of 6.6 m_o/yr. the hardestand most luminous radiation originates from two compact clusters in thesouthern part of the overlap region, which also have the highest dusttemperatures. pah emission and other tracers of softer radiation are spatiallyextended throughout and beyond the overlap region, but regions with harder andintenser radiation field show a reduced pah strength. the strong h_2 emissionis rather confined around the nucleus of ngc 4039, where shocks appear to bethe dominant excitation mechanism, and the southern part of the overlap region,where it traces the most recent starburst activity. the luminosity ratiobetween the warm molecular gas (traced by the h_2 lines) and the total far-iremission is ~1.6x10^-4, similar to that found in many starburst and ulirgs. thetotal mass of warm h_2 in the antennae is 2.5x10^7 m_o, with a fraction of warmto total h_2 gas mass of about 0.35%. the average warm h_2 temperature is302+/-26 k and appears anti-correlated with the radiation field hardness,possibly due to an evolution of the pdr morphology. the previously reportedtight correlation between the h_2 and pah emission was not found but highertotal pah emission to continuum ratios were found in pdrs with warmer gas.

0905.1124	unusual dust emission from planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic study of a sample of 25planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds. the low-resolution modules are usedto analyze the dust features present in the infrared spectra. this studycomplements a previous work by the same authors where the same sample wasanalyzed in terms of neon and sulfur abundances. over half of the objects (14)show emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, typical of carbon-rich dustenvironments. we compare the hydrocarbon emission in our objects to those ofgalactic hii regions and planetary nebulae, and lmc/smc hii regions. amorphoussilicates are seen in just two objects, enforcing the now well-known-fact thatoxygen-rich dust is less common at low metallicities. besides these commonfeatures, some planetary nebulae show very unusual dust. nine objects show astrong silicon carbide feature at 11um and twelve of them show magnesiumsulfide emission starting at 25um. the high percentage of spectra with siliconcarbide in the magellanic clouds is not common. two objects show a broad bandwhich may be attributed to hydrogenated amorphous carbon and weaklow-excitation atomic lines. it is likely that these nebulae are very young.the spectra of the remaining eight nebulae are dominated by the emission offine-structure lines with a weak continuum due to thermal emission of dust,although in a few cases the s/n in the spectra is low, and weak dust featuresmay not have been detected.

(k-[24]) colors are determined using kmagnitudes from the 2mass survey for all stars in order to search for excess 24um luminosity compared to that arising from the stellar photosphere. of thecombined sample of 268 stars, 141 are of spectral types f, g, or k, and 17 ofthese 141 stars have 24 um excesses with (k-[24]) &gt; 0.2 mag. using limits onabsolute magnitude derived from proper motions, at least 8 of the fgk starswith excesses are main sequence stars, and estimates derived from thedistribution of apparent magnitudes indicate that all 17 are main sequencestars. these estimates lead to the conclusion that between 9% and 17% of themain sequence fgk field stars in these samples have 24 um infrared excesses.this result is statistically similar to the fraction of stars with debris disksfound among previous spitzer targeted observations of much brighter, mainsequence field stars.

0905.1956	an evolutionary paradigm for dusty active galaxies at low redshift	we apply methods from bayesian inferencing and graph theory to a dataset of102 mid-infrared spectra, and archival data from the optical to the millimeter,to construct an evolutionary paradigm for z&lt;0.4 infrared-luminous galaxies(ulirgs). we propose that the ulirg lifecycle consists of three phases. thefirst phase lasts from the initial encounter until approximately coalescence.it is characterized by homogeneous mid-ir spectral shapes, and ir emissionmainly from star formation, with a contribution from an agn in some cases. atthe end of this phase, a ulirg enters one of two evolutionary paths dependingon the dynamics of the merger, the available quantities of gas, and the massesof the black holes in the progenitors. on one branch, the contributions fromthe starburst and the agn to the total ir luminosity decline and increaserespectively. the ir spectral shapes are heterogeneous, likely due to feedbackfrom agn-driven winds. some objects go through a brief qso phase at the end. onthe other branch, the decline of the starburst relative to the agn is lesspronounced, and few or no objects go through a qso phase. we show that the 11.2micron pah feature is a remarkably good diagnostic of evolutionary phase, andidentify six ulirgs that may be archetypes of key stages in this lifecycle.

0704.1518	crystalline silicates and dust processing in the protoplanetary disks of  the taurus young cluster	we characterize the crystalline silicate content and spatial distribution ofsmall dust grains in a large sample of protoplanetary disks in thetaurus-auriga young cluster, using spitzer space telescope mid-infraredspectra. in turn we use the results to analyze the evolution of structure andcomposition of these 1-2 myr-old disks around solar- and later-type youngstars, and test the standard models of dust processing which result in theconversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. we find strong evidenceof evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of thestructure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fractionis strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. we also confirm thatthe crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r &lt; 10 au. however, wesee no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar massor luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, aswould be expected in the standard models of dust processing based uponphoto-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,accretion-heating-driven annealing at r &lt; 1 au, or spiral-shock heating at r &lt;10 au, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. either anothergrain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must beat work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. we propose oneof each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely x-ray heatingand annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure bygiant-planetary formation and migration.

0707.2962	decomposing dusty galaxies. i. multi-component spectral energy  distribution fitting	we present a new multi-component spectral energy distribution (sed)decomposition method and use it to analyze the ultraviolet to millimeterwavelength seds of a sample of dusty infrared-luminous galaxies. seds areconstructed from spectroscopic and photometric data obtained with the spitzerspace telescope, in conjunction with photometry from the literature. each sedis decomposed into emission from populations of stars, an agn accretion disk,pahs, atomic and molecular lines, and distributions of graphite and silicategrains. decompositions of the seds of the template starburst galaxies ngc7714and ngc2623 and the template agns pg0804+761 and mrk463 provide baselineproperties to aid in quantifying the strength of star-formation and accretionin the composite systems ngc6240 and mrk1014. we find that obscured radiationfrom stars is capable of powering the total dust emission from ngc6240,although we cannot rule out a contribution from a deeply embedded agn visibleonly in x-rays. the decomposition of mrk1014 is consistent with ~65% of itspower emerging from an agn and ~35% from star-formation. we suggest that manyof the variations in our template starburst seds may be explained in terms ofthe different mean optical depths through the clouds of dust surrounding theyoung stars within each galaxy. prompted by the divergent far-ir properties ofour template agns, we suggest that variations in the relative orientation oftheir agn accretion disks with respect to the disks of the galaxies hostingthem may result in different amounts of agn-heated cold dust emission emergingfrom their host galaxies. we estimate that 30-50% of the far-ir and pahemission from mrk1014 may originate from such agn-heated material in its hostgalaxy disk.

0707.4190	pah emission from ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we explore the relationships between the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) feature strengths, mid-infrared continuum luminosities, far-infraredspectral slopes, optical spectroscopic classifications, and silicate opticaldepths within a sample of 107 ulirgs observed with the infrared spectrograph onthe spitzer space telescope. the detected 6.2 micron pah equivalent widths(eqws) in the sample span more than two orders of magnitude (0.006-0.8 micron),and ulirgs with hii-like optical spectra or steep far-infrared spectral slopes(s_{25} / s_{60} &lt; 0.2) typically have 6.2 micron pah eqws that are half thatof lower-luminosity starbursts. a significant fraction (~40-60%) of hii-like,liner-like, and cold ulirgs have very weak pah eqws. many of these ulirgs alsohave large (tau_{9.7} &gt; 2.3) silicate optical depths. the far-infrared spectralslope is strongly correlated with pah eqw, but not with silicate optical depth.in addition, the pah eqw decreases with increasing rest-frame 24 micronluminosity. we argue that this trend results primarily from dilution of the paheqw by continuum emission from dust heated by a compact central source,probably an agn. high luminosity, high-redshift sources studied with spitzerappear to have a much larger range in pah eqw than seen in local ulirgs, whichis consistent with extremely luminous starburst systems being absent at lowredshift, but present at early epochs.

(there are anadditional 19 galactic stars with f_{\nu}(24um) &gt; 10mjy in the survey area.)using a relation between 7.7um pah luminosity and star formation rate derivedfrom previous irs observations of starbursts, the star formation rate per unitvolume of the local universe (sfrd) is determined from the complete sample andis found to be 0.008 \mdot mpc^{-3}. individual sources in the sample have starformation rates from 0.14 to 160 \mdot. the derived value for the local sfrd isabout half that of the local sfrd deduced from bolometric luminosities of theiras 60um bright galaxy sample, with the deficiency being at lower luminositiesand arising primarily from the small number of low luminosity sources in the 10mjy sample. the agreement for higher luminosities confirms the validity ofusing the 7.7um pah feature as a measure of sfrd in the high redshift universe,where this is often the only indicator available for faint sources.

0709.3292	neon and sulfur abundances of planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds	the chemical abundances of neon and sulfur for 25 planetary nebulae (pne) inthe magellanic clouds are presented. these abundances have been derived usingmainly infrared data from the spitzer space telescope. the implications for thechemical evolution of these elements are discussed. a comparison with similarlyobtained abundances of galactic pne and hii regions and magellanic clouds hiiregions is also given. the average neon abundances are 6.0x10(-5) and2.7x10(-5) for the pne in the large and small magellanic clouds respectively.these are ~1/3 and 1/6 of the average abundances of galactic planetary nebulaeto which we compare. the average sulfur abundances for the lmc and smc arerespectively 2.7x10(-6) and 1.0x10(-6). the ne/s ratio (23.5) is on averagehigher than the ratio found in galactic pne (16) but the range of values inboth data sets is similar for most of the objects. the neon abundances found inpne and hii regions agree with each other. it is possible that a few (3-4) ofthe pne in the sample have experienced some neon enrichment, but for two ofthese objects the high ne/s ratio can be explained by their very low sulfurabundances. the neon and sulfur abundances derived in this paper are alsocompared to previously published abundances using optical data andphoto-ionization models.

1208.1306	the dust and gas content of carbon stars toward the galactic halo	we present spitzer irs spectra of four carbon stars located in the galactichalo and the thick disc. the spectra display typical features of carbon starswith sic dust emission and c$_2$h$_2$ molecular absorption. dust radiativetransfer models and infrared colors enable us to determine the dust productionrates for these stars whilst prior co measurements yield expansion velocitiesand total mass-loss rates.  the gas properties (low expansion velocities (around 7 km/s) and strongc$_2$h$_2$ molecular absorption bands) are consistent with the stars beingmetal-poor. however the dust content of these stars (strong sic emission bands)is very similar to what is observed in metal-rich carbon stars. the strong sicemission may indicate that the carbon stars derive from a metal-richpopulation, or that these agb stars produce silicon.  the origin of the halo carbon stars is not known. they may be extrinsinc halostars belonging to the halo population, they may have been accreted from asatellite galaxy such as the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, or they maybe escapees from the galactic disk. if the stars are intrinsically metal-rich,an origin in the disc would be most likely. if an $\alpha$-element enhancementcan be confirmed, it would argue for an origin in the halo (which is known tobe $\alpha$-enhanced) or a galactic satellite.

0801.1842	the nature of star formation in distant ultraluminous infrared galaxies  selected in a remarkably narrow redshift range	we present mid-infrared spectra of thirty two high redshift ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, selected via the stellar photospheric feature at rest-frame1.6um, and an observed-frame 24um flux of &gt;500mujy. nearly all the samplereside in a redshift range of &lt;z&gt;=1.71+/-0.15, and have rest-frame 1-1000umluminosities of 10^12.9 - 10^13.8 lsun. most of the spectra exhibit prominentpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, and weak silicateabsorption, consistent with a starburst origin for the ir emission. ourselection method appears to be a straightforward and efficient way of findingdistant, ir-luminous, star-forming galaxies in narrow redshift ranges. there ishowever evidence that the mid-ir spectra of our sample differ systematicallyfrom those of local ulirgs; our sample have comparable pah equivalent widthsbut weaker apparent silicate absorption, and (possibly) enhanced pah6.2um/7.7um and 6.2um/11.2um flux ratios. furthermore, the composite mid-irspectrum of our sample is almost identical to that of local starbursts with irluminosities of 10^10-10^11 lsun rather than that of local ulirgs. thesedifferences are consistent with a reduced dust column, which can plausibly beobtained via some combination of (1) star formation that is extended overspatial scales of 1-4kpc, and (2) star formation in unusually gas-rich regions.

0803.1828	chemical abundances and dust in planetary nebulae in the galactic bulge	we present mid-infrared spitzer spectra of eleven planetary nebulae in thegalactic bulge. we derive argon, neon, sulfur, and oxygen abundances for themusing mainly infrared line fluxes combined with some optical line fluxes fromthe literature. due to the high extinction toward the bulge, the infraredspectra allow us to determine abundances for certain elements more accuratelythat previously possible with optical data alone. abundances of argon andsulfur (and in most cases neon and oxygen) in planetary nebulae in the bulgegive the abundances of the interstellar medium at the time their progenitorstars formed; thus these abundances give information about the formation andevolution of the bulge. the abundances of bulge planetary nebulae tend to beslightly higher than those in the disk on average, but they do not follow thetrend of the disk planetary nebulae, thus confirming the difference betweenbulge and disk evolution. additionally, the bulge planetary nebulae showpeculiar dust properties compared to the disk nebulae. oxygen-rich dust feature(crystalline silicates) dominate the spectra of all of the bulge planetarynebulae; such features are more scarce in disk nebulae. additionally,carbon-rich dust features (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) appear in roughlyhalf of the bulge planetary nebulae in our sample, which is interesting inlight of the fact that this dual chemistry is comparatively rare in the milkyway as a whole.

1408.5922	spectral calibration in the mid-infrared: challenges and solutions	we present spectra obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope of 33 k giants and 20 a dwarfs to assess theirsuitability as spectrophotometric standard stars. the k giants confirm previousfindings that the strength of the sio absorption band at 8 um increases forboth later optical spectral classes and redder (b-v)_0 colors, but withconsiderable scatter. for k giants, the synthetic spectra underpredict thestrengths of the molecular bands from sio and oh. for these reasons, theassumed true spectra for k giants should be based on neither the assumptionthat molecular band strengths in the infrared can be predicted accurately fromoptical spectral class or color nor synthetric spectra. the oh bands in kgiants grow stronger with cooler stellar temperatures, and they are strongerthan predicted by synthetic spectra. as a group, a dwarfs are better behavedand more predictable than the k giants, but they are more likely to show redexcesses from debris disks. no suitable a dwarfs were located in parts of thesky continuously observable from spitzer, and with previous means of estimatingthe true spectra of k giants ruled out, it was necessary to use models of adwarfs to calibrate spectra of k giants from observed spectral ratios of thetwo groups and then use the calibrated k giants as standards for the fulldatabase of infrared spectra from spitzer. we also describe a lingeringartifact that affects the spectra of faint blue sources at 24 um.

0807.1115	morphologies of high redshift, dust obscured galaxies from keck laser  guide star adaptive optics	spitzer mips images in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyhave revealed a class of extremely dust obscured galaxy (dog) at z~2. the dogsare defined by very red optical to mid-ir (observed-frame) colors, r - [24 um]&gt; 14 mag, i.e. f_v (24 um) / f_v (r) &gt; 1000. they are ultra-luminous infraredgalaxies with l_8-1000 um &gt; 10^12 -10^14 l_sun, but typically have very faintoptical (rest-frame uv) fluxes. we imaged three dogs with the keck laser guidestar adaptive optics (lgsao) system, obtaining ~0.06'' resolution in thek'-band. one system was dominated by a point source, while the other two wereclearly resolved. of the resolved sources, one can be modeled as a exponentialdisk system. the other is consistent with a de vaucouleurs profile typical ofelliptical galaxies. the non-parametric measures of their concentration andasymmetry, show the dogs to be both compact and smooth. the ao images rule outdouble nuclei with separations of greater than 0.1'' (&lt; 1 kpc at z=2), makingit unlikely that ongoing major mergers (mass ratios of 1/3 and greater) aretriggering the high ir luminosities. by contrast, high resolution images of z~2scuba sources tend to show multiple components and a higher degree ofasymmetry. we compare near-ir morphologies of the dogs with a set of z=1luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs; l_ir ~ 10^11 l_sun) imaged with keck lgsaoby the center for adaptive optics treasury survey. the dogs in our sample havesignificantly smaller effective radii, ~1/4 the size of the z=1 lirgs, and tendtowards higher concentrations. the small sizes and high concentrations may helpexplain the globally obscured rest-frame blue-to-uv emission of the dogs.

0807.2998	the magellanic zoo: mid-infrared spitzer spectroscopy of evolved stars  and circumstellar dust in the magellanic clouds	we observed a sample of evolved stars in the large and small magellanicclouds (lmc and smc) with the infrared spectrograph on the spitzer spacetelescope. comparing samples from the smc, lmc, and the galaxy reveals that thedust-production rate depends on metallicity for oxygen-rich stars, but carbonstars with similar pulsation properties produce similar quantities of dust,regardless of their initial metallicity. other properties of the oxygen-richstars also depend on metallicity. as the metallicity decreases, the fraction ofnaked (i.e. dust-free) stars increases, and among the naked stars, the strengthof the 8 um absorption band from sio decreases. our sample includes severalmassive stars in the lmc with long pulsation periods which produce significantamounts of dust, probably because they are young and relatively metal rich.little alumina dust is seen in circumstellar shells in the smc and lmc, unlikein galactic samples. three oxygen-rich sources also show emission frommagnesium-rich crystalline silicates. many also show an emission feature at 14um. the one s star in our sample shows a newly detected emission featurecentered at 13.5 um. at lower metallicity, carbon stars with similar amounts ofamorphous carbon in their shells have stronger absorption from molecularacetylene (c_2h_2) and weaker emission from sic and mgs dust, as discovered inprevious studies.

astro-ph;0502144	spitzer observations of optically "invisible" radio and x-ray sources:  high redshift agn	we have combined a survey at 24 microns to 0.3 mjy with the multiband imagingphotometer (mips) on the spitzer space telescope, a 20 cm a-array vla surveycovering 0.5 deg^2, and an existing 172 ks chandra x-ray observatory exposureto investigate the nature of optically faint radio and x-ray sources in thenoao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs) in bootes. we find little overlap betweenthe radio and infrared selected populations: only 9% of the infrared sourcesare detected in the radio and only 33% of the radio sources are detected in theinfrared. thirty-six (10%) of the 377 compact radio sources lack opticalcounterparts in the ndwfs bw, r, &amp; i images. we refer to these objects asoptically invisible radio sources (oirs). only four of the thirty-one oirssobserved with mips are detected at 24 microns. comparisons of the radio andinfrared properties of the oirss with various galaxy spectral energydistributions demonstrate that most of these sources are powered by agn ratherthan starbursts. similarly, eleven x-ray sources observed by both mips and thevla are classified as optically invisible x-ray sources (oixs). none aredetected at 24 microns or 20 cm. all seven oixss detected in chandra's 0.5-2kev band have infrared to x-ray flux ratios consistent with their luminositybeing dominated by an unobscured agn. from these results we conclude that boththe optically invisible radio and x-ray source populations are primarily agn,relatively unaffected by dust and most likely at z &gt; 1. no oirss are detectedin x-ray emission and no oixss are detected at 20 cm. however, given the widerange in radio and x-ray properties of known agn and the size of our samples,this lack of overlap does not necessarily imply agn source populations.

astro-ph;0509859	the detection of crystalline silicates in ultra-luminous infrared  galaxies	silicates are an important component of interstellar dust and the structureof these grains -- amorphous versus crystalline -- is sensitive to the localphysical conditions. we have studied the infrared spectra of a sample ofultra-luminous infrared galaxies. here, we report the discovery of weak, narrowabsorption features at 11, 16, 19, 23, and 28 microns, characteristic ofcrystalline silicates, superimposed on the broad absorption bands at 10 and 18microns due to amorphous silicates in a subset of this sample. these featuresbetray the presence of forsterite (mg_2sio_4), the magnesium-rich end member ofthe olivines. previously, crystalline silicates have only been observed incircumstellar environments. the derived fraction of forsterite to amorphoussilicates is typically 0.1 in these ulirgs. this is much larger than the upperlimit for this ratio in the interstellar medium of the milky way, 0.01. theseresults suggest that the timescale for injection of crystalline silicates intothe ism is short in a merger-driven starburst environment (e.g., as compared tothe total time to dissipate the gas), pointing towards massive stars as aprominent source of crystalline silicates. furthermore, amorphization due tocosmic rays, which is thought to be of prime importance for the local ism, lagsin vigorous starburst environments.

astro-ph;0605464	mid-infrared spectroscopy of disks around classical t tauri stars	we present the first spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs; the irs was acollaborative venture between cornell university and ball aerospace corporationfunded by nasa through the jet propulsion laboratory and the ames researchcenter.) observations of the disks around classical t tauri stars: spectra inthe 5.2-30 micron range of six stars. the spectra are dominated by emissionfeatures from amorphous silicate dust, and a continuous component from 5 to 8microns that in most cases comprises an excess above the photosphere throughoutour spectral range. there is considerable variation in the silicatefeature/continuum ratio, which implies variations of inclination, disk flaring,and stellar mass accretion rate. in most of our stars, structure in thesilicate feature suggests the presence of a crystalline component. in one, cokutau/4, no excess above the photosphere appears at wavelengths shortward of thesilicate features, similar to 10 myr old tw hya, hen 3-600, and hr 4796a. thisindicates the optically thick inner disk is largely absent. the silicateemission features with peaks at 9.7 and 18 microns indicate small dust grainsare present. the extremely low 10-20 micron color temperature of the dustexcess, 135 k, indicates these grains are located more than 10 au from thestar. these features are suggestive of gravitational influence by planets orclose stellar companions and grain growth in the region within 10 au of thestar, somewhat surprising for a star this young (1 myr).

astro-ph;0605639	a spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) spectral sequence of m, l, and t  dwarfs	we present a low-resolution (r = 90), 5.5-38 micron spectral sequence of asample of m, l, and t dwarfs obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard the spitzer space telescope. the spectra exhibit prominent absorptionbands of h_2o at 6.27 microns, ch_4 at 7.65 microns, and nh_3 at 10.5 micronsand are relatively featureless at lambda &gt; 15 microns. three spectral indicesthat measure the strengths of these bands are presented; h_2o absorptionfeatures are present throughout the mlt sequence while the ch_4 and nh_3 bandsfirst appear at roughly the l/t transition. although the spectra are, ingeneral, qualitatively well matched by synthetic spectra that include theformation of spatially homogeneous silicate and iron condensate clouds, thespectra of the mid-type l dwarfs show an unexpected flattening from roughly 9to 11 microns. we hypothesize that this may be a result of a population ofsmall silicate grains that are not predicted in the cloud models. the spectrumof the peculiar t6 dwarf 2mass j0937+2931 is suppressed from 5.5-7.5 micronsrelative to typical t6 dwarfs and may be a consequence of its mildlymetal-poor/high surface gravity atmosphere. finally, we compute bolometricluminosities of a subsample of the m, l, and t dwarfs by combining the irsspectra with previously published 0.6-4.1 micron spectra and find goodagreement with the values of golimowski et al. who use l'- and m'-bandphotometry and to account for the flux emitted at lambda &gt; 2.5 microns.

astro-ph;0609024	the mid-ir properties of starburst galaxies from spitzer-irs  spectroscopy	we present 5-38um mid-infrared spectra at a spectral resolution of r~65-130of a large sample of 22 starburst nuclei taken with the infrared spectrographirs on board the spitzer space telescope. the spectra show a vast range instarburst seds. the silicate absorption ranges from essentially no absorptionto heavily obscured systems with an optical depth of tau(9.8um)~5. the spectralslopes can be used to discriminate between starburst and agn powered sources.the monochromatic continuum fluxes at 15um and 30um enable a remarkablyaccurate estimate of the total infrared luminosity of the starburst. we findthat the pah equivalent width is independent of the total starburst luminosityl_ir as both continuum and pah feature scale proportionally. however, theluminosity of the 6.2um feature scales with l_ir and can be used to approximatethe total infrared luminosity of the starburst. although our starburst samplecovers about a factor of ten difference in the [neiii]/[neii] ratio, we foundno systematic correlation between the radiation field hardness and the pahequivalent width or the 7.7um/11.3um pah ratio. these results are based onspatially integrated diagnostics over an entire starburst region, and localvariations may be ``averaged out''. it is presumably due to this effect thatunresolved starburst nuclei with significantly different global propertiesappear spectrally as rather similar members of one class of objects.

astro-ph;0610218	observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies with the infrared  spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope ii: the iras bright galaxy sample	we present spectra taken with the infrared spectrograph on spitzer coveringthe 5-38 micron region of the ten ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs)found in the iras bright galaxy sample. among the bgs ulirgs, we find a factorof 50 spread in the rest-frame mid to far-infrared spectral slope. the 9.7micron silicate optical depths range from less than 0.4 more than 4.2, implyingline of sight extinctions of a(v) ~ 8 - 78 mag. there is evidence for water iceand hydrocarbon absorption and c2h2 and hcn absorption features in four andpossibly six of the 10 bgs ulirgs, indicating shielded molecular clouds and awarm, dense ism. we have detected [nev] emission in three of the ten bgsulirgs, at flux levels of 5-18e-14 erg/cm^2/sec and [nev] 14.3/[neii] 12.8 lineflux ratios of 0.12-0.85. the remaining bgs ulirgs have limits on their[nev]/[neii] line flux ratios which range from less than 0.15 to less than0.01. among the bgs ulirgs, the agn fractions implied by either the[nev]/[neii] or [oiv]/[neii] line flux ratios (or their upper limits) aresignificantly lower than implied by the mir slope or eqw of the 6.2 micron pahfeature. fitting the seds, we see evidence for hot (t &gt; 300k) dust in five ofthe bgs ulirgs, with the fraction of hot dust to total dust luminosity rangingfrom ~1-23%, before correcting for extinction. when integrated over the irac-8,irs blue peakup, and mips-24 filter bandpasses, the irs spectra imply very bluecolors for some ulirgs at z ~ 1.3. this is most extreme for sources withsignificant amounts of warm dust and deep silicate absorption.

astro-ph;0611458	deep mid-infrared silicate absorption as a diagnostic of obscuring  geometry toward galactic nuclei	the silicate cross section peak near 10um produces emission and absorptionfeatures in the spectra of dusty galactic nuclei observed with the spitzerspace telescope. especially in ultraluminous infrared galaxies, the observedabsorption feature can be extremely deep, as iras 08572+3915 illustrates. aforeground screen of obscuration cannot reproduce this observed feature, evenat large optical depth. instead, the deep absorption requires a nuclear sourceto be deeply embedded in a smooth distribution of material that is bothgeometrically and optically thick. in contrast, a clumpy medium can produceonly shallow absorption or emission, which are characteristic ofoptically-identified active galactic nuclei. in general, the geometry of thedusty region and the total optical depth, rather than the grain composition orheating spectrum, determine the silicate feature's observable properties. theapparent optical depth calculated from the ratio of line to continuum emissiongenerally fails to accurately measure the true optical depth. the obscuringgeometry, not the nature of the embedded source, also determines the far-irspectral shape.

astro-ph;0612509	the distribution of silicate strength in spitzer spectra of agns and  ulirgs	a sample of 196 agns and ulirgs observed by the infrared spectrograph (irs)on spitzer is analyzed to study the distribution of the strength of the 9.7micron silicate feature. average spectra are derived for quasars, seyfert 1 andseyfert 2 agns, and ulirgs. we find that quasars are characterized by silicatefeatures in emission and seyfert 1s equally by emission or weak absorption.seyfert 2s are dominated by weak silicate absorption, and ulirgs arecharacterized by strong silicate absorption (mean apparent optical depth about1.5). luminosity distributions show that luminosities at rest frame 5.5 micronare similar for the most luminous quasars and ulirgs and are almost 10^5 timesmore luminous than the least luminous agn in the sample. the distributions ofspectral characteristics and luminosities are compared to those of opticallyfaint infrared sources at z~2 being discovered by the irs, which are alsocharacterized by strong silicate absorption. it is found that local ulirgs area similar population, although they have lower luminosities and somewhatstronger absorption compared to the high redshift sources.

astro-ph;0612748	infrared molecular starburst fingerprints in deeply obscured (u)lirg  nuclei	high resolution spectra of the spitzer space telescope showvibration-rotation absorption bands of gaseous c2h2, hcn, and co2 moleculestoward a sample of deeply obscured (u)lirg nuclei. the observed bands revealthe presence of dense (n&gt;~ 10^7 cm^-3), warm (t_ex = 200-700 k) molecular gaswith high column densities of these molecules ranging from a few 10^15 - 10^17cm^-2. abundances relative to h2, inferred from the silicate optical depth,range from ~10^-7 to 10^-6 and show no correlation with temperature.theoretical studies show that the high abundances of both c2h2 and hcn excludea x-ray dominated region (xdr) associated with the toroid surrounding an agn asthe origin of this dense warm molecular gas. galactic massive protostars in theso-called hot core phase have similar physical characteristics with comparablehigh abundances of c2h2, hcn, and co2 in the hot phase. however, the abundancesof c2h2 and hcn and the c2h2/co2 and hcn/co2 ratios are much higher toward the(u)lirgs in the cooler (t_ex &lt;= 400 k) phase. we suggest that the warm densemolecular gas revealed by the mid-ir absorption lines is associated with aphase of deeply embedded star formation where the extreme pressures anddensities of the nuclear starburst environment have inhibited the expansion ofhii regions and the global disruption of the star forming molecular cloudcores, and `trapped' the star formation process in an `extended' hot corephase.
