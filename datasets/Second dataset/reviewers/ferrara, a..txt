0902.4071	interpreting the transmission windows of distant quasars	we propose the apparent shrinking criterion (asc) to interpret the spatialextent, r_w, of transmitted flux windows in the absorption spectra of high-zquasars. the asc can discriminate between the two regimes in which r_wcorresponds either to the physical size, r_hii, of the quasar hii region, or tothe distance, r^{max}_w, at which the transmitted flux drops to =0.1 and agunn-peterson (gp) trough appears. in the first case (hr regime), one candetermine the igm mean hi fraction, x_hi; in the second (pr regime), the valueof r_w allows to measure the local photoionization rate and the localenhancement of the photoionization rate, gamma_g, due to nearby/interveninggalaxies. the asc has been tested against radiative transfer+sph numericalsimulations, and applied to 15 high-z (z&gt;5.8) quasars sample from fan et al.(2006). all sample quasars are found to be in the pr regime; hence, theirobserved spectral properties (inner flux profile, extent of transmissionwindow) cannot reliably constrain the value of x_hi. four sample quasars showevidence for a local enhancement (up to 50%) in the local photoionization ratepossibly produced by a galaxy overdensity. we discuss the possibleinterpretations and uncertainties of this result.

0903.0346	wimp annihilation effects on primordial star formation	we study the effects of wimp dark matter (dm) annihilations on the thermaland chemical evolution of the gaseous clouds where the first generation ofstars in the universe is formed. we follow the collapse of the gas inside atypical halo virializing at very high redshift, from well before virializationuntil a stage where the heating from dm annihilations exceeds the gas coolingrate. the dm energy input is estimated by inserting the energy released by dmannihilations (as predicted by an adiabatic contraction of the original dmprofile) in a spherically symmetric radiative transfer scheme. in addition tothe heating effects of the energy absorbed, we include its feedback upon thechemical properties of the gas, which is critical to determine the cooling ratein the halo, and hence the fragmentation scale and jeans mass of the firststars. we find that dm annihilation does alter the free electron and especiallythe h2 fraction when the gas density is n&gt;~ 10^4 cm^-3, for our fiducialparameter values. however, even if the change in the h2 abundance and thecooling efficiency of the gas is large (sometimes exceeding a factor 100), theeffects on the temperature of the collapsing gas are far smaller (a reductionby a factor &lt;~1.5), since the gas cooling rate depends very strongly ontemperature: then, the fragmentation mass scale is reduced only slightly,hinting towards no dramatic change in the initial mass function of the firststars.

0907.0337	lyman alpha emitter evolution in the reionization epoch	combining cosmological sph simulations with a previously developed lymanalpha production/transmission model and the early reionization model (erm,reionization ends at redshift z~7), we obtain lyman alpha and uv luminosityfunctions (lfs) for lyman alpha emitters (laes) for redshifts between 5.7 and7.6. matching model results to observations at z~5.7 requires escape fractionsof lyman alpha, f_alpha=0.3, and uv (non-ionizing) continuum photons, f_c=0.22,corresponding to a color excess, e(b-v)=0.15. we find that (i) f_c increasestowards higher redshifts, due the decreasing mean dust content of galaxies,(ii) the evolution of f_alpha/f_c hints at the dust content of the ism becomingprogressively inhomogeneous/clumped with decreasing redshift. the clusteringphotoionization boost is important during the initial reionization phases buthas little effect on the lyman alpha lf for a highly ionized igm. halo(stellar) masses are in the range 10.0 &lt; \log m_h &lt; 11.8 (8.1 &lt; \log m_* &lt;10.4) with m_h \propto m_*^{0.64}. the star formation rates are between 3-120solar masses per year, mass-weighted mean ages are greater than 20 myr at allredshifts, while the mean stellar metallicity increases from z=0.12 to 0.22solar metallicity from z~7.6 to z~5.7; both age and metallicity positivelycorrelate with stellar mass. the brightest laes are all characterized by largestar formation rates and intermediate ages (~200 myr), while objects in thefaint end of the lyman alpha lf show large age and star formation rate spreads.with no more free parameters, the spectral energy distributions of three lae atz~5.7 observed by lai et al.

0908.4279	mining the galactic halo for very metal-poor stars	we study the age and metallicity distribution function (mdf) of metal-poorstars in the milky way halo as a function of galactocentric radius by combiningn-body simulations and semi-analytical methods. we find that the oldest starspopulate the innermost region, while extremely metal-poor stars are moreconcentrated within r &lt; 60 kpc. the mdf of [fe/h] &lt; -2 stars varies only veryweakly within the central 50 kpc, while the relative contribution of [fe/h] &lt;-2 stars strongly increases with r, varying from 16% within 7 kpc &lt; r &lt; 20 kpcup to &gt; 40% for r &gt; 20 kpc. this is due to the faster descent of the spatialdistribution (as seen from earth) of the more enriched population. this impliesthat the outer halo &lt; 40 kpc is the best region to search for very metal-poorstars. beyond ~ 60 kpc the density of [fe/h] &lt; -2 stars is maximum within dwarfgalaxies. all these features are imprinted by a combination of (i) thevirialization epoch of the star-forming haloes, and (ii) the metal enrichmenthistory of the milky way environment.

0707.1433	population iii stars: hidden or disappeared ?	a popiii/pop ii transition from massive to normal stars is predicted to occurwhen the metallicity of the star forming gas crosses the critical range z_cr =10^(-5 +/- 1) z_sun. to investigate the cosmic implications of such process weuse numerical simulations which follow the evolution, metal enrichment andenergy deposition of both pop iii and pop ii stars. we find that: (i) due toinefficient heavy element transport by outflows and slow "genetic" transmissionduring hierarchical growth, large fluctuations around the average metallicityarise; as a result pop iii star formation continues down to z=2.5, but at a lowpeak rate of 10^-5 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 occurring at z~6 (about 10^-4 of thepopii one); (ii) pop iii star formation proceeds in a "inside-out" mode inwhich formation sites are progressively confined at the periphery of collapsedstructures, where the low gas density and correspondingly long free-falltimescales result in a very inefficient astration. these conclusions stronglyencourage deep searches for pristine star formation sites at moderate (2&lt;z&lt;5)redshifts where metal free stars are likely to be hidden.

0912.2693	constraining cosmic reionization with quasar, gamma ray burst, and lya  emitter observations	we investigate the cosmic reionization history by comparing semi-analyticalmodels of the lya forest with observations of high-z quasars and gamma raybursts absorption spectra. in order to constrain the reionization epoch z_rei,we consider two physically motivated scenarios in which reionization endseither early (erm, z_rei&gt;= 7) or late (lrm, z_rei~6). we analyze thetransmitted flux in a sample of 17 quasars spectra at 5.7&lt;z&lt;6.4 and in thespectrum of the gamma ray burst 050904 at z=6.3, studying the wide darkportions (gaps) in the observed absorption spectra. by comparing the statisticsof these spectral features with our models, we conclude that currentobservational data do not require any sudden change in the ionization state ofthe igm at z~6, favouring indeed a highly ionized universe at these epochs, aspredicted by the erm. moreover, we test the predictions of this model throughlya emitters observations, finding that the erm provide a good fit to theevolution of the luminosity function of lya emitting galaxies in the redshiftrange z=5.7-6.5. the overall result points towards an extended reionizationprocess which starts at z&gt;=11 and completes at z_rei&gt;=7, in agreement with therecent wmap5 data.

1003.0676	first star formation with dark matter annihilation	we include an energy term based on dark matter (dm) self-annihilation duringthe cooling and subsequent collapse of the metal-free gas, in halos hosting theformation of the first stars in the universe. we have found that the feedbackinduced on the chemistry of the cloud does modify the properties of the gasthroughout the collapse. however, the modifications are not dramatic, and thetypical jeans mass within the halo is conserved throughout the collapse, forall the dm parameters we have considered. this result implies that the presenceof dark matter annihilations does not substantially modify the initial massfunction of the first stars, with respect to the standard case in which suchadditional energy term is not taken into account. we have also found that whenthe rate of energy produced by the dm annihilations and absorbed by the gasequals the chemical cooling (at densities yet far from the actual formation ofa proto-stellar core) the structure does not halt its collapse, although thatproceeds more slowly by a factor smaller than few per cent of the totalcollapse time.

1003.3873	simulating high-redshift galaxies	recent observations have gathered a considerable sample of high redshiftgalaxy candidates and determined the evolution of their luminosity function(lf). to interpret these findings, we use cosmological sph simulationsincluding, in addition to standard physical processes, a detailed treatment ofthe pop iii-pop ii transition in early objects. the simulated high-z galaxiesmatch remarkably well the amplitude and slope of the observed lf in theredshift range 5&lt;z&lt;10. the lf shifts towards fainter luminosities withincreasing redshift, while its faint-end slope keeps an almost constant value,\alpha ~-2. the stellar populations of high-z galaxies have ages of 100-300(40-130) myr at z=5 (z=7-8), implying an early (z&gt;9.4) start of their starformation activity; the specific star formation rate is almost independent ofgalactic stellar mass. these objects are enriched rapidly with metals andgalaxies identified by hst/wfc3 (m_uv &lt; -18) show metallicities ~0.1 zsun evenat z=7-8. most of the simulated galaxies at z~7 (noticeably the smallest ones)are virtually dust-free, and none of them has an extinction larger than e(b-v)= 0.01. the bulk (50%) of the ionizing photons is produced by objectspopulating the faint-end of the lf (m_uv &lt; -16), which jwst will resolve up toz=7.3. popiii stars continue to form essentially at all redshifts; however, atz=6 (z=10) the contribution of pop iii stars to the total galactic luminosityis always less than 5% for m_uv &lt; -17 (m_uv &lt; -16). the typical high-z galaxiesclosely resemble the grb host galaxy population observed at lower redshifts,strongly encouraging the use of grbs to detect the first galaxies.

0704.2143	absorption features of high redshift galactic winds	the environment of high-redshift galaxies is characterized by bothwind-driven outflowing gas and gravitationally infalling streams. toinvestigate such galaxy-igm interplay we have generated synthetic opticalabsorption line spectra piercing the volume surrounding a starbursting analogof a lyman break galaxy selected in a $z \approx 3$ output from a sphsimulation, including a detailed treatment of mechanical feedback from winds.distributions for several observable species (hi, ciii, civ, siii, siiii, siiv,ovi, ovii, and oviii) have been derived by post-processing the simulationoutputs. the hot wind material is characterized by the presence ofhigh-ionization species such as ovi, ovii, and oviii (the latter two observableonly in x-ray bands); the colder ($t&lt;10^{5.5}$ k) infalling streams can beinstead identified by the combined presence of siii, siiii, and ciii opticalabsorption together with ovi that surrounds the cooler gas clumps. however,both line profile and pixel optical depth analysis of the synthetic spectrashow that the intergalactic filament in which the wind-blowing galaxy isembedded produces absorption signatures that closely mimic those of the windenvironment. we conclude that may be difficult to clearly identify wind-blowinggalaxies and their complex gaseous environment at high redshift in optical qsoabsorption-line spectra based solely on the observed ion absorption patterns.

1202.2884	joint ly{\alpha} emitters - quasars reionization constraints	we present a novel method to investigate cosmic reionization, using jointspectral information on high redshift lyman alpha emitters (lae) and quasars(qsos). although laes have been proposed as reionization probes, their use ishampered by the fact their ly{\alpha} line is damped not only by intergalactichi but also internally by dust. our method allows to overcome such degeneracy.first, we carefully calibrate a reionization simulation with qso absorptionline experiments. then we identify laes in two simulation boxes at z=5.7 andz=6.6 and we build synthetic images/spectra of a prototypical lae. at redshift5.7, we find that the ly{\alpha} transmissivity (t_lae) ~ 0.25, almostindependent of the halo mass. this constancy arises from the conspiracy of twoeffects: (i) the intrinsic ly{\alpha} line width and (ii) the infall peculiarvelocity. at higher redshift, z=6.6, where the transmissivity is insteadlargely set by the local hi abundance and lae transmissivity consequentlyincreases with halo mass from 0.15 to 0.3. although outflows are present, theyare efficiently pressure-confined by infall in a small region around the lae;hence they only marginally affect transmissivity. finally, we cast losoriginating from background qsos passing through foreground laes at differentimpact parameters, and compute the quasar transmissivity (t_qso). at smallerimpact parameters, d &lt; 1 cmpc, a positive correlation between t_qso and halomass is found at z = 5.7, which tends to become less pronounced (i.e. flatter)at larger distances. by cross-correlating t_lae and t_qso, we can obtain a hidensity estimate unaffected by dust. at z= 5.7, the cross-correlation isrelatively weak,whereas at z = 6.6 we find a clear positive correlation. weconclude by briefly discussing the perspectives for the application of themethod to existing and forthcoming data.

1204.2904	evidence of strong quasar feedback in the early universe	most theoretical models invoke quasar driven outflows to quench starformation in massive galaxies, this feedback mechanism is required to accountfor the population of old and passive galaxies observed in the local universe.the discovery of massive, old and passive galaxies at z=2, implies that suchquasar feedback onto the host galaxy must have been at work very early on,close to the reionization epoch. we have observed the [cii]158um transition insdssj114816.64+525150.3 that, at z=6.4189, is one of the most distant quasarsknown. we detect broad wings of the line tracing a quasar-driven massiveoutflow. this is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likelytracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early universe.the outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that theoutflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedbackmodels. the inferred outflow rate, dm/dt &gt; 3500 msun/yr, is the highest everfound. at this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, andtherefore quench star formation, in a few million years.

0712.0538	detectable signatures of cosmic radiative feedback	we use a semi-analytical model to study the impact of reionization, and theassociated radiative feedback, on galaxy formation. two feedback models havebeen considered: (i) a standard prescription, according to which star formationis totally suppressed in galaxies with circular velocity below a criticalthreshold (model cf06) and (ii) a characterization based on the filtering scale(model g00), allowing for a gradual reduction of the gas available for starformation in low-mass galaxies. in model cf06 reionization starts at z ~ 15-20,is 85% complete by z ~ 10; at the same z, the ionized fraction is 16% in modelg00. the models match sdss constraints on the evolution of the neutral hydrogenfraction at z &lt; 7, but predict different thomson optical depths, tau_e = 0.1017(cf06), and 0.0631 (g00); such values are within 1 sigma of the wmap 3-yrdetermination. both models are in remarkable good agreement with additionalexisting data (evolution of lyman-limit systems, cosmic star formation history,high-z galaxy counts, igm thermal history), which therefore cannot be used todiscriminate among different feedback models. deviations among radiativefeedback prescriptions emerge when considering the expected hi 21 cm backgroundsignal, where a ~ 15 mk absorption feature in the range 75-100 mhz is presentin model g00 and a global shift of the emission feature preceding reionizationtowards larger frequencies occurs in the same model. single dish observationswith existing or forthcoming low-frequency radio telescopes can achieve mksensitivity, allowing the identification of these features provided thatforegrounds can be accurately subtracted.

1307.2573	simulating intergalactic quasar scintillation	intergalactic scintillation of distant quasars is sensitive to free electronsand therefore complements ly$\alpha$ absorption line experiments probing theneutral intergalactic medium (igm). we present a new scheme to compute igmrefractive scintillation effects on distant sources in combination withadaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations. first we validate our modelby reproducing the well-known interstellar scintillation (iss) of galacticsources. the simulated cosmic density field is then used to infer thestatistical properties of intergalactic scintillation. contrary to previousclaims, we find that the scattering measure of the simulated igm at $z&lt;2$ is$\langle \mbox{sm}_{\equ}\rangle=3.879$, i.e. almost 40 times larger than forthe usually assumed smooth igm. this yield an average modulation index rangingfrom 0.01 ($\nu_s=5$ ghz) up to 0.2 ($\nu_s=50$ ghz); above $\nu_{s}\gsim30$ghz the igm contribution dominates over iss modulation. we compare our modelwith data from a $0.3\leq z\leq 2$ quasar sample observed at $\nu_{\obs}=8.4$ghz. for this high frequency ($10.92\leq \nu_s \leq 25.2$), high galacticlatitude sample iss is negligible, and igm scintillation can reproduce theobserved modulation with a 4% accuracy, without invoking intrinsic sourcevariability. we conclude by discussing the possibility of using igmscintillation as a tool to pinpoint the presence of intervening high-$z$groups/clusters along the line of sight, thus making it a probe suitablycomplementing sunyaev-zeldovich data recently obtained by \textit{planck}.

1406.6685	initial mass function of intermediate mass black hole seeds	we study the initial mass function (imf) and host halo properties ofintermediate mass black holes (imbh, 10^{4-6} msun) formed inside metal-free,uv illuminated atomic cooling haloes (virial temperature t_vir &gt; 10^4 k) eithervia the direct collapse of the gas or via an intermediate super massive star(sms) stage. we achieve this goal in three steps: (a) we derive the gasaccretion rate for a proto-sms to undergo general relativity instability andproduce a direct collapse black hole (dcbh) or to enter the zams and latercollapse into a imbh; (b) we use merger-tree simulations to select atomiccooling halos in which either a dcbh or sms can form and grow, accounting formetal enrichment and major mergers that halt the growth of the proto-sms by gasfragmentation. we derive the properties of the host halos and the massdistribution of black holes at this stage, and dub it the "birth massfunction"; (c) we follow the further growth of the dcbh due to accretion ofleftover gas in the parent halo and compute the final imbh mass.we consider twoextreme cases in which minihalos (t_vir &lt; 10^4 k) can (fertile) or cannot(sterile) form stars and pollute their gas leading to a different imbh imf. inthe (fiducial) fertile case the imf is bimodal extending over a broad range ofmasses, m= (0.5-20)x10^5 msun, and the dcbh accretion phase lasts from 10 to100 myr. if minihalos are sterile, the imf spans the narrower mass range m=(1-2.8)x10^6 msun, and the dcbh accretion phase is more extended (70-120 myr).we conclude that a good seeding prescription is to populate halos (a) of mass7.5 &lt; log (m_h/msun) &lt; 8, (b) in the redshift range 8 &lt; z &lt; 17, (c) with imbhin the mass range 4.75 &lt; log (m_bh/msun) &lt; 6.25.

1501.00913	missing cosmic metals revealed by x-ray absorption towards distant  sources	the census of heavy elements (metals) produced by all stars through cosmictimes up to present-day is limited to ~50%; of these only half are still foundwithin their parent galaxy. the majority of metals is expelled from galaxiesinto the circumgalactic (or even more distant, intergalactic) space by powerfulgalactic winds, leaving unpleasant uncertainty on the amount, thermalproperties and distribution of these key chemical species. these dispersedmetals unavoidably absorb soft x-ray photons from distant sources. we show thattheir integrated contribution can be detected in the form of increasing x-rayabsorption with distance, for all kinds of high-energy cosmic sources. based onextensive cosmological simulations, we assess that $\sim$ 10\% of all cosmicmetals reside in the intergalactic medium. most of the x-ray absorption arisesinstead from a few discrete structures along the line of sight. these extendedstructures, possibly pin-pointing galaxy groups, contain million degree,metal-enriched gas, 100-1,000 times denser than the cosmic mean. an additional~10% of cosmic metals could reside in this phase.

1506.05803	mapping metals at high redshift with far-infrared lines	cosmic metal enrichment is one of the key physical processes regulatinggalaxy formation and the evolution of the intergalactic medium (igm). however,determining the metal content of the most distant galaxies has proven so faralmost impossible; also, absorption line experiments at $z\sim6$ becomeincreasingly difficult because of instrumental limitations and the paucity ofbackground quasars. with the advent of alma, far-infrared emission linesprovide a novel tool to study early metal enrichment. among these, the [cii]line at 157.74 $\mu$m is the most luminous line emitted by the interstellarmedium of galaxies. it can also resonant scatter cmb photons inducingcharacteristic intensity fluctuations ($\delta i/i_{cmb}$) near the peak of thecmb spectrum, thus allowing to probe the low-density igm. we compute both [cii]galaxy emission and metal-induced cmb fluctuations at $z\sim 6$ by usingadaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and producemock observations to be directly compared with alma band6 data ($\nu_{obs}\sim272$ ghz). the [cii] line flux is correlated with $m_{uv}$ as$\log(f_{peak}/\mu{\rm jy})=-27.205-2.253\,m_{uv}-0.038\,m_{uv}^2$. suchrelation is in very good agreement with recent alma observations (e.g. maiolinoet al. 2015; capak et al. 2015) of $m_{uv}&lt;-20$ galaxies. we predict that a$m_{uv}=-19$ ($m_{uv}=-18$) galaxy can be detected at $4\sigma$ in $\simeq40$(2000) hours, respectively. cmb resonant scattering can produce $\simeq\pm0.1\,\mu$jy/beam emission/absorptions features that are very challenging to bedetected with current facilities. the best strategy to detect these signalsconsists in the stacking of deep alma observations pointing fields with known$m_{uv}\simeq-19$ galaxies. this would allow to simultaneously detect both[cii] emission from galactic reionization sources and cmb fluctuations producedby $z\sim6$ metals.

1507.00340	on the [cii]-sfr relation in high redshift galaxies	after two alma observing cycles, only a handful of [cii] $158\,\mu m$emission line searches in z&gt;6 galaxies have reported a positive detection,questioning the applicability of the local [cii]-sfr relation to high-zsystems. to investigate this issue we use the vallini et al. 2013 (v13) model,based on high-resolution, radiative transfer cosmological simulations topredict the [cii] emission from the interstellar medium of a z~7 (halo mass$m_h=1.17\times10^{11}m_{\odot}$) galaxy. we improve the v13 model by including(a) a physically-motivated metallicity (z) distribution of the gas, (b) thecontribution of photo-dissociation regions (pdrs), (c) the effects of cosmicmicrowave background on the [cii] line luminosity. we study the relativecontribution of diffuse neutral gas to the total [cii] emission ($f_{diff}/f_{tot}$) for different sfr and z values. we find that the [cii]emission arises predominantly from pdrs: regardless of the galaxy properties,$f _{diff}/f_{tot}\leq 10$% since, at these early epochs, the cmb temperatureapproaches the spin temperature of the [cii] transition in the cold neutralmedium ($t_{cmb}\sim t_s^{cnm}\sim 20$ k). our model predicts a high-z[cii]-sfr relation consistent with observations of local dwarf galaxies($0.02&lt;z/z_{\odot}&lt;0.5$). the [cii] deficit suggested by actual data($l_{cii}&lt;2.0\times 10^7 l_{\odot}$ in bdf3299 at z~7.1) if confirmed by deeperalma observations, can be ascribed to negative stellar feedback disruptingmolecular clouds around star formation sites. the deviation from the local[cii]-sfr would then imply a modified kennicutt-schmidt relation in z&gt;6galaxies. alternatively/in addition, the deficit might be explained by low gasmetallicities ($z&lt;0.1 z_{\odot}$).

astro-ph;0104271	the fragmentation of pre-enriched primordial objects	recent theoretical investigations have suggested that the formation of thevery first stars, forming out of metal-free gas, was fundamentally differentfrom the present-day case. in this paper, we study the effect of metallicity onthe evolution of the gas in a collapsing dark matter mini-halo. we model such asystem as an isolated 3\sigma peak of mass 2x10^6 m_sun that collapses atz_coll=30, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. the gas has a supposed levelof pre-enrichment of either 10^-4 z_sun or 10^-3 z_sun. we find that theevolution proceeds very differently for the two cases. the gas in the lowermetallicity simulation fails to undergo continued collapse and fragmentation,whereas the gas in the higher metallicity case dissipatively settles into thecenter of the dark matter halo. the central gas, characterized by densities n &gt;10^4 cm^-3, and a temperature, t \sim 90 k, which closely follows that of thecmb, is gravitationally unstable and undergoes vigorous fragmentation. wediscuss the physical reason for the existence of a critical metallicity, z_crit\sim 5x10^-4 z_sun, and its possible dependence on redshift. compared to thepure h/he case, the fragmentation of the 10^-3 z_sun gas leads to a largerrelative number of low-mass clumps.

astro-ph;0209034	effects of dust grains on early galaxy evolution	stars form out of molecular gas and supply dust grains during their lastevolutionary stages; in turn hydrogen molecules (h2) are produced moreefficiently on dust grains. therefore, dust can drastically accelerate h2formation, leading to an enhancement of star formation activity. in order toexamine the first formation of stars and dust in galaxies, we model theevolution of galaxies in the redshift range of 5&lt;z&lt;20. in particular, we focuson the interplay between dust formation in type ii supernova ejecta and h2production on dust grains. such effect causes an enhancement of star formationrate by an order of magnitude on a timescale (~3--5 galactic dynamical times)shorter than the hubble timescale. we also find that about half of theradiative energy from stars is reprocessed by dust grains and is finallyradiated in the far infrared (fir). typical star formation rates andluminosities (fir, uv and metal-line luminosities) are calculated for a largeset of (m_vir, z_vir). using these results and the press-schechter formalism,we calculate galaxy number counts and integrated light from high-redshift (z&gt;5)galaxies in sub-millimetre and near-infrared bands. we find that: i) alma candetect dust emission from several thousands of galaxies per square degree, andii) ngst can detect the stellar emission from 10^6 galaxies per square degree.further observational checks of our predictions include the integrated flux ofmetal (oxygen and carbon) lines. we finally discuss possible color selectionstrategies for high-redshift galaxy searches.

astro-ph;0302451	early reionization by the first galaxies	large-scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background measured by thewmap satellite requires a mean optical depth to thomson scattering, tau_e ~0.17. the reionization of the universe must therefore have begun at relativelyhigh redshift. we have studied the reionization process using supercomputersimulations of a large and representative region of a universe which hascosmological parameters consistent with the wmap results. our simulationsfollow both the radiative transfer of ionizing photons and the formation andevolution of the galaxy population which produces them. a previously publishedmodel with a standard stellar imf, with a moderate photon escape fraction fromgalaxies and with ionizing photon production as expected for zero metallicitystars produces tau_e = 0.104, which is within 1.0 to 1.5-sigma of the ``best''wmap value. values up to 0.16 can be produced by taking larger escape fractionsor a top heavy imf. the data do not require a separate populations of``miniquasars'' or of stars forming in objects with total masses below 10^9m_sun. reconciling such early reionization with the observed gunn-petersontroughs in z&gt;6 quasars may be challenging. possible resolutions of this problemare discussed.

astro-ph;0304074	induced formation of primordial low-mass stars	we show that the explosion of the first supernovae can trigger low-mass starformation via gravitational fragmentation of the supernova-driven gas shell. ifthe shell mass does not exceed the host galaxy gas mass, all explosions withenergies e_sn &gt; 10^{51} erg can lead to shell fragmentation. however, theminimum ambient density required to induce such fragmentation is much larger,n_0 &gt; 300 cm^{-3}, for type ii supernovae than for pair-instability ones, whichcan induce star formation even at lower ambient densities. the typical mass ofthe unstable fragments is 10^{4-7} msun; their density is in the range110-6x10^7 cm{-3}. fragments have a metallicity strictly lower than 10^{-2.6}zsun and large values of the gravitational-to-pressure force ratio f ~ 8. basedon these findings, we conclude that the second generation of stars produced bysuch self-propagating star formation is predominantly constituted by low-mass,long-living, extremely metal-poor (or even metal-free, if mixing is suppressed)stars. we discuss the implications of such results for pop iii star formationscenarios and for the most iron-poor halo star he0107-5240.

astro-ph;0304254	low-mass relics of early star formation	the earliest stars to form in the universe were the first sources of light,heat and metals after the big bang. the products of their evolution will havehad a profound impact on subsequent generations of stars. recent studies ofprimordial star formation have shown that, in the absence of metals (elementsheavier than helium), the formation of stars with masses 100 times that of thesun would have been strongly favoured, and that low-mass stars could not haveformed before a minimum level of metal enrichment had been reached. the valueof this minimum level is very uncertain, but is likely to be between 10^{-6}and 10^{-4} that of the sun. here we show that the recent discovery of the mostiron-poor star known indicates the presence of dust in extremelylow-metallicity gas, and that this dust is crucial for the formation oflower-mass second-generation stars that could survive until today. the dustprovides a pathway for cooling the gas that leads to fragmentation of theprecursor molecular cloud into smaller clumps, which become the lower-massstars.

astro-ph;0304280	first stars contribution to the near infrared background fluctuations	we show that the emission from the first, metal-free stars inside populationiii objects (popiiis) are needed to explain the level of fluctuations in thenear infrared background (nirb) recently discovered by kashlinsky et al.(2002), at least at the shortest wavelengths. clustering of (unresolved) popiiis can in fact account for the entire signal at almost all the ~1-30 arcsecscales probed by observations in the j band. their contribution fades away atshorter frequencies and becomes negligible in the k band. ``normal'', highlyclustered, &lt;z&gt;~3 galaxies undergoing intense star-formation such as those foundin the hubble deep fields can 'fill in' this gap and provide for the missingsignal. it is in fact found that their contribution to the intensityfluctuations is the dominant one at lambda=2.17 mum, while it gradually loosesimportance in the h and j bands. the joint contribution from these twopopulations of cosmic objects is able, within the errors, to reproduce theobserved power spectrum in the whole near infrared range on small angularscales (theta &lt; 200" for pop iii protogalaxies). signals on larger scalesdetected by other experiments instead require the presence of more localsources.

astro-ph;0405611	cosmological feedback from high-redshift dwarf galaxies	we model how repeated supernova explosions in high-redshift dwarf starburstgalaxies drive superbubbles and winds out of the galaxies. we compute theefficiencies of metal and mass ejection and energy transport from the galacticpotentials, including the effect of cosmological infall of external gas. thestarburst bubbles quickly blow out of small, high-redshift, galactic disks, butmust compete with the ram pressure of the infalling gas to escape intointergalactic space. we show that the assumed efficiency of the star formationrate dominates the bubble evolution and the metal, mass, and energy feedbackefficiencies. with star formation efficiency f*=0.01, the ram pressure ofinfall can confine the bubbles around high-redshift dwarf galaxies withcircular velocities v_c&gt;52 km/s. we can expect high metal and mass ejectionefficiencies, and moderate energy transport efficiencies in halos withv_c~30-50 km/s and f*~0.01 as well as in halos with v_c~100 km/s and f*&gt;&gt;0.01.such haloes collapse successively from 1-2 sigma peaks in lambdacdm gaussiandensity perturbations as time progresses. these dwarf galaxies can probablyenrich low and high-density regions of intergalactic space with metals to10^-3-10^-2 zsun as they collapse at z~8 and z&lt;5 respectively. they also may beable to provide adequate turbulent energy to prevent the collapse of othernearby halos, as well as to significantly broaden lyman-alpha absorption linesto v_rms~20-40 km/s. we compute the timescales for the next starbursts if gasfreely falls back after a starburst, and find that, for star formationefficiencies as low as f*&lt;0.01, the next starburst should occur in less thanhalf the hubble time at the collapse redshift. this suggests that episodic starformation may be ubiquitous in dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0409577	a supernova origin for dust in a high-redshift quasar	interstellar dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of the universe byassisting the formation of molecules, by triggering the formation of the firstlow-mass stars, and by absorbing stellar ultraviolet-optical light andsubsequently re-emitting it at infrared/millimetre wavelengths. dust is thoughtto be produced predominantly in the envelopes of evolved (age &gt;1 gyr), low-massstars. this picture has, however, recently been brought into question by thediscovery of large masses of dust in the host galaxies of quasars at redshiftz&gt;6, when the age of the universe was less than 1 gyr. theoretical studies,corroborated by observations of nearby supernova remnants, have suggested thatsupernovae provide a fast and efficient dust formation environment in the earlyuniverse. here we report infrared observations of a quasar at redshift 6.2,which are used to obtain directly its dust extinction curve. we then show thatsuch a curve is in excellent agreement with supernova dust models. this resultdemonstrates a supernova origin for dust in this high-redshift quasar, fromwhich we infer that most of the dust at high redshifts has probably the sameorigin.

astro-ph;0411027	experimental constraints on self-consistent reionization models	a self-consistent formalism to jointly study cosmic reionization and thermalhistory of the igm is presented. the model implements most of the relevantphysics governing these processes, such as the inhomogeneous igm densitydistribution, three different sources of ionizing photons (popiii stars, popiistars and qsos), and radiative feedback. by constraining the free parameterswith available data on redshift evolution of lyman-limit systems, gunn-petersonand electron scattering optical depths, near infrared background (nirb), andcosmic star formation history, we select a fiducial model, whose mainpredictions are: (i) h was completely reionized at z \approx 15, while heiimust have been reionized by z \approx 12. at z \approx 7, heiii suffered analmost complete recombination as a result of the extinction of popiii stars, asrequired by the interpretation of the nirb. (ii) a qso-induced complete heiireionization occurs at z=3.5; a similar double h reionization does not takeplace due to the large number of photons above 1 ryd from popii stars and qsos,even after popiii stars have disappeared. (iii) following reionization, thetemperature of the igm corresponding to the mean gas density is boosted to15000 k. observations of t_0 are consistent with the fact that he is singlyionized at z &gt; 3.5, while they are consistent with he being doubly ionized at z&lt; 3.5. this might be interpreted as a signature of (second) heii reionization.(iv) only 0.3% of the stars produced by z=2 need to be popiii stars in order toachieve the hydrogen reionization. such model not only relieves the tensionbetween the gunn-peterson optical depth and wmap observations, but alsoaccounts self-consistently for all known observational constraints (abridged).

astro-ph;0411134	extragalactic background light: new constraints from the study of the  photon-photon absorption on blazar spectra	the study of the extragalactic background light (ebl) is crucial tounderstand many astrophysical problems (as the formation of first stars, theevolution of galaxies and the role of dust emission). at present, one of themost powerful ways to put constraints on ebl is represented by the study of thephoton-photon absorption on gamma-ray spectra of tev blazars. adopting thismethod, we found that, if the only contribution to the optical and nearinfrared (nir) background is given by galaxies, the spectrum of the blazarh1426+428 cannot be fitted. to reproduce the observational data of h1426+428 anear infrared excess with respect to galaxy counts is required, with amplitudeconsistent with both the matsumoto et al. (2000) data with kelsall's model ofzodiacal light (zl) subtraction and the dirbe data with wright's model of zlsubtraction. the derived constraints on the optical ebl are weaker, because theexperimental errors on blazar data are still bigger than the differences amongvarious optical ebl models. in the mid-infrared the spitzer measurement at 24micron provides the best fit of the blazar spectrum.

astro-ph;0510258	radiative transfer effects on the lya forest	strong observational evidence for a fluctuating ultraviolet background (uvb)has been accumulating through a number of studies of the hi and heii lya forestas well as accurate igm metallicity measurements. uvb fluctuations could ariseboth from the inhomogeneous distribution of the ionizing sources and/or fromradiative transfer (rt) through the filamentary igm. in this study weinvestigate, via numerical simulations, the role of rt effects such asshadowing, self-shielding and filtering of the ionizing radiation, in givingraise to a fluctuating uvb. we focus on possible detectable signatures of theseeffects on quantities derived from lya forest spectra, as photoionization ratefluctuations, eta parameter (the heii to hi column density ratio) distributionsand the igm temperature at redshift about 3. we find that rt inducesfluctuations up to 60% in the uvb, which are tightly correlated to the densityfield. the uvb mean intensity is progressively suppressed toward higherdensities and photon energies above 4 ryd, due to the high heii opacity.shielding of overdense regions (delta &gt; 5) from cosmic heii ionizing radiation,produces a decreaseing trend of eta with overdensity. furthermore we find thatthe mean eta value inferred from hi-heii lya forest observations can beexplained only by properly accounting for the actual igm opacity. we outlineand discuss several implications of our findings.

astro-ph;9905280	the role of stellar feedback and dark matter in the evolution of dwarf  galaxies	supernova and multiple supernova events regulate several structuralproperties of dwarf galaxies. in particular, they govern the metal enrichmentand the energy budget of the ism; they might induce partial (blowout) or total(blowaway) gas removal from the galaxy; the morphology of the galactic gaseousbody. significant amounts of dark matter may play an equally important role:the dark matter gravitational potential tends to concentrate baryons towardsthe center, thus enhancing both the star formation rate and metal production.also, the dynamical properties of the ism, and the occurrence of a blowout orblowaway are shown to be determined by the dark matter content. we presentdetailed analytical/numerical models describing the evolution of dwarfirregular galaxies including the above and other effects. the main results are:(i) dwarfs with total masses $m\simlt 5\times 10^6 m_\odot$ are blown away;those with gas masses up to $\simeq 10^9 m_\odot$ lose mass in an outflow; (ii)metallicities are found to correlate tightly with dark matter content and areconsistent with a range of dark-to-visible mass ratios $\phi\approx 0-30$ withabout 65% of the dwarfs in the sample having $\phi\approx 0-10$; (iii) wepredict a lower limit to the oxygen abundance in dis of $12+log(o/h)\approx7.2$; (iv) outflows are not particularly important for the metallicityevolution of dwarf galaxies and certainly less than star formation for gasconsumption; however, dwarfs with gas masses few $\times 10^8 m_\odot$ areshown to be the major pollutants of the igm; (v) the ism hi velocity dispersioncorrelates with metallicity and, indepentently of dark matter, scales as$z^{3.5}$.

astro-ph;9907189	inhomogeneous reionization regulated by radiative and stellar feedbacks	we study the inhomogeneous reionization in a critical density cdm universedue to stellar sources, including population iii objects. the spatialdistribution of the sources is obtained from high resolution numerical n-bodysimulations. we calculate the source properties taking into account aself-consistent treatment of both radiative (ie ionizing and h2-photodissociating photons) and stellar (ie sn explosions) feedbacks regulatedby massive stars. this allows us to describe the topology of the ionized anddissociated regions at various cosmic epochs and derive the evolution of h, he,and h2 filling factors, soft uv background, cosmic star formation rate and thefinal fate of ionizing objects. the main results are: (i) galaxies reionize theigm by z~10 (with some uncertainty related to the gas clumping factor), whereash2 is completely dissociated already by z~25; (ii) reionization is mostly dueto the relatively massive objects which collapse via h line cooling, whileobjects whose formation relies on h2 cooling alone are insufficient to thisaim; (iii) the diffuse soft uv background is the major source of radiativefeedback effects for z&lt;15; at higher z direct flux from neighboring objectsdominates; (iv) the match of the calculated cosmic star formation history withthe one observed at lower redshifts suggests that the conversion efficiency ofbaryons into stars is ~1%; (v) we find that a very large population of darkobjects which failed to form stars is present by z~8. we discuss and compareour results with similar previous studies.

astro-ph;9911467	cmb anisotropies due to feedback-regulated inhomogeneous reionization	we calculate the secondary anisotropies in the cmb produced by inhomogeneousreionization from simulations in which the effects of radiative and stellarfeedback effects on galaxy formation have been included. this allows toself-consistently determine the beginning ($z_i\approx 30$), the duration ($\delta z\approx 20$) and the (nonlinear) evolution of the reionization processfor a critical density cdm model. in addition, from the simulated spatialdistribution of ionized regions, we are able to calculate the evolution of thetwo-point ionization correlation function, $c_\chi$, and obtain the powerspectrum of the anisotropies, $c_\ell$, in the range $5000 &lt; \ell &lt; 10^6$. thepower spectrum has a broad maximum around $\ell \approx 30000$, where itreaches the value $2\times 10^{-12}$. we also show that the angular correlationfunction $c(\theta)$ is not gaussian, but at separation angles $% \theta\lower.5ex\hbox{\ltsima} 10^{-4}$ rad it can be approximated by a modifiedlorentzian shape; at larger separations an anticorrelation signal is predicted.detection of signals as above will be possible with future mm-wavelengthinterferometers like alma, which appears as an optimum instrument to search forsignatures of inhomogeneous reionization.

0706.1053	glimpsing through the high redshift neutral hydrogen fog	we analyze the transmitted flux in a sample of 17 qsos spectra at5.74&lt;zem&lt;6.42 to obtain tighter constraints on the volume-averaged neutralhydrogen fraction, xhi, at z~6. we study separately the narrow transmissionwindows (peaks) and the wide dark portions (gaps) in the observed absorptionspectra. by comparing the statistics of these spectral features with lyalphaforest simulations, we conclude that xhi evolves smoothly from 10^{-4.4} atz=5.3 to 10^{-4.2} at z=5.6, with a robust upper limit xhi&lt;0.36 at z=6.3. thefrequency and physical sizes of the peaks imply an origin in cosmic underdenseregions and/or in hii regions around faint quasars or galaxies. in one case(the intervening hii region of the faint quasar rd j1148+5253 at z=5.70 alongthe los of sdss j1148+5251 at z=6.42) the increase of the peak spectral densityis explained by the first-ever detected transverse proximity effect in the hilyalpha forest; this indicates that at least some peaks result from a locallyenhanced radiation field. we then obtain a strong lower limit on the foregroundqso lifetime of tq&gt;11 myr. the observed widths of the peaks are found to besystematically larger than the simulated ones. reasons for such discrepancymight reside either in the photoionization equilibrium assumption or inradiative transfer effects.
