0909.3461	mambo observations at 240ghz of optically obscured spitzer sources:  source clumps and radio activity at high redshift	optically very faint r&gt;25.5 sources detected by the spitzer space telescopeat 24um represent a very interesting population at redshift z [1.5-3]. theyexhibit strong clustering properties, implying that they are hosted by verymassive halos, and their mid-ir emission could be powered by eitherdust-enshrouded star-formation and/or by an obscured agn. we reportobservations carried out with the mambo array at the iram 30m antenna on picoveleta of a candidate protocluster with five optically obscured sourcesselected from the 24um spitzer sample of the first look survey. interestingly,these sources appear to lie on a high density filament aligned with the tworadio jets of an agn. four out of five of the observed sources were detected.we combine these measurements with optical, infrared and radio observations toprobe}the nature of the candidate protocluster members. our preliminaryconclusions can be summarized as follows: the spectral energy distributions ofall sources include both agn and starburst contributions; the agn contributionto the bolometric luminosities ranges between 14 and 26% of the total. such acontribution is enough for the agn to dominate the emission at 5.8, 8 and 24um,while the stellar component, inferred from sed fitting, prevails at 1.25mm andat lambda&lt;4.5um. the present analysis suggests a coherent interplay at high-zbetween extended radio activity and the development of filamentary large-scalestructures.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.1473	pep: first herschel probe of dusty galaxy evolution up to z~3	we exploit the deepest existing far-infrared (fir) data obtained so far byherschel at 100 and 160 um in the goods-n, as part of the pacs evolutionaryprobe (pep) survey, to derive for the first time the evolution of therest-frame 60-um, 90-um, and total ir luminosity functions (lfs) of galaxiesand agns from z=0 to unprecedented high redshifts (z~2-3). the pep lfs werecomputed using the 1/vmax method. the fir sources were classified by means of adetailed broad- band sed-fitting analysis and spectral characterisation. basedon the best-fit model results, k-correction and total ir (8-1000 um) luminositywere obtained for each source. lfs (monochromatic and total) were then derivedfor various ir populations separately in different redshift bins and comparedto backward evolution model predictions. we detect strong evolution in the lfto at least z~2. objects with seds similar to local spiral galaxies are themajor contributors to the star formation density (sfd) at z&lt; 0.3, then, asredshift increases, moderate sf galaxies - most likely containing alow-luminosity agn - start dominating up to z ~= 1.5. at &gt;1.5 the sfd isdominated by the contributions of starburst galaxies. in agreement withprevious findings, the comoving ir ld derived from our data evolvesapproximately as (1 + z)^(3.8+/-0.3) up to z~1, there being some evidence offlattening up to z~2.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

0710.2343	the radio properties of optically obscured spitzer sources	this paper analyses the radio properties of a subsample of optically obscured(r&gt;25.5) galaxies observed at 24um by the spitzer space telescope within thefirst look survey. 96 f[24um]&gt;0.35 mjy objects out of 510 are found to have aradio counterpart at 1.4 ghz, 610 mhz or at both frequencies respectively downto ~40ujy and ~200ujy. irac photometry sets the majority of them in theredshift interval z [1-3] and allows for a broad distinction betweenagn-dominated galaxies (~47% of the radio-identified sample) and systemspowered by intense star-formation (~13%), the remaining objects beingimpossible to classify. the percentage of radio identifications is a strongfunction of 24um flux. the radio number counts at both radio frequenciessuggest that the physical process(es) responsible for radio activity in theseobjects have a common origin regardless of whether the source shows mid-iremission compatible with being an obscured agn or a star-forming galaxy. wealso find that both candidate agn and star-forming systems follow (althoughwith a large scatter) the relationship between 1.4 ghz and 24um fluxes reportedby appleton et al. (2004) which identifies sources undergoing intense starformation activity. on the other hand, the inferred radio spectral indicesalpha indicate that a large fraction of objects in our sample (~60% of allgalaxies with estimated alpha) may belong to the population of ultra steepspectrum (uss) sources, typically 'frustrated' radio-loud agn. we interpret ourfindings as a strong indication for concurrent agn and star-forming activity,whereby the 1.4 ghz flux is of thermal origin, while that at 610 ghz mainlystems from the nuclear source.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1202.0997	pacs-herschel fir detections of lyman-alpha emitters at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.5	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 56spectroscopically selected star-forming (sf) ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 using both a spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting procedure from rest-frame uv to mid-ir and direct 160$\mu$mobservations taken with the photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs)instrument onboard \emph{herschel space observatory}. we define laes as thosely$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths(ly$\alpha$ ew$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\aa, the typical threshold innarrow-band searches. ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with ly$\alpha$ew$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-laes. as a result of an individual sed fittingfor each object, we find that the studied sample of laes contains galaxies withages mostly below 100myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, sfrs, andstellar masses. the heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen inthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. inthis way, we find that laes at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. furthermore,the main difference between laes and non-laes is their dust attenuation,because laes are not as dusty as non-laes. on the fir side, four galaxies ofthe sample (two laes and two non-laes) have pacs-fir counterparts. their totalir luminosity place all of them in the ulirg regime and are all dusty objects,with a$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. this is an indication from direct firmeasurements that dust and ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. thispopulation of red and dusty laes is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting anevolution with redshift of the ir nature of galaxies selected via theirly$\alpha$ emission.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

1301.4826	irregular time series in astronomy and the use of the lomb-scargle  periodogram	detection of a signal hidden by noise within a time series is an importantproblem in many astronomical searches, i.e. for light curves containing thecontributions of periodic/semi-periodic components due to rotating objects andall other astrophysical time-dependent phenomena. one of the most popular toolsfor use in such studies is the "periodogram", whose use in an astronomicalcontext is often not trivial. the "optimal" statistical properties of theperiodogram are lost in the case of irregular sampling of signals, which is acommon situation in astronomical experiments. parts of these properties arerecovered by the "lomb-scargle" (ls) technique, but at the price of theoreticaldifficulties, that can make its use unclear, and of algorithms that require thedevelopment of dedicated software if a fast implementation is necessary. suchproblems would be irrelevant if the ls periodogram could be used tosignificantly improve the results obtained by approximated but simplertechniques. in this work we show that in many astronomical applications simplertechniques provide results similar to those obtainable with the ls periodogram.the meaning of the "nyquist frequency" is also discussed in the case ofirregular sampling.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1305.4050	an approach for the detection of point-sources in very high resolution  microwave maps	this paper deals with the detection problem of extragalactic point-sources inmulti-frequency, microwave sky maps that will be obtainable in future cosmicmicrowave background radiation (cmb) experiments with instruments capable ofvery high spatial resolution. with spatial resolutions that can be of order of0.1-1.0 arcsec or better, the extragalactic point-sources will appear isolated.the same holds also for the compact structures due to the sunyaev-zeldovich(sz) effect (both thermal and kinetic). this situation is different from themaps obtainable with instruments as wmap or planck where, because of thesmaller spatial resolution (approximately 5-30 arcmin), the point-sources andthe compact structures due to the sz effect form a uniform noisy background(the "confusion noise"). hence, the point-source detection techniques developedin the past are based on the assumption that all the emissions that contributeto the microwave background can be modeled with homogeneous and isotropic(often gaussian) random fields and make use of the corresponding spatialpower-spectra. in the case of very high resolution observations such anassumption cannot be adopted since it still holds only for the cmb. here, wepropose an approach based on the assumption that the diffuse emissions thatcontribute to the microwave background can be locally approximated bytwo-dimensional low order polynomials. in particular, two sets of numericaltechniques are presented containing two different algorithms each. theperformance of the algorithms is tested with numerical experiments that mimicthe physical scenario expected for high galactic latitude observations with theatacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma).

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1401.1213	karl g. jansky very large array observations of cold dust and molecular  gas in starbursting quasar host galaxies at z~4.5	we present karl g. jansky very large array (vla) observations of 44 ghzcontinuum and co j=2-1 line emission in br1202-0725 at z=4.7 (a starburstgalaxy and quasar pair) and bri1335-0417 at z=4.4 (also hosting a quasar). withthe full 8 ghz bandwidth capabilities of the upgraded vla, we study the(rest-frame) 250 ghz thermal dust continuum emission for the first time alongwith the cold molecular gas traced by the low-j co line emission. the measuredco j=2-1 line luminosities of br1202-0725 are l'(co) = (8.7+/-0.8)x10^10 k km/spc^2 and l'(co) = (6.0+/-0.5)x10^10 k km/s pc^2 for the submm galaxy (smg) andquasar, which are equal to previous measurements of the co j=5-4 lineluminosities implying thermalized line emission and we estimate a combined coldmolecular gas mass of ~9x10^10 msun. in bri1335-0417 we measure l'(co) =(7.3+/-0.6)x10^10 k km/s pc^2. we detect continuum emission in the smgbr1202-0725 north (s(44ghz) = 51+/-6 microjy), while the quasar is detectedwith s(44ghz) = 24+/-6 microjy and in bri1335-0417 we measure s(44ghz) = 40+/-7microjy. combining our continuum observations with previous data at(rest-frame) far-infrared and cm-wavelengths, we fit three component models inorder to estimate the star-formation rates. this spectral energy distributionfitting suggests that the dominant contribution to the observed 44~ghzcontinuum is thermal dust emission, while either thermal free-free orsynchrotron emission contributes less than 30%.

1401.6572	relativistic cosmology number densities in void-lemaitre-tolman-bondi  models	the goal of this work is to compute the number density of far-ir selectedgalaxies in the comoving frame and along the past lightcone of observationallyconstrained ltb models and to compare those results with their standard modelcounterparts.  we derived integral number densities and differential number densities usingdifferent cosmological distance definitions in the ltb models. then, wecomputed selection functions and consistency functions for the luminosityfunctions in the combined fields of the herschel/pacs evolutionary probe (pep)survey in both standard and void cosmologies, from which we derived theobserved values of the above-mentioned densities. we used thekolmogorov-smirnov statistics to study both the evolution of the consistencyfunctions and its connection to the evolution of the comoving density ofsources. finally, we fitted the power-law behaviour of the densities along theobserver's past lightcone.  the analysis of the comoving number density shows that the increasedflexibility of the ltb models is not enough to fit the observed redshiftevolution of the number counts, if it is specialised to a recent best-fit giantvoid parametrisation. the results for the power-law fits of the densities alongthe observer's past lightcone show general agreement across both cosmologicalmodels studied here around a slope of -2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 for the integral numberdensity on the luminosity-distance volumes. the differential number densitiesshow much bigger slope discrepancies.  we conclude that the differential number densities on the observer's pastlightcone were still rendered dependent on the cosmological model by the fluxlimits of the pep survey. in addition, we show that an intrinsic evolution ofthe sources must be assumed to fit the comoving number-density redshiftevolution in the giant void parametrisation for the ltb models used in thiswork.

0806.0520	a statistical analysis of the "internal linear combination" method in  problems of signal separation as in cmb observations	aims: the separation of foreground contamination from cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) observations is one of the most challenging and importantproblem of digital signal processing in cosmology. in literature, varioustechniques have been presented, but no general consensus about their realperformances and properties has been reached. this is due to thecharacteristics of these techniques that have been studied essentially throughnumerical simulations based on semi-empirical models of the cmb and thegalactic foregrounds. such models often have different level of sophisticationand/or are based on different physical assumptions (e.g., the number of thegalactic components and the level of the noise). hence, a reliable comparisonis difficult. what actually is missing is a statistical analysis of theproperties of the proposed methodologies. here, we consider the "internallinear combination" method (ilc) which, among the separation techniques,requires the smallest number of "a priori" assumptions. this feature is ofparticular interest in the context of the cmb polarization measurements atsmall angular scales where the lack of knowledge of the polarized backgroundsrepresents a serious limit. methods: the statistical characteristics of ilc areexamined through an analytical approach and the basic conditions are fixed in away to work satisfactorily. results: ilc provides satisfactory results onlyunder rather restrictive conditions. this is a critical fact to take intoconsideration in planning the future ground-based observations (e.g., withalma) where, contrary to the satellite experiments, there is the possibility tohave a certain control of the experimental conditions.

astro-ph;0301493	digital deblurring of cmb maps: performance and efficient implementation	digital deblurring of images is an important problem that arises inmultifrequency observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) where,because of the width of the point spread functions (psf), maps at differentfrequencies suffer a different loss of spatial resolution. deblurring is usefulfor various reasons: first, it helps to restore high frequency components lostthrough the smoothing effect of the instrument's psf; second, emissions atvarious frequencies observed with different resolutions can be better studiedon a comparable resolution; third, some map-based component separationalgorithms require maps with similar level of degradation. because ofcomputational efficiency, deblurring is usually done in the frequency domain.but this approach has some limitations as it requires spatial invariance of thepsf, stationarity of the noise, and is not flexible in the selection of moreappropriate boundary conditions. deblurring in real space is more flexible butusually not used because of its high computational cost. in this paper (thefirst in a series on the subject) we present new algorithms that allow the useof real space deblurring techniques even for very large images. in particular,we consider the use of tikhonov deblurring of noisy maps with applications to{\it planck}. we provide details for efficient implementations of thealgorithms. their performance is tested on gaussian and non-gaussian simulatedcmb maps, and psfs with both circular and elliptical symmetry. matlab code ismade available.

0810.4755	a theoretical framework for the detection of point-sources in cosmic  microwave background maps	the detection of point-sources in microwave maps is a critical step in theanalysis of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) data. if not properlyremoved, these sources have adverse effects on the estimation of thepower-spectrum and/or the test of gaussianity of the cmb component. thetechniques to extract point sources from an observed image used up to now donot show a general consensus about their real performance and properties. theircharacteristics have been studied essentially through numerical simulationsbased on semi-empirical models of the cmb and the galactic foreground. suchmodels often have different levels of sophistication and/or are based ondifferent physical assumptions (e.g. the number of galactic components andlevel of the noise). moreover, the application of a given technique to a set ofdata (either simulated or experimental) requires the tuning of one or moreparameters that unavoidably is a subjective operation. hence, a reliablecomparison is difficult. what is missing is a statistical analysis of theproperties of the proposed methodologies. this is the aim of the present paper.the statistical properties of the detection techniques in the context of twodifferent criteria, i.e. the neyman-pearson criterion and the maximization ofthe signal-to-noise ratio, are analyzed through an analytical approach. variousexamples, techniques and the conditions under which they work satisfactorilyare shown together with their limits and implementation details. exploitingsome a priori information, it is possible to develop simple algorithms withperformances similar to those of more sophisticated but complex techniques. inthis respect, a detection algorithm, useful in future ground-based experimentsas, for example the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array, is presented.
