0901.2930	the kiloparsec-scale kinematics of high-redshift star-forming galaxies	we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the kinematic structureof star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 3 using keck/osiris integral fieldspectroscopy. our sample is comprised of 12 galaxies between redshifts z ~ 2.0and 2.5 and one galaxy at z ~ 3.3 which are well detected in either halpha or[o iii] emission. these observations were obtained in conjunction with the kecklaser guide star adaptive optics system, with a typical angular resolutionafter spatial smoothing ~ 0.15" (approximately 1 kpc at the redshift of thetarget sample). at most five of these 13 galaxies have spatially resolvedvelocity gradients consistent with rotation while the remaining galaxies haverelatively featureless or irregular velocity fields. all of our galaxies showlocal velocity dispersions ~ 60 - 100 km/s, suggesting that (particularly forthose galaxies with featureless velocity fields) rotation about a preferredaxis may not be the dominant mechanism of physical support. while some galaxiesshow evidence for major mergers such evidence is unrelated to the kinematics ofindividual components (one of our strongest merger candidates also exhibitsunambiguous rotational structure), refuting a simple bimodal disk/mergerclassification scheme. we discuss these data in light of complementary surveysand extant uv-ir spectroscopy and photometry, concluding that the dynamicalimportance of cold gas may be the primary factor governing the observedkinematics of z ~ 2 galaxies. we conclude by speculating on the importance ofmechanisms for accreting low angular-momentum gas and the early formation ofquasi-spheroidal systems in the young universe.(abridged)

0706.2865	morphologies of galaxies in and around a protocluster at z=2.300	we present results from the first robust investigation of galaxy morphologyas a function of environment at z&gt;1.5. our study is motivated by the fact thatstar-forming galaxies contained within a protocluster at z=2.3 in the hs1700+64field have significantly older ages and larger stellar masses on average thanthose at similar redshifts but more typical environmental densities. in theanalysis of hst/acs images, we apply non-parametric statistics to characterizethe rest-frame uv morphologies of a sample of 85 uv-selected star-forminggalaxies at z=1.7-2.9, 22 of which are contained in the protocluster. theremaining 63 control-sample galaxies are not in the protocluster but have asimilar mean redshift of &lt;z&gt;~2.3. we find no environmental dependence for thedistributions of morphological properties. combining the measured morphologieswith the results of population synthesis modeling, we find only weakcorrelations, if any, between morphological and stellar population propertiessuch as stellar mass, age, extinction and star-formation rate. given theincomplete census of the protocluster galaxy population, and the lack ofcorrelation between rest-frame uv morphology and star-formation history at z~2within our sample, the absence of environmental trends in the distribution ofmorphological properties is not surprising. additionally, using a larger sampleof photometric candidates, we compare morphological distributions for 282uv-selected and 43 near-ir-selected galaxies. while the difference in thedegree of nebulosity between the two samples appears to be a byproduct of thefainter average rest-frame uv surface brightness of the near-ir-selectedgalaxies, we find that, among the lowest surface brightness galaxies, thenear-ir-selected objects have significantly smaller angular sizes (abridged).

0706.4091	multi-wavelength constraints on the cosmic star formation history from  spectroscopy: the rest-frame uv, h-alpha, and infrared luminosity functions  at redshifts 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4	we use a sample of rest-frame uv selected and spectroscopically observedgalaxies at redshifts 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4, combined with ground-based spectroscopich-alpha and spitzer mips 24 micron data, to derive the most robust measurementsof the rest-frame uv, h-alpha, and infrared (ir) luminosity functions (lfs) atthese redshifts. our sample is by far the largest of its kind, with over 2000spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.4 and ~15000 photometriccandidates in 29 independent fields covering a total area of almost a squaredegree. our method for computing the lfs takes into account a number ofsystematic effects, including photometric scatter, ly-alpha perturbations tooptical colors, and contaminants. taking into account the latter, we find noevidence for an excess of uv-bright galaxies over what was inferred in earlyz~3 lbg studies. the uv lf appears to undergo little evolution between z~4 andz~2. corrected for extinction, the uv luminosity density (ld) at z~2 is atleast as large as the value at z~3 and a factor of ~9 larger than the value atz~6, primarily reflecting an increase in the number density of bright galaxiesbetween z~6 and z~2. our analysis yields the first constraints anchored byextensive spectroscopy on the ir and bolometric lfs for faint and moderatelyluminous (l[bol]&lt;10^12 l_sun) galaxies. adding the ir to the emergent uvluminosity, incorporating independent measurements of the ld from ulirgs, andassuming realistic dust attenuation values for uv-faint galaxies, indicatesthat galaxies with l[bol]&lt;10^12 l_sun account for ~80% of the bolometric ld andsfrd at z~2-3. our multi-wavelength constraints on the global sfrd indicatethat approximately one-third of the present-day stellar mass density was formedin sub-ultraluminous galaxies between redshifts z=1.9-3.4.

0906.2197	rest-frame optical spectra of three strongly lensed galaxies at z~2	we present keck ii nirspec rest-frame optical spectra for three recentlydiscovered lensed galaxies: the cosmic horseshoe (z = 2.38), the clone (z =2.00), and sdss j090122.37+181432.3 (z = 2.26). the boost in signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) from gravitational lensing provides an unusually detailed view ofthe physical conditions in these objects. a full complement of high s/nrest-frame optical emission lines is measured, spanning from rest-frame 3600 to6800aa, including robust detections of fainter lines such as h-gamma,[sii]6717,6732, and in one instance [neii]3869. sdss j090122.37+181432.3 showsevidence for agn activity, and therefore we focus our analysis on star-formingregions in the cosmic horseshoe and the clone. for these two objects, weestimate a wide range of physical properties, including star-formation rate(sfr), metallicity, dynamical mass, and dust extinction. in all respects, thelensed objects appear fairly typical of uv-selected star-forming galaxies atz~2. the clone occupies a position on the emission-line diagnostic diagram of[oiii]/h-beta vs. [nii]/h-alpha that is offset from the locations of z~0galaxies. our new nirspec measurements may provide quantitative insights intowhy high-redshift objects display such properties. from the [sii] line ratio,high electron densities (~1000 cm^(-3)) are inferred compared to localgalaxies, and [oiii]/[oii] line ratios indicate higher ionization parameterscompared to the local population. building on previous similar results at z~2,these measurements provide further evidence (at high s/n) that star-formingregions are significantly different in high-redshift galaxies, compared totheir local counterparts (abridged).

0906.2412	the ultraviolet spectrum of the gravitationally lensed galaxy `the  cosmic horseshoe': a close-up of a star-forming galaxy at z = 2	taking advantage of strong gravitational lensing, we have recorded therest-frame uv spectrum of the z = 2.38115 galaxy `the cosmic horseshoe'(j1148+1930) at higher resolution and s/n than is currently feasible forunlensed galaxies at z = 2 -3. from the analysis of stellar spectral features,we conclude that a continuous mode of star formation with a salpeter slopegives a good representation of the uv spectrum, ruling out significantdepartures from a `standard' imf. generally, we find good agreement between thevalues of metallicity deduced from stellar and nebular tracers. interstellarabsorption is present over a velocity range of 1000 km/s, from -800$ to +250km/s relative to the stars and their h ii regions, and there is evidence thatthe outflowing interstellar gas may be patchy, covering only 60% of the uvstellar continuum. the lya line shares many of the characteristics of theso-called lya emitters. its double-peaked profile can be reproduced by modelsof lya photons resonantly scattered by an expanding shell of gas and dust, with10-15% of the photons escaping the galaxy. many of the physical properties ofthe cosmic horseshoe are similar to those of the only other galaxy at z = 2-3studied in comparable detail up to now: ms 1512-cb58. the fact that these twogalaxies have drastically different lya lines may be due simply to orientationeffects, or differences in the covering factor of outflowing gas, and cautionsagainst classifying high-z galaxies only on the basis of spectral features,such as lya, whose appearance can be affected by a variety of differentparameters.

0910.0840	a study of interstellar gas and stars in the gravitationally lensed  galaxy `the cosmic eye' from rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopy	we report the results of a study of the rest-frame uv spectrum of the cosmiceye, a luminous lyman break galaxy at z=3.07331 gravitationally lensed by afactor of 25. the spectrum, recorded with the esi spectrograph on the keck iitelescope, is rich in absorption features from the gas and massive stars inthis galaxy. the interstellar absorption lines are resolved into two componentsof approximately equal strength and each spanning several hundred km/s invelocity. one component has a net blueshift of -70 km/s relative to the starsand h ii regions and presumably arises in a galaxy-scale outflow similar tothose seen in most star-forming galaxies at z = 2-3. the other is more unusualin showing a mean redshift of +350 km/s relative to the systemic redshift;possible interpretations include a merging clump, or material ejected by aprevious star formation episode and now falling back onto the galaxy, or moresimply a chance alignment with a foreground galaxy. in the metal absorptionlines, both components only partially cover the ob stars against which they arebeing viewed. we tentatively associate the redshifted component with the strongdamped lyman alpha line, indicative of a column density n(h i) = (3.0 +/- 0.8)x 10(21) atoms/cm2, and propose that it provides the dust `foreground screen'responsible for the low ratio of far-infrared to uv luminosities of the cosmiceye. compared to other well-studied examples of strongly lensed galaxies, wefind that the young stellar population of the cosmic eye is essentiallyindistinguishable from those of the cosmic horseshoe and ms 1512-cb58, whilethe interstellar spectra of all three galaxies are markedly different,attesting to the real complexity of the interplay between starbursts andambient interstellar matter in young galaxies (abridged).

0911.2000	the relationship between stellar populations and lyman alpha emission in  lyman break galaxies	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 321 lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3 to investigate systematically the relationshipbetween lya emission and stellar populations. lya equivalent widths (ew) werecalculated from rest-frame uv spectroscopy and optical/near-infrared/spitzerphotometry was used in population synthesis modeling to derive the keyproperties of age, dust extinction, star formation rate (sfr), and stellarmass. we directly compare the stellar populations of lbgs with and withoutstrong lya emission, where we designate the former group (ew &gt; 20 aa) as lyaemitters (laes) and the latter group (ew &lt; 20 aa) as non-laes. this controlledmethod of comparing objects from the same uv luminosity distribution representsan improvement over previous studies in which the stellar populations of lbgsand narrowband-selected laes were contrasted, where the latter were oftenintrinsically fainter in broadband filters by an order of magnitude simply dueto different selection criteria. using a variety of statistical tests, we findthat lya equivalent width and age, sfr, and dust extinction, respectively, aresignificantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong lya emissionalso tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty thanobjects with weak lya emission, or the line in absorption. we accordinglyconclude that, within the lbg sample, objects with strong lya emissionrepresent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-inducedoutflows have reduced the dust covering fraction. we also examined thehypothesis that the attenuation of lya photons is lower than that of thecontinuum, as proposed by some, but found no evidence to support this picture.

0707.3634	integral field spectroscopy of high-redshift star forming galaxies with  laser guided adaptive optics: evidence for dispersion-dominated kinematics	we present early results from an ongoing study of the kinematic structure ofstar-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 3 using integral-field spectroscopyof rest-frame optical nebular emission lines in combination with keck laserguide star adaptive optics (lgsao). we show kinematic maps of 3 target galaxiesq1623-bx453, q0449-bx93, and dsf2237a-c2 located at redshifts z = 2.1820,2.0067, and 3.3172 respectively, each of which is well-resolved with a psfmeasuring approximately 0.11 - 0.15 arcsec (~ 900 - 1200 pc at z ~ 2-3) aftercosmetic smoothing. neither galaxy at z ~ 2 exhibits substantial kinematicstructure on scales &gt;~ 30 km/s; both are instead consistent with largelydispersion-dominated velocity fields with sigma ~ 80 km/s along any given lineof sight into the galaxy. in contrast, dsf2237a-c2 presents a well-resolvedgradient in velocity over a distance of ~ 4 kpc with peak-to-peak amplitude of140 km/s. it is unlikely that dsf2237a-c2 represents a dynamically coldrotating disk of ionized gas as the local velocity dispersion of the galaxy(sigma = 79 km/s) is comparable to the observed shear. using extantmulti-wavelength spectroscopy and photometry we relate these kinematic data tophysical properties such as stellar mass, gas fraction, star formation rate,and outflow kinematics and consider the applicability of current galaxyformation models.[abridged]

1002.0837	dust obscuration and metallicity at high redshift: new inferences from  uv, h-alpha, and 8 micron observations of z~2 star-forming galaxies	we use a sample of 90 spectroscopically-confirmed lyman break galaxies withh-alpha and 24 micron observations to constrain the relationship betweenrest-frame 8 micron luminosity, l(8), and star formation rate (sfr) for l*galaxies at z~2. we find a tight correlation with 0.24 dex scatter between l8and l(ha)/sfr for z~2 galaxies with l(ir)~10^10 - 10^12 lsun. employing thisrelationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts,we find that the uv slope can be used to recover the dust attenuation of thevast majority of l* galaxies at z~2 to within 0.4 dex scatter using the localcorrelation. separately, young galaxies with ages &lt;100 myr appear to follow anextinction curve that is steeper than the one found for local starburstgalaxies. therefore, such young galaxies may be significantly less dusty thaninferred previously. our results provide the first direct evidence, independentof the uv slope, for a correlation between uv and bolometric luminosity at highredshift, in the sense that uv-faint galaxies are also on average less infraredand less bolometrically-luminous than their uv-bright counterparts. further, asthe sfr increases, the uv luminosity reaches a maximum value corresponding tol* at z~2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible formodulating the bright-end of the uv luminosity function. l* galaxies at z~2,while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically-luminous, exhibitratios of metals-to-dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. thisresult is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a lessmetal-rich environment compared to local galaxies of the same luminosity, thusnaturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the luminosity-metallicityand luminosity-obscuration relations.

1003.1780	the origin of [oii] in post-starburst and red-sequence galaxies in  high-redshift clusters	we present the first results from a near-ir spectroscopic campaign of thecl1604 supercluster at z~0.9 and the cluster rx j1821.6+6827 at z~0.82 toinvestigate the nature of [oii] 3727a emission in cluster galaxies at highredshift. of the 401 members in the two systems, 131 galaxies have detectable[oii] emission with no other signs of current star-formation, as well as strongabsorption features indicative of a well-established older stellar population.the combination of these features suggests that the primary source of [oii]emission in these galaxies is not the result of star-formation, but rather dueto the presence of a liner or seyfert component. using the nirspec spectrographon the keck ii 10-m telescope, 19 such galaxies were targeted, as well as sixadditional [oii]-emitting cluster members that exhibited other signs of ongoingstar-formation. nearly half (~47%) of the 19 [oii]-emitting, absorption-linedominated galaxies exhibit [oii] to ha equivalent width ratios higher thanunity, the typical value for star-forming galaxies. a majority (~68%) of these19 galaxies are classified as liner/seyfert based on the emission-line ratio of[nii] and ha, increasing to ~85% for red [oii]-emitting, absorption-linedominated galaxies. the liner/seyfert galaxies exhibit l([oii])/l(ha) ratiossignificantly higher than that observed in populations of star-forminggalaxies, suggesting that [oii] is a poor indicator of star-formation in alarge fraction of high-redshift cluster members. we estimate that at least ~20%of galaxies in high-redshift clusters contain a liner/seyfert component thatcan be revealed with line ratios. we also investigate the effect thispopulation has on the star formation rate of cluster galaxies and thepost-starburst fraction, concluding that liner/seyferts must be accounted forif these quantities are to be meaningful.

0708.0007	the sightline to q2343-bx415: clues to galaxy formation in a quasar  environment	(abridged) we have discovered a strong dla coincident in redshift with thefaint qso q2343-bx415 (r = 20.2, z_em = 2.57393). follow-up observations atintermediate spectral resolution reveal that the metal lines associated withthis 'proximate' dla consist of two sets of absorption components. one set ismoving towards the quasar with velocities of ~ 150-600 km/s; this gas is highlyionized and does not fully cover the continuum source, suggesting that it isphysically close to the active nucleus. the other, which accounts for most ofthe neutral gas, is blueshifted relative to the qso, with the strongestcomponent at ~ -160 km/s. we consider the possibility that the pdla arises inthe outflowing interstellar medium of the host galaxy of q2343-bx415, aninterpretation supported by strong c iv and n v absorption at nearbyvelocities, and by the intense radiation field longward of the lyman limitimplied by the high c ii*/h i ratio. if q2343-bx415 is the main source of theseuv photons, then the pdla is located at either ~ 8 or ~ 37 kpc from the activenucleus. alternatively, the absorber may be a foreground star-forming galaxyunrelated to the quasar and coincidentally at the same redshift, but our deepimaging and follow-up spectroscopy of the field of q2343-bx415 has not yetproduced a likely candidate. we measure the abundances of 14 elements in thepdla, finding an overall metallicity of ~ 1/5 solar and a normal pattern ofrelative element abundances for this metallicity. thus, in this pdla there isno evidence for the super-solar metallicities that have been claimed for someproximate, high ionization, systems.

1006.5456	physical conditions in a young, unreddened, low metallicity galaxy at  high redshift	increasingly large samples of galaxies are now being discovered at redshiftsz~5-6 and higher. many of these objects are inferred to be young, low in mass,and relatively unreddened, but detailed analysis of their high quality spectrawill not be possible until the advent of future facilities. in this paper weshed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low mass galaxy bypresenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and uv spectra ofq2343-bx418, an l* galaxy at z=2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio andunusual properties: bx418 is young (&lt;100 myr), low mass (m_star ~ 10^9 msun),low in metallicity (z ~ 1/6 zsun), and unreddened (e(b-v)~0.02, uv continuumslope beta=-2.1). we infer a metallicity 12+log(o/h)=7.9 +/- 0.2 from therest-frame optical emission lines. we also determine the metallicity via thedirect, electron temperature method, using the ratio o iii] 1661, 1666/[o iii]5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12+ log(o/h)=7.8 +/-0.1. these measurements place bx418 among the most metal-poor galaxies observedin emission at high redshift. the rest-frame uv spectrum contains strongemission from lya (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 a), he ii 1640 (bothstellar and nebular), c iii] 1907, 1909 and o iii] 1661, 1666. the c iv/c iii]ratio indicates that the source of ionization is unlikely to be an agn.analysis of the he ii, o iii] and c iii] line strengths indicates a very highionization parameter log u ~ -1, while lya and the interstellar absorptionlines indicate that outflowing gas is highly ionized over a wide range ofvelocities. it remains to be determined how many of bx418's unique spectralfeatures are due to its global properties, such as low metallicity and dustextinction, and how many are indicative of a short-lived phase in the earlyevolution of an otherwise normal star-forming galaxy.

1011.1495	the origin of [oii] emission in recently quenched agn hosts	we have employed emission-line diagnostics derived from deimos and nirspecspectroscopy to determine the origin of the [oii] emission line observed in sixagn hosts at z~0.9. these galaxies are a subsample of agn hosts detected in thecl1604 supercluster that exhibit strong balmer absorption lines in theirspectra and appear to be in a post-starburst or post-quenched phase, if not fortheir [oii] emission. examining the flux ratio of the [nii] to halpha lines, wefind that in five of the six hosts the dominant source of ionizing flux is agncontinuum emission. furthermore, we find that four of the six galaxies haveover twice the [oii] line luminosity that could be generated by star formationprocesses alone given their halpha line luminosities. this strongly suggeststhat agn-excited narrow-line emission is contaminating the [oii] line flux. acomparison of star formation rates calculated from extinction-corrected [oii]and halpha line luminosities indicates that the former yields a five-foldoverestimate of current activity in these galaxies. our findings reveal the[oii] line to be a poor indicator of star formation activity in a majority ofthese moderate-luminosity seyferts. this result bolsters our previous findingsthat an increased fraction of agn at high redshifts are hosted by galaxies in apost-starburst phase. the relatively high fraction of agn hosts in the cl1604supercluster that show signs of recently truncated star formation activitysuggest agn feedback may play an increasingly important role in suppressingongoing activity in large-scale structures at high redshift.

1107.4367	the kinematics of multiple-peaked ly-alpha emission in star-forming  galaxies at z~2-3	we present new results on the ly-alpha emission-line kinematics of 18 z~2-3star-forming galaxies with multiple-peaked ly-alpha profiles. with our largespectroscopic database of uv-selected star-forming galaxies at these redshifts,we have determined that ~30% of such objects with detectable ly-alpha emissiondisplay multiple-peaked emission profiles. these profiles provide additionalconstraints on the escape of ly-alpha photons due to the rich velocitystructure in the emergent line. despite recent advances in modeling the escapeof ly-alpha from star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, comparisons betweenmodels and data are often missing crucial observational information. using keckii nirspec spectra of h-alpha (z~2) and [oiii] 5007 (z~3), we have measuredaccurate systemic redshifts, rest-frame optical nebular velocity dispersionsand emission-line fluxes for the objects in the sample. accurate systemicredshifts allow us to translate the multiple-peaked ly-alpha profiles intovelocity space, revealing that the majority (11/18) display double-peakedemission straddling the velocity-field zeropoint with stronger red-sideemission. we compare our data with the predictions of simple models foroutflowing and infalling gas distributions around high-redshift galaxies. whilepopular "shell" models provide a qualitative match with many of theobservations of ly-alpha emission, we find that in detail there are importantdiscrepancies between the models and data, as well as problems with applyingthe framework of an expanding thin shell of gas to explain high-redshift galaxyspectra. our data highlight these inconsistencies, as well as illuminatingcritical elements for success in future models of outflow and infall inhigh-redshift galaxies.

0711.0001	the varied fates of z~2 star-forming galaxies	star-forming galaxies constitute the majority of galaxies with stellar masses&gt;10^10 m_sun/h^2 at z~2 and dominate the star-formation rate density of theuniverse at this early epoch. it is thus critical to understand their origins,evolution, and connection to the underlying dark matter distribution. to thisend, we identify the dark matter halos (including subhalos) that are likely tocontain star-forming galaxies at z~2 (z2sfgs) within a large dissipationlesscosmological simulation and then use halo merger histories to follow theevolution of z2sfg descendants to z~1 and z~0. the evolved halos at theseepochs are then confronted with an array of observational data in order touncover the likely descendants of z2sfgs. though the evolved halos haveclustering strengths comparable to red galaxies at z~1 and z~0, we find thatthe bulk of z2sfgs do not evolve into red galaxies, at either epoch. thisconclusion is based primarily on the fact that the space density of z2sfgs ismuch higher than that of lower redshift red galaxies, even when accounting forthe merging of z2sfg descendants, which decreases the number density of z2sfgdescendants by at most a factor of two by z~0. of the ~50% of z2sfgs thatsurvive to z~0, ~70% reside at the center of z~0 dark matter halos with m&gt;10^12m_sun/h. halo occupation modeling of z~0 galaxies suggests that such halos areoccupied by galaxies with m_r&lt;-20.5, implying that these z2sfgs evolve into``typical'' ~ l* galaxies today, including our own galaxy. the remaining ~30%become satellite galaxies by z~0, and comparison to halo occupation modelingsuggests that they are rather faint, with m_r&lt;-19.5.

1205.0555	the characteristic star formation histories of galaxies at redshifts  z~2-7	a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;3.7, withcomplementary imaging in the near- and mid-ir from the ground and from hubbleand spitzer, is used to infer the average star formation histories (sfhs) oftypical galaxies from z~7 to 2. for a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6, weperform a comparison of star formation rates (sfrs) determined from sedmodeling (sfrs[sed]) and those calculated from deep keck uv and spitzer/mips 24micron imaging (sfrs[ir+uv]). exponentially declining sfhs yield sfrs[sed] thatare 5-10x lower on average than sfrs[ir+uv], indicating that declining sfhs maynot be accurate for typical galaxies at z&gt;2. the sfrs of z~2-3 galaxies aredirectly proportional to their stellar masses m*, with unity slope---a resultthat is confirmed with spitzer/irac stacks of 1179 uv-faint (r&gt;25.5)galaxies---for m*&gt;5e8 msun and sfrs &gt;2 msun/yr. we interpret this result in thecontext of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of thesfr-m* relation. the average specific sfrs at z~2-3 are similar within a factorof two to those measured at z&gt;4, implying an average sfh where sfrs increasewith time. a consequence of these rising sfhs is that (a) a substantialfraction of uv-bright z~2-3 galaxies had faint sub-l* progenitors at z&gt;4; and(b) gas masses must increase with time from z=7 to 2, over which time the netcold gas accretion rate---as inferred from the specific sfr and thekennicutt-schmidt relation---is ~2-3x larger than the sfr . however, if weevolve to higher redshift the sfhs and masses of the halos that are expected tohost l* galaxies at z~2, we find that &lt;10% of the baryons accreted onto typicalhalos at z&gt;4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. theseresults highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at earlycosmic times when galaxies were first assembling.

1206.3308	stellar populations of uv-selected active galactic nuclei host galaxies  at z ~ 2 - 3	we use stellar population synthesis modeling to analyze the host galaxyproperties of a sample of 33 uv-selected, narrow-lined active galactic nuclei(agns) at z ~ 2 - 3. in order to quantify the contribution of agn emission tohost galaxy broadband spectral energy distributions (seds), we use thesubsample of 11 agns with photometric coverage spanning from rest-frame uvthrough near-ir wavelengths. modeling the seds of these objects with a linearcombination of stellar population and agn templates, we infer the effect of theagn on derived stellar population parameters. we also estimate the typical biasin derived stellar populations for agns lacking rest-frame near-ir wavelengthcoverage, and develop a method for inferring the true host galaxy properties.we compare agn host galaxy properties to those of a sample of uv-selected,star-forming non-agns in the same redshift range, including a subsamplecarefully matched in stellar mass. although the agns have higher masses andsfrs than the full non-active sample, their stellar population properties areconsistent with those of the mass-selected sample, suggesting that the presenceof an agn is not connected with the cessation of star-formation activity instar-forming galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3. we suggest that a correlation between m_bhand galaxy stellar mass is already in place at this epoch. assuming a roughlyconstant eddington ratio for agns at all stellar masses, we are unable todetect the agns in low-mass galaxies because they are simply too faint.

1206.5552	demographics and physical properties of gas out/inflows at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.4	we present keck/lris spectra of over 200 galaxies with well-determinedredshifts between 0.4 and 1.4. we combine new measurements of near-ultraviolet,low-ionization absorption lines with previously measured masses, luminosities,colors, and star formation rates to describe the demographics and properties ofgalactic flows. among star-forming galaxies with blue colors, we find a netblueshift of the feii absorption greater than 200 km/s (100 km/s) towards 2.5%(20%) of the galaxies. the fraction of blueshifted spectra does not varysignificantly with stellar mass, color, or luminosity but does decline atspecific star formation rates less than roughly 0.8 gyr^{-1}. the insensitivityof the blueshifted fraction to galaxy properties requires collimated outflowsat these redshifts, while the decline in outflow fraction with increasingblueshift might reflect the angular dependence of the outflow velocity. the lowdetection rate of infalling gas, 3 to 6% of the spectra, suggests an origin in(enriched) streams favorably aligned with our sightline. we find 4 of these 9infalling streams have projected velocities commensurate with the kinematics ofan extended disk or satellite galaxy. the strength of the mgii absorptionincreases with stellar mass, b-band luminosity, and u-b color, trends arisingfrom a combination of more interstellar absorption at the systemic velocity andless emission filling in more massive galaxies. our results provides a newquantitative understanding of gas flows between galaxies and the circumgalacticmedium over a critical period in galaxy evolution.

1206.6889	an hst/wfc3-ir morphological survey of galaxies at z = 1.5-3.6: ii. the  relation between morphology and gas-phase kinematics	we analyze rest-frame optical morphologies and gas-phase kinematics as tracedby rest-frame far-uv and optical spectra for a sample of 204 star forminggalaxies in the redshift range z ~ 2-3 drawn from the keck baryonic structuresurvey (kbss). we find that spectroscopic properties and gas-phase kinematicsare closely linked to morphology: compact galaxies with semi-major axis radii r&lt;~ 2 kpc are substantially more likely than their larger counterparts toexhibit lya in emission. although lya emission strength varies widely withingalaxies of a given morphological type, all but one of 19 galaxies with lyaequivalent width w_lya &gt; 20 angstroms have compact and/or multiple-componentmorphologies with r &lt;= 2.5 kpc. the velocity structure of absorption lines inthe galactic continuum spectra also varies as a function of morphology.galaxies of all morphological types drive similarly strong outflows (as tracedby the blue wing of interstellar absorption line features), but the outflows oflarger galaxies are less highly ionized and exhibit larger optical depth at thesystemic redshift that may correspond to a decreasing efficiency of feedback inevacuating gas from the galaxy. this v ~ 0 km/s gas is responsible both forshifting the mean absorption line redshift and attenuating w_lya (via a longerresonant scattering path) in galaxies with larger rest-optical half lightradii. in contrast to galaxies at lower redshifts, there is no evidence for acorrelation between outflow velocity and inclination, suggesting that outflowsfrom these puffy and irregular systems may be poorly collimated.

1207.4196	high velocity dispersion in a rare grand design spiral galaxy at  redshift z=2.18	although relatively common in the local universe, only one grand-designspiral galaxy has been spectroscopically confirmed to lie at z&gt;2 (hdfx 28;z=2.011), and may prove to be a major merger that simply resembles a spiral inprojection. the rarity of spirals has been explained as a result of disks beingdynamically 'hot' at z&gt;2 which may instead favor the formation ofcommonly-observed clumpy structures. alternatively, current instrumentation maysimply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to thosein the modern universe. at redshifts &lt;2, the velocity dispersion of disksdecreases, and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z~1. here we reportobservations of the grand design spiral galaxy q2343-bx442 at z=2.18.spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying anuncertain origin for the spiral structure. the kinematics of the galaxy areconsistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive theformation of short-lived spiral structure. a duty cycle of &lt; 100 myr for suchtidally-induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with theirrarity.

1210.2393	a refined estimate of the ionizing emissivity from galaxies at z~3:  spectroscopic follow-up in the ssa22a field	we investigate the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the ionizingbackground at z~3, building on previous work based on narrowband (nb3640)imaging in the ssa22a field. we use new keck/lris spectra of lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) and narrowband-selected lya emitters (laes) to measureredshifts for 16 lbgs and 87 laes at z&gt;3.055, such that our nb3640 imagingprobes the lyman-continuum (lyc) region. when we include the existing set ofspectroscopically-confirmed lbgs, our total sample with z&gt;3.055 consists of 41lbgs and 91 laes, of which nine lbgs and 20 laes are detected in our nb3640image. with our combined imaging and spectroscopic data sets, we criticallyinvestigate the origin of nb3640 emission for detected lbgs and laes. we removefrom our samples 3 lbgs and 3 laes with spectroscopic evidence of contaminationof their nb3640 flux by foreground galaxies, and statistically model theeffects of additional, unidentified foreground contaminants. the resultingcontamination and lyc-detection rates, respectively, are 62 +/-13% and 8 +/-3%for our lbg sample, and 47 +/-10% and 12 +/-2% for our lae sample. thecorresponding ratios of non-ionizing uv to lyc flux-density, corrected forintergalactic medium (igm) attenuation, are 18.0 +34.8/-7.4 for lbgs, and 3.7+2.5/-1.1 for laes. we use these ratios to estimate the total contribution ofstar-forming galaxies to the ionizing background and the hydrogenphotoionization rate in the igm, finding values larger than, but consistentwith, those measured in the lya forest. finally, the measured uv to lycflux-density ratios imply model-dependent lyc escape fractions of f_{esc}^{lyc}~ 5-7% for our lbg sample and f_{esc}^{lyc} ~ 10-30% for our fainter laesample.

1304.6405	scattered emission from z~1 galactic outflows	mapping mg ii resonance emission scattered by galactic winds offers a meansto determine the spatial extent and density of the warm outflow. usingkeck/lris spectroscopy, we have resolved scattered mg ii emission to the eastof 32016857, a star-forming galaxy at z =0.9392 with an outflow. the mg iiemission from this galaxy exhibits a p-cygni profile, extends further than boththe continuum and [o ii] emission along the eastern side of the slit, and has aconstant doppler shift along the slit which does not follow the velocitygradient of the nebular [o ii] emission. using the sobolev approximation, wederive the density of mg+ ions at a radius of 12 to 18 kpc in the outflow. wemodel the ionization correction and find that much of the outflowing mg is inmg++. we estimate that the total mass flux could be as large as 330 - 500 solarmasses per year, with the largest uncertainties coming from the depletion of mgonto grains and the clumpiness of the warm outflow. we show that confining thewarm clouds with a hot wind reduces the estimated mass flux of the warm outflowand indicates amass-loading factor near unity in the warm phase alone. based onthe high blue luminosities that distinguish 32016857 and tkrs 4389, describedby rubin et al. 2011, from other galaxies with p-cygni emission, we suggestthat, as sensitivity to diffuse emission improves, scattering halos may proveto be a generic property of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

1304.6719	the column density distribution and continuum opacity of the  intergalactic and circumgalactic medium at redshift &lt;z&gt;=2.4	we present new high-precision measurements of the opacity of theintergalactic and circumgalactic medium (igm, cgm) at &lt;z&gt;=2.4. using voigtprofile fits to the full lyman alpha and lyman beta forests in 15high-resolution high-s/n spectra of hyperluminous qsos, we make the firststatistically robust measurement of the frequency of absorbers with hi columndensities 14 &lt; log(nhi) &lt; 17.2. we also present the first measurements of thefrequency distribution of hi absorbers in the volume surrounding high-zgalaxies (the cgm, 300 pkpc), finding that the incidence of absorbers in thecgm is much higher than in the igm. in agreement with rudie et al. (2012), wefind that there are fractionally more high-nhi absorbers than low-nhi absorbersin the cgm compared to the igm, leading to a shallower power law fit to the cgmfrequency distribution. we use these new measurements to calculate the totalopacity of the igm and cgm to hydrogen-ionizing photons, finding significantlyhigher opacity than most previous studies, especially from absorbers withlog(nhi) &lt; 17.2. reproducing the opacity measured in our data as well as theincidence of absorbers with log(nhi) &gt; 17.2 requires a broken power lawparameterization of the frequency distribution with a break near log(nhi) ~ 15.we compute new estimates of the mean free path (mfp) to hydrogen-ionizingphotons at z=2.4, finding mfp = 147 +- 15 mpc when considering only igmopacity. if instead, we consider photons emanating from a high-z star-forminggalaxy and account for the local excess opacity due to the surrounding cgm ofthe galaxy itself, the mean free path is reduced to mfp = 121 +- 15 mpc. thesemfp measurements are smaller than recent estimates and should inform futurestudies of the metagalactic uv background and of ionizing sources at z~2-3.

1306.1535	narrowband lyman-continuum imaging of galaxies at z ~ 2.85	we present results from a survey for z~2.85 lyman-continuum (lyc) emission inthe hs1549+1933 field and place constraints on the amount of ionizing radiationescaping from star-forming galaxies. using a custom narrowband filter (nb3420)tuned to wavelengths just below the lyman limit at z&gt;=2.82, we probe the lycspectral region of 49 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) and 91 lya-emitters (laes)spectroscopically confirmed at z&gt;=2.82. four lbgs and seven laes are detectedin nb3420. using v-band data probing the rest-frame non-ionizing uv, we observethat many nb3420-detected galaxies exhibit spatial offsets between their lycand non-ionizing uv emission and are characterized by extremely blue nb3420-vcolors, corresponding to low ratios of non-ionizing to ionizing radiation(f_uv/f_lyc) that are in tension with current stellar population synthesismodels. we measure average values of f_uv/f_lyc for our lbg and lae samples,correcting for foreground galaxy contamination and hi absorption in the igm. wefind (f_uv/f_lyc)_corr^lbg=82 +/- 45 and (f_uv/f_lyc)_corr^lae=7.4 +/- 3.6.these flux-density ratios correspond respectively to relative lyc escapefractions of f_esc,rel^lbg=5-8% and f_esc,rel^lae=18-49%, absolute lyc escapefractions of f_esc^lbg=1-2% and f_esc^lae=5-15%, and a comoving lyc emissivityfrom star-forming galaxies of 8.8-15.0 x 10^24 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3. in order tostudy the differential properties of galaxies with and without lyc detections,we analyze narrowband lya imaging and rest-frame near-infrared imaging, findingthat while laes with lyc detections have lower lya equivalent widths onaverage, there is no substantial difference in the rest-frame near-infraredcolors of lbgs or laes with and without lyc detections. these preliminaryresults are consistent with an orientation-dependent model where lyc emissionescapes through cleared paths in a patchy ism.

0801.1670	metallicities and physical conditions in star-forming galaxies at  z~1.0-1.5	we present a study of the mass-metallicity (m-z) relation and h ii regionphysical conditions in a sample of 20 star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.5 drawnfrom the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. our analysis indicates that the zeropoint of the m-z relationship evolves with redshift, in the sense that galaxiesat fixed stellar mass become more metal-rich at lower redshift. measurements of[o iii]/h-beta and [n ii]/h-alpha emission-line ratios show that, on average,objects in the deep2 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.5 sample are significantly offset from theexcitation sequence observed in nearby h ii regions and sdss emission-linegalaxies. in order to fully understand the causes of this offset, which is alsoobserved in z~2 star-forming galaxies, we examine in detail the small fractionof sdss galaxies that have similar diagnostic ratios to those of the deep2sample. some of these galaxies indicate evidence for agn and/or shock activity,which may give rise to their unusual line ratios, and contribute to balmeremission lines at the level of ~20%. others indicate no evidence for agn orshock excitation, yet are characterized by higher electron densities andtemperatures, and therefore, interstellar gas pressures, than typical sdssstar-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass. these anomalous objects alsohave higher concentrations and star-formation rate surface densities, which aredirectly connected to higher interstellar pressure. higher star-formation ratesurface densities, interstellar pressures, and hii region ionization parametersmay also be common at high-redshift. these effects must be taken into accountwhen using strong-line indicators to understand the evolution of heavy elementsin galaxies. when such effects are included, the inferred evolution of the m-zrelation out to z~2 is more significant than previous estimates.

1306.6334	the mass-metallicity relation of a z~2 protocluster with mosfire	we present keck/mosfire observations of the role of environment in theformation of galaxies at z~2. using k-band spectroscopy of h-alpha and [n ii]emission lines, we have analyzed the metallicities of galaxies within andaround a z=2.3 protocluster discovered in the hs1700+643 field. our main sampleconsists of 23 protocluster and 20 field galaxies with estimates of stellarmasses and gas-phase metallicities based on the n2 strong-line metallicityindicator. with these data we have examined the mass-metallicity relation (mzr)with respect to environment at z~2. we find that field galaxies follow thewell-established trend between stellar mass and metallicity, such that moremassive galaxies have larger metallicities. the protocluster galaxies, however,do not exhibit a dependence of metallicity on mass, with the low-massprotocluster galaxies showing an enhancement in metallicity compared to fieldgalaxies spanning the same mass range. a comparison with galaxy formationmodels suggests that the mass-dependent environmental trend we observed can bequalitatively explained in the context of the recycling of "momentum-driven"galaxy wind material. accordingly, winds are recycled on a shorter timescale indenser environments, leading to an enhancement in metallicity at fixed mass forall but the most massive galaxies. future hydrodynamical simulations of z~2overdensities matching the one in the hs1700 field will be crucial forunderstanding the origin of the observed environmental trend in detail.

1311.5092	testing metallicity indicators at z~1.4 with the gravitationally lensed  galaxy cassowary 20	we present x-shooter observations of cassowary 20 (cswa 20), a star-forming(sfr ~6 msol/yr) galaxy at z=1.433, magnified by a factor of 11.5 by thegravitational lensing produced by a massive foreground galaxy at z=0.741. weanalysed the integrated physical properties of the hii regions of cswa 20 usingtemperature- and density-sensitive emission lines. we find the abundance ofoxygen to be ~1/7 of solar, while carbon is ~50 times less abundant than in thesun. the unusually low c/o ratio may be an indication of a particularly rapidtimescale of chemical enrichment. the wide wavelength coverage of x-shootergives us access to five different methods for determining the metallicity ofcswa 20, three based on emission lines from hii regions and two on absorptionfeatures formed in the atmospheres of massive stars. all five estimates are inagreement, within the factor of ~2 uncertainty of each method. the interstellarmedium of cswa 20 only partially covers the star-forming region as viewed fromour direction; in particular, absorption lines from neutrals and first ions areexceptionally weak. we find evidence for large-scale outflows of theinterstellar medium (ism) with speeds of up 750 km/s, similar to the valuesmeasured in other high-z galaxies sustaining much higher rates of starformation.

1408.3638	the ly-alpha properties of faint galaxies at z2-3 with systemic  redshifts and velocity dispersions from keck-mosfire	we study the lya profiles of 36 spectroscopically-detected lya-emitters(laes) at z2-3, using keck mosfire to measure systemic redshifts and velocitydispersions from rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. the sample has amedian optical magnitude r=26.0, and ranges from r23 to r&gt;27, corresponding torest-frame uv absolute magnitudes m_uv-22 to m_uv&gt;-18.2. dynamical masses rangefrom m_dyn&lt;1.3e8 msun to m_dyn=6.8e9 msun, with a median value of m_dyn=6.3e8msun. thirty of the 36 lya emission lines are redshifted with respect to thesystemic velocity with at least 1 sigma significance, and the velocity offsetwith respect to systemic dv_lya is correlated with r-band magnitude, m_uv, andthe velocity dispersion measured from nebular emission lines with &gt;3 sigmasignificance: brighter galaxies with larger velocity dispersions tend to havelarger values of dv_lya. we also make use of a comparison sample of 122uv-color-selected r&lt;25.5 galaxies at z2, all with lya emission and systemicredshifts measured from nebular emission lines. using the combined lae andcomparison samples for a total of 158 individual galaxies, we find that dv_lyais anti-correlated with the lya equivalent width with 7 sigma significance. ourresults are consistent with a scenario in which the lya profile is determinedprimarily by the properties of the gas near the systemic redshift; in such ascenario, the opacity to lya photons in lower mass galaxies may be reduced iflarge gaseous disks have not yet developed and if the gas is ionized by theharder spectrum of young, low metallicity stars.

1502.06978	a deep hubble and keck search for definitive identification of lyman  continuum emitters at z~3.1	narrow-band imaging of the rest-frame lyman continuum (lyc) of galaxies atz~3.1 has produced a large number of candidate lyc-emitting galaxies. thesesamples are contaminated by galaxies at lower redshift. to better understandlyc escape, we need an uncontaminated sample of galaxies that emit strongly inthe lyc. here we present deep hubble imaging of five bright galaxies at z~3.1that had previously been identified as candidate lyc-emitters with ground-basedimages. the wfc3 f336w images probe the lyc of galaxies at z&gt;3.06 and providean order-of-magnitude increase in spatial resolution over ground-based imaging.the non-ionizing uv images often show multiple galaxies (or components) within~1'' of the candidate lyc emission seen from the ground. in each case, only oneof the components is emitting light in the f336w filter, which would indicatelyc escape if that component is at z&gt;3.06. we use keck/nirspec near-irspectroscopy to measure redshifts of these components to distinguishlyc-emitters from foreground contamination. we find that two candidates are lowredshift contaminants, one candidate had a previously misidentified redshift,and the other two cannot be confirmed as lyc-emitters. the level ofcontamination is consistent with previous estimates. for the galaxies withz&gt;3.06, we derive strong 1 sigma limits on the relative escape fraction between0.07 and 0.09. we still do not have a sample of definitive lyc-emitters, and amuch larger study of low luminosity galaxies is required. the combination ofhigh resolution imaging and deep spectroscopy is critical for distinguishinglyc-emitters from foreground contaminants.

1503.03929	investigating h$\alpha$, uv, and ir star-formation rate diagnostics for  a large sample of z ~ 2 galaxies	we use a sample of 262 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies atredshifts $2.08\leq z\leq 2.51$ to compare h$\alpha$, uv, and irstar-formation-rate diagnostics and to investigate the dust properties of thegalaxies. at these redshifts, the h$\alpha$ line shifts to the $k_{s}$-band. bycomparing $k_{s}$-band photometry to underlying stellar population model fitsto other uv, optical, and near-infrared data, we infer the h$\alpha$ flux foreach galaxy. we obtain the best agreement between h$\alpha$- and uv-based sfrsif we assume that the ionized gas and stellar continuum are reddened by thesame value and that the calzetti attenuation curve is applied to both. aidedwith mips 24$\mu$m data, we find that an attenuation curve steeper than thecalzetti curve is needed to reproduce the observed ir/uv ratios of galaxiesyounger than 100 myr. furthermore, using the bolometric star-formation rateinferred from the uv and mid-ir data (sfr$_{ir}$+sfr$_{uv}$), we calculated theconversion between the h$\alpha$ luminosity and sfr to be $(7.5\pm1.3) \times10^{-42}$ for a salpeter imf, which is consistent with the kennicutt (1998)conversion. the derived conversion factor is independent of any assumption ofthe dust correction and is robust to stellar population model uncertainties.

1504.02782	the mosdef survey: measurements of balmer decrements and the dust  attenuation curve at redshifts z~1.4-2.6	we present results on the dust attenuation curve of z~2 galaxies using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. our sampleconsists of 224 star-forming galaxies with nebular spectroscopic redshifts inthe range z= 1.36-2.59 and high s/n measurements of, or upper limits on, theh-alpha and h-beta emission lines obtained with keck/mosfire. we constructcomposite seds of galaxies in bins of specific sfr and balmer optical depth inorder to directly constrain the dust attenuation curve from the uv throughnear-ir for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. our results implyan attenuation curve that is very similar to the smc extinction curve atwavelengths redward of 2500 angstroms. at shorter wavelengths, the shape of thecurve is identical to that of the calzetti relation, but with a lowernormalization (r_v). hence, the new attenuation curve results in sfrs that are~20% lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtainedwith the calzetti attenuation curve. moreover, we find that the difference inthe reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellarcontinuum correlates strongly with sfr, such that for dust-corrected sfrslarger than 20 msun/yr assuming a chabrier imf, the nebular emission linessuffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. a simplemodel that can account for these trends is one in which the uv through opticalstellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, whilethe nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated bydustier stellar populations for galaxies with large sfrs, as a result of theincreased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. consequently, uv- andsed-based sfrs may underestimate the total sfr at even modest levels of ~20msun/yr.

1506.08201	a high-resolution hubble space telescope study of apparent lyman  continuum leakers at $z\sim3$	we present $u_{336}v_{606}j_{125}h_{160}$ follow-up $hst$ observations of 16$z\sim3$ candidate lyc emitters in the hs1549+1919 field. with these data, weobtain high spatial-resolution photometric redshifts of all sub-arcsecondcomponents of the lyc candidates in order to eliminate foreground contaminationand identify robust candidates for leaking lyc emission. of the 16 candidates,we find one object with a robust lyc detection that is not due to foregroundcontamination. this object (md5) resolves into two components; we refer to thelyc-emitting component as md5b. md5b has an observed 1500\aa\ to 900\aa\flux-density ratio of $(f_{uv}/f_{lyc})_{obs}=4.0\pm2.0$, compatible withpredictions from stellar population synthesis models. assuming minimal igmabsorption, this ratio corresponds to a relative (absolute) escape fraction of$f_{esc,rel}^{md5b}=75-100$% ($f_{esc,abs}^{md5b}=14-19$%). the stellarpopulation fit to md5b indicates an age of $\lesssim50$myr, which is in theyoungest 10% of the $hst$ sample and the youngest third of typical $z\sim3$lyman break galaxies, and may be a contributing factor to its lyc detection. weobtain a revised, contamination-free estimate for the comoving specificionizing emissivity at $z=2.85$, indicating (with large uncertainties) thatstar-forming galaxies provide roughly the same contribution as qsos to theionizing background at this redshift. our results show that foregroundcontamination prevents ground-based lyc studies from obtaining a fullunderstanding of lyc emission from $z\sim3$ star-forming galaxies. futureprogress in direct lyc searches is contingent upon the elimination offoreground contaminants through high spatial-resolution observations, and uponacquisition of sufficiently deep lyc imaging to probe ionizing radiation inhigh-redshift galaxies.

1507.00721	physical properties of a pilot sample of spectroscopic close pair  galaxies at z ~ 2	we use hubble space telescope wide-field camera 3 (hst/wfc3) rest-frameoptical imaging to select a pilot sample of star-forming galaxies in theredshift range z = 2.00-2.65 whose multi-component morphologies are consistentwith expectations for major mergers. we follow up this sample of major mergercandidates with keck/nirspec longslit spectroscopy obtained in excellent seeingconditions (fwhm ~ 0.5 arcsec) to obtain halpha-based redshifts of each of themorphological components in order to distinguish spectroscopic pairs from falsepairs created by projection along the line of sight. of six pair candidatesobserved, companions (estimated mass ratios 5:1 and 7:1) are detected for twogalaxies down to a 3sigma limiting emission-line flux of ~ 10^{-17} erg/s/cm2.this detection rate is consistent with a ~ 50% false pair fraction at suchangular separations (1-2 arcsec), and with recent claims that thestar-formation rate (sfr) can differ by an order of magnitude between thecomponents in such mergers. the two spectroscopic pairs identified have totalsfr, sfr surface densities, and stellar masses consistent on average with theoverall z ~ 2 star forming galaxy population.

1507.03017	the mosdef survey: dissecting the star-formation rate vs. stellar mass  relation using h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ emission lines at z ~ 2	we present results on the star-formation rate (sfr) versus stellar mass($m_*$) relation (i.e., the "main sequence") among star-forming galaxies at1.37$\leq$$z$$\leq$2.61 using the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey.based on a sample of 261 galaxies with h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ spectroscopy, wehave estimated robust dust-corrected instantaneous sfrs over a large range in$m_*$ ($\sim10^{9.5}-10^{11.5}m_\odot$). we find a correlation betweenlog(sfr(h$\alpha$)) and log($m_*$) with a slope of 0.65$\pm$0.08(0.58$\pm$0.10) at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.6 (2.1&lt;z&lt;2.6). we find that different assumptionsfor the dust correction, such as using the color-excess of the stellarcontinuum to correct the nebular lines, sample selection biases against redstar-forming galaxies, and not accounting for balmer absorption can yieldsteeper slopes of the log(sfr)-log($m_*$) relation. our sample is immune fromthese biases as it is rest-frame optically selected, h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ arecorrected for balmer absorption, and the h$\alpha$ luminosity is dust-correctedusing the nebular color-excess computed from the balmer decrement. the scatterof the log(sfr(h$\alpha$))-log($m_*$) relation, after accounting for themeasurement uncertainties, is 0.31 dex at 2.1&lt;z&lt;2.6, which is 0.05 dex largerthan the scatter in log(sfr(uv))-log($m_*$). based on comparisons to asimulated sfr-$m_*$ relation with some intrinsic scatter, we argue that in theabsence of direct measurements of galaxy-to-galaxy variations in theattenuation/extinction curves and the imf, one cannot use the difference in thescatter of the sfr(h$\alpha$)- and sfr(uv)-$m_*$ relations to constrain thestochasticity of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.

1509.03636	the mosdef survey: electron density and ionization parameter at  $z\sim2.3$	using observations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey, weinvestigate the physical conditions of star-forming regions in $z\sim2.3$galaxies, specifically the electron density and ionization state. frommeasurements of the [o ii]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729 and [sii]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731 doublets, we find a median electron density of$\sim250$ cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim2.3$, an increase of an order of magnitudecompared to measurements of galaxies at $z\sim0$. while $z\sim2.3$ galaxies areoffset towards significantly higher o$_{32}$ values relative to local galaxiesat fixed stellar mass, we find that the high-redshift sample follows a similardistribution to the low-metallicity tail of the local distribution in theo$_{32}$ vs. r$_{23}$ and o3n2 diagrams. based on these results, we proposethat $z\sim2.3$ star-forming galaxies have the same ionization parameter aslocal galaxies at fixed metallicity. in combination with simple photoionizationmodels, the position of local and $z\sim2.3$ galaxies in excitation diagramssuggests that there is no significant change in the hardness of the ionizingspectrum at fixed metallicity from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim2.3$. we find that$z\sim2.3$ galaxies show no offset compared to low-metallicity local galaxiesin emission line ratio diagrams involving only lines of hydrogen, oxygen, andsulfur, but show a systematic offset in diagrams involving [n ii]$\lambda$6584.we conclude that the offset of $z\sim2.3$ galaxies from the local star-formingsequence in the [n ii] bpt diagram is primarily driven by elevated n/o at fixedo/h compared to local galaxies. these results suggest that the local gas-phaseand stellar metallicity sets the ionization state of star-forming regions at$z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$.

astro-ph;0102456	the rest frame optical spectra of lyman break galaxies: star formation,  extinction, abundances, and kinematics	we present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of lyman breakgalaxies in the near-infrared aimed at detecting the emission lines of [o ii],[o iii], and hbeta from the h ii regions of star forming galaxies at z = 3.  from observations of 19 objects with the keck and vlt telescopes, we reachthe following main conclusions. contrary to expectations, the star formationrates deduced from the hbeta luminosity are on average no larger than thoseimplied by the stellar continuum at 1500 a; presumably any differentialextinction between rest-frame optical and uv is small compared with therelative uncertainties in the calibrations of these two star formation tracers.for the galaxies in our sample, the abundance of o can only be determined towithin one order of magnitude. even so, it seems well established that lbgs arethe most metal-enriched structures at z = 3, apart from qsos, with abundancesgreater than about 1/10 solar. they are also significantly overluminous fortheir metallicities; this is probably an indication that their mass-to-lightratios are small compared with present-day galaxies. at face value theirvelocity dispersions, sigma = 50 - 115 km/s imply virial masses of about10^{10} solar masses within half-light radii of 2.5 kpc. however, we are unableto establish if the widths of the emission lines do reflect the motions of theh ii regions within the gravitational potential of the galaxies, even though intwo cases we see hints of rotation curves. all 19 lbgs observed show evidencefor galactic-scale superwinds; such outflows are important for regulating starformation, distributing metals over large volumes, and allowing lyman continuumphotons to escape and ionize the igm.

astro-ph;0503485	uv to mid-ir observations of star-forming galaxies at z~2: stellar  masses and stellar populations	we present the broad-band uv through mid-infrared spectral energydistributions (seds) of a sample of 72 spectroscopically-confirmed star-forminggalaxies at z=2.30+/-0.3. located in a 72 arcmin-squared field centered on thebright background qso, hs1700+643, these galaxies were pre-selected to lie atz~2 based solely on their rest-frame uv colors and luminosities, and should berepresentative of uv-selected samples at high redshift. in addition to deepground-based photometry spanning from 0.35-2.15 microns, we make use ofspitzer/irac data, which probes the rest-frame near-ir at z~2. the range ofstellar populations present in the sample is investigated with simple,single-component stellar population synthesis models. emphasizing stellar massestimates, which are less subject to systematic uncertainties than otherparameters, we find &lt;log(m*/msun)&gt;=10.32+/-0.51 for the sample. allowing forthe possibility of episodic star formation, we find that typical galaxies inour sample could contain up to three times more stellar mass in an oldunderlying burst than what was inferred from single-component modeling. incontrast, mass estimates for the most massive galaxies in the sample (m*&gt;10^11msun) are fairly insensitive to the method used to model the stellarpopulation. galaxies in this massive tail, which are also the oldest objects inthe sample, could plausibly evolve into the passive galaxies discovered atz~1.7 with near-ir selection techniques. in the general framework ofhierarchical galaxy formation and mergers, which implies episodicstar-formation histories, galaxies at high redshift may pass in and out ofuv-selected and near-ir color-selected samples as they evolve from phases ofactive star formation to quiescence and back again (abridged).

astro-ph;0509102	chemical abundances of deep2 star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.5	we present the results of near-infrared spectroscopic observations for asample of 12 star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.5, drawn from the deep2 galaxyredshift survey. h-beta, [oiii], h-alpha, and [nii] emission-line fluxes aremeasured for these galaxies. application of the o3n2 and n2 strong-lineabundance indicators implies average gas-phase oxygen abundances of 50-80%solar. we find preliminary evidence of luminosity-metallicity (l-z) andmass-metallicity (m-z) relationships within our sample, which spans fromm_b=-20.3 to -23.1 in rest-frame optical luminosity, and from 4x10^9 to 2x10^11msun in stellar mass. at fixed oxygen abundance, these relationships aredisplaced from the local ones by several magnitudes towards brighter absoluteb-band luminosity and more than an order of magnitude towards larger stellarmass. if individual deep2 galaxies in our sample follow the observed globalevolution in the b-band luminosity function of blue galaxies between z~1 andz~0 they will fade on average by ~1.3 magnitudes in m_b. to fall on local (l-z)and (m-z) relationships, these galaxies must increase by a factor of 6-7 inm/l_b between z~1 and z~0, and by factor of two in both stellar mass andmetallicity. emission line diagnostic ratios indicate that the z&gt;1 deep2galaxies in our sample are significantly offset from the excitation sequenceobserved in nearby hii regions and sdss emission-line galaxies. this offsetimplies that physical conditions are different in the hii regions of distantgalaxies hosting intense star formation, and may affect the chemical abundancesderived from strong-line ratios for such objects (abridged).

astro-ph;0602473	the mass-metallicity relation at z~2	we use a sample of 87 rest-frame uv-selected star-forming galaxies with meanspectroscopic redshift z=2.26 to study the correlation between metallicity andstellar mass at high redshift. using stellar masses determined from sed fittingto 0.3-8 micron photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in stellar mass,and construct six composite h-alpha+[nii] spectra from all of the objects ineach bin. we estimate the mean oxygen abundance in each bin from the[nii]/h-alpha ratio, and find a monotonic increase in metallicity withincreasing stellar mass, from 12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.2 for galaxies with &lt;m_star&gt; =2.7e9 msun to 12+log(o/h) = 8.6 for galaxies with &lt;m_star&gt; = 1e11 msun. we usethe empirical relation between star formation rate density and gas density toestimate the gas fractions of the galaxies, finding an increase in gas fractionwith decreasing stellar mass. these gas fractions combined with the observedmetallicities allow the estimation of the effective yield y_eff as a functionof stellar mass; in constrast to observations in the local universe which showa decrease in y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.such a variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit by a model withsupersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times higher than the star formationrate. we conclude that the mass-metallicity relation at high redshift is drivenby the increase in metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through starformation, and is likely modulated by metal loss from strong outflows ingalaxies of all masses. there is no evidence for preferential loss of metalsfrom low mass galaxies as has been suggested in the local universe.

astro-ph;0602596	star formation and extinction in redshift z~2 galaxies: inferences from  spitzer mips observations	using very deep spitzer/mips 24 micron observations, we present an analysisof the bolometric luminosities (l[bol]) and uv extinction properties of morethan 200 spectroscopically identified, optically selected (ugr) z~2 galaxies inthe goods-n field. the large spectroscopic sample is supplemented with near-irselected (bzk/drg) galaxies and submm sources at similar redshifts in the samefield, providing a representative collection of relatively massive (m*&gt;1e10msun) galaxies at high redshifts. we focus on the redshift range 1.5-2.6, wheremips is sensitive to the strength of the mid-ir pah features in the galaxyspectra (rest-frame 5-8.5 micron). we demonstrate, using stacked x-ray data anda subset of galaxies with h-alpha measurements, that l(5-8.5) provides areliable estimate of l(ir) for most star forming galaxies at z~2. the range ofl(ir) in the samples considered extends from ~1e10 to &gt;1e12 lsun, with a meanof 2e11 lsun. using 24 micron observations to infer dust extinction in highredshift galaxies, we find that, as in the local universe, the obscuration(l[ir]/l[1600]) is strongly dependent on l(bol), and ranges in value from &lt;1 to\~1000. however, the obscuration is ~10 times smaller at a given l(bol) at z~2than at z=0. we show that the values of l(ir) and obscuration inferred from theuv spectral slope beta generally agree well with the values inferred froml(5-8.5) for l(bol)&lt;1e12 lsun. for galaxies with l(bol)&gt;1e12 lsun, it is commonfor uv-based estimates to underpredict l(ir) by a factor of ~10-100. using thespecific sfr as a proxy for cold gas fraction, we find a wide range in theevolutionary state of galaxies at z~2, from those which have just begun to formstars to those which have already accumulated most of their stellar mass andare about to become, or already are, passively-evolving.

astro-ph;0604041	the stellar, gas and dynamical masses of star-forming galaxies at z~2	we present analysis of the near-infrared spectra of 114 rest-frameuv-selected star-forming galaxies at z~2. by combining the h-alpha spectra withphotometric measurements from observed 0.3--8 micron, we assess therelationships between kinematics, dynamical masses, inferred gas fractions, andstellar masses and ages. the h-alpha line widths give a mean dynamical massm_dyn=6.9 +/- 0.6 x 10^10 msun within a typical radius of ~6 kpc, afterexcluding agn. the average dynamical mass is ~2 times larger than the averagestellar mass, and the two agree to within a factor of several for most objects.however, ~15% of the sample has m_dyn &gt;&gt; m_star. these objects are best fit byyoung stellar populations and tend to have high h-alpha equivalent widths,suggesting that they are young starbursts with large gas masses. rest-frameoptical luminosity and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigmasignificance. using the local empirical correlation between star formation rateper unit area and gas surface density, we estimate the mass of the gasassociated with star formation, and find a mean gas fraction of ~50% and astrong decrease in gas fraction with increasing stellar mass. the masses of gasand stars combined are considerably better correlated with the dynamical massesthan are the stellar masses alone, and agree to within a factor of three for85% of the sample. the combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gasmasses, and stellar population properties suggest that the factor of ~500 rangein stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully explained by intrinsicdifferences in the total masses of the galaxies, which vary by a factor of ~40;the remaining variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population andthe conversion of gas into stars.

astro-ph;0604388	h-alpha observations of a large sample of galaxies at z~2: implications  for star formation in high redshift galaxies	using h-alpha spectra of 114 rest-frame uv-selected galaxies at z~2, wecompare inferred star formation rates (sfrs) with those determined from the uvcontinuum luminosity. after correcting for extinction using standard techniquesbased on the uv continuum slope, we find excellent agreement between theindicators, with &lt;sfr_ha&gt; = 31 msun/yr and &lt;sfr_uv&gt; = 29 msun/yr. the agreementbetween the indicators suggests that the uv luminosity is attenuated by antypical factor of ~4.5 (with a range from no attenuation to a factor of ~100for the most obscured object in the sample), in good agreement with estimatesof obscuration from x-ray, radio and mid-ir data. the h-alpha luminosity isattenuated by a factor of ~1.7 on average, and the maximum h-alpha attenuationis a factor of ~5. in agreement with x-ray and mid-ir studies, we find that thesfr increases with increasing stellar mass and at brighter k magnitudes, to&lt;sfr_ha&gt; ~ 60 msun/yr for galaxies with k&lt;20; the correlation between kmagnitude and sfr is much stronger than the correlation between stellar massand sfr. all galaxies in the sample have sfrs per unit area sigma_sfr in therange observed in local starbursts. we compare the instantaneous sfrs and thepast average sfrs as inferred from the ages and stellar masses, finding thatfor most of the sample, the current sfr is an adequate representation of thepast average. there is some evidence that the most massive galaxies (m_star&gt;10^11 msun) have had higher sfrs in the past.

astro-ph;0606635	the direct detection of lyman-continuum emission from star-forming  galaxies at z~3	we present the results of rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopic observationsof a sample of 14 z~3 star-forming galaxies in the ssa22a field. these spectraare characterized by unprecedented depth in the lyman-continuum region. for thefirst time, we have detected escaping ionizing radiation from individualgalaxies at high redshift, with two of the 14 objects showing significantemission below the lyman limit. we also measured the ratio of emergent fluxdensity at 1500 aa to that in the lyman-continuum region, for the individualdetections (c49 and d3) and the sample average. if a correction for the averageigm opacity is applied to the spectra of the objects c49 and d3, we findf_1500/f_900,corr(c49)=4.5 and f_1500/f_900,corr(d3)=2.9. the average emergentflux-density ratio in our sample is &lt;f_1500/f_900,corr&gt;=22, implying an escapefraction ~4.5 times lower than inferred from the composite spectrum in steidelet al. (2001). if this new estimate is representative of lbgs, theircontribution to the metagalactic ionizing radiation field isj_nu(900)~2.6x10^{-22} erg/s/cm^2/hz/sr, comparable to the contribution ofoptically-selected quasars at the same redshift. the sum of the contributionsfrom galaxies and quasars is consistent with recent estimates of the level ofthe ionizing background at z~3, inferred from the hi ly-alpha forest opticaldepth. there is significant variance among the emergent far-uv spectra in oursample, yet the factors controlling the detection or non-detection oflyman-continuum emission from galaxies are not well-determined. because we donot yet understand the source of this variance, significantly larger sampleswill be required to obtain robust constraints on the galaxy contribution to theionizing background at z~3 and beyond (abridged).

astro-ph;0610693	the physical nature of rest-uv galaxy morphology during the peak epoch  of galaxy formation	motivated by the irregular and little-understood morphologies of z ~ 2 - 3galaxies, we use non-parametric coefficents to quantify the morphologies of 216galaxies which have been spectroscopically confirmed to lie at redshifts z =1.8 - 3.4 in the goods-n field. using measurements of ultraviolet (uv) andoptical spectral lines, multi-band photometric data, and stellar populationmodels we statistically assess possible correlations between galaxy morphologyand physical observables such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and thestrength of galaxy-scale outflows. we find evidence that dustier galaxies havemore nebulous uv morphologies and that larger, more luminous galaxies may drivestronger outflows, but otherwise conclude that uv morphology is eitherstatistically decoupled from the majority of physical observables or determinedby too complex a combination of physical processes to provide characterizationswith predictive power. given the absence of strong correlations between uvmorphology and physical parameters such as star formation rates, we aretherefore unable to support the hypothesis that morphologically irregulargalaxies predominantly represent major galaxy mergers. comparing galaxysamples, we find that ir-selected bzk galaxies and radio-selected submillimetergalaxies (smgs) have uv morphologies similar to the optically selected sample,while distant red galaxies (drgs) are more nebulous.

astro-ph;9910131	si and mn abundances in damped lya systems with low dust content	we have measured the abundances of zn, si, mn, cr, fe, and ni in three dampedlyman alpha systems at redshifts z &lt; 1 from high resolution echelle spectra ofqsos recorded with the keck i telescope. in all three cases the abundances ofcr, fe, and ni relative to zn indicate low levels of dust depletions. wepropose that when the proportion of refractory elements locked up in dustgrains is less than about 50 percent, it is plausible to assume anapproximately uniform level of depletion for all grain constituents and, byapplying a small dust correction, recover the intrisic abundances of si and mn.we use this approach on a small sample of damped systems for which it isappropriate, with the aim of comparing the metallicity dependence of the ratios[si/fe] and [mn/fe] with analogous measurements in milky way stars. the mainconclusion is that the relative abundances of both elements in distant galaxiesare broadly in line with expectations based on galactic data. si displays amild enhancement at low metallicities, as expected for an alpha-captureelement, but there are also examples of near-solar [si/fe] at [fe/h] &lt; -1. theunderabundance of mn at low metallicities is possibly even more pronounced thanthat in metal-poor stars, and no absorption system has yet been found where[mn/fe] is solar. the heterogeneous chemical properties of damped lyman alphasystems, evident even from this limited set of measurements, provide furthersupport for the conclusion from imaging studies that a varied population ofgalaxies gives rise to this class of qso absorbers.

0810.5599	dynamics of galactic disks and mergers at z~1.6: spatially resolved  spectroscopy with keck laser guide star adaptive optics	we present 0.2" resolution near-infrared integral field spectroscopy ofh-alpha emission from six star forming galaxies at z~1.6 (look-back time of~9.6 gyr). these observations were obtained with osiris using the keck laserguide star adaptive optics system. all sources have a compact spatial extent of~1", with an average half light radius of r=2.9 kpc and average dereddened starformation rate of 22 msolar per year. based on h-alpha kinematics we find thatthese six galaxies are dynamically distinguishable, and we classify them aseither merger or disk candidate systems. we find three merger systems(hdf-bx1287, hdf-bx1315, and q1623-bx491) with varying geometries and dynamicalproperties. three galaxies (hdf-bmz1299, q2343-bx344, and q2343-bm145) arewell-fit by an inclined-disk model with low velocity residuals (20 to 46km/sec). an average plateau velocity of v_p=185 km/sec is achieved within 1.0kpc. the majority of observed velocity dispersions (~88 km/sec) can beexplained by the residual seeing halo, and are not intrinsic to our sources.however, one merger and one disk candidate have high velocity dispersions (&gt;200 km/sec) that cannot be solely explained by beam smearing. for two diskcandidates, we detect [nii] emission and are able to map the [nii]/h-alpharatio on kiloparsec scales. in both cases, [nii] emission is more concentratedthan h-alpha emission (&lt; 0.2"), and peak ratios are best explained by thepresence of an agn. these are among the weakest known agn at high redshift,however their emission is strong enough to impact high redshift metallicitystudies that use nebular ratios. all disk candidates have likely completed onlya few orbital periods, and if left unperturbed are excellent candidates tobecome present-day spiral galaxies.
