0904.2020	clues to the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge: abundances  in moa-2008-blg310 and moa-2008-blg311	we present abundance analyses based on high dispersion and highsignal-to-noise ratio magellan spectra of two highly microlensed galactic bulgestars in the region of the main sequence turnoff with teff ~ 5650 k. we findthat moa-2008-blg310 has [fe/h]= +0.41 (+,- 0.09 dex) and moa-2008-blg311 has+0.26 (+, - 0.09 dex). the abundance ratios for the ~20 elements for whichfeatures could be detected in the spectra of each of the two stars follow thetrends with [fe/h] found among samples of bulge giants. combining these twobulge dwarfs with the results from previous abundance analysis of four othergalactic bulge turnoff region stars, all highly magnified by microlensing,gives a mean [fe/h] of +0.29dex. this implies that there there is aninconsistency between the fe-metallicity distribution of the microlensed bulgedwarfs and that derived by the many previous estimates based on surveys ofcool, luminous bulge giants, which have mean [fe/h] ~ -0.1 dex. a number ofpossible mechanisms for producing this difference are discussed. if oneascribes this inconsistency to systematic errors in the abundance analyses, weprovide statistical arguments suggesting that a substantial systematic error inthe fe-metallicity for one or both of the two cases, bulge dwarfs vs bulgegiants, is required which is probably larger than can realistically beaccommodated.

0906.1006	the chemical evolution of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present an abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra of 8 starsselected to span the full range in metallicity in the draco dwarf spheroidalgalaxy. we find [fe/h] for the sample stars ranges from -1.5 to -3.0 dex.combining our sample with previously published work for a total of 14 luminousdraco giants, we show that the abundance ratios [na/fe], [mg/fe] and [si/fe]for the draco giants overlap those of galactic halo giants at the lowest [fe/h]probed, but are significantly lower for the higher fe-metallicity draco stars.for the explosive alpha-elements ca and ti, the abundance ratios for dracogiants with [fe/h] &gt; -2.4 dex are approximately constant and slightlysub-solar, well below values characteristic of galactic halo stars. thes-process contribution to the production of heavy elements begins atsignificantly lower fe-metallicity than in the galactic halo.  using a toy model we compare the behavior of the abundance ratios within thesample of draco giants with those from the literature of galactic globularclusters, and the carina and sgr dsph galaxies. the differences appear to berelated to the timescale for buildup of the heavy elements, with draco havingthe slowest rate.  we note the presence of a draco giant with [fe/h] &lt; -3.0 dex in our sample,and reaffirm that the inner galactic halo could have been formed by earlyaccretion of galactic satellite galaxies and dissolution of young globularclusters, while the outer halo could have formed from those satellite galaxiesaccreted later.

0909.5230	globular cluster abundances and what they can tell us about galaxy  formation	we review the properties of globular clusters which make them useful forstudying the galactic halo, galactic chemical evolution, and the early stagesof the formation of the milky way. we review the evidence that gcs have achemical inventory similar to those of halo field stars. we discuss theabundance ratios for dsph galaxies and show that it is possible to have formedat least part the galactic halo field stellar population by dissolving globularclusters and/or accreting dsph galaxies but only if this occurred at an earlystage in the formation of the galaxy. we review the constraints on haloformation timescales deduced from the low mg isotopic ratios in metal-poor halofield dwarfs which indicate that agb stars did not have time to contributesignificantly, while m71 contains two populations, one without and also onewith a substantial agb contribution. we review the limited evidence for gcswith a second population showing additional contributions from snii, currentlyconfined to omega cen, m54, and m22, all of which may have been the nuclei orcentral regions of accreted galaxies. we check our own data for additional suchgcs, and find preliminary indications that ngc 2419, a massive gc far in theouter galactic halo, may also belong to this group.

1006.3538	the chemical evolution of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present an abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra of 10 starsselected to span the full range in metallicity in the ursa minor dwarfspheroidal galaxy. we find [fe/h] for the sample stars ranges from -1.35 to-3.10 dex and establish the trends of the abundance ratios [x/fe]. in keycases, particularly for the alpha-elements, these resemble those for stars inthe outer part of the galactic halo, especially at the lowest metallicitiesprobed. the n-capture elements show a r-process distribution over the fullrange of fe-metallicity. this suggests that the duration of star formation inthe umi dsph was shorter than in other dsph galaxies. the derived ages for alarger sample of umi stars with more uncertain metallicities also suggest apopulation dominated by uniformly old (~13 gyr) stars, with a hint of anage-metallicity relationship.  in comparing our results for umi, our earlier work in draco, and publishedstudies of more metal-rich dsph galactic satellites, there appears to be apattern of moving from a chemical inventory for dsph giants with [fe/h] &lt; -2dex which is very similar to that of stars in the outer part of the galactichalo (enhanced alpha/fe relative to the sun, coupled with subsolar [x/fe] forthe heavy neutron capture elements and r-process domination), switching tosubsolar alpha-elements and super-solar s-process dominated neutron captureelements for the highest [fe/h] dsph stars. the combination of low starformation rates over a varying and sometimes extended duration that producedthe stellar populations in the local dsph galaxies with [fe/h] &gt; -1.5 dex leadsto a chemical inventory wildly discrepant from that of any component of themilky way.

0709.0029	new extremely metal-poor stars in the galactic halo	we present a detailed abundance analysis based on high resolution and highsignal-to-noise spectra of eight extremely metal poor (emp) stars with [fe/h] &lt;-3.5$ dex, four of which are new. only stars with 4900 &lt; teff&lt; 5650 k areincluded. two stars of the eight are outliers in each of several abundanceratios. the most metal poor star in this sample, he1424-0241, has [fe/h] ~ -4dex and is thus among the most metal poor stars known in the galaxy. it hashighly anomalous abundance ratios unlike those of any other known emp giant,with very low si, ca and ti relative to fe, and enhanced mn and co, againrelative to fe. only (low) upper limits for c and n can be derived from thenon-detection of the ch and nh molecular bands. he0132$-$2429, another samplestar, has excesses of n and sc with respect to fe. the strong outliers inabundance ratios among the fe-peak elements in these c-normal stars, not foundat somewhat higher metallicities, are definitely real. they suggest that atsuch low metallicities we are beginning to see the anticipated and long soughtstochastic effects of individual supernova events contributing to the fe-peakmaterial within a single star. a detailed comparison of the results of theanalysis procedures adopted by our 0z project compared to those of the firststars vlt large project finds a systematic difference for [fe/h] of ~0.3 dex,our values always being higher.

1011.4516	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra. ii.  catalog of stars in milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we present a catalog of fe, mg, si, ca, and ti abundances for 2961 red giantstars that are likely members of eight dwarf satellite galaxies of the milkyway (mw): sculptor, fornax, leo i, sextans, leo ii, canes venatici i, ursaminor, and draco. for the purposes of validating our measurements, we alsoobserved 445 red giants in mw globular clusters and 21 field red giants in themw halo. the measurements are based on keck/deimos medium-resolutionspectroscopy combined with spectral synthesis. we estimate uncertainties in[fe/h] by quantifying the dispersion of [fe/h] measurements in a sample ofstars in monometallic globular clusters. we estimate uncertainties in mg, si,ca, and ti abundances by comparing our medium-resolution spectroscopicmeasurements to high-resolution spectroscopic abundances of the same stars. forthis purpose, our deimos sample included 132 red giants with publishedhigh-resolution spectroscopy in globular clusters, the mw halo field, and dwarfgalaxies. the standard deviations of the differences in [fe/h] and [alpha/fe](the average of [mg/fe], [si/fe], [ca/fe], and [ti/fe]) between the two samplesis 0.15 and 0.16, respectively. this catalog represents the largest sample ofmulti-element abundances in dwarf galaxies to date. the next papers in thisseries draw conclusions on the chemical evolution, gas dynamics, and starformation histories from the catalog presented here. the wide range of dwarfgalaxy luminosity reveals the dependence of dwarf galaxy chemical evolution ongalaxy stellar mass.

1011.4937	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra.  iii. metallicity distributions of milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we present metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) for the central regionsof eight dwarf satellite galaxies of the milky way: fornax, leo i and ii,sculptor, sextans, draco, canes venatici i, and ursa minor. we use thepublished catalog of abundance measurements from the previous paper in thisseries. the measurements are based on spectral synthesis of iron absorptionlines. for each mdf, we determine maximum likelihood fits for leaky box,pre-enriched, and extra gas (wherein the gas supply available for starformation increases before it decreases to zero) analytic models of chemicalevolution. although the models are too simplistic to describe any mdf indetail, a leaky box starting from zero metallicity gas fits none of thegalaxies except canes venatici i well. the mdfs of some galaxies, particularlythe more luminous ones, strongly prefer the extra gas model to the othermodels. only for canes venatici i does the pre-enriched model fit significantlybetter than the extra gas model. the best-fit effective yields of the lessluminous half of our galaxy sample do not exceed 0.02 z_sun, indicating thatgas outflow is important in the chemical evolution of the less luminousgalaxies. we surmise that the ratio of the importance of gas infall to gasoutflow increases with galaxy luminosity. strong correlations of average [fe/h]and metallicity spread with luminosity support this hypothesis.

1011.5221	multi-element abundance measurements from medium-resolution spectra. iv.  alpha element distributions in milky way dwarf satellite galaxies	we derive the star formation histories of eight dwarf spheroidal (dsph) milkyway satellite galaxies from their alpha element abundance patterns. nearly 3000stars from our previously published catalog (paper ii) comprise our data set.the average [alpha/fe] ratios for all dsphs follow roughly the same path withincreasing [fe/h]. we do not observe the predicted knees in the [alpha/fe] vs.[fe/h] diagram, corresponding to the metallicity at which type ia supernovaebegin to explode. instead, we find that type ia supernova ejecta contribute tothe abundances of all but the most metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -2.5) stars. we havealso developed a chemical evolution model that tracks the star formation rate,types ii and ia supernova explosions, and supernova feedback. without metalenhancement in the supernova blowout, massive amounts of gas loss define thehistory of all dsphs except fornax, the most luminous in our sample. all six ofthe best-fit model parameters correlate with dsph luminosity but not withvelocity dispersion, half-light radius, or galactocentric distance.

1106.3551	ptf11eon/sn2011dh: discovery of a type iib supernova from a compact  progenitor in the nearby galaxy m51	on may 31, 2011 ut a supernova (sn) exploded in the nearby galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). we discovered this event using small telescopes equippedwith ccd cameras, as well as by the palomar transient factory (ptf) survey, andrapidly confirmed it to be a type ii supernova. our early light curve andspectroscopy indicates that ptf11eon resulted from the explosion of arelatively compact progenitor star as evidenced by the rapid shock-breakoutcooling seen in the light curve, the relatively low temperature in early-timespectra and the prompt appearance of low-ionization spectral features. thespectra of ptf11eon are dominated by h lines out to day 10 after explosion, butinitial signs of he appear to be present. assuming that he lines continue todevelop in the near future, this sn is likely a member of the ciib (compactiib; chevalier and soderberg 2010) class, with progenitor radius larger thanthat of sn 2008ax and smaller than the eiib (extended iib) sn 1993j progenitor.our data imply that the object identified in pre-explosion hubble spacetelescope images at the sn location is possibly a companion to the progenitoror a blended source, and not the progenitor star itself, as its radius (~10^13cm) would be highly inconsistent with constraints from our post-explosionphotometric and spectroscopic data.

1201.4190	outliers in the 0z survey	we have now completed detailed abundance analyses of more than 100 starsselected as candidate extremely metal-poor stars with [fe/h] &lt; -3.0 dex. ofthese 18 are below -3.3 dex on the scale of the first stars vlt project led bycayrel, and 57 are below -3.0 dex on that scale. ignoring enhancement of carbonwhich ranges up to very large values, and two c-rich stars with very high n aswell, there are 0 to 3 high or low strong outliers for each abundance ratiotested from mg to ni. the outliers have been checked and they are real.ignoring the outliers, the dispersions are in most cases approximatelyconsistent with the uncertainties, except those for [sr/fe] and [ba/fe], whichare much larger. approximately 6% of the sample are strong outliers in one ormore elements between mg and ni. this rises to ~15% if minor outliers for theseelements and strong outliers for sr and ba are included. there are 6 stars withextremely low [sr/fe and [ba/fe], including one which has lower [ba/h] thandraco 119, the star found by fulbright, rich and castro to have the lowest suchratio known previously. there is one extreme r-process star.

1203.4561	the dynamics and metallicity distribution of the distant dwarf galaxy  vv124	vv124 (ugc 4879) is an isolated, dwarf irregular/dwarf spheroidal (dirr/dsph)transition-type galaxy at a distance of 1.36 mpc. previous low-resolutionspectroscopy yielded inconsistent radial velocities for different components ofthe galaxy, and photometry hinted at the presence of a stellar disk. in orderto quantify the stellar dynamics, we observed individual red giants in vv124with the keck/deimos spectrograph. we validated members based on theirpositions in the color-magnitude diagram, radial velocities, and spectralfeatures. our sample contains 67 members. the average radial velocity is &lt;v_r&gt;= -29.1 +/- 1.3 km/s, in agreement with the previous radio measurements of higas. the velocity distribution is gaussian, indicating that vv124 is supportedprimarily by velocity dispersion inside a radius of 1.5 kpc. outside thatradius, our measurements provide only an upper limit of 8.6 km/s on anyrotation in the photometric disk-like feature. the velocity dispersion issigma_v = 9.4 +/- 1.0 km/s, from which we inferred a mass of m_1/2 = (2.1 +/-0.2) x 10^7 m_sun and a mass-to-light ratio of (m/l_v)_1/2 = 5.2 +/- 1.1m_sun/l_sun, both measured within the half-light radius. thus, vv124 containsdark matter. we also measured the metallicity distribution from neutral ironlines. the average metallicity, &lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -1.58 +/- 0.06, is consistent withthe mass-metallicity relation defined by dwarf spheroidal galaxies. thedynamics and metallicity distribution of vv124 appear similar to dsphs ofsimilar stellar mass.

1206.4057	the nature of hypervelocity stars and the time between their formation  and ejection	we obtain keck hires spectroscopy of hvs5, one of the fastest unbound starsin the milky way halo. we show that hvs5 is a 3.62 +- 0.11 msun main sequence bstar at a distance of 50 +- 5 kpc. the difference between its age and itsflight time from the galactic center is 105 +-18(stat)+-30(sys) myr; flighttimes from locations elsewhere in the galactic disk are similar. this 10^8 yr`arrival time' between formation and ejection is difficult to reconcile withany ejection scenario involving massive stars that live for only 10^7 yr. forcomparison, we derive arrival times of 10^7 yr for two unbound runaway b stars,consistent with their disk origin where ejection results from a supernova in abinary system or dynamical interactions between massive stars in a dense starcluster. for hvs5, ejection during the first 10^7 yr of its lifetime is ruledout at the 3-sigma level. together with the 10^8 yr arrival times inferred forthree other well-studied hypervelocity stars (hvss), these results areconsistent with a galactic center origin for the hvss. if the hvss were indeedejected by the central black hole, then the galactic center was forming stars~200 myr ago, and the progenitors of the hvss took ~100 myr to enter the blackhole's loss cone.

1209.2705	the bizarre chemical inventory of ngc 2419, an extreme outer halo  globular cluster	we present new keck/hires observations of six red giants in the globularcluster ngc 2419. although the cluster is among the most distant and mostluminous in the milky way, it was considered chemically ordinary until veryrecently. our previous work showed that the near-infrared ca ii triplet linestrength varied more than expected for a chemically homogeneous cluster, andthat at least one star had unusual abundances of mg and k. here, we confirmthat ngc 2419 harbors a population of stars, comprising about one third of itsmass, that is depleted in mg by a factor of 8 and enhanced in k by a factor of6 with respect to the mg-normal population. although the majority, mg-normalpopulation appears to have a chemical abundance pattern indistinguishable fromordinary, inner halo globular clusters, the mg-poor population exhibitsdispersions of several elements. the abundances of k and sc are stronglyanti-correlated with mg, and some other elements (si and ca among others) areweakly anti-correlated with mg. these abundance patterns suggest that thedifferent populations of ngc 2419 sample the ejecta of diverse supernovae inaddition to agb ejecta. however, the abundances of fe-peak elements except scshow no star-to-star variation. we find no nucleosynthetic source thatsatisfactorily explains all of the abundance variations in this cluster.because ngc 2419 appears like no other globular cluster, we reiterate ourprevious suggestion that it is not a globular cluster at all, but rather thecore of an accreted dwarf galaxy.

1209.3778	detailed abundances of two very metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies	the most metal-poor stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs) can show thenucleosynthetic patterns of one or a few supernovae. these supernovae couldhave zero metallicity, making metal-poor dsph stars the closest surviving linksto population iii stars. metal-poor dsph stars also help to reveal theformation mechanism of the milky way halo. we present the detailed abundancesfrom keck/hires spectroscopy for two very metal-poor stars in two milky waydsphs. one star, in the sculptor dsph, has [fe i/h] = -2.40. the other star, inthe ursa minor dsph, has [fe i/h] = -3.16. both stars fall in the previouslydiscovered low-metallicity, high-[alpha/fe] plateau. most abundance ratios ofvery metal-poor stars in these two dsphs are largely consistent with verymetal-poor halo stars. however, the abundances of na and some r-processelements lie at the lower end of the envelope defined by inner halo stars ofsimilar metallicity. we propose that the metallicity dependence of supernovayields is the cause. the earliest supernovae in low-mass dsphs have less gas topollute than the earliest supernovae in massive halo progenitors. as a result,dsph stars at -3 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -2 sample supernovae with [fe/h] &lt;&lt; -3, whereashalo stars in the same metallicity range sample supernovae with [fe/h] ~ -3.consequently, enhancements in [na/fe] and [r/fe] were deferred to highermetallicity in dsphs than in the progenitors of the inner halo.

1307.5820	metal abundances, radial velocities and other physical characteristics  for the rr lyrae stars in the kepler field	spectroscopic iron-to-hydrogen ratios, radial velocities, atmosphericparameters, and new photometric analyses are presented for 41 rr lyrae stars(and one probable high-amplitude delta scuti star) located in the field-of-viewof the kepler space telescope. thirty-seven of the rr lyrae stars arefundamental-mode pulsators (i.e., rrab stars) of which 16 exhibit the blazhkoeffect. four of the stars are multiperiodic rrc pulsators oscillating primarilyin the first-overtone mode. spectroscopic [fe/h] values for the 34 stars forwhich we were able to derive estimates range from -2.54 +/- 0.13 (nr lyr) to-0.05 +/- 0.13 dex (v784 cyg), and for the 19 kepler-field non-blazhko starsstudied by nemec et al.(2011) the abundances agree will with their photometric[fe/h] values. four non-blazhko rr lyrae stars that they identified asmetal-rich (kic 6100702, v2470 cyg, v782 cyg and v784 cyg) are confirmed assuch, and four additional stars (v839 cyg, kic 5520878, kic 8832417, kic3868420) are also shown here to be metal-rich. five of the non-blazhko rrabstars are found to be more metal-rich than [fe/h] -0.9 dex while all of the 16blazhko stars are more metal-poor than this value. new period-phi31s-[fe/h]relationships are derived based on ~970 days of quasi-continuous high-precisonq0-q11 long- and short-cadence kepler photometry. with the exception of someblazhko stars, the spectroscopic and photometric [fe/h] values are in goodagreement. several stars with unique photometric characteristics areidentified, including a blazhko variable with the smallest known amplitude andfrequency modulations (v838 cyg).

1308.0857	tracing the orphan stream to 55 kpc with rr lyrae stars	we report positions, velocities and metallicities of 50 ab-type rr lyrae(rrab) stars observed in the vicinity of the orphan stellar stream. using about30 rrab stars classified as being likely members of the orphan stream, we studythe metallicity and the spatial extent of the stream. we find that rrab starsin the orphan stream have a wide range of metallicities, from -1.5 dex to -2.7dex. the average metallicity of the stream is -2.1 dex, identical to the valueobtained by newberg et al. (2010) using blue horizontal branch stars. we findthat the most distant parts of the stream (40-50 kpc from the sun) are about0.3 dex more metal-poor than the closer parts (within ~30 kpc), suggesting apossible metallicity gradient along the stream's length. we have extended theprevious studies and have mapped the stream up to 55 kpc from the sun. evenafter a careful search, we did not identify any more distant rrab stars thatcould plausibly be members of the orphan stream. if confirmed with othertracers, this result would indicate a detection of the end of the leading armof the stream. we have compared the distances of orphan stream rrab stars withthe best-fit orbits obtained by newberg et al. (2010). we find that model 6 ofnewberg et al. (2010) cannot explain the distances of the most remote orphanstream rrab stars, and conclude that the best fit to distances of orphan streamrrab stars and to the local circular velocity is provided by potentials wherethe total mass of the galaxy within 60 kpc is m_{60}~2.7x10^{11} msun, or about60% of the mass found by previous studies. more extensive modelling that wouldconsider non-spherical potentials and the possibility of misalignment betweenthe stream and the orbit, is highly encouraged.

0801.3264	clues to the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge: abundances  in ogle-2007_blg-349s	we present an abundance analysis based on high dispersion and highsignal-to-noise ratio keck spectra of a very highly microlensed galactic bulgedwarf, ogle-2007-blg-349s, with teff ~ 5400 k. the amplification at the timethe spectra were taken ranged from 350 to 450. this bulge star is highlyenhanced in metallicity with [fe/h] = +0.51 \pm 0.09 dex. the abundance ratiosfor the 28 species of 26 elements for which features could be detected in thespectra are solar. in particular, there is no evidence for enhancement of anyof the alpha-elements including o and mg. we conclude that the high [fe/h] seenin this star, when combined with the equally high [fe/h] derived in previousdetailed abundance analysis of two other galactic bulge dwarfs, both alsomicrolensed, implies that the median metallicity in the galactic bulge is veryhigh. we thus infer that many previous estimates of the metallicitydistribution in the galactic bulge have substantially underestimated the meanfe-metallicity there due to sample bias, and suggest a candidate mechanism forsuch. if our conjecture proves valid, it may be necessary to update thecalibrations for the algorithms used by many groups to interpret spectra andbroad band photometry of the integrated light of very metal-rich old stellarpopulations, including luminous elliptical galaxies.

1501.06908	carbon in red giants in globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies	we present carbon abundances of red giants in milky way globular clusters anddwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). our sample includes measurements of carbonabundances for 154 giants in the clusters ngc 2419, m68, and m15 and 398 giantsin the dsphs sculptor, fornax, ursa minor, and draco. this sample doubles thenumber of dsph stars with measurements of [c/fe]. the [c/fe] ratio in theclusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(l/l_sun) ~= 1.6, whichcan be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. the same decrease isobserved in dsphs, but the initial [c/fe] of the dsph giants is not uniform.stars in dsphs at lower metallicities have larger [c/fe] ratios. we hypothesizethat [c/fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines withincreasing [fe/h] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield ofasymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of type iasupernovae at higher metallicities. we also identified 11 very carbon-richgiants (8 previously known) in three dsphs. however, our selection biasespreclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the milky waystellar halo. nonetheless, the stars with [c/fe] &lt; +1 in dsphs follow adifferent [c/fe] track with [fe/h] than the halo stars. specifically, [c/fe] indsphs begins to decline at lower [fe/h] than in the halo. the difference in themetallicity of the [c/fe] "knee" adds to the evidence from [alpha/fe]distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale forchemical enrichment than the surviving dsphs.

1510.03856	triangulum ii: possibly a very dense ultra-faint dwarf galaxy	laevens et al. recently discovered triangulum ii, a satellite of the milkyway. its galactocentric distance is 36 kpc, and its luminosity is only 450l_sun. using keck/deimos, we measured the radial velocities of six member starswithin 1.2' of the center of triangulum ii, and we found a velocity dispersionof sigma_v = 5.1 -1.4 +4.0 km/s. we also measured the metallicities of threestars and found a range of 0.8 dex in [fe/h]. the velocity and metallicitydispersions identify triangulum ii as a dark matter-dominated galaxy. thegalaxy is moving very quickly toward the galactic center (v_gsr = -262 km/s).although it might be in the process of being tidally disrupted as it approachespericenter, there is no strong evidence for disruption in our data set. theellipticity is low, and the mean velocity, &lt;v_helio&gt; = -382.1 +/- 2.9 km/s,rules out an association with the triangulum-andromeda substructure or thepan-andromeda archaeological survey (pandas) stellar stream. if triangulum iiis in dynamical equilibrium, then it would have a mass-to-light ratio of 3600-2100 +3500 m_sun/l_sun, the highest of any non-disrupting galaxy (those forwhich dynamical mass estimates are reliable). the density within the 3-dhalf-light radius would be 4.8 -3.5 +8.1 m_sun/pc^3, even higher than segue 1.hence, triangulum ii is an excellent candidate for the indirect detection ofdark matter annihilation.

astro-ph;0002036	the merger rate to redshift one from kinematic pairs: caltech faint  galaxy redshift survey xi	the rate of mass accumulation due to galaxy merging depends on the mass,density, and velocity distribution of galaxies in the near neighborhood of ahost galaxy. the fractional luminosity in kinematic pairs combines all of theseeffects in a single estimator which is relatively insensitive to populationevolution. here we use a k-corrected and evolution compensated volume-limitedsample drawing about 300 redshifts from cfgrs and 3000 from cnoc2 to measurethe rate and redshift evolution of merging. we identify kinematic pairs withprojected separations less than either 50 or 100 \hkpc and rest-frame velocitydifferences of less than 1000\kms. the fractional luminosity in pairs ismodeled as f_l(delta v,r_p,m_r^{ke})(1+z)^{m_l} where [f_l,m_l] are[0.14+/-0.07,0+/-1.4] and [0.37+/-0.7,0.1+/-0.5] for r_p&lt;= 50 and 100\hkpc,respectively (omega_m=0.2, omega_lambda=0.8). the value of m_l is about 0.6larger if lambda=0. to convert these redshift space statistics to a merger ratewe use the data to derive a conversion factor to physical space pair density, amerger probability and a mean in-spiral time. the resulting mass accretion rateper galaxy (m_1,m_2&gt;= 0.2 m*) is 0.02+/-0.01(1+z)^{0.1+/-0.5} m*~gyr^{-1}.present day high-luminosity galaxies therefore have accreted approximately0.15m* of their mass over the approximately 7 gyr to redshift one.

astro-ph;0002119	rotations and abundances of blue horizontal-branch stars in globular  cluster m15	high-resolution optical spectra of eighteen blue horizontal-branch (bhb)stars in the globular cluster m15 indicate that their stellar rotation ratesand photospheric compositions vary strongly as a function of effectivetemperature. among the cooler stars in the sample, at teff ~ 8500 k, metalabundances are in rough agreement with the canonical cluster metallicity, andthe v sin i rotations appear to have a bimodal distribution, with eight starsat v sin i &lt; 15 km/s and two stars at v sin i ~ 35 km/s. most of the stars atteff &gt; 10000 k, however, are slowly rotating, v sin i &lt; 7 km/s, and their ironand titanium are enhanced by a factor of 300 to solar abundance levels.magnesium maintains a nearly constant abundance over the entire range of teff,and helium is depleted by factors of 10 to 30 in three of the hotter stars.diffusion effects in the stellar atmospheres are the most likely explanationfor these large differences in composition. our results are qualitatively verysimilar to those previously reported for m13 and ngc 6752, but with even largerenhancement amplitudes, presumably due to the increased efficiency of radiativelevitation at lower intrinsic [fe/h]. we also see evidence for faster stellarrotation explicitly preventing the onset of the diffusion mechanisms among asubset of the hotter stars.

astro-ph;0006284	the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey xii: clustering of galaxies	a clustering analysis is performed on two samples of $\sim 600$ faintgalaxies each, in two widely separated regions of the sky, including the hubbledeep field. one of the survey regions is configured so that some galaxy pairsspan angular separations of up to 1 deg. the median redshift is $z_{med}\approx0.55$. strong clustering is obvious, with every pencil-beam field containing ahandful of narrow redshift-space features, corresponding to galaxy structureswith sizes of 5 to 20 mpc. the structures are not obviously organized onplanes, though one prominent, colinear triplet of structures is observed,spanning $\sim 20$ mpc. this may be evidence of a filament. a galaxy--galaxycorrelation function calculation is performed. no significant evolution ofclustering (relative to stable clustering) is found in the redshift range0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0. this is not surprising, since uncertainties in the correlationamplitude estimated from surveys like these are large; field-to-fieldvariations and covariances between data points are both shown to besignificant. consistent with other studies in this redshift range, thegalaxy--galaxy correlation length is found to be somewhat smaller than thatpredicted from local measurements and an assumption of no evolution. galaxieswith absorption-line-dominated spectra show much stronger clustering atdistances of &lt;2 mpc than typical field galaxies. there is some evidence forweaker clustering at intermediate redshift than at low redshift, when theresults presented here are compared with surveys of the local universe. insubsets of the data, the measured pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxiesranges from 200 to $600 km s^{-1}$, depending on the properties of the dominantredshift structures in each subset.

(abridged) on the basis of these and similar observations, it isinferred that the development of pronounced spiral structure was delayed until\~5 gyr and that most bulges are probably not formed by disintegrating bars.major morphological changes were still taking place only ~5 gyr ago even thoughchanges in the integrated light of most galaxies were then much slower thanthey were ~10 gyr ago.

astro-ph;0101251	caltech faint galaxy redshift survey xiii: spectral energy distributions  for galaxies in the region of the hubble deep field north	we introduce a new empirical function for modeling the spectral energydistributions of galaxies. we apply it to a sample of 590 galaxies in theregion of the hdf with $z &lt; 1.5$ using multi-color photometry with widewavelength coverage combined with spectroscopic redshifts from our 93% completer-selected redshift survey there. we find the following: as expected, galaxieswith strong signs of recent star formation (i.e. those which show emissionlines) have bluer continua in both the rest frame uv and theoptical/near-infrared. the redder galaxies tend to be more luminous. the sedsof actively star forming galaxies become bluer in the mean in the rest-frame uvat higher redshift, which trend might arise from sed modeling errors. asidefrom this, we discern no change with redshift in the relationship between sedcharacteristics and galaxy spectral type based on the strength of narrowemission and absorption features. there is no evidence in our r-selected samplethat supports the existence of a substantial population of very dusty starforming galaxies at z &lt; 1.5. the overall pattern of the l(k) - z relationshipsuggests that passive evolution at constant stellar mass is a goodapproximation to the actual behavior of at least the most luminous galaxies inthis large sample of galaxies in the region of the hdf out to z \sim 1.5.(abridged)

astro-ph;0104099	calibration of the ch and cn variations among main sequence stars in m71  and in m13	an analysis of the cn and ch band strengths measured in a large sample of m71and m13 main sequence stars by cohen (1999a,b) is undertaken using syntheticspectra to quantify the underlying c and n abundances. in the case of m71 it isfound that the observed cn and ch band strengths are best matched by the{\it{identical}} c/n/o abundances which fit the bright giants, implying: 1)little if any mixing is taking place during red giant branch ascent in m71, and2) a substantial component of the c and n abundance inhomogeneities is in placebefore the main sequence turn-off. the unlikelihood of mixing while on the mainsequence requires an explanation for the abundance variations which liesoutside the present stars (primordial inhomogeneities or intra-cluster selfenrichment). for m13 it is shown that the 3883\aa cn bands are too weak to bemeasured in the spectra for any reasonable set of expected compositions. asimilar situation exists for ch as well. however, two of the more luminousprogram stars do appear to have c abundances considerably greater than thosefound among the bright giants thereby suggesting deep mixing has taken place onthe m13 red giant branch.

(2001), but seems to have a smaller amplitude ofstar-to-star variations at a given luminosity, as might be expected from itshigher metallicity. the results of our abundance analysis of 25 stars in m71provide sufficient evidence of abundance variations at unexpectedly lowluminosities to rule out the mixing scenario. either alone or, even morepowerfully, combined with other recent studies of c and n abundances in m71stars, the existence of such abundance variations cannot be reproduced withinthe context of our current understanding of stellar evolution.

astro-ph;0112199	c and n abundances in stars at the base of the red giant branch in m5	we present an analysis of a large sample of moderate resolution keck lrisspectra of subgiant (v \sim 17.2) and fainter stars in the galactic globularcluster m5 (ngc 5904) with the goal of deriving c and n abundances.star-to-star stochastic variations with significant range in both [c/fe] and[n/fe] are found at all luminosities extending to the bottom of the rgb at m_v\sim +3. similar variations in ch appear to be present in the main sequenceturnoff spectra. there is no sign of a change in the behavior of c and n withevolutionary stage over the full range in luminosity of the rgb and sgb. the cand n abundances appear strongly anti-correlated, as would be expected from thecn-cycle processing of stellar material. yet the present stars are considerablyfainter than the rgb bump, the point at which deep mixing is believed to setin. on this basis, while the observed abundance pattern is consistent withproton capture nucleosynthesis, we infer that the site of the reactions islikely not within the present sample, but rather in a population of moremassive (2 -- 5 m(sun)) now defunct stars. the range of variation of the nabundances is very large and the sum of c+n increases as c decreases. toreproduce this requires the incorporation not only of cn but also ofon-processed material. furthermore, the existence of this correlation is quitedifficult to reproduce with an external mechanism such as ``pollution'' withmaterial processed in a more massive agb star, which mechanism is fundamentallystochastic in nature. we therefore suggest that although the internal mixinghypothesis has serious flaws,new theoretical insights are needed and it shouldnot be ruled out yet.

astro-ph;0301460	abundance analysis of he2148-1247, a star with extremely enhanced  neutron capture elements	abundances for 27 elements in the very metal poor dwarf star he2148-1247 arepresented, including many of the neutron capture elements. we establish thathe2148-1247 is a very highly s-process enhanced star with anomalously high euas well, eu/h about half solar, demonstrating the large addition of heavynuclei at [fe/h] = -2.3 dex. ba and la are enhanced by a somewhat larger factorand reach the solar abundance, while pb significantly exceeds it. ba/eu is tentimes the solar r-process ratio but much less than that of the s-process,indicating a substantial r-process addition as well. c and n are also veryhighly enhanced. we have found that he2148-1247 is a radial velocity variable.the c, n and the s-process element enhancements thus presumably were producedthrough mass transfer from a former agb binary companion. the large enhancementof heavy r-nuclides also requires an additional source as this is far above anyinventory in the ism at such low [fe/h]. we further hypothesize that accretiononto the white dwarf from the envelope of the star caused accretion inducedcollapse of the white dwarf, forming a neutron star, which then produced heavyr-nuclides and again contaminated its companion.

astro-ph;0303229	dynamics of the globular cluster system associated with m49 (ngc4472):  cluster orbital properties and the distribution of dark matter	we have measured radial velocities for 196 globular clusters (gcs) aroundm49, the brightest member of the virgo cluster. combined with published data,they bring the total number of gcs with measured radial velocities in thisgalaxy to 263. using this sample, we extract the projected kinematics of thefull sample of gcs, and of the separate metal-poor and metal-rich subsamples.in agreement with previous results for the global gc kinematics based onsmaller datasets, we find that the gc system as a whole exhibits a slow overallrotation that is due almost entirely to a net rotation of the metal-poor gcsubsystem alone. in a spatial average, the metal-rich gcs shows essentially norotation. we note, however, the presence of a well defined grouping of 10metal-rich gcs that are located at opposite poles along the galaxy's major axisand which appear to be rotating at nearly 300 km/s about the minor axis. thisgrouping may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event. using ajeans-equation analysis, we show that the gc radial velocities alone pointunequivocally (and independently of x-ray observations) to the need for amassive dark halo associated with m49 and the virgo b subcluster around it. wealso show that the gc system as a whole is consistent with an almost perfectlyisotropic velocity ellipsoid. m49 is now the second elliptical galaxy (afterm87) for which we have been able to demonstrate velocity isotropy in theglobular cluster system overall, when no division based on gc color ormetallicity is attempted. thus, the data for these two galaxies lend supportthe general assumption of isotropy when using gc kinematics to study thedark-matter distribution in early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0304333	the ages and abundances of a sample of globular clusters in m49 (ngc  4472)	we present a study of the metallicity and age of the globular clusters systemof m49 (ngc 4472), the most luminous galaxy in the virgo cluster. we measurelick indices for 47 gcs in m49 from lris/keck spectra and establish theirmetallicity parameters qualitatively in comparison to the galactic gcs and topublished data for 150 m87 gcs. we then compare our measurements with thepredictions of models for the integrated light of old single burst stellarsystems by worthey and by thomas, maraston &amp; bender. we find that themetallicity of the m49 gc system spans the range from [fe/h]_z = -2.0 to +0.4dex. we show that the metallicity and age parameters for these two gc systemsare basically identical, except that the m49 gcs reach slightly highermetallicities than do those of m87. we find that the gcs of both of these giantelliptical galaxies are alpha-enhanced by a factor of about two above the solarvalue, as is also true of the galactic gcs. while adoption of thealpha-enhanced models of tmb has eliminated most of the previous discrepancieswith observations, the most metal rich m49 gcs have nad lines which are stillconsiderably stronger than those predicted by any model, and there are stillissues involving the metallicity scale of these models. we find that in themean, the m49 gcs are at least 10 gyr old. however, the grids of models we useddiffer in how they treat the horizontal branch, and this perceptibly affectsthe predicted hbeta index. hence our current incomplete understanding of therole of the horizontal branch limits our ability to derive a more detaileddistribution for the ages of the gcs in m49 and in m87.

astro-ph;0312315	the chemical inhomogeneity of faint m13 stars: c and n abundances	building upon earlier observations which demonstrate substantial star-to-stardifferences in the carbon abundances of m13 subgiants, we present new keck lrisspectra reaching more that 1.5 mag below the m13 main-sequence turn-off (to v ~20). our analysis reveals a distribution of c abundances similar to that foundamong the subgiants, implying little change in the compositions of the m13stars at least through the main-sequence turn-off. we presume these differencesto be the result of some process operating early in the cluster history.  additional spectra of previously studied bright m13 giants have been obtainedwith the hale 5-m. a comparison of c abundances derived using the presentmethods and those from the literature yield a mean difference of 0.03+-0.14 dexfor four stars in common with smith et al. (1996) and 0.14+-0.07 dex for starsalso observed by suntzeff (1981) (if one extreme case is removed). we concludethat the lower surface c abundances of these luminous giants as compared to thesubgiants and main-sequence stars are likely the result of mixing rather than adifference in our abundance scales.  nh band strengths have also been measured for a handful of the most luminousm13 turn-off stars. while molecular band formation in such stars is weak,significant star-to-star nh band strength differences are present. moreover,for the stars with both c and n measurements, differences between stars inthese two elements appear to be anticorrelated.  finally, the most recent c and n abundances for main-sequence, main-sequenceturn-off, and subgiant stars in 47 tuc, m71, m5, and the present m13 data arecompared.

astro-ph;0405286	abundances in very metal poor dwarf stars	we discuss the detailed composition of 28 extremely metal-poor dwarfs, 22 ofwhich are from the hamburg/eso survey, based on keck echelle spectra. oursample has a median [fe/h] of -2.7 dex, extends to -3.5 dex, and is somewhatless metal-poor than was expected from [fe/h](hk,hes) determined from lowresolution spectra. our analysis supports the existence of a sharp decline inthe distribution of halo stars with metallicity below [fe/h] = -3.0 dex. so farno additional turnoff stars with [fe/h]}&lt;-3.5 have been identified in ourfollow up efforts. for the best observed elements between mg and ni, we findthat the abundance ratios appear to have reached a plateau, i.e. [x/fe] isapproximately constant as a function of [fe/h], except for cr, mn and co, whichshow trends of abundance ratios varying with [fe/h]. these abundance ratios atlow metallicity correspond approximately to the yield expected from type ii snwith a narrow range in mass and explosion parameters; high mass type ii snprogenitors are required. the dispersion of [x/fe] about this plateau level issurprisingly small, and is still dominated by measurement errors rather thanintrinsic scatter. the dispersion in neutron-capture elements, and theabundance trends for cr, mn and co are consistent with previous studies ofevolved emp stars. two dwarfs in the sample are carbon stars, while two othershave significant c enhancements, all with c12/c13 ~ 7 and with c/n between 10and 150. three of these c-rich stars have large enhancements of the heavyneutron capture elements, including lead, which implies a strong s-processcontribution, presumably from binary mass transfer; the fourth shows no excessof sr or ba.

astro-ph;0603582	carbon stars in the hamburg/eso survey: abundances	we have carried out a detailed abundance analysis for a sample of 16 carbonstars found among candidate extremely metal-poor (emp) stars from thehamburg/eso survey. we find that the fe-metallicities for the cooler c-stars(teff ~ 5100k) have been underestimated by a factor of ~10 by the standard hessurvey tools. the results presented here provided crucial supporting data usedby cohen et al (2006) to derive the frequency of c-stars among emp stars.  c-enhancement in these emp c-stars appears to be independent offe-metallicity and approximately constant at ~1/5 the solar c/h. the mostly lowc12/c13 ratios (~4) and the high n abundances in many of these stars suggestthat material which has been through proton burning via the cn cycle comprisesmost of the stellar envelope. c-enhancement is associated with strongenrichment of heavy nuclei beyond the fe-peak for 12 of the 16 stars. theremaining c-stars from the hes, which tend to be the most fe-metal poor, showno evidence for enhancement of the heavy elements. very high enhancements oflead are detected in some of the c-stars with highly enhanced ba. (we showthat) the s-process is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy elementsfor the majority of the c-stars in our sample.  we suggest that both the s-process rich and ba-normal c-stars result fromphenomena associated with mass transfer in binary systems. this leads directlyto the progression from c-stars to ch stars and then to ba stars as thefe-metallicity increases.
