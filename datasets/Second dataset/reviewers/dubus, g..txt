1002.3888	the relativistic jet of cygnus x-3 in gamma rays	high energy gamma-rays have been detected from cygnus x-3, a system composedof a wolf-rayet star and a black hole or neutron star. the gamma-ray emissionis linked to the radio emission from the jet launched in the system. the fluxis modulated with the 4.8 hr orbital period, as expected if high energyelectrons are upscattering photons emitted by the wolf-rayet star to gamma-rayenergies. this modulation is computed assuming that high energy electrons arelocated at some distance along a relativistic jet of arbitrary orientation.modeling shows that the jet must be inclined and that the gamma ray emittingelectrons cannot be located within the system. this is consistent with the ideathat the electrons gain energy where the jet is recollimated by the stellarwind pressure and forms a shock. jet precession should strongly affect thegamma-ray modulation shape at different epochs. the power in non-thermalelectrons represents a small fraction of the eddington luminosity only if theinclination is low i.e. if the compact object is a black hole.

1004.0511	relativistic doppler-boosted emission in gamma-ray binaries	gamma-ray binaries could be compact pulsar wind nebulae formed when a youngpulsar orbits a massive star. the pulsar wind is contained by the stellar windof the o or be companion, creating a relativistic comet-like structureaccompanying the pulsar along its orbit. the x-ray and the very high energy(&gt;100 gev, vhe) gamma-ray emissions from the binary ls 5039 are modulated onthe orbital period of the system. maximum and minimum flux occur at theconjunctions of the orbit, suggesting that the explanation is linked to theorbital geometry. the vhe modulation has been proposed to be due to thecombined effect of compton scattering and pair production on stellar photons,both of which depend on orbital phase. the x-ray modulation could be due torelativistic doppler boosting in the comet tail where both the x-ray and vhephotons would be emitted. relativistic aberrations change the seed stellarphoton flux in the comoving frame so doppler boosting affects synchrotron andinverse compton emission differently. the dependence with orbital phase ofrelativistic doppler-boosted (isotropic) synchrotron and (anisotropic) inversecompton emission is calculated, assuming that the flow is oriented radiallyaway from the star (ls 5039) or tangentially to the orbit (ls i +61 303, psrb1259-63). doppler boosting of the synchrotron emission in ls 5039 produces alightcurve whose shape corresponds to the x-ray modulation. the observationsimply an outflow velocity of 0.15-0.33c consistent with the expected flow speedat the pulsar wind termination shock. in ls i +61 303, the calculated dopplerboosted emission peaks in phase with the observed vhe and x-ray maximum.doppler boosting might provide an explanation for the puzzling phasing of thevhe peak in this system.

1102.4336	the origin of variability of the intermediate-mass black-hole ulx system  hlx-1 in eso 243-49	the ultra-luminous intermediate-mass black-hole system hlx-1 in the eso243-49 galaxy exhibits variability with a possible recurrence time of a fewhundred days. finding the origin of this variability would constrain the stilllargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object. since it exhibits anintensity-hardness behavior characteristic of black-hole x-ray transients, wehave analyzed the variability of hlx-1 in the framework of the disk instabilitymodel that explains outbursts of such systems. we find that the long-termvariability of hlx-1 is unlikely to be explained by a model in which outburstsare triggered by thermal-viscous instabilities in an accretion disc. possiblealternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure dominated disk butwe argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass-transfer due totidal stripping of a star on an eccentric orbit around the intermediate-massblack hole. we consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation ofsuch a system and estimate the probability of its observation. we conclude,using a simplified dynamical model of the post-collapse cluster, that no morethan 1/100 to 1/10 of mbh &lt; 10^4 msun imbhs - formed by run-away stellarmergers in the dense collapsed cores of young clusters - could have a few times1 msun main-sequence star evolve to an agb on an orbit eccentric enough formass transfer at periapse, while avoiding collisional destruction or beingscattered into the imbh by 2-body encounters. the finite but low probability ofthis configuration is consistent with the uniqueness of hlx-1. we note,however, that the actual response of a standard accretion disk to bursts ofmass transfer may be too slow to explain the observations unless the orbit isclose to parabolic (and hence even rarer) and/or additional heating, presumablylinked to the highly time-dependent gravitational potential, are invoked.

0710.0968	the modulation of the gamma-ray emission from the binary ls 5039	gamma-ray binaries, composed of a massive star and compact object, have beenestablished as a new class of sources of very high energy (vhe) photons. thegamma-rays are produced by inverse compton scattering of the stellar light byvhe electrons accelerated in the vicinity of the compact object. the vheemission from ls 5039 displays an orbital modulation.  the inverse compton spectrum depends on the angle between the incoming andoutgoing photon in the electron rest frame. since the angle at which anobserver sees the star and electrons changes with the orbit, a phase dependenceof the spectrum is expected. the phase-dependent spectrum of ls 5039 iscalculated, assuming a continuous injection of electrons. the shape of theelectron distribution depends on the injected power-law and on the magneticfield intensity.  anisotropic scattering produces hard emission at inferior conjunction, whenattenuation due to pair production of the vhe gamma-rays on star light isminimum. the computed lightcurve and spectra provide good fits to the hess andegret observations, except at phases of maximum attenuation where pair cascadeemission may be significant for hess. detailed predictions are made for amodulation in the glast energy range. the magnetic field intensity atperiastron is 0.8+-0.2 g.  anisotropic inverse compton scattering plays a major role in ls 5039. thederived magnetic field intensity, injection energy and slope suggest arotation-powered pulsar wind nebula. gamma-ray binaries are promising sourcesto study the environment of pulsars on small scales.

(j2000) = -64d30m00s with a 2' statistical error in each coordinate,namely hess j1356-645. the source is extended, with an intrinsic gaussian widthof (0.20 +/- 0.02)deg. its integrated energy flux between 1 and 10 tev of 8e-12erg cm-2 s-1 represents ~ 11% of the crab nebula flux in the same energy band.the energy spectrum between 1 and 20 tev is well described by a power law dn/de~ e-gamma with photon index gamma = 2.2 +/- 0.2stat +/- 0.2sys. the inspectionof archival radio images at three frequencies and the analysis of x-ray datafrom rosat/pspc and xmm-newton/mos reveal the presence of faint non-thermaldiffuse emission coincident with hess j1356-645. hess j1356-645 is most likelyassociated with the young and energetic pulsar psr j1357-6429 (abridged)

1108.3600	supernova enhanced cosmic ray ionization and induced chemistry in a  molecular cloud of w51c	cosmic rays pervade the galaxy and are thought to be accelerated in supernovashocks. the interaction of cosmic rays with dense interstellar matter has twoimportant effects: 1) high energy (&gt;1 gev) protons produce {\gamma}-rays by{\pi}0-meson decay; 2) low energy (&lt; 1 gev) cosmic rays (protons and electrons)ionize the gas. we present here new observations towards a molecular cloudclose to the w51c supernova remnant and associated with a recently discoveredtev {\gamma}-ray source. our observations show that the cloud ionization degreeis highly enhanced, implying a cosmic ray ionization rate ~ 10-15 s-1, i.e. 100times larger than the standard value in molecular clouds. this is consistentwith the idea that the cloud is irradiated by an enhanced flux of freshlyaccelerated low-energy cosmic rays. in addition, the observed high cosmic rayionization rate leads to an instability in the chemistry of the cloud, whichkeeps the electron fraction high, ~ 10-5, in a large fraction (av \geq 6mag) ofthe cloud and low, ~ 10-7, in the interior. the two states have been predictedin the literature as high- and low-ionization phases (hip and lip). this is theobservational evidence of their simultaneous presence in a cloud.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1111.6975	tracing colliding winds in the uv line orbital variability of gamma-ray  binaries	gamma-ray binaries emit most of their radiated power beyond ~10 mev. thenon-thermal emission is thought to arise from the interaction of therelativistic wind of a rotation-powered pulsar with the stellar wind of itsmassive (o or be) companion star. a powerful pulsar creates an extended cavity,filled with relativistic electrons, in the radiatively-driven wind of themassive star. as a result, the observed p cyg profiles of uv resonant linesfrom the stellar wind should be different from those of single massive stars.we propose to use uv emission lines to detect and constrain the colliding windregion in gamma-ray binaries. we compute the expected orbital variability of pcyg profiles depending upon the interaction geometry (set by the ratio ofmomentum fluxes from the winds) and the line-of-sight to the system. we predictlittle or no variability for the case of ls 5039 and psr b1259-63, in agreementwith currently available hst observations of ls 5039. however, variabilitybetween superior and inferior conjunction is expected in the case of ls i+61303.

1201.3356	a giant radio flare from cygnus x-3 with associated gamma-ray emission	with frequent flaring activity of its relativistic jets, cygnus x-3 is one ofthe most active microquasars and is the only galactic black hole candidate withconfirmed high energy gamma-ray emission, thanks to detections by fermi/lat andagile. in 2011, cygnus x-3 was observed to transit to a soft x-ray state, whichis known to be associated with high-energy gamma-ray emission. we present theresults of a multi-wavelength campaign covering a quenched state, when radioemission from cygnus x-3 is at its weakest and the x-ray spectrum is very soft.a giant (~ 20 jy) optically thin radio flare marks the end of the quenchedstate, accompanied by rising non-thermal hard x-rays. fermi/lat observations (e&gt;100 mev) reveal renewed gamma-ray activity associated with this giant radioflare, suggesting a common origin for all non-thermal components. in addition,current observations unambiguously show that the gamma-ray emission is notexclusively related to the rare giant radio flares. a 3-week period ofgamma-ray emission is also detected when cygnus x-3 was weakly flaring inradio, right before transition to the radio quenched state. no gamma rays areobserved during the ~ one-month long quenched state, when the radio flux isweakest. our results suggest transitions into and out of the ultrasoft x-ray(radio quenched) state trigger gamma-ray emission, implying a connection to theaccretion process, and also that the gamma-ray activity is related to the levelof radio flux (and possibly shock formation), strengthening the connection tothe relativistic jets.

1201.4135	a multiwavelength view of the flaring state of pks 2155-304 in 2006	multiwavelength (mwl) observations of the blazar pks 2155-304 during twoweeks in july and august 2006, the period when two exceptional flares at veryhigh energies (vhe, e&gt;= 100 gev) occurred, provide a detailed picture of theevolution of its emission. the complete data set from this campaign ispresented, including observations in vhe gamma-rays (h.e.s.s.), x-rays (rxte,chandra, swift xrt), optical (swift uvot, bronberg, watcher, rotse), and in theradio band (nrt, hartrao, atca). optical and radio light curves from 2004 to2008 are compared to the available vhe data from this period, to put the 2006campaign into the context of the long-term evolution of the source. the x-rayand vhe gamma-ray emission are correlated during the observed high state of thesource, but show no direct connection with longer wavelengths. the long-termflux evolution in the optical and radio bands is found to be correlated andshows that the source reaches a high state at long wavelengths after theoccurrence of the vhe flares. spectral hardening is seen in the swift xrt data.the nightly averaged high-energy spectra of the non-flaring nights can bereproduced by a stationary one-zone ssc model, with only small variations inthe parameters. the spectral and flux evolution in the high-energy band duringthe night of the second vhe flare is modelled with multi-zone ssc models, whichcan provide relatively simple interpretations for the hour time-scale evolutionof the high-energy emission, even for such a complex data set. for the firsttime in this type of source, a clear indication is found for a relation betweenhigh activity at high energies and a long-term increase in the low frequencyfluxes.

1202.1866	long-term monitoring of the high-energy gamma-ray emission from ls i  +61{\deg} 303 and ls 5039	the fermi large area telescope (lat) reported the first definitive gevdetections of the binaries ls i +61\degree 303 and ls 5039 in the first yearafter its launch in june, 2008. these detections were unambiguous as aconsequence of the reduced positional uncertainty and the detection ofmodulated gamma-ray emission on the corresponding orbital periods. an analysisof new data from the lat, comprising 30 months of observations, identifies achange in the gamma-ray behavior of ls i +61\degree 303. an increase in flux isdetected in march 2009 and a steady decline in the orbital flux modulation isobserved. significant emission up to 30gev is detected by the lat; priordatasets led to upper limits only. contemporaneous tev observations no longerdetected the source, or found it -in one orbit- close to periastron, far fromthe phases at which the source previously appeared at tev energies. thedetailed numerical simulations and models that exist within the literature donot predict or explain many of these features now observed at gev and tevenergies. new ideas and models are needed to fully explain and understand thisbehavior. a detailed phase-resolved analysis of the spectral characterizationof ls i +61\degree 303 in the gev regime ascribes a power law with anexponential cutoff spectrum along each analyzed portion of the system's orbit.the on-source exposure of ls 5039 is also substantially increased with respectto our prior publication. in this case, whereas the general gamma-rayproperties remain consistent, the increased statistics of the current datasetallows for a deeper investigation of its orbital and spectral evolution.

1205.5038	revisiting a fundamental test of the disc instability model for x-ray  binaries	we revisit a core prediction of the disc instability model (dim) applied tox-ray binaries. the model predicts the existence of a critical mass transferrate, which depends on disc size, separating transient and persistent systems.we therefore selected a sample of 52 persistent and transient neutron star andblack hole x-ray binaries and verified if observed persistent (transient)systems do lie in the appropriate stable (unstable) region of parameter spacepredicted by the model. we find that, despite the significant uncertaintiesinherent to these kinds of studies, the data are in very good agreement withthe theoretical expectations. we then discuss some individual cases that do notclearly fit into this main conclusion. finally, we introduce the transientnessparameter as a measure of the activity of a source and show a clear trend ofthe average outburst recurrence time to decrease with transientness inagreement with the dim predictions. we therefore conclude that, despitedifficulties in reproducing the complex details of the lightcurves, the dimsucceeds to explain the global behaviour of x-ray binaries averaged over a longenough period of time.

1205.5485	spectral analysis and interpretation of the \gamma-ray emission from the  starburst galaxy ngc 253	very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt;100 gev) and high-energy (he; 100 mev &lt; e &lt; 100gev) data from \gamma-ray observations performed with the h.e.s.s. telescopearray and the fermi-lat instrument, respectively, are analysed in order toinvestigate the non-thermal processes in the starburst galaxy ngc 253. the vhe\gamma-ray data can be described by a power law in energy with differentialphoton index \gamma=2.14 \pm 0.18_stat \pm 0.30_sys and differential fluxnormalisation at 1 tev of f_0 = (9.6 \pm 1.5_stat (+5.7,-2.9)_sys) x 10^{-14}tev^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. a power-law fit to the differential he \gamma-rayspectrum reveals a photon index of \gamma=2.24 \pm 0.14_stat \pm 0.03_sys andan integral flux between 200 mev and 200 gev of f(0.2-200 gev) = (4.9 \pm1.0_stat \pm 0.3_sys) x 10^{-9} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no evidence for a spectralbreak or turnover is found over the dynamic range of both the lat instrumentand the h.e.s.s. experiment: a combined fit of a power law to the he and vhe\gamma-ray data results in a differential photon index \gamma=2.34 \pm 0.03with a p-value of 30%. the \gamma-ray observations indicate that at least about20% of the energy of the cosmic rays capable of producing hadronic interactionsis channeled into pion production. the smooth alignment between the spectra inthe he and vhe \gamma-ray domain suggests that the same transport processesdominate in the entire energy range. advection is most likely responsible forcharged particle removal from the starburst nucleus from gev to multiple tevenergies. in a hadronic scenario for the \gamma-ray production, the singleoverall power-law spectrum observed would therefore correspond to the meanenergy spectrum produced by the ensemble of cosmic-ray sources in the starburstregion.

1210.3215	binaries with the eyes of cta	the binary systems that have been detected in gamma rays have proven veryuseful to study high-energy processes, in particular particle acceleration,emission and radiation reprocessing, and the dynamics of the underlyingmagnetized flows. binary systems, either detected or potential gamma-rayemitters, can be grouped in different subclasses depending on the nature of thebinary components or the origin of the particle acceleration: the interactionof the winds of either a pulsar and a massive star or two massive stars;accretion onto a compact object and jet formation; and interaction of arelativistic outflow with the external medium. we evaluate the potentialitiesof an instrument like the cherenkov telescope array (cta) to study thenon-thermal physics of gamma-ray binaries, which requires the observation ofhigh-energy phenomena at different time and spatial scales. we analyze thecapability of cta, under different configurations, to probe the spectral,temporal and spatial behavior of gamma-ray binaries in the context of the knownor expected physics of these sources. cta will be able to probe with highspectral, temporal and spatial resolution the physical processes behind thegamma-ray emission in binaries, significantly increasing as well the number ofknown sources. this will allow the derivation of information on the particleacceleration and emission sites qualitatively better than what is currentlyavailable.

0704.3910	cascading on extragalactic background light	high-energy gamma-rays propagating in the intergalactic medium can interactwith background infrared photons to produce e+e- pairs, resulting in theabsorption of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum. tev observations of the distantblazar 1es 1101-232 were thus recently used to put an upper limit on theinfrared extragalactic background light density. the created pairs canupscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce,thereby initiating a cascade. the pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magneticfield (emf) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuringits intensity. limits on the ir background and emf are reconsidered taking intoaccount cascade emissions. the cascade equations are solved numerically.assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 mev - 100 tevspectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and theintensity of the emf. cascades emit mainly at or below 100 gev. the observedtev spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission istaken into account. the upper limit on the ir photon background is found to berobust. inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the tev data areuncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution tothe observed spectrum. an emf intensity around 1e-8 ng leads to acharacteristic spectral hump in the glast band. higher emf intensities divertthe pairs away from the line-of-sight and the cascade contribution to thespectrum becomes negligible.

1308.4531	what caused the gev flare of psr b1259-63 ?	psr b1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system composed of a high spindown pulsarand a massive star. non-thermal emission up to tev energies is observed nearperiastron passage, attributed to emission from high energy e+e- pairsaccelerated at the shock with the circumstellar material from the companionstar, resulting in a small-scale pulsar wind nebula. weak gamma-ray emissionwas detected by the fermi/lat at the last periastron passage, unexpectedlyfollowed 30 days later by a strong flare, limited to the gev band, during whichthe luminosity nearly reached the spindown power of the pulsar. the origin ofthis gev flare remains mysterious. we investigate whether the flare could havebeen caused by pairs, located in the vicinity of the pulsar, up-scatteringx-ray photons from the surrounding pulsar wind nebula rather than uv stellarphotons, as usually assumed. such a model is suggested by the geometry of theinteraction region at the time of the flare. we compute the gamma-raylightcurve for this scenario, based on a simplified description of theinteraction region, and compare it to the observations. the gev lightcurvepeaks well after periastron with this geometry. the pairs are inferred to havea lorentz factor ~500. they also produce an mev flare with a luminosity ~1e34erg/s prior to periastron passage. a significant drawback is the very highenergy density of target photons required for efficient gev emission. wepropose to associate the gev-emitting pairs with the maxwellian expected atshock locations corresponding to high pulsar latitudes, while the rest of thenon-thermal emission arises from pairs accelerated in the equatorial region ofthe pulsar wind termination shock.

1404.1447	localized sio emission triggered by the passage of the w51c snr shock	the region towards w51c is a convincing example of interaction between asupernova remnant and a surrounding molecular cloud. large electron abundanceshave been reported towards the position w51c-e located in this interactionregion, and it was proposed that the enhanced ionization fraction was due tocosmic ray particles freshly accelerated by the snr shock. we present pdbinterferometer observations of the h$^{13}$co$^+$(1-0) and dco$^+$(2-1)emission lines centered at position w51c-e. these observations confirm theprevious scenario of cosmic-ray induced ionization at this location. inaddition, sio(2-1) emission has been successfully mapped in the close vicinityof w51c-e, with a spatial resolution of 7". the morphology and kinematics ofthe sio emission are analyzed and strongly suggest that this emission isproduced by the passage of the snr primary shock. put in conjunction with theenhanced ionization fraction in this region, we give a consistent picture inwhich the w51c-e position is located downstream of the shock, where a largereservoir of freshly accelerated particles is available.

1404.1613	tev {\gamma}-ray observations of the young synchrotron-dominated snrs  g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 with h.e.s.s	the non-thermal nature of the x-ray emission from the shell-type supernovaremnants (snrs) g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 is an indication of intense particleacceleration in the shock fronts of both objects. this suggests that the snrsare prime candidates for very-high-energy (vhe; e $&gt;$ 0.1 tev) {\gamma}-rayobservations. g1.9+0.3, recently established as the youngest known snr in thegalaxy, also offers a unique opportunity to study the earliest stages of snrevolution in the vhe domain. the purpose of this work is to probe the level ofvhe {\gamma}-ray emission from both snrs and use this to constrain theirphysical properties. observations were conducted with the h.e.s.s. (high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

astro-ph;0009264	precessing warped accretion discs in x-ray binaries	we study the radiation-driven warping of accretion discs in the context ofx-ray binaries. the latest evolutionary equations are adopted, which extend theclassical alpha theory to time-dependent thin discs with non-linear warps. wealso develop accurate, analytical expressions for the tidal torque and theradiation torque, including self-shadowing.  we investigate the possible non-linear dynamics of the system within theframework of bifurcation theory. first, we re-examine the stability of aninitially flat disc to the pringle instability. then we compute directly thebranches of non-linear solutions representing steadily precessing discs.finally, we determine the stability of the non-linear solutions. each probleminvolves only ordinary differential equations, allowing a rapid, accurate andwell resolved solution.  we find that radiation-driven warping is probably not a common occurrence inlow-mass x-ray binaries. we also find that stable, steadily precessing discsexist for a narrow range of parameters close to the stability limit. this couldexplain why so few systems show clear, repeatable `super-orbital' variations.the best examples of such systems, her x-1, ss 433 and lmc x-4, all lie closeto the stability limit for a reasonable choice of parameters. systems far fromthe stability limit, including cyg x-2, cen x-3 and smc x-1, probablyexperience quasi-periodic or chaotic variability as first noticed by wijers &amp;pringle. we show that radiation-driven warping provides a coherent andpersuasive framework but that it does not provide a generic explanation for thelong-term variabilities in all x-ray binaries.

astro-ph;0101057	bepposax spectroscopy of the luminous x-ray sources in m33	the nearby galaxy m33 was observed by the imaging x-ray instruments on-boardbepposax. two observations at different phases of the 105.9 day intensity cycleof the luminous central source x-8 failed to reveal the expected modulation,suggesting that it is probably transitory. similar behavior has been observedfrom several x-ray binary sources. this strengthens somewhat the idea that m33x-8 is a black hole accreting from a binary companion. the 0.2-10 kev spectrumof m33 x-8 can best be modeled by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of1.89 +0.40 -0.79 and a disk-blackbody with a temperature, kt, of 1.10 +/0 0.05kev and a projected inner-disk radius of 55.4 +6.0 -7.7 km. this spectral shapeis in good agreement with earlier asca results. the 2-10 kev spectra of m33x-4, x-5, x-7, x-9 and x-10 are all consistent with power-law or bremsstrahlungmodels, whilst that of x-6 appears to be significantly more complex and may bereasonably well modeled with a disk-blackbody with kt = 1.7 +/- 0.2 kev and aprojected inner-disk radius of 7 +/- 2 km. the spectrum of m33 x-9 is ratherhard with a photon index of 1.3. compared to earlier einstein and rosatobservations, m33 x-7 and x-9 varied in intensity, m33 x-4, x-6, and x-10 mayhave varied and m33 x-5 remained constant.

astro-ph;0102237	the disc instability model for x-ray transients: evidence for truncation  and irradiation	we study the prospect of explaining the outbursts of soft x-ray transients(sxts) by the thermal-viscous instability in a thin disc. this instability islinked to hydrogen ionization and is significantly changed when irradiation ofthe disc by x-rays from the inner regions is included. we present the firstnumerically reliable, physically consistent calculations of the outburst cycleswhich include the effects of accretion disc irradiation. the decay fromoutburst is governed by irradiation, as pointed out by king &amp; ritter (1998),leading to slow exponential decays. at the end of the outburst, the disc isseverely depleted, which lengthens the time needed to rebuild mass to thecritical density for an outburst. despite this, the long recurrence times andquiescent x-ray luminosities of sxts still require the inner disc to bereplaced by another type of flow in quiescence, presumably a hot advectiondominated accretion flow (adaf). we include the effects of such truncation andshow that the resulting lightcurves are conclusively similar to those of sxtslike a0620-00. we conclude that the two-alpha disc instability model providesan adequate description of the outbursts of sxts when both truncation andirradiation are included. the values for the viscosities in outburst and inquiescence are comparable to those used in cvs. we discuss the model in thecontext of present observations.

astro-ph;0106525	vlt spectroscopy of xte j2123-058 during quiescence	we present vlt low resolution spectroscopy of the neutron star x-raytransient xte j2123-058 during its quiescent state. our data reveal thepresence of a k7v companion which contributes 77 % to the total flux at 6300 aand orbits the neutron star at k_2 = 287 +/- 12 km/s. contrary to other softx-ray transients (sxts), the halpha emission is almost exactly in antiphasewith the velocity curve of the optical companion. using the light-centertechnique we obtain k_1 = 140 +/- 27 km/s and hence q=k_1/k_2=m_2/m_1= 0.49 +/-0.10. this, combined with a previous determination of the inclination angle(i=73 +/- 4) yields m_1 = 1.55 +/- 0.31 msun and m_2 = 0.76 +/- 0.22 msun. m_2agrees well with the observed spectral type. doppler tomography of the halphaemission shows a non-symmetric accretion disc distribution mimicking that seenin sw sex stars. although we find a large systemic velocity of -110 +/- 8 km/sthis value is consistent with the galactic rotation velocity at the position ofj2123-058, and hence a halo origin. the formation scenario of j2123-058 isstill unresolved.

astro-ph;0112389	the structure and evolution of circumbinary disks in cataclysmic  variable systems	we investigate the structure and evolution of a geometrically thin viscouskeplerian circumbinary (cb) disk, using detailed models of theirradiative/convective vertical structure. we use a simplified description forthe evolution of the cataclysmic binary and focus on cases where thecircumbinary disk causes accelerated mass transfer (&gt; 1e-8 msun/yr). the inneredge of the disk is assumed to be determined by the tidal truncation radius andthe mass input rate into the disk is assumed to be a small fraction (1e-5-0.01)of the mass transfer rate. under the action of the viscous stresses in the diskthe matter drifts outward with the optically thick region extending to severalau. the inner part of the disk is cool with maximum effective temperatures &lt;3,000 k while the outermost parts of the disk are &lt; 30 k and optically thin. wecalculate the effects of thermal instability on a sufficiently massive cb disk.it leads to outbursts reminiscent of those in thermally unstable accretiondisks, with the instability remaining confined to the inner regions of the cbdisk. however, for most of the evolutionary sequences the surface densitiesrequired to trigger instability are not reached. the spectral energydistributions from circumbinary disks are calculated, and the prospects for thedetection of such disks in the infrared and submm wavelength regions arediscussed.

astro-ph;0211154	the optical light curves of xte j2123--058: the mass of the binary  components and the structure of the quiescent accretion disk	we present optical photometry of xte j2123-058 during its quiescent statetaken in 1999 and 2000. the dominant feature of our r-band light curve is theellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star, however, in order to fit thissatisfactorily we require additional components which comprise an x-ray heatedroche-lobe filling secondary star, and an accretion disk bulge, i.e. where thegas stream impacts the accretion disk. the observed dip near phase 0.8 isinterpreted as the eclipse of inner parts of the accretion disk by the bulge.this scenario is highly plausible given the high binary inclination. our fitsallow us to constrain the size of the quiescent accretion disk to lie in therange 0.26-0.56r_l1 (68% confidence). using the distance of 9.6 kpc and thex-ray flux inferred from the heated hemisphere of the companion, we obtain anunabsorbed x-ray luminosity of 1.2x10^33 erg/s for xte j2123-058 in quiescence.  from the observed quiescent optical/ir colors we find that the power-lawindex (-1.4) for the spectral distribution of the accretion disk compares wellwith other quiescent x-ray transients. we also re-analyse the optical lightcurves of the soft x-ray transient xte j2123-058 taken during its outburst anddecay in 1998. we use a robust method to fit the data using a refined x-raybinary model. the model computes the light arising from a roche-lobe fillingstar and flared accretion disk irradiated by x-rays, and calculates the effectsof shadowing and mutual star/disk eclipses. we obtain relatively accuratevalues for the binary inclination and mass ratio, which when combined withspectroscopic results obtained in paper ii gives a neutron star mass in therange 1.04-1.56mo (68% confidence).

astro-ph;0312408	excess mid-ir emission in cataclysmic variables	we present a search for excess mid-ir emission due to circumbinary materialin the orbital plane of cataclysmic variables (cvs). our motivation stems fromthe fact that the strong braking exerted by a circumbinary (cb) disc on thebinary system could explain several puzzles in our current understanding of cvevolution. since theoretical estimates predict that the emission from a cb disccan dominate the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the system atwavelengths &gt; 5 microns, we obtained simultaneous visible to mid-ir seds foreight systems. we report detections of ss cyg at 11.7 microns and ae aqr at17.6 microns, both in excess of the contribution from the secondary star. in aeaqr, the ir likely originates from synchrotron-emitting clouds propelled by thewhite dwarf. in ss cyg, we argue that the observed mid-ir variability isdifficult to reconcile with simple models of cb discs and we consider free-freeemission from a wind. in the other systems, our mid-ir upper limits placestrong constraints on the maximum temperature of a putative cb disc. theresults show that if any sizeable cb disc are present in these systems, theymust be self-shadowed or perhaps dust-free, with the peak thermal emissionshifted to far-ir wavelengths.

astro-ph;0403578	radio and x-ray observations during the outburst decay of the black hole  candidate xte j1908+094	obtaining simultaneous radio and x-ray data during the outburst decay of softx-ray transients is a potentially important tool to study the disc - jetconnection. here we report results of the analysis of (nearly) simultaneousradio (vla or wsrt) and chandra x-ray observations of xte j1908+094 during thelast part of the decay of the source after an outburst. the limit on the indexof a radio - x-ray correlation we find is consistent with the value of 0.7which was found for other black hole candidates in the low/hard state.interestingly, the limit we find seems more consistent with a value of 1.4which was recently shown to be typical for radiatively efficient accretion flowmodels. we further show that when the correlation-index is the same for twosources one can use the differences in normalisation in the radio - x-ray fluxcorrelation to estimate the distance towards the sources if the distance of oneof them is accurately known (assuming black hole spin and mass and jet lorentzfactor differences are unimportant or minimal). finally, we observed a strongincrease in the rate of decay of the x-ray flux. between march 23, 2003 andapril 19, 2003 the x-ray flux decayed with a factor ~5 whereas between april19, 2003 and may 13, 2003, the x-ray flux decreased by a factor ~750. thesource (0.5-10 kev) luminosity at the last chandra observation was l~3x10^32(d/8.5 kpc)^2 erg s^-1.

astro-ph;0509355	angular momentum losses and the orbital period distribution of  cataclysmic variables below the period gap: effects of circumbinary disks	the population synthesis of cataclysmic variables below the period isinvestigated. a grid of detailed binary evolutionary sequences has beencalculated and included in the simulations to take account of additionalangular momentum losses beyond that associated with gravitational radiation andmass loss, due to nova outbursts, from the system. as a specific example, weconsider the effect of a circumbinary disk to gain insight into the ingredientsnecessary to reproduce the observed orbital period distribution. the resultingdistributions show that the period minimum lies at about 80 minutes with thenumber of systems monotonically increasing with increasing orbital period to amaximum near 90 minutes. there is no evidence for an accumulation of systems atthe period minimum which is a common feature of simulations in which onlygravitational radiation losses are considered. the period distribution is foundto be fairly flat for orbital periods ranging from about 85 to 120 minutes. thesteepness of the lower edge of the period gap can be reproduced, for example,by an input of systems at periods near 2.25 hrs due to a flow of cataclysmicvariable binary systems from orbital periods longer than 2.75 hrs. the goodagreement with the cumulated distribution function of observed systems withinthe framework of our model indicates that the angular momentum loss by acircumbinary disk or a mechanism which mimics its features coupled with aweighting factor to account for selection effects in the discovery of suchsystems and a flow of systems from above the period gap to below the period gapare important ingredients for understanding the overall period distribution ofcataclysmic variable binary systems.

astro-ph;0604434	the origin and fate of short-period low-mass black-hole binaries	we present results of a population synthesis study for semidetached shortorbital period binaries which contain low-mass(&lt;1.5 msun) donors and black hole(&gt;4 msun) accretors. evolution of these binaries is determined by nuclearevolution of the donors and/or orbital angular momentum loss due to magneticbraking by the stellar wind of the donors and gravitational wave radiation.according to our model, the estimated total number of this type of black-holebinaries in the galaxy is about 10000. if the magnetic braking is described bythe verbunt &amp; zwaan formula, the model predicts around 3000 transient systemswith periods &gt;2 hours and around 300 luminous stable systems with periodsbetween 3 and 8 hours. several dozens of these bright systems should be abovethe rxte asm sensitivity limit. the absence of such systems implies thatangular momentum losses are reduced by a factor more than 2 with respect to theverbunt &amp; zwaan prescription. we show that it is unlikely that the transientbehaviour of black-hole short-period x-ray binaries is explained by the evolvednature of the stellar companion. a substantial fraction of black-hole binarieswith periods &gt;3 hours could be faint with truncated, stable cold accretiondiscs as proposed by menou et al. most of the semidetached black-hole binariesare expected to have periods shorter than ~2 hours. properties of such, stillto be observed, very small mass-ratio (q&lt;0.02) binaries are different fromthose of their longer period cousins.

astro-ph;0611569	theoretical orbital period distributions of cataclysmic variables above  the period gap: effects of circumbinary disks	the population of non magnetic cataclysmic variables evolving under theinfluence of a circumbinary disk is investigated for systems above the upperedge of the period gap at orbital periods greater than 2.75hr. for a fractionalmass input rate into the disk, corresponding to 3e-4 of the mass transfer rate,the model systems exhibit a bounce at orbital periods greater than 2.75hr. thesimulations reveal that (1) some systems can exist as dwarf nova type systemsthroughout their lifetime, (2) dwarf nova type systems can evolve intonova-like systems as their mass transfer rate increases with increasingcircumbinary disk mass, and (3) nova-like systems can evolve back into dwarfnova systems during their postbounce evolution to longer orbital periods. amongthese subclasses, nova-like cataclysmic variables would be the best candidatesto search for circumbinary disks at wavelengths greater than 10 micron. thetheoretical orbital period distribution of our population synthesis model is inreasonable accord with the combined population of dwarf novae and nova-likesystems above the period gap, suggesting the possibility that systems withunevolved donors need not detach and evolve below the period gap as in thedisrupted magnetic braking model. the resulting population furthermore revealsthe possible presence of systems with small mass ratios (a property of systemsexhibiting superhump phenomena at long orbital periods) and a preference ofo/ne/mg white dwarfs in dwarf nova systems in comparison to nova-like systems.the importance of observational bias in accounting for the differingpopulations is examined, and it is shown that an understanding of these effectsis necessary in order to confront the theoretical distributions with theobserved ones in a meaningful manner.

astro-ph;0703464	spitzer space telescope observations of the magnetic cataclysmic  variable ae aqr	the magnetic cataclysmic variable ae aquarii hosts a rapidly rotating whitedwarf which is thought to expel most of the material streaming onto it.observations of ae aqr have been obtained in the wavelength range of 5 - 70microns with the irs, irac, and mips instruments on board the spitzer spacetelescope. the spectral energy distribution reveals a significant excess abovethe k4v spectrum of the donor star with the flux increasing with wavelengthabove 12.5 microns. superposed on the energy distribution are several hydrogenemission lines, identified as pf alpha and hu alpha, beta, gamma. the infraredspectrum above 12.5 microns can be interpreted as synchrotron emission fromelectrons accelerated to a power-law distribution dn=e^{-2.4}de in expandingclouds with an initial evolution timescale in seconds. however, too manycomponents must then be superposed to explain satisfactorily both themid-infrared continuum and the observed radio variability. thermal emissionfrom cold circumbinary material can contribute, but it requires a disktemperature profile intermediate between that produced by local viscousdissipation in the disk and that characteristic of a passively irradiated disk.future high-time resolution observations spanning the optical to radio regimecould shed light on the acceleration process and the subsequent particleevolution.

astro-ph;9808347	hot white dwarfs and the uv delay in dwarf novae	we calculate the effect of illumination of dwarf nova accretion discs byradiation from a hot, central, white dwarf. we show that only for very hotwhite dwarfs (teff ~ 40 000$ k) the inner region of quiescent dwarf nova discsare partially depleted so that the delay between the rise to outburst of theoptical and uv fluxes would be increased as suggested recently by king (1997).this depletion, however, must create several small outbursts between mainoutbursts, contrary to observations. lower white dwarf temperatures may causethe outburts to be of the `inside-out' type removing the uv delay. we concludethat white dwarf irradiation of dwarf nova discs is not very efficient forexample because the uv radiation from the hot white dwarf does not penetratedeep enough in the disc atmosphere. the total ablation of the inner disc bye.g. evaporation (possibly related to illumination) appears to be a verypromising possibility, accounting for both the euv delay and the generallightcurves properties.

0811.2956	prompt high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts in the internal shock  model	the prompt grb emission is thought to arise from electrons accelerated ininternal shocks propagating within a highly relativistic outflow. the launch offermi offers the prospect of observations with unprecedented sensitivity inhigh-energy (&gt;100 mev) gamma-rays. the aim is to explore the predictions for heemission from internal shocks, taking into account both dynamical and radiativeaspects, and to deduce how he observations constrain the properties of therelativistic outflow. the emission is modeled by combining a time-dependentradiative code with a dynamical code giving the evolution of the physicalconditions in the shocked regions.synthetic lightcurves and spectra arecompared to observations. the he emission deviates significantly fromanalytical estimates, which tend to overpredict the ic component, when the timedependence and full cross-sections are included. the exploration of theparameter space favors the case where the dominant process in the batse rangeis synchrotron emission. the he component becomes stronger for weaker magneticfields. the he lightcurve can display a prolonged pulse duration due to icemission, or even a delayed peak compared to the batse range.alternatively,having dominant ic emission in the batse range requires most electrons to beaccelerated into a steep power-law distribution and implies strong 2nd order icscattering. in this case, the batse and he lightcurves are very similar. thecombined dynamical and radiative approach allows a firm appraisal of grb heprompt emission. a diagnostic procedure is presented to identify fromobservations the dominant emission process and derive constrains on the bulklorentz factor, particle density and magnetic field of the outflow.
