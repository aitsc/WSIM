0901.1237	star formation history in the smc: the case of ngc602	deep hst/acs photometry of the young cluster ngc 602, located in the remotelow density "wing" of the small magellanic cloud, reveals numerous pre-mainsequence stars as well as young stars on the main sequence. the resolvedstellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation historyinto recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, suchas the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binaryfraction. to better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present anew set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase withmetallicity appropriate for the small magellanic cloud (z = 0.004). we use astellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range ofstellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formationhistory in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitudediagrams. the derived present day mass function for ngc 602 is consistent withthat resulting from the synthetic diagrams. the star formation rate in theregion has increased with time on a scale of tens of myr, reaching $0.3-0.7\times 10^{-3} m_\odot yr^{-1}$ in the last 2.5 myr, comparable to what isfound in galactic ob associations. star formation is most complete in the maincluster but continues at moderate levels in the gas-rich periphery of thenebula.

1003.3236	the x-ray spectra of the luminous lmxbs in ngc 3379: field and globular  cluster sources	from a deep multi-epoch chandra observation of the elliptical galaxy ngc 3379we report the spectral properties of eight luminous lmxbs (lx&gt;1.2e38 erg/s). wealso present a set of spectral simulations, produced to aid the interpretationof low-count single-component spectral modeling. these simulations demonstratethat it is possible to infer the spectral states of x-ray binaries from thesesimple models and thereby constrain the properties of the source. of the eightlmxbs studied, three reside within globular clusters, and one is a confirmedfield source. due to the nature of the luminosity cut all sources are eitherneutron star binaries emitting at or above the eddington luminosity or blackhole binaries. the spectra from these sources are well described bysingle-component models, with parameters consistent with galactic lmxbobservations, where hard-state sources have a range in photon index of 1.5-1.9and thermally dominated sources have inner disc temperatures between ~0.7-1.55kev. the large variability observed in the brightest globular cluster source(lx&gt;4e38 erg/s) suggests the presence of a black hole binary. at its mostluminous this source is observed in a thermally dominated state with kt=1.5kev, consistent with a black hole mass of ~4 msol. this observation providesfurther evidence that globular clusters are able to retain such massivebinaries. we also observed a source transitioning from a bright state (lx~1e39erg/s), with prominent thermal and non-thermal components, to a less luminoushard state (lx=3.8e38 erg/s, gamma=1.85). in its high flux emission this sourceexhibits a cool-disc component of ~0.14 kev, similar to spectra observed insome ultraluminous x-ray sources. such a similarity indicates a possible linkbetween `normal' stellar mass black holes in a high accretion state and ulxs.

1104.0075	time-dependent searches for point sources of neutrinos with the  40-string and 22-string configurations of icecube	this paper presents searches for flaring sources of neutrinos using theicecube neutrino telescope. for the first time, a search is performed over theentire parameter space of energy, direction and time looking for neutrinoflares of 20 microseconds to a year duration from astrophysical sources amongthe atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds. searches which integrate overtime are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a largerbackground of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the timeconstraint. flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei,soft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrinoemitters. we used mainly data taken between april 5, 2008 and may 20, 2009 by apartially completed configuration of icecube with 40 strings. for the presentedsearches an unbinned maximum likelihood method is used with a time-dependentprior to test several different source hypotheses. an "untriggered" searchcovers any possible time-dependent emission from sources not correlated to anyother observation using other astrophysical messengers such as photons.moreover, a similar time scan is performed for a predefined catalogue ofsources that exhibit intense photon flares. searches triggered bymulti-wavelength information on flares from blazars and soft gamma-rayrepeaters are performed using the 40 string data and also the data taken by theprevious configuration of 22 strings in operation between may 31, 2007 andapril 5, 2008. flares for which extensive and continuous monitoring isavailable from fermi-lat and swift and flares detected by imaging cherenkovtelescopes with shorter time-scale monitoring are considered. the results fromall searches are compatible with a fluctuation of the background.

1108.0171	icecube sensitivity for low-energy neutrinos from nearby supernovae	this paper describes the response of the icecube neutrino telescope locatedat the geographic south pole to outbursts of mev neutrinos from the corecollapse of nearby massive stars. icecube was completed in december 2010forming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1cubic kilometer in the deep antarctic ice for particle induced photons. thetelescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 gev.owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates areparticularly low. hence icecube can also detect large numbers of mev neutrinosby observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the darknoise. with 2 ms timing resolution, icecube can detect subtle features in thetemporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. for a supernova at thegalactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-freemegaton-scale supernova search experiment. the sensitivity decreases to 20standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations atthe large magellanic cloud (50 kpc). icecube is sending triggers from potentialsupernovae to the supernova early warning system. the sensitivity to neutrinoproperties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as thepossibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electronneutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black holeas well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrateicecube's capability for supernova detection.

1208.3430	an improved method for measuring muon energy using the truncated mean of  de/dx	the measurement of muon energy is critical for many analyses in largecherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separatingextraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. muonenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss(de/dx) along the muon's path and relating the de/dx to the muon energy.because high-energy muons (e_mu &gt; 1 tev) lose energy randomly, the spread inde/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 inlog10(e_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the icecubedetector. in this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncatedmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. the muon track isdivided into separate segments with individual de/dx values. the elimination ofsegments with the highest de/dx results in an overall de/dx that is moreclosely correlated to the muon energy. this method results in an energyresolution of 0.22 in log10(e_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. thistechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially tolarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.

1210.7992	search for galactic pev gamma rays with the icecube neutrino observatory	gamma-ray induced air showers are notable for their lack of muons, comparedto hadronic showers. hence, air shower arrays with large underground muondetectors can select a sample greatly enriched in photon showers by rejectingshowers containing muons. icecube is sensitive to muons with energies above~500 gev at the surface, which provides an efficient veto system for hadronicair showers with energies above 1 pev. one year of data from the 40-stringicecube configuration was used to perform a search for point sources and agalactic diffuse signal. no sources were found, resulting in a 90% c.l. upperlimit on the ratio of gamma rays to cosmic rays of 1.2 x 10^(-3)for the fluxcoming from the galactic plane region (-80 deg &lt; l &lt; -30 deg; -10 deg &lt; b &lt; 5deg) in the energy range 1.2 - 6.0 pev. in the same energy range, point sourcefluxes with e^(-2) spectra have been excluded at a level of (e/tev)^2 d\phi/de~ 10^(-12)-10^(-11) cm^2/s/tev depending on source declination. the completeicecube detector will have a better sensitivity, due to the larger detectorsize, improved reconstruction and vetoing techniques. preliminary data from thenearly-final icecube detector configuration has been used to estimate the 5year sensitivity of the full detector. it is found to be more than an order ofmagnitude better, allowing the search for pev extensions of known tev gamma-rayemitters.

1212.5026	thomson scattering and collisional ionization in the x-rays grating  spectra of the recurrent nova u scorpii	we present a chandra observation of the recurrent nova u scorpii, done withthe hrc-s detector and the letg grating on day 18 after the observed visualmaximum of 2010, and compare it with xmm-newton observations obtained in days23 and 35 after maximum. the total absorbed flux was in the range 2.2-2.6 x10^(-11) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1), corresponding to unabsorbed luminosity 7-8.5 x10^(36)x(d/12 kpc)^2 for n(h)=2-2.7x10^(21) cm^(-2). on day 18, 70% of the softx-tray flux was in a continuum typical of a very hot white dwarf (wd)atmosphere, which accounted for about 80% of the flux on days 23 and 35. inaddition all spectra display very broad emission lines, due to higherionization stages at later times.  with chandra we observed apparent p cygni profiles. we find that thesepeculiar profiles are not due to blue shifted absorption and red shiftedemission in photoionized ejecta, like the optical p cyg of novae, but they arerather a superposition of wd atmospheric absorption features reflected by thealready discovered thomson scattering corona, and emission lines due tocollisional ionization in condensations in the ejecta. on days 23 and 35 theabsorption components were no longer measurable, having lost the initial largeblue shift that displaced them from the core of the broad emission lines. weinterpret this as indication that mass loss ceased between day 18 and day 23.on day 35, the emission lines spectrum became very complex, with severaldifferent components. model atmospheres indicate that the wd atmospherictemperature was about 730,000 k on day 18 and reached 900,000 k--one million kon day 35. this peak temperature is consistent with a wd mass of at least 1.3m(sol).

1308.5501	improvement in fast particle track reconstruction with robust statistics	the icecube project has transformed one cubic kilometer of deep naturalantarctic ice into a cherenkov detector. muon neutrinos are detected and theirdirection inferred by mapping the light produced by the secondary muon trackinside the volume instrumented with photomultipliers. reconstructing the muontrack from the observed light is challenging due to noise, light scattering inthe ice medium, and the possibility of simultaneously having multiple muonsinside the detector, resulting from the large flux of cosmic ray muons. thismanuscript describes work on two problems: (1) the track reconstructionproblem, in which, given a set of observations, the goal is to recover thetrack of a muon; and (2) the coincident event problem, which is to determinehow many muons are active in the detector during a time window. rather thansolving these problems by developing more complex physical models that areapplied at later stages of the analysis, our approach is to augment thedetectors early reconstruction with data filters and robust statisticaltechniques. these can be implemented at the level of on-line reconstructionand, therefore, improve all subsequent reconstructions. using the metric ofmedian angular resolution, a standard metric for track reconstruction, weimprove the accuracy in the initial reconstruction direction by 13%. we alsopresent improvements in measuring the number of muons in coincident events: wecan accurately determine the number of muons 98% of the time.

1311.7048	search for a diffuse flux of astrophysical muon neutrinos with the  icecube 59-string configuration	a search for high-energy neutrinos was performed using data collected by theicecube neutrino observatory from may 2009 to may 2010, when the array wasrunning in its 59-string configuration. the data sample was optimized tocontain muon neutrino induced events with a background contamination ofatmospheric muons of less than 1%. these data, which are dominated byatmospheric neutrinos, are analyzed with a global likelihood fit to search forpossible contributions of prompt atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos,neither of which have yet been identified. such signals are expected to followa harder energy spectrum than conventional atmospheric neutrinos. in addition,the zenith angle distribution differs for astrophysical and atmosphericsignals. a global fit of the reconstructed energies and directions of observedevents is performed, including possible neutrino flux contributions for anastrophysical signal and atmospheric backgrounds as well as systematicuncertainties of the experiment and theoretical predictions. the best fityields an astrophysical signal flux for $\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\mu $ of $e^2 \cdot\phi (e) = 0.25 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{gev} \textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{sr}^{-1}$, and a zero prompt component. although the sensitivity ofthis analysis for astrophysical neutrinos surpasses the waxman and bahcallupper bound, the experimental limit at 90% confidence level is a factor of 1.5above at a flux of $e^2 \cdot \phi (e) = 1.44 \cdot 10^{-8} \textrm{gev}\textrm{cm}^{-2} \textrm{s}^{-1} \textrm{sr}^{-1}$.

1406.6868	multipole analysis of icecube data to search for dark matter accumulated  in the galactic halo	dark matter which is bound in the galactic halo might self-annihilate andproduce a flux of stable final state particles, e.g. high energy neutrinos.these neutrinos can be detected with icecube, a cubic-kilometer sized cherenkovdetector. given icecube's large field of view, a characteristic anisotropy ofthe additional neutrino flux is expected. in this paper we describe a multipolemethod to search for such a large-scale anisotropy in icecube data. this methoduses the expansion coefficients of a multipole expansion of neutrino arrivaldirections and incorporates signal-specific weights for each expansioncoefficient. we apply the technique to a high-purity muon neutrino sample fromthe northern hemisphere. the final result is compatible with thenull-hypothesis. as no signal was observed, we present limits on theself-annihilation cross-section averaged over the relative velocitydistribution $&lt;\sigma v&gt;$ down to $1.9\cdot10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter particle mass of$700\,\mathrm{gev}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{gev}$ and direct annihilation into$\nu\bar{\nu}$. the resulting exclusion limits come close to exclusion limitsfrom $\gamma$-ray experiments, that focus on the outer galactic halo, for highdark matter masses of a few tev and hard annihilation channels.

1408.0634	searches for small-scale anisotropies from neutrino point sources with  three years of icecube data	recently, icecube found evidence for a diffuse signal of astrophysicalneutrinos in an energy range of $60\,\mathrm{tev}$ to the $\mathrm{pev}$-scale.the origin of those events, being a key to understanding the origin of cosmicrays, is still an unsolved question. so far, analyses have not succeeded toresolve the diffuse signal into point-like sources. searches including amaximum-likelihood-ratio test, based on the reconstructed directions andenergies of the detected down- and up-going neutrino candidates, were alsoperformed on icecube data leading to the exclusion of bright point sources. inthis paper, we present two methods to search for faint neutrino point sourcesin three years of icecube data, taken between 2008 and 2011. the first methodis an autocorrelation test, applied separately to the northern and southernsky. the second method is a multipole analysis, which expands the measured datain the northern hemisphere into spherical harmonics and uses the resultingexpansion coefficients to separate signal from background. with both methods,the results are consistent with the background expectation with a slightly moresparse spatial distribution, corresponding to an underfluctuation. depending onthe assumed number of sources, the resulting upper limit on the flux per sourcein the northern hemisphere for an $e^{-2}$ energy spectrum ranges from $1.5\cdot 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s})$, in the case of oneassumed source, to $4 \cdot 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s})$, in the case of $3500$ assumed sources.

1507.03991	a combined maximum-likelihood analysis of the high-energy astrophysical  neutrino flux measured with icecube	evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now beenfound in multiple searches with the icecube detector. the first solid evidencewas provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies$\gtrsim30$ tev and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. recentanalyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies andis also visible with throughgoing, $\nu_\mu$-induced tracks from the northernhemisphere. here, we combine the results from six different icecube searchesfor astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. the combinedevent sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-likeevents. the data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle andevent topology. assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and toconsist of equal flavors at earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrinoenergies between 25 tev and 2.8 pev is well described by an unbroken power lawwith best-fit spectral index $-2.50\pm0.09$ and a flux at 100 tev of$\left(6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1}\right)\cdot10^{-18}\,\mathrm{gev}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index $-2$ is disfavoredwith a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$ ($p=0.0066\%$) with respect to the bestfit. this significance is reduced to 2.1 $\sigma$ ($p=1.7\%$) if instead wecompare the best fit to a spectrum with index $-2$ that has an exponentialcut-off at high energies. allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate fromthe other two flavors, we find a $\nu_e$ fraction of $0.18\pm0.11$ at earth.the sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic ofneutron-decay dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6$\sigma$ ($p=0.014\%$).

astro-ph;0007374	the emission nebula associated with v1974 cyg: a unique object?	through a program of narrow band imaging, we have observed the changingstructure of the h alpha emission line around nova cyg 1992 (v1974 cyg) atregular intervals from 1996 to 1999. between 1994 and 1996, the nebularboundary advanced to the southwest at nearly the speed of light, implying thatthe nebula was created by an expanding wave of radiation originating in theexplosion interacting with surrounding material. the expansion speed dropped to0.35c during 1996-1999. we have taken spectra of the nebula in 1998 and 1999.only balmer lines are detected, no he i, [oiii], [oii], [nii], or [sii]. thereis also no trace of the high excitation nova lines (he ii, nev, etc). thesespectra show that the nebula is not a reflection nebula, a conventional hiiregion, or a shock involving motions of the gas. the integrated h alphaluminosity of the nebula between 1996 and 1999 is in the range =~1.3-2.2 x10(35) erg s(-1). the density is poorly determined, but is probably very large(10(4) cm(-3)) in order to explain the brightest region of the nebula. thedynamical timescale is about a year and the recombination timescale of the sameorder. bright patches are observed to fade in these times. the energy requiredto ionize the nebula is the bolometric luminosity of the nova for 30 days,smaller than the time during which the temperature of the nova photosphere wasin the right range to produce the ionizing photons. we have also undertakensensitive surveys of h alpha nebulae around recent novae but find no evidenceof other such nebulae, so this type of object must be rare.

astro-ph;0501439	andromeda ix: properties of the smallest m 31 dwarf satellite galaxy	we present wiyn observations of the recently discovered and ix dwarfspheroidal (dsph) satellite galaxy of m 31. our data, obtained at a naturalseeing of 0.5'' and just reaching the horizontal branch level, confirm and ixas a dsph galaxy with a distance similar to m 31. a survey for carbon starsshows no evidence for an intermediate-age (1--10 gyr) stellar population in andix. from the red giant branch we estimate a metallicity of roughly -2 dex.combined with the tip of the red giant branch luminosity, this results in adistance of 735 kpc, placing and ix approximately 45 kpc from m 31. this faintdsph follows the relations between luminosity and metallicity, and luminosityand surface brightness defined by other local group dsph galaxies. the core andtidal radii are found to be 1.35' and 5.9', respectively. we conclude that andix -- despite its low luminosity -- might be an ordinary local group dsph anddiscuss implications for its formation from a once more massive, but strippedprogenitor or from an intrinsically low-mass seed.

astro-ph;0510781	on stability and spiral patterns in polar disks	to investigate the stability properties of polar disks we performedtwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for flat polytropic gaseousself-gravitating disks which were perturbed by a central s0-like component. ourdisk was constructed to resemble that of the proto-typical galaxy ngc 4650a.this central perturbation induces initially a stationary two-armedtightly-wound leading spiral in the polar disk. for a hot disk (toomreparameter q&gt;1.7), the structure does not change over the simulation time of 4.5gyr. in case of colder disks, the self-gravity of the spiral becomes dominant,it decouples from the central perturbation and grows, until reaching asaturation stage in which an open trailing spiral is formed, rather similar tothat observed in ngc4650a. the timescale for developing non-linear structuresis 1-2 gyr; saturation is reached within 2-3 gyr. the main parametercontrolling the structure formation is the toomre parameter. the results aresurprisingly insensitive to the properties of the central component. if thepolar disk is much less massive than that in ngc4650a, it forms a weakertightly-wound spiral, similar to that seen in dust absorption in the dust diskof ngc2787. our results are derived for a polytropic equation of state, butappear to be generic as the adiabatic exponent is varied between \gamma = 1(isothermal) and \gamma = 2 (very stiff).

astro-ph;0608189	spitzer sage survey of the large magellanic cloud ii: evolved stars and  infrared color magnitude diagrams	color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) are presented for the spitzer sage (surveyingthe agents of a galaxy's evolution) survey of the large magellanic cloud (lmc).irac and mips 24 um epoch one data are presented. these data represent thedeepest, widest mid-infrared cmds of their kind ever produced in the lmc.combined with the 2mass survey, the diagrams are used to delineate the evolvedstellar populations in the large magellanic cloud as well as galacticforeground and extragalactic background populations. some 32000 evolved starsbrighter than the tip of the red giant branch are identified. of these,approximately 17500 are classified as oxygen-rich, 7000 carbon-rich, andanother 1200 as ``extreme'' asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. brightermembers of the latter group have been called ``obscured'' agb stars in theliterature owing to their dusty circumstellar envelopes. a large number (1200)of luminous oxygen--rich agb stars/m supergiants are also identified. finally,there is strong evidence from the 24 um mips channel that previouslyunexplored, lower luminosity oxygen-rich agb stars contribute significantly tothe mass loss budget of the lmc (1200 such sources are identified).

astro-ph;0609330	past and present star formation in the smc: ngc 346 and its neighborhood	in the quest of understanding how star formation occurs and propagates in thelow metallicity environment of the small magellanic cloud (smc), we acquireddeep f555w (~v), and f814w (~i) hst/acs images of the young and massive starforming region ngc 346. these images and their photometric analysis provide uswith a snapshot of the star formation history of the region. we find evidencefor star formation extending from ~10 gyr in the past until ~150 myr in thefield of the smc. the youngest stellar population (~3 +/- 1 myr) is associatedwith the ngc 346 cluster. it includes a rich component of low mass pre-mainsequence stars mainly concentrated in a number of sub-clusters, spatially co-located with co clumps previously detected by rubio et al. (2000). within ouranalysis uncertainties, these sub-clusters appear coeval with each other. themost massive stars appear concentrated in the central sub-clusters, indicatingpossible mass segregation. a number of embedded clusters are also observed.this finding, combined with the overall wealth of dust and gas, could implythat star formation is still active. an intermediate age star cluster, bs90,formed ~4.3 +/-0.1 gyr ago, is also present in the region. thus, this region ofthe smc has supported star formation with varying levels of intensity over muchof the cosmic time.
