0904.0005	polarisation of very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs	ultra-cool dwarfs of the l spectral type (teff=1400-2200k) are known to havedusty atmospheres. asymmetries of the dwarf surface may arise fromrotationally-induced flattening and dust-cloud coverage, and may result innon-zero linear polarisation through dust scattering.  we aim to study the heterogeneity of ultra-cool dwarfs' atmospheres and thegrain-size effects on the polarisation degree in a sample of nine late m, l andearly t dwarfs.  we obtain linear polarimetric imaging measurements using fors1 at the verylarge telescope, in the bessel i filter, and for a subset in the bessel r andthe gunn z filters.  we measure a polarisation degree of (0.31+/-0.06)% for lhs102bc. we fail todetect linear polarisation in the rest of our sample, with upper-limits on thepolarisation degree of each object of 0.09% to 0.76% (95% cl). for thosetargets we do not find evidence of large-scale cloud horizontal structure inour data. together with previous surveys, our results set the fraction ofultra-cool dwarfs with detected linear polarisation to (30+10-6)% (1-sigma).  for three brown dwarfs, our observations indicate polarisation degreesdifferent (at the 3-sigma level) than previously reported, giving hints ofpossible variations.  our results fail to correlate with the current model predictions forultra-cool dwarf polarisation for a flattening-induced polarisation, or withthe variability studies for a polarisation induced by an hetereneous cloudcover. this stresses the intricacy of each of those tasks, but may as wellproceed from complex and dynamic atmospheric processes.

0905.3919	the evidence for and against astronomical impacts on climate change and  mass extinctions: a review	numerous studies over the past 30 years have suggested there is a causalconnection between the motion of the sun through the galaxy and terrestrialmass extinctions or climate change. proposed mechanisms include comet impacts(via perturbation of the oort cloud), cosmic rays and supernovae, the effectsof which are modulated by the passage of the sun through the galactic midplaneor spiral arms. supposed periodicities in the fossil record, impact crateringdates or climate proxies over the phanerozoic (past 545 myr) are frequentlycited as evidence in support of these hypotheses. this remains a controversialsubject, with many refutations and replies having been published. here i reviewboth the mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance ofastronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution. this necessarilyincludes a critical assessment of time series analysis techniques andhypothesis testing. some of the studies have suffered from flaws inmethodology, in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling out anull hypothesis. i conclude that there is little evidence for intrinsicperiodicities in biodiversity, impact cratering or climate on timescales oftens to hundreds of myr. furthermore, galactic midplane and spiral armcrossings seem to have little or no impact on biological or climate variationabove background level.

0907.1671	towards a library of synthetic galaxy spectra and preliminary results of  classification and parametrization of unresolved galaxies for gaia - ii	this paper is the second in a series, implementing a classification systemfor gaia observations of unresolved galaxies. our goals are to determinespectral classes and estimate intrinsic astrophysical parameters via synthetictemplates. here we describe (1) a new extended library of synthetic galaxyspectra, (2) its comparison with various observations, and (3) first results ofclassification and parametrization experiments using simulated gaiaspectrophotometry of this library. using the pegase.2 code, based on galaxyevolution models that take account of metallicity evolution, extinctioncorrection, and emission lines (with stellar spectra based on the basellibrary), we improved our first library and extended it to cover the domain ofmost of the sdss catalogue. we produce an extended library of 28885 syntheticgalaxy spectra at zero redshift covering four general hubble types of galaxies,over the wavelength range between 250 and 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm orless. the library is also produced for 4 random values of redshift in the rangeof 0-0.2. it is computed on a random grid of four key astrophysical parameters(infall timescale and 3 parameters defining the sfr) and, depending on thegalaxy type, on two values of the age of the galaxy. the synthetic library wascompared and found to be in good agreement with various observations. the firstresults from the svm classifiers and parametrizers are promising, indicatingthat hubble types can be reliably predicted and several parameters estimatedwith low bias and variance.

0909.0802	candidate free-floating super-jupiters in the young sigma orionis open  cluster	free-floating substellar candidates with estimated theoretical masses of aslow as ~5 jupiter masses have been found in the ~3 myr old sigma orionis opencluster. as the overlap with the planetary mass domain increases, the questionof how these objects form becomes important. the determination of their numberdensity and whether a mass cut-off limit exists is crucial to understandingtheir formation. we propose to search for objects of yet lower masses in thecluster and determine the shape of the mass function at low mass. using new-and (re-analysed) published izjhks[3.6]-[8.0]-band data of an area of 840arcmin2, we performed a search for lt-type cluster member candidates in themagnitude range j=19.5-21.5 mag, based on their expected magnitudes andcolours. besides recovering the t type object s ori 70 and two other knownobjects, we find three new cluster member candidates, s ori 72-74, with j=21mag and within 12 arcmin of the cluster centre. they have theoretical masses of4 (-2,+3) m_jup and are among the least massive free-floating objects detectedby direct imaging outside the solar system. the photometry in archival spitzer[3.6]-[5.8]-band images infers that s ori 72 is an l/t transition candidate ands ori 73 a t-type candidate, following the expected cluster sequence in themid-infrared. finally, the l-type candidate s ori 74 with lower qualityphotometry is located at 11.8 arcsec (~4250 au) of a stellar member of sigmaorionis and could be a companion. after contaminant correction in the areacomplete to j=21.1 mag, we estimate that there remain between zero and twocluster members in the mass interval 6-4 m_jup. our result suggests a possibleturnover in the substellar mass spectrum below ~6 jupiter masses, which couldbe investigated further by wider and deeper photometric surveys.

0909.0842	a constraint on brown dwarf formation via ejection: radial variation of  the stellar and substellar mass function of the young open cluster ic2391	we present the stellar and substellar mass function of the open clusteric2391, plus its radial dependence, and use this to put constraints on theformation mechanism of brown dwarfs. our multiband optical and infraredphotometric survey with spectroscopic follow-up covers 11 square degrees,making it the largest survey of this cluster to date. we observe a radialvariation in the mass function over the range 0.072 to 0.3msol, but nosignificant variation in the mass function below the substellar boundary at thethree cluster radius intervals analyzed. this lack of radial variation for lowmasses is what we would expect with the ejection scenario for brown dwarfformation, although considering that ic2391 has an age about three times olderthan its crossing time, we expect that brown dwarfs with a velocity greaterthan the escape velocity have already escaped the cluster. alternatively, thevariation in the mass function of the stellar objects could be an indicationthat they have undergone mass segregation via dynamical evolution. we alsoobserve a significant variation across the cluster in the colour of the(background) field star locus in colour-magnitude diagrams and conclude thatthis is due to variable background extinction in the galactic plane. from ourpreliminary spectroscopic follow-up to confirm brown dwarf status and clustermembership, we find that all candidates are m dwarfs (in either the field orthe cluster), demonstrating the efficiency of our photometric selection methodin avoiding contaminants (e.g. red giants). about half of our photometriccandidates for which we have spectra are spectroscopically-confirmed as clustermembers; two are new spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarf members of ic2391.

0910.4529	brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the praesepe open cluster: a  dynamically unevolved mass function?	[abridged] in this paper, we present the results of a photometric survey toidentify low mass and brown dwarf members of the old open cluster praesepe (ageof 590[+150][-120]myr and distance of 190[+6.0][-5.8]pc) and use this to inferits mass function which we compare with that of other clusters. we haveperformed an optical (ic-band) and near-infrared (j and ks-band) photometricsurvey of praesepe with a spatial coverage of 3.1deg^2. with 5sigma detectionlimits of ic=23.4 and j=20.0, our survey is sensitive to objects with massesfrom about 0.6 to 0.05msol. the mass function of praesepe rises from 0.6msoldown to 0.1msol and then turns-over at ~0.1msol. the rise observed is inagreement with the mass function derived by previous studies, including asurvey based on proper motion and photometry. comparing our mass function withthat for another open cluster with a similar age, the hyades (age ~ 600myr), wesee a significant difference. possible reasons are that dynamical evaporationhas not influenced the hyades and praesepe in the same way, or that theclusters did not have the same initial mass function, or that dynamicalinteractions have modified the evolution of one or both clusters. although adifference in the binary fractions of the clusters could cause the observed(i.e. system) mass functions to differ, measurements in the literature give noevidence for a significant difference in the binary fractions of the twoclusters. of our cluster candidates, six have masses predicted to be equal toor below the stellar/substellar boundary at 0.072msol.

0911.5242	the ilium forward modelling algorithm for multivariate parameter  estimation and its application to derive stellar parameters from gaia  spectrophotometry	i introduce an algorithm for estimating parameters from multidimensional databased on forward modelling. in contrast to many machine learning approaches itavoids fitting an inverse model and the problems associated with this. thealgorithm makes explicit use of the sensitivities of the data to theparameters, with the goal of better treating parameters which only have a weakimpact on the data. the forward modelling approach provides uncertainty (fullcovariance) estimates in the predicted parameters as well as a goodness-of-fitfor observations. i demonstrate the algorithm, ilium, with the estimation ofstellar astrophysical parameters (aps) from simulations of the low resolutionspectrophotometry to be obtained by gaia. the ap accuracy is competitive withthat obtained by a support vector machine. for example, for zero extinctionstars covering a wide range of metallicity, surface gravity and temperature,ilium can estimate teff to an accuracy of 0.3% at g=15 and to 4% for (lowersignal-to-noise ratio) spectra at g=20. [fe/h] and logg can be estimated toaccuracies of 0.1-0.4dex for stars with g&lt;=18.5. if extinction varies a prioriover a wide range (av=0-10mag), then teff and av can be estimated quiteaccurately (3-4% and 0.1-0.2mag respectively at g=15), but there is a strongand ubiquitous degeneracy in these parameters which limits our ability toestimate either accurately at faint magnitudes. using the forward model we canmap these degeneracies (in advance), and thus provide a complete probabilitydistribution over solutions.

1009.2766	bayesian inference of stellar parameters and interstellar extinction  using parallaxes and multiband photometry	astrometric surveys provide the opportunity to measure the absolutemagnitudes of large numbers of stars, but only if the individual line-of-sightextinctions are known. unfortunately, extinction is highly degenerate withstellar effective temperature when estimated from broad band optical/infraredphotometry. to address this problem, i introduce a bayesian method forestimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction.it uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order toprovide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over theparameters. the method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing thehertzsprung--russell diagram (hrd) to constrain solutions and to ensure thatthey respect stellar physics. i first demonstrate this method by using it toestimate effective temperature and extinction from bvjhk data for a set ofartificially reddened hipparcos stars, for which accurate effectivetemperatures have been estimated from high resolution spectroscopy. using justthe four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation)between the temperature and extinction. introducing the parallax, apparentmagnitude and the hrd reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision(reduces the error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, thelatter by about 35%. the resulting accuracy is about 200k in temperature and0.2mag in extinction. i then apply the method to estimate these parameters andabsolute magnitudes for some 47000 f,g,k hipparcos stars which have beencross-matched with 2mass. the method can easily be extended to incorporate theestimation of other parameters, in particular metallicity and surface gravity,making it particularly suitable for the analysis of the 10^9 stars from gaia.

1105.4100	bayesian time series analysis of terrestrial impact cratering	giant impacts by comets and asteroids have probably had an importantinfluence on terrestrial biological evolution. we know of around 180 highvelocity impact craters on the earth with ages up to 2400myr and diameters upto 300km. some studies have identified a periodicity in their age distribution,with periods ranging from 13 to 50myr. it has further been claimed that suchperiods may be causally linked to a periodic motion of the solar system throughthe galactic plane. however, many of these studies suffer from methodologicalproblems, for example misinterpretation of p-values, overestimation ofsignificance in the periodogram or a failure to consider plausible alternativemodels. here i develop a bayesian method for this problem in which impacts aretreated as a stochastic phenomenon. models for the time variation of the impactprobability are defined and the evidence for them in the geological record iscompared using bayes factors. this probabilistic approach obviates the need forad hoc statistics, and also makes explicit use of the age uncertainties. i findstrong evidence for a monotonic decrease in the recorded impact rate going backin time over the past 250myr for craters larger than 5km. the same is found forthe past 150myr when craters with upper age limits are included. this isconsistent with a crater preservation/discovery bias modulating an otherwiseconstant impact rate. the set of craters larger than 35km (so less affected byerosion and infilling) and younger than 400myr are best explained by a constantimpact probability model. a periodic variation in the cratering rate isstrongly disfavoured in all data sets. there is also no evidence for aperiodicity superimposed on a constant rate or trend, although this morecomplex signal would be harder to distinguish.

1109.1210	the substellar population of sigma orionis: a deep wide survey	we present a deep i,z photometric survey covering a total area of 1.12deg^{2} of the sigma orionis cluster (icompl=22 and zcompl=21.5mag). from i,i-z color-magnitude diagrams we have selected 153 candidates that fit thepreviously known sequence of the cluster. using j-band photometry, we find that124 of the 151 candidates follow the previously known infrared photometricsequence of the cluster and are probably members. we have studied the spatialdistribution of these candidates and found that there are objects located atdistances greater than 30 arcmin to the north and west of sigma orionis thatprobably belong to different populations of the orion's belt. for the 102 bonafide sigma orionis cluster member candidates, we find that the radial surfacedensity can be represented by a decreasing exponential function (sigma =sigma_0 e^{-r/r_0}) with a central density of sigma_0=0.23+/-0.03object/arcmin^{2} and a characteristic radius of r_0=9.5+/-0.7 arcmin. from astatistical comparison with monte carlo simulations, we conclude that thespatial distribution of the cluster member candidates is compatible with apoissonian distribution and, hence, they are not mainly forming aggregations orsub-clustering. using near-infrared jhk-band data from 2mass and ukidss andmid-infrared data from irac/spitzer, we find that 5-9 % of the brown dwarfcandidates in the sigma orionis cluster have k-band excesses and 31+/-7 % ofthem show mid-infrared excesses at wavelengths longer than 5.8 microns, whichare probably related to the presence of disks. we have also calculated theinitial mass spectrum (dn/dm) of sigma orionis from very low mass stars (0.10msol) to the deuterium-burning mass limit (0.012-0.013 msol). this is a risingfunction toward lower masses and can be represented by a power-law distribution(dn/dm = m^{-alpha}) with an exponent alpha of 0.7+/-0.3 for an age of 3 myr.

1209.3730	a bayesian method for the analysis of deterministic and stochastic time  series	i introduce a general, bayesian method for modelling univariate time seriesdata assumed to be drawn from a continuous, stochastic process. the methodaccommodates arbitrary temporal sampling, and takes into account measurementuncertainties for arbitrary error models (not just gaussian) on both the timeand signal variables. any model for the deterministic component of thevariation of the signal with time is supported, as is any model of thestochastic component on the signal and time variables. models illustrated hereare constant and sinusoidal models for the signal mean combined with a gaussianstochastic component, as well as a purely stochastic model, theornstein-uhlenbeck process. the posterior probability distribution over modelparameters is determined via monte carlo sampling. models are compared usingthe "cross-validation likelihood", in which the posterior-averaged likelihoodfor different partitions of the data are combined. in principle this is morerobust to changes in the prior than is the evidence (the prior-averagedlikelihood). the method is demonstrated by applying it to the light curves of11 ultra cool dwarf stars, claimed by a previous study to show statisticallysignificant variability. this is reassessed here by calculating thecross-validation likelihood for various time series models, including a nullhypothesis of no variability beyond the error bars. 10 of 11 light curves areconfirmed as being significantly variable, and one of these seems to beperiodic, with two plausible periods identified. another object is bestdescribed by the ornstein-uhlenbeck process, a conclusion which is obviouslylimited to the set of models actually tested.

0711.4464	correlated spectral variability in brown dwarfs	models of brown dwarf atmospheres suggest they exhibit complex physicalbehaviour. observations have shown that they are indeed dynamic, displayingsmall photometric variations over timescales of hours. here i report results ofinfrared (0.95-1.64 micron) spectrophotometric monitoring of four field l and tdwarfs spanning timescales of 0.1-5.5 hrs, the goal being to learn more aboutthe physical nature of this variability. spectra are analysed differentiallywith respect to a simultaneously observed reference source in order to removeearth-atmospheric variations. the variability amplitude detected is typically2-10%, depending on the source and wavelength. i analyse the data forcorrelated variations between spectral indices. this approach is more robustthan single band or chisq analyses, because it does not assume an amplitude forthe (often uncertain) noise level (although the significance test still assumesa shape for the noise power spectrum). three of the four targets showsignificant evidence for correlated variability. some of this can be associatedwith specific features including fe, feh, vo and ki, and there is good evidencefor intrinsic variability in water and possibly also methan. yet some of thisvariability covers a broader spectral range which would be consistent with dustopacity variations. the underlying common cause is plausibly localizedtemperature or composition fluctuations caused by convection. looking at thehigh signal-to-noise ratio stacked spectra we see many previously identifiedspectral features of l and t dwarfs, such as ki, nai, feh, water and methane.in particular we may have detected methane absorption at 1.3-1.4 micron in thel5 dwarf sdss 0539-0059.

1303.3105	a history of the gamma-ray burst flux at the earth from galactic  globular clusters	nearby gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are likely to have represented a significantthreat to life on the earth. recent observations suggest that a significantsource of such bursts is compact binary mergers in globular clusters. this linkbetween globular clusters and grbs offers the possibility to find timeintervals in the past with higher probabilities of a nearby burst, by tracingglobular cluster orbits back in time. here we show that the expected flux fromsuch bursts is not flat over the past 550 myr but rather exhibits three broadpeaks, at 70, 180 and 340 myr ago. the main source for nearby grbs for allthree time intervals is the globular cluster 47 tuc, a consequence of its largemass and high stellar encounter rate, as well as the fact that it is one of theglobular clusters which comes quite close to the sun. mass extinction eventsindeed coincide with all three time intervals found in this study, although achance coincidence is quite likely. nevertheless, the identified time intervalscan be used as a guide to search for specific signatures of grbs in thegeological record around these times.

1303.6121	assessing the influence of the solar orbit on terrestrial biodiversity	the terrestrial fossil record shows a significant variation in the extinctionand origination rates of species during the past half billion years. numerousstudies have claimed an association between this variation and the motion ofthe sun around the galaxy, invoking the modulation of cosmic rays, gamma raysand comet impact frequency as a cause of this biodiversity variation. however,some of these studies exhibit methodological problems, or were based on coarseassumptions (such as a strict periodicity of the solar orbit). here weinvestigate this link in more detail, using a model of the galaxy toreconstruct the solar orbit and thus a predictive model of the temporalvariation of the extinction rate due to astronomical mechanisms. we comparethese predictions as well as those of various reference models withpaleontological data. our approach involves bayesian model comparison, whichtakes into account the uncertainties in the paleontological data as well as thedistribution of solar orbits consistent with the uncertainties in theastronomical data. we find that various versions of the orbital model are notfavored beyond simpler reference models. in particular, the distribution ofmass extinction events can be explained just as well by a uniform randomdistribution as by any other model tested. although our negative results on theorbital model are robust to changes in the galaxy model, the sun's coordinatesand the errors in the data, we also find that it would be very difficult topositively identify the orbital model even if it were the true one. (incontrast, we do find evidence against simpler periodic models.) thus while wecannot rule out there being some connection between solar motion andbiodiversity variations on the earth, we conclude that it is difficult to giveconvincing positive conclusions of such a connection using current data.

1312.3424	3d galactic dust extinction mapping with multi-band photometry	we present a method to simultaneously infer the interstellar extinctionparameters $a_0$ and $r_0$, stellar effective temperature $t_{\rm eff}$, anddistance modulus $\mu$ in a bayesian framework. using multi-band photometryfrom sdss and ukidss, we train a forward model to emulate the colour-change dueto physical properties of stars and the interstellar medium for temperaturesfrom 4000 to 9000 k and extinctions from 0 to 5 mag. we introduce ahertzsprung-russel diagram prior to account for physical constraints on thedistribution of stars in the temperature-absolute magnitude plane. this allowsus to infer distances probabilistically. influences of colour information,priors and model parameters are explored. residual mean absolute errors (maes)on a set of objects for extinction and temperature are 0.2 mag and 300 k,respectively, for $r_0$ fixed to 3.1. for variable $r_0$, we obtain maes of0.37 mag, 412.9 k and 0.74 for $a_0$, $t_{\rm eff}$ and $r_0$, respectively.distance moduli are accurate to approximately 2 mag. quantifying the precisionsof individual parameter estimates with $68\%$ confidence interval of theposterior distribution, we obtain 0.05 mag, 66 k, 2 mag and 0.07 for $a_0$,$t_{\rm eff}$, $\mu$ and $r_0$, respectively, although we find that theseunderestimate the accuracy of the model. we produce two-dimensional maps inextinction and $r_0$ that are compared to previous work. furthermore weincorporate the inferred distance information to compute fully probabilisticdistance profiles for individual lines of sight. the individual stellar apestimates, combined with inferred 3d information will make possible manygalactic science and modelling applications. adapting our method to work withother surveys, such as pan-starrs and gaia, will allow us to probe otherregions of the galaxy.

1406.1519	exploring the role of the sun's motion in terrestrial comet impacts	the cratering record on the earth and moon shows that our planet has beenexposed to high velocity impacts for much or all of its existence. some ofthese craters were produced by the impact of long period comets (lpcs). theseprobably originated in the oort cloud, and were put into their present orbitsthrough gravitational perturbations arising from the galactic tide and stellarencounters, both of which are modulated by the solar motion about the galaxy.here we construct dynamicalmodels of these mechanisms in order to predict thetime-varying impact rate of lpcs and the angular distribution of theirperihelia (which is observed to be non-uniform). comparing the predictions ofthese dynamical models with other models, we conclude that cometary impactsinduced by the solar motion contribute only a small fraction of terrestrialimpact craters over the past 250 myr. over this time scale the apparentcratering rate is dominated by a secular increase towards the present, whichmight be the result of the disruption of a large asteroid. our dynamicalmodels, together with the solar apex motion, predict a non-uniform angulardistribution of the perihelia, without needing to invoke the existence of amassive body in the outer oort cloud. our results are reasonably robust tochanges in the parameters of the galaxy model, oort cloud, and stellarencounters.

1407.2849	search for free-floating planetary-mass objects in the pleiades	(abridged) we aim at identifying the least massive population of the solarmetallicity, young (120 myr), nearby (133.5 pc) pleiades star cluster with theultimate goal of understanding the physical properties of intermediate-age,free-floating, low-mass brown dwarfs and giant planetary-mass objects, andderiving the cluster substellar mass function across the deuterium-burning masslimit at ~0.012 msol. we performed a deep photometric and astrometric j- andh-band survey covering an area of ~0.8 deg^2. the images with completeness andlimiting magnitudes of j,h ~ 20.2 and ~ 21.5 mag were acquired ~9 yr apart(proper motion precision of +/-6 mas/yr). j- and h-band data were complementedwith z, k, and mid-infrared magnitudes up to 4.6 micron coming from ukidss,wise, and follow-up observations of our own. pleiades member candidates wereselected to have proper motions compatible with that of the cluster, and colorsfollowing the known pleiades sequence in the interval j = 15.5-8.8 mag, andz_ukidss - j &gt; 2.3 mag or z nondetections for j &gt; 18.8 mag. we found a neatsequence of astrometric and photometric pleiades substellar member candidatesin the intervals j = 15.5-21.2 mag and ~0.072-0.008 msol. the faintest objectsshow very red near- and mid-infrared colors exceeding those of fieldhigh-gravity dwarfs by &gt;0.5 mag. the pleiades photometric sequence does notshow any color turn-over because of the presence of photospheric methaneabsorption down to j = 20.3 mag, which is about 1 mag fainter than predicted bythe color-computed models. pleiades brown dwarfs have a proper motiondispersion of 6.4-7.5 mas/yr and are dynamically relaxed at the age of thecluster. the pleiades mass function extends down to the deuterium burning-massthreshold, with a slope fairly similar to that of other young star clusters andstellar associations.

1412.3648	close encounters of the stellar kind	stars which pass close to the sun can perturb the oort cloud, injectingcomets into the inner solar system where they may collide with the earth. usingvan leeuwen's re-reduction of the hipparcos data complemented by the originalhipparcos and tycho-2 catalogues, along with recent radial velocity surveys, iintegrate the orbits of over 50 000 stars through the galaxy to look for closeencounters. the search uses a monte carlo simulation over the covariance of thedata in order to properly characterize the uncertainties in the times,distances, and speeds of the encounters. i show that modelling stellarencounters by assuming instead a linear relative motion produces, for manyencounters, inaccurate and biased results. i find 42, 14, and 4 stars whichhave encounter distances below 2, 1, and 0.5 pc respectively, although some ofthese stars have questionable data. of the 14 stars coming within 1 pc, 5 werefound by at least one of three previous studies (which found a total of 7coming within 1 pc). the closest encounter appears to be hip 85605, a k or mstar, which has a 90% probability of coming between 0.04 and 0.20 pc between240 and 470 kyr from now (90% bayesian confidence interval). however, itsastrometry may be incorrect, in which case the closest encounter found is thek7 dwarf gl 710, which has a 90% probability of coming within 0.10-0.44 pc inabout 1.3 myr. a larger perturbation may have been caused by gamma microscopii,a g6 giant with a mass of about 2.5 msol, which came within 0.35-1.34 pc (90%confidence interval) around 3.8 myr ago.

1505.02183	obliquity and precession as pacemakers of pleistocene deglaciations	the milankovitch theory states that the orbital eccentricity, precession, andobliquity of the earth influence our climate by modulating the summerinsolation at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. despite considerablesuccess of this theory in explaining climate change over the pleistocene epoch(2.6 to 0.01 myr ago), it is inconclusive with regard to which combination oforbital elements paced the 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles over the latepleistocene. here we explore the role of the orbital elements in pacing thepleistocene deglaciations by modeling ice-volume variations in a bayesianapproach. when comparing models, this approach takes into account theuncertainties in the data as well as the different degrees of model complexity.we find that the earth's obliquity (axial tilt) plays a dominant role in pacingthe glacial cycles over the whole pleistocene, while precession only becomesimportant in pacing major deglaciations after the transition of the dominantperiod from 41 kyr to 100 kyr (the mid-pleistocene transition). we also findthat geomagnetic field and orbital inclination variations are unlikely to havepaced the pleistocene deglaciations. we estimate that the mid-pleistocenetransition took place over a 220 kyr interval centered on a time 715 kyr ago,although the data permit a range of 600--1000 kyr. this transition, occurringwithin just two 100\,kyr cycles, indicates a relatively rapid change in theclimate response to insolation.

1507.02105	estimating distances from parallaxes	astrometric surveys such as gaia and lsst will measure parallaxes forhundreds of millions of stars. yet they will not measure a single distance.rather, a distance must be estimated from a parallax. in this didactic article,i show that doing this is not trivial once the fractional parallax error islarger than about 20%, which will be the case for about 80% of stars in thegaia catalogue. estimating distances is an inference problem in which the useof prior assumptions is unavoidable. i investigate the properties andperformance of various priors and examine their implications. a supposeduninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distanceestimates (large bias and variance). any prior with a sharp cut-off at somedistance has similar problems. the choice of prior depends on the informationone has available - and is willing to use - concerning, for example, the surveyand the galaxy. i demonstrate that a simple prior which decreasesasymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodatesnon-positive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.

1509.07222	finding the imprints of stellar encounters in long period comets	the solar system's oort cloud can be perturbed by the galactic tide and byindividual passing stars. these perturbations can inject oort cloud objectsinto the inner parts of the solar system, where they may be observed as thelong-period comets (periods longer than 200 years). using dynamical simulationsof the oort cloud under the perturbing effects of the tide and 61 known stellarencounters, we investigate the link between long-period comets and encounters.we find that past encounters were responsible for injecting at least 5% of thecurrently known long-period comets. this is a lower limit due to theincompleteness of known encounters. although the galactic tide seems to playthe dominant role in producing the observed long-period comets, the non-uniformlongitude distribution of the cometary perihelia suggests the existence ofstrong -- but as yet unidentified -- stellar encounters or other impulses. thestrongest individual future and past encounters are probably hip 89825 (gliese710) and hip 14473, which contribute at most 8% and 6% to the total flux oflong-period comets, respectively. our results show that the strength of anencounter can be approximated well by a simple proxy, which will be convenientfor quickly identifying significant encounters in large data sets. our analysisalso indicates a smaller population of the oort cloud than is usually assumed,which would bring the mass of the solar nebula into line with planet formationtheories.

astro-ph;0012224	variability in ultra cool dwarfs: evidence for the evolution of surface  features	we present photometric light curves for a sample of 21 ultra cool m and ldwarfs in the field and in the young open clusters sigma orionis and thepleiades. evidence for variability with rms amplitudes (in the i band) of 0.01to 0.055 magnitudes on timescales of 0.4 to 100 hours is discovered in half ofthese objects. power spectral analysis using the clean algorithm was performedto search for evidence of periodic variability. some objects show strongperiodicities at around a few hours, which could be due to rotationalmodulation of the light curve by surface features. however, several objects donot have any significant periodicities to explain their variability. the vsinivalues of a similar population of objects makes it very likely that our timesampling was sensitive to the expected range of rotation periods, andsimulations show that we would have detected these if they were caused bylong-lived surface features. we argue that this absence of periodicity is dueto the evolution of the brightness, and presumably also the physical size, ofsurface features on timescales of a few to a few tens of hours. this issupported in the case of 2m1145 for which two light curves have been obtainedone year apart and show no common periodicity. the surface features couldplausibly be photospheric dust clouds or magnetically-induced spots. therecently observed decline in chromospheric activity for late type m and ldwarfs hints towards the former explanation for at least our later-typeobjects. furthermore, our sample suggests that variability to be more common inobjects later than m9, indicating that the variability may be related to dustformation. one light curve shows a brief, but significant, dip, which could bea short-lived feature or possibly an eclipse by a companion.

astro-ph;0104097	the substellar mass function in sigma orionis	we combine results from imaging searches for substellar objects in the sigmaorionis cluster and follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations toderive a census of the brown dwarf population in a region of 847 arcmin^2. weidentify 64 very low-mass cluster member candidates in this region. we haveavailable three color (izj) photometry for all of them, spectra for 9 objects,and k photometry for 27% of our sample. these data provide a well definedsequence in the i vs i-j, i-k color magnitude diagrams, and indicate that thecluster is affected by little reddening despite its young age (~5 myr). usingstate-of-the-art evolutionary models, we derive a mass function from thelow-mass stars (0.2 msol) across the complete brown dwarf domain (0.075 msol to0.013 msol), and into the realm of free-floating planetary-mass objects (&lt;0.013msol). we find that the mass spectrum (dn/dm ~ m^{-alpha}) increases towardlower masses with an exponent alpha = 0.8+/-0.4. our results suggest thatplanetary-mass isolated objects could be as common as brown dwarfs; both kindsof objects together would be as numerous as stars in the cluster. if thedistribution of stellar and substellar masses in sigma orionis isrepresentative of the galactic disk, older and much lower luminosityfree-floating planetary-mass objects with masses down to about 0.005 msolshould be abundant in the solar vicinity, with a density similar to m-typestars.

(2001), the expected signatures of thesephenomena in the 0.5-2.5 um wavelength region are presented and discussed. nearinfrared spectra of 2m1145 were obtained along with a nearby reference starobserved simultaneously in the spectrograph slit. no convincing variabilityover a 54 hour interval is found in any one of several colour indices designedto be most sensitive to dust- and spot-related variability. nonetheless, asignificant correlation between the variability of two colour indices is found.this is slightly more consistent with the dust-related variability model thanthe cool spot one considered. based on the theoretically predicted signaturesand the median errors in the colour indices (0.03-0.05 magnitudes), upperlimits are placed on the coverage of possible spots and clouds. assuming the ldwarf to be best modelled by a dusty atmosphere at 1900k, coherent clear cloudsare limited to a coverage of 10-15% of the projected surface area and 200kcooler spots to a 20% coverage. a larger coverage of many small featuresvarying incoherently cannot be ruled out with this method. a lower effectivetemperature restricts coherent clear clouds to be much smaller; a highertemperature allows both clouds and spots to be larger. these upper limits areconsistent with the two separate variability detections in the i-band reportedby bailer-jones &amp; mundt (2001).

astro-ph;0402591	evolutionary design of photometric systems and its application to gaia	designing a photometric system to best fulfil a set of scientific goals is acomplex task, demanding a compromise between conflicting requirements andsubject to various constraints. a specific example is the determination ofstellar astrophysical parameters (aps) - effective temperature, metallicityetc. - across a wide range of stellar types. i present a novel approach to thisproblem which makes minimal assumptions about the required filter system. byconsidering a filter system as a set of free parameters it may be designed byoptimizing some figure-of-merit (fom) with respect to these parameters. in theexample considered, the fom is a measure of how well the filter system can`separate' stars with different aps. this separation is vectorial in nature, inthe sense that the local directions of ap variance are preferably mutuallyorthogonal to avoid ap degeneracy. the optimization is carried out with anevolutionary algorithm, which uses principles of evolutionary biology to searchthe parameter space. this model, hfd (heuristic filter design), is applied tothe design of photometric systems for the gaia space astrometry mission. theoptimized systems show a number of interesting features, not least thepersistence of broad, overlapping filters. these hfd systems perform as leastas well as other proposed systems for gaia, although inadequacies remain inall. the principles underlying hfd are quite generic and may be applied tofilter design for numerous other projects, such as the search for specifictypes of objects or photometric redshift determination.

astro-ph;0403013	spectroscopic rotation velocities of l dwarfs from vlt/uves and their  comparison with periods from photometric monitoring	the variability and rotation of ultra cool dwarfs (ucds) provide importantinformation on their atmospheres and evolution. as part of an ongoing programto investigate this, projected rotation speeds, vsini, are presented for 16field ucds (m9v-l7.5v). this doubles the number of l dwarfs for which vsini hasbeen measured. all targets are found to have vsini between 10 and 40 km/s,confirming that l dwarfs are rapid rotators. from the random distribution ofthe rotation axes, i, one-sided confidence intervals are placed on the rotationperiods of individual object. these are compared with published period dataobtained from photometric monitoring. from this, the period of 31 hrs for thel0.5 dwarf 2m0746+2000 published by gelino et al. (2002) may be ruled out asthe rotation period. the period of 11.2 +/- 0.8 hrs for the l1.5 dwarf2m1145+2317 obtained by bailer-jones &amp; mundt (2001) is plausibly the rotationperiod. the inclination of the rotation axis is i = 62-90 deg with anexpectation value of 76 deg. alternatively the data set a lower limit on theradius of 0.1 rsol. similarly, the period of 2.7 +/- 0.1 hrs for 2m1334+1940 isthe likely rotation period; the inclination is i = 27-44 deg (mean i = 34 deg).where no variability or period was detected by the monitoring programs thelikely reason is low contrast surface features. however, in three casesvariability but no period was detected, despite sensitivity to the likelyrotation periods inferred from vsini. this reinforces the `masking hypothesis',the idea that the evolution of photospheric features obscures regularmodulation of the light curve. as has been previously discussed, a likelycandidate for such features is inhomogeneous dust clouds.

astro-ph;0409463	variability and rotation of ultra cool dwarfs	over the past few years monitoring programs have shown ultra cool dwarfs(ucds) to be photometrically variable. of the 60 sources monitored in the fieldand some 120 monitored in clusters, about 40% show variability in both cases.for mid to late m dwarfs in young (&lt;100 myr) clusters, this variability isgenerally periodic with amplitudes of up to a few tenths of a magnitude andperiods of between a few hours and several days. for older field dwarfs(covering late m, l and t types) this variability is often nonperiodic withsmaller amplitudes (up to 0.1 mag in i) and timescales of order hours. theformer may be attributed to the rotational modulation of magnetically-inducedphotospheric spots, as seen in higher mass t tauri stars. the nonperiodicvariability, on the other hand, may be caused by a rapid evolution of surfacefeatures (which 'mask' the otherwise observable rotational modulation). thiscould be related to the formation and dissipation of inhomogeneities in dustclouds in the photospheres of ucds.

astro-ph;0409531	microarcsecond astrometry with gaia: the solar system, the galaxy and  beyond	gaia is an all sky, high precision astrometric and photometric satellite ofthe european space agency (esa) due for launch in 2010-2011. its primarymission is to study the composition, formation and evolution of our galaxy.gaia will measure parallaxes and proper motions of every object in the skybrighter than v=20, amounting to a billion stars, galaxies, quasars and solarsystem objects. it will achieve an astrometric accuracy of 10muas at v=15 -corresponding to a distance accuracy of 1% at 1kpc. with gaia, tens of millionsof stars will have their distances measured to a few percent or better. this isan improvement over hipparcos by several orders of magnitude in the number ofobjects, accuracy and limiting magnitude. gaia will also measure radialvelocities for source brighter than v~17. to characterize the objects, eachobject is observed in 15 medium and broad photometric bands with an onboard ccdcamera. with these capabilities, gaia will make significant advances in a widerange of astrophysical topics. these include a detailed kinematical map ofstellar populations, stellar structure and evolution, the discovery andcharacterization of thousands of exoplanetary systems and general relativity onlarge scales. i give an overview of the mission, its operating principles andits expected scientific contributions. for the latter i provide a quick look infive areas on increasing scale size in the universe: the solar system, exosolarplanets, stellar clusters and associations, galactic structure andextragalactic astronomy.

astro-ph;0502099	design of the gaia photometric systems for stellar parametrization using  a population-based optimizer	large, deep surveys must typically rely on multiband photometry rather thanspectroscopy for determining the astrophysical properties (aps) of stars. yetdesigning an optimal photometric system for a wide range of objects is complex,because it must trade off conflicting scientific requirements. i present a newmethod for designing photometric systems and apply it to the gaia galacticsurvey satellite, which will observe one billion stars brighter than v=20. theprinciple is to optimally sample stellar spectra in order to best determine theaps (e.g. teff, [fe/h], interstellar extinction). by considering a filtersystem as a set of free parameters (central wavelengths, fwhm etc.), it may bedesigned by optimizing a figure-of-merit (fom) with respect to theseparameters. the fom is a measure of how well the filter system can vectorially'separate' stars in the data space to avoid ap degeneracies. the resultingsystems show some interesting features, in particular broad, overlappingfilters, which may be desirable from a multivariate classification perspective.these systems are competitive with others proposed for gaia.

astro-ph;0503345	analysis of medium resolution spectra by automated methods - application  to m55 and omega centauri	we have employed feedforward neural networks trained on synthetic spectra inthe range 3800 to 5600 aa with resolutions of 2-3 aa to determine metallicitiesfrom spectra of about 1000 main-sequence turn-off, subgiant and red giant starsin the globular clusters m55 and omega cen. the overall metallicity accuraciesare of the order of 0.15 to 0.2 dex. in addition, we tested how well thestellar parameters logg and teff can be retrieved from such data withoutadditional colour or photometric information. we find overall uncertainties of0.3 to 0.4 dex for logg and 140 to 190 k for teff. in order to obtain somemeasure of uncertainty for the determined values of [fe/h], logg and teff, weapplied the bootstrap method for the first time to neural networks for thiskind of parametrization problem. the distribution of metallicities for stars inomega cen clearly shows a large spread in agreement with the well knownmultiple stellar populations in this cluster.

astro-ph;0507578	the disappearing act of kh 15d: photometric results from 1995 to 2004	we present results from the most recent (2002-2004) observing campaigns ofthe eclipsing system kh 15d, in addition to re-reduced data obtained at vanvleck observatory (vvo) between 1995 and 2000. phasing nine years ofphotometric data shows substantial evolution in the width and depth of theeclipses. the most recent data indicate that the eclipses are now approximately24 days in length, or half the orbital period. these results are interpretedand discussed in the context of the recent models for this system put forwardby winn et al. and chiang &amp; murray-clay. a periodogram of the entire data setyields a highly significant peak at 48.37 +/- 0.01 days, which is in accordwith the spectroscopic period of 48.38 +/- 0.01 days determined by johnson etal. another significant peak, at 9.6 days, was found in the periodogram of theout-of-eclipse data at two different epochs. we interpret this as the rotationperiod of the visible star and argue that it may be tidally locked inpseudosynchronism with its orbital motion. if so, application of hut's theoryimplies that the eccentricity of the orbit is e = 0.65 +/- 0.01. analysis ofthe uves/vlt spectra obtained by hamilton et al. shows that the v sin(i) of thevisible star in this system is 6.9 +/- 0.3 km/sec. using this value of v sin(i)and the measured rotation period of the star, we calculate the lower limit onthe radius to be r = (1.3 +/- 0.1), r_sun, which concurs with the valueobtained by hamilton et al. from its luminosity and effective temperature. herewe assume that i = 90 degrees since it is likely that the spin and orbitalangular momenta vectors are nearly aligned.

astro-ph;0512038	the design and performance of the gaia photometric system	the european gaia astrometry mission is due for launch in 2011. gaia willrely on the proven principles of esa's hipparcos mission to create an all-skysurvey of about one billion stars throughout our galaxy and beyond, byobserving all objects down to 20th magnitude. through its massive measurementof stellar distances, motions and multi-colour photometry it will providefundamental data necessary for unravelling the structure, formation andevolution of the galaxy. this paper presents the design and performance of thebroad- and medium-band set of photometric filters adopted as the baseline forgaia. the nineteen selected passbands (extending from the ultraviolet to thefar-red), the criteria, and the methodology on which this choice has been basedare discussed in detail. we analyse the photometric capabilities forcharacterizing the luminosity, temperature, gravity and chemical composition ofstars. we also discuss the automatic determination of these physical parametersfor the large number of observations involved, for objects located throughoutthe entire hertzsprung-russell diagram. finally, the capability of thephotometric system to deal with the main gaia science case is outlined.

astro-ph;0608255	pleiades low-mass brown dwarfs: the cluster l dwarf sequence	we present a search for low-mass brown dwarfs in the pleiades open cluster.the identification of pleiades members fainter and cooler than those currentlyknown allows us to constrain evolutionary models for l dwarfs and to extend thestudy of the cluster mass function to lower masses. we conducted a 1.8 deg^2near-infrared j-band survey at the 3.5m calar alto telescope, with completenessj~19.0. the detected sources were correlated with those of previously availableoptical i-band images (completeness i~22). using a j versus i-jcolour-magnitude diagram, we identified 18 faint red l-type candidates, withmagnitudes 17.4&lt;j&lt;19.7 and colours i-j&gt;3.2. if pleiades members, their masseswould span ~0.040-0.020 m_sol. we performed follow-up hks-band imaging tofurther confirm their cluster membership by photometry and proper motion. outof 11 ij candidates with proper motion measurements, we find six clustermembers, two non-members and three whose membership is uncertain and depends onthe intrinsic velocity dispersion of pleiades brown dwarfs. this dispersion (&gt;4mas yr^-1) is at least four times that of cluster stars with masses &gt;1 m_sol.five of the seven other ij candidates are discarded because their j-ks coloursare bluer than those of confirmed members. the j versus i-j sequence of thel-type candidates at j&gt;18 is not as red as theoretical models predict; itrather follows the field l-dwarf sequence translated to the cluster distance.this sequence overlapping, also observed in the j versus j-h and j-k diagrams,suggests that pleiades and field l dwarfs may have similar spectral energydistributions and luminosities, and thus possibly similar radii. also, we findalpha=0.5+-0.2 for a power-law approximation dn/dm propor. m^-alpha of thesurvey mass spectrum in the mass range 0.5-0.026 m_sol.

astro-ph;0703309	estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters from sdss/segue spectra	we present techniques for the estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters(teff,logg,[fe/h]) for stars from the sdss/segue survey. the atmosphericparameters are derived from the observed medium-resolution (r=2000) stellarspectra using non-linear regression models trained either on (1) pre-classifiedobserved data or (2) synthetic stellar spectra. in the first case we use ourmodels to automate and generalize parametrization produced by a preliminaryversion of the sdss/segue spectroscopic parameter pipeline (sspp). in thesecond case we directly model the mapping between synthetic spectra (derivedfrom kurucz model atmospheres) and the atmospheric parameters, independently ofany intermediate estimates. after training, we apply our models to varioussamples of sdss spectra to derive atmospheric parameters, and compare ourresults with those obtained previously by the sspp for the same samples. weobtain consistency between the two approaches, with rms deviations of 150k inteff, 0.35dex in logg, and 0.22dex in [fe/h]. the models are applied topre-processed spectra, either via principal components analysis or a wavelengthrange selection method, which employs a subset of the full 3850-9000a spectralrange. this is both for computational reasons, and because it delivers higheraccuracy. from an analysis of cluster candidates with available sdssspectroscopy (m15, m13, m2, and ngc2420), we find evidence for small systematicoffsets in teff and/or logg for the atmospheric parameter estimates from themodel trained on real data with the sspp. thus, this model turns out to derivemore precise, but less accurate, atmospheric parameters than the model trainedon synthetic data.

0809.3373	finding rare objects and building pure samples: probabilistic quasar  classification from low resolution gaia spectra	we develop and demonstrate a probabilistic method for classifying rareobjects in surveys with the particular goal of building very pure samples. itworks by modifying the output probabilities from a classifier so as toaccommodate our expectation (priors) concerning the relative frequencies ofdifferent classes of objects. we demonstrate our method using the discretesource classifier, a supervised classifier currently based on support vectormachines, which we are developing in preparation for the gaia data analysis.dsc classifies objects using their very low resolution optical spectra. we lookin detail at the problem of quasar classification, because identification of apure quasar sample is necessary to define the gaia astrometric reference frame.by varying a posterior probability threshold in dsc we can trade off samplecompleteness and contamination. we show, using our simulated data, that it ispossible to achieve a pure sample of quasars (upper limit on contamination of 1in 40,000) with a completeness of 65% at magnitudes of g=18.5, and 50% atg=20.0, even when quasars have a frequency of only 1 in every 2000 objects. thestar sample completeness is simultaneously 99% with a contamination of 0.7%.including parallax and proper motion in the classifier barely changes theresults. we further show that not accounting for class priors in the targetpopulation leads to serious misclassifications and poor predictions for samplecompleteness and contamination.

astro-ph;9906439	a search for variability in brown dwarfs and l dwarfs	we have undertaken a differential photometric i band search for variabilityin three pleiades brown dwarfs and three very low mass field l dwarfs. analysisof the resultant time series for the pleiades brown dwarfs (teide 1, calar 3,roque 11) gives no evidence for variability (above 99% confidence) greater than0.05 mags in any of these objects on timescales between 25 minutes and 27hours. time series of two of the l dwarfs, 2massw j0913032+184150 and 2masswj1146345+223053, are also consistent with no intrinsic variability (nosignificant variability above 0.07 mags for 30 mins &lt; t &lt; 126 hours, and above0.025 mags for 30 mins &lt; t &lt; 75 hours, for the two objects respectively).however, the l dwarf 2massw j1145572+231730 shows evidence for variability ofamplitude 0.04 magnitudes with a tentative period of about 7 hours. it istherefore interesting that kirkpatrick et al. (1999) report an halpha emissionline of 4.2aa equivalent width for this star: if our detection is confirmed asa rotation period, it would support the link between rotation and halphaemission in very low mass stars.
