0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

1004.1131	grb 021004: tomography of a gamma-ray burst progenitor and its host  galaxy	we analyse the distribution of matter around the progenitor star of gamma-rayburst grb 021004 as well as the properties of its host galaxy withhigh-resolution echelle as well as near-infrared spectroscopy. observationswere taken by the 8.2m very large telescope with the ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (uves) and the infrared spectrometer and array camera(isaac) between 10 and 14 hours after the onset of the event. we report thefirst detection of emission lines from a grb host galaxy in the near-infrared,detecting h-alpha and the [o iii] doublet. these allow an independentmeasurement of the systemic redshift (z = 2.3304 +/- 0.0005) which is notcontaminated by absorption as the ly-alpha line is, and the deduction ofproperties of the host galaxy. from the visual echelle spectroscopy, we findseveral absorption line groups spanning a range of about 3,000 km/s in velocityrelative to the redshift of the host galaxy. the absorption profiles are verycomplex with both velocity-broadened components extending over several 100 km/sand narrow lines with velocity widths of only 20 km/s. by analogy with qsoabsorption line studies, the relative velocities,widths, and degrees ofionization of the lines ("line-locking", "ionization--velocity correlation")show that the progenitor had both an extremely strong radiation field andseveral distinct mass loss phases (winds). these results are consistent withgrb progenitors being massive stars, such as luminous blue variables (lbvs) orwolf--rayet stars, providing a detailed picture of the spatial and velocitystructure of the grb progenitor star at the time of explosion. the host galaxyis a prolific star-forming galaxy with a sfr of about 40 solar masses per year.

1006.4469	searching for differences in swift's intermediate grbs	gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emissioninto short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect twodifferent types of progenitors. however, it has been shown on statisticalgrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classificationscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so farnot been done. the large amount of follow-up studies generated during the swiftera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this thirdpopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and theirafterglows. our study is focused on a sample of grbs observed by swift duringits first four years of operation. the sample contains those bursts withmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than longgrbs, especially when considering the x-ray light curves, which are on averageone order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. there is a less significanttrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer thanlong bursts. except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties tolong bursts. in particular, they follow the epeak vs. eiso correlation andhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that oflong bursts. like long grbs, they normally have an associated supernova,although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. this studyshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite ofsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences betweenthem as well. we suggest that the physical difference between intermediate andlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while forthe latter they are thick shells.

1007.0383	the swift/fermi grb 080928 from 1 ev to 150 kev	we present the results of a comprehensive study of the gamma-ray burst 080928and of its afterglow. grb 080928 was a long burst detected by swift/bat andfermi/gbm. it is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission hadalready been detected when the grb itself was still radiating in the gamma-rayband. for nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, x-ray and gamma-ray dataprovide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient sourcefrom about 1 ev to 150 kev. in particular, we show that the sed during the mainprompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. we constructed theoptical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based onswift/uvot, rotse-iiia (australia), and grond (la silla) data and compared itto the x-ray light curve retrieved from the swift/xrt repository. we show thatits bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forwardshock.furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolutionof the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early x-ray lightcurve can be explained by large-angle emission (lae). we find that anonstandard lae model is required to explain the observations. finally, wereport on the results of our search for the grb host galaxy, for which only adeep upper limit can be provided.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1009.0004	monster in the dark: the ultraluminous grb 080607 and its dusty  environment	we present early-time optical through infrared photometry of the brightgamma-ray burst grb 080607, starting only 6 s following the initial trigger inthe rest frame. complemented by our previously published spectroscopy, thishigh-quality photometric dataset allows us to solve for the extinctionproperties of the redshift 3.036 sightline, giving perhaps the most detailedinformation on the ultraviolet continuum absorption properties of any sightlineoutside our local group to date. the extinction properties are not adequatelymodeled by any ordinary extinction template (including the average milky way,large magellanic cloud, and small magellanic cloud curves), partially becausethe 2175-angstrom feature (while present) is weaker by about a factor of twothan when seen under similar circumstances locally. however, the spectralenergy distribution is exquisitely fitted by the more general fitzpatrick &amp;massa (1990) parameterization of local-group extinction, putting it in the samefamily as some peculiar milky way extinction curves. after correcting for this(considerable, a_v = 3.3 +/- 0.4 mag) extinction, grb 080607 is revealed tohave been among the most optically luminous events ever observed, comparable tothe naked-eye burst grb 080319b. its early peak time (t_rest &lt; 6 s) indicates ahigh initial lorentz factor (gamma &gt; 600), while the extreme luminosity may beexplained in part by a large circumburst density. only because of its earlyhigh luminosity could the afterglow of grb 080607 be studied in such detail inspite of the large attenuation and great distance, making this burst anexcellent prototype for the understanding of other highly obscuredextragalactic objects, and of the class of "dark" grbs in particular.

1010.4057	the circumburst density profile around grb progenitors: a statistical  study	according to our present understanding, long grbs originate from the collapseof massive stars while short bursts are due to the coalescence of compactstellar objects. since the afterglow evolution is determined by the circumburstdensity profile, n(r), traversed by the fireball, it can be used to distinguishbetween a so-called ism profile, n(r) = const., and a free stellar wind, $n(r)\propto r^{-2}$. our goal is to derive the most probable circumburst densityprofile for a large number of swift-detected bursts using well-sampledafterglow light curves in the optical and x-ray bands. we combined all publiclyavailable optical and swift/x-ray afterglow data from june 2005 to september2009 to find the best-sampled late-time afterglow light curves. after applyingseveral selection criteria, our final sample consists of 27 bursts, includingone short burst. the afterglow evolution was then studied within the frameworkof the fireball model. we find that the majority (18) of the 27 afterglow lightcurves are compatible with a constant density medium (ism case). only 6 of the27 afterglows show evidence for a wind profile at late times. in particular, weset upper limits on the wind termination-shock radius, $r_t$, for grb fireballswhich are propagating into an ism profile and lower limits on $r_t$ for thosewhich were found to propagate through a wind medium. observational evidence forism profiles dominates in grb afterglow studies, implying that most grbprogenitors might have relatively small wind termination-shock radii. a smallergroup of progenitors, however, seems to be characterised by notably moreextended wind regions.

1105.0917	on the nature of the extremely fast optical rebrightening of the  afterglow of grb 081029	context. after the launch of the swift satellite, the gamma-ray burst (grb)optical light-curve smoothness paradigm has been questioned thanks to thefaster and better sampled optical follow-up, which has unveiled a very complexbehaviour. this complexity is triggering the interest of the whole grbcommunity. the grond multi-channel imager is used to study optical andnear-infrared (nir) afterglows of grbs with unprecedented optical andnear-infrared temporal and spectral resolution. the grb 081029 has a veryprominent optical rebrightening event and is an outstanding example of theapplication of the multi-channel imager to grb afterglows. aims. here weexploit the rich grond multi-colour follow-up of grb 081029 combined with xrtobservations to study the nature of late-time rebrightenings that appear in theoptical-nir light-curves of some grb afterglows. methods. we analyse theoptical and nir observations obtained with the seven-channel gamma-ray burstoptical and near-infrared detector (grond) at the 2.2 m mpi/eso telescope andthe x-ray data obtained with the xrt telescope on board the swift observatory.the multi-wavelength temporal and spectral evolution is discussed in theframework of different physical models. results. the extremely steep opticaland nir rebrightening observed in grb 081029 cannot be explained in theframework of the standard forward shock afterglow model. the absence of acontemporaneous x-ray rebrightening and the evidence of a strong spectralevolution in the optical-nir bands during the rise suggest two separatecomponents that dominate in the early and late-time lightcurves, respectively.the steepness of the optical rise cannot be explained even in the framework ofthe alternative scenarios proposed in the literature unless a late-timeactivity of the central engine is assumed.

1105.1312	grb 090426: discovery of a jet break in a short burst afterglow	context: the link between the duration of grbs and the nature of theirprogenitors remains disputed. short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)are less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, andexhibit significantly fainter afterglows. aims: it is of critical importance toestablish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different grbpopulation models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. the swift grb090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. its duration(t_90=1.28 s) places grb 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while thehigh redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectralcharacteristics are more similar to those of long-duration grbs. methods: onthe basis of data obtained with the tautenburg 2m telescope (germany) and the7-channel imager grond (la silla, chile), we compiled the most finely sampledlight curve available for a short burst optical/nir afterglow. the light curvewas then analysed in a standard fashion. grond and xrt data were used todetermine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow acrossmore than three orders of magnitude. results: our data show that a light curvebreak exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. this light curvedecay is achromatic in the optical/nir bands, and interpreted as a post-jetbreak phase. the x-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.conclusions: the half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as theluminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that grb 090426is probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger oftwo compact objects.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1105.3015	an unusual stellar death on christmas day	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most dramatic examples of massivestellar deaths, usually as- sociated with supernovae (woosley et al. 2006).they release ultra-relativistic jets producing non-thermal emission throughsynchrotron radiation as they interact with the surrounding medium (zhang etal. 2004). here we report observations of the peculiar grb 101225a (the"christmas burst"). its gamma-ray emission was exceptionally long and followedby a bright x-ray transient with a hot thermal component and an unusual opticalcounterpart. during the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as anexpanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistentwith a faint supernova, emerged. we determine its distance to 1.6 gpc byfitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the opticalemission with a grb-supernova template. deep optical observations may haverevealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. our proposed progenitor is a heliumstar-neutron star merger that underwent a common envelope phase expelling itshydrogen envelope. the resulting explosion created a grb-like jet which getsthermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material and thuscreating the observed black-body, until finally the emission from the supernovadominated. an alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutronstar in the galaxy (campana et al. 2011).

1108.0674	the seds and host galaxies of the dustiest grb afterglows	(abridged) until recently the information inferred from gamma-ray burstfollow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows,biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amountsof dust. here, we present grb afterglow and host observations for a sample ofbursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visualextinction along the sight-line. this facilitates an investigation of theproperties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of thesepoorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts fromoptically-selected samples. the hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse intheir properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than thehosts of optically-bright events. we hence probe a different galaxy population,suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,chemically-evolved and metal-rich members. this also indicates that the dustalong the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probablylocated in the diffuse ism or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate grbenvironment. some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young or of smallstellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxiespossess very dusty sight-lines due to a patchy dust distribution. the presentedobservations establish a population of luminous, massive and correspondinglychemically-evolved grb hosts. this suggests that grbs trace the globalstar-formation rate better than studies based on optically-selected hostsamples indicate, and the previously-claimed deficiency of high-mass hostgalaxies was at least partially a selection effect.

1201.3885	the late-time afterglow of the extremely energetic short burst grb  090510 revisited	the discovery of the short grb 090510 has raised considerable attentionmainly because it had a bright optical afterglow and it is among the mostenergetic events detected so far within the entire grb population. theafterglow was observed with swift/uvot and swift/xrt and evidence of a jetbreak around 1.5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature,implying that after this break the optical and x-ray light curve should fadewith the same decay slope. as noted by several authors, the post-break decayslope seen in the uvot data is much shallower than the steep decay in the x-rayband, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times. we reduced andanalyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imagergrond. based on the densely sampled data set obtained with grond, we find thatthe optical afterglow of grb 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phasestarting around 22 ks after the burst. during this time the grond optical lightcurve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the x-ray data.in combination with the uvot data this implies that a second break must haveoccurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however,has no obvious counterpart in the x-ray band, contradicting the interpretationthat this could be another jet break. the grond data provide the missing pieceof evidence that the optical afterglow of grb 090510 did follow a post-jetbreak evolution at late times.

1202.0347	the shallow-decay phase in both optical and x-ray afterglows of swift  grb 090529a: energy injection into a wind-type medium?	the energy injection model is usually proposed to interpret the shallow-decayphase in swift grb x-ray afterglows. however, very few grbs have simultaneoussignatures of energy injection in their optical and x-ray afterglows. here, wereport optical observations of grb 090529a from 2000 sec to $\sim10^6$ secafter the burst, in which an achromatic decay is seen at both wavelengths. theoptical light curve shows a decay from 0.37 to 0.99 with a break at $\sim10^5$sec. in the same time interval, the decay indices of the x-ray light curvechanged from 0.04 to 1.2. comparing these values with the closure relations,the segment after 3$\times10^{4}$ sec is consistent with the prediction of theforward shock in an ism medium without any energy injection. the shallow-decayphase between 2000 to 3$\times10^{4}$ sec could be due to the external shock ina wind-type-like medium with an energy injection under the condition of $\nu_o&lt; \nu_c &lt; \nu_x$. however, the constraint of the spectral region is not wellconsistent with the multi-band observations. for this shallow-decay phase,other models are also possible, such as energy injection with evolvingmicrophysical parameters, or a jet viewed off-axis,etc.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1302.6362	clustering of galaxies around grb sight-lines	there is evidence of an overdensity of strong intervening mgii absorptionline systems distributed along the lines of sight towards grb afterglowsrelative to quasar sight-lines. if this excess is real, one should also expectan overdensity of field galaxies around grb sight-lines, as strong mgii tendsto trace these sources. in this work, we test this expectation by calculatingthe two point angular correlation function of galaxies within120$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim470~h_{71}^{-1}~\mathrm{kpc}$ at $\langle z\rangle\sim0.4$) of grb afterglows. we compare the gamma-ray burst optical andnear-infrared detector (grond) grb afterglow sample -- one of the largest andmost homogeneous samples of grb fields -- with galaxies and agn found in thecosmos-30 photometric catalog. we find no significant signal of anomalousclustering of galaxies at an estimated median redshift of $z\sim0.3$ around grbsight-lines, down to $k_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;19.3$. this result is contrary to theexpectations from the mgii excess derived from grb afterglow spectroscopy,although many confirmed galaxy counterparts to mgii absorbers may be too faintto detect in our sample -- especially those at $z&gt;1$. we note that the additionof higher sensitivity spitzer irac or hst wfc3 data for even a subset of oursample would increase this survey's depth by several orders of magnitude,simultaneously increasing statistics and enabling the investigation of a muchlarger redshift space.}

1304.5852	the unusual afterglow of the gamma-ray burst 100621a	in order to constrain the broad-band spectral energy distribution of theafterglow of grb 100621a, dedicated observations were performed in theoptical/near-infrared with the 7-channel "gamma-ray burst optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpg/eso telescope, in thesub-millimeter band with the large bolometer array laboca at apex, and at radiofrequencies with atca. utilizing also swift x-ray observations, we attempt aninterpretation of the observational data within the fireball scenario.  the afterglow of grb 100621a shows a very complex temporal as well asspectral evolution. we identify three different emission components, the mostspectacular one causing a sudden intensity jump about one hour after the promptemission. the spectrum of this component is much steeper than the canonicalafterglow. we interpret this component using the prescription of vlasis et al.(2011) for a two-shell collision after the first shell has been decelerated bythe circumburst medium. we use the fireball scenario to derive constraints onthe microphysical parameters of the first shell. long-term energy injectioninto a narrow jet seems to provide an adequate description. another noteworthyresult is the large ($a_v$ = 3.6 mag) line-of-sight host extinction of theafterglow in an otherwise extremely blue host galaxy.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1306.0892	the low-extinction afterglow in the solar-metallicity host galaxy of  gamma-ray burst 110918a	metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in gamma-rayburst (grb) explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than adecade of extensive studies, not fully understood. this is largely related totwo phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likelyhigh-metallicity grb hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack ofefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies includingmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the grb host population.the subject of this work is the very energetic grb 110918a, for which wemeasure a redshift of z=0.984. grb 110918a gave rise to a luminous afterglowwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line withlittle extinction (a_v=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions ofafterglow properties. photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations ofthe galaxy hosting grb 110918a, including optical/nir photometry with grond andspectroscopy with vlt/x-shooter, however, reveal an all but average grb host incomparison to the z~1 galaxies selected through similar afterglows to date. ithas a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of ~10 kpc, the higheststellar mass for z&lt;1.9 (log(m_*/m_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an halpha-based starformation rate of 41 m_sol/yr. we measure a gas-phase extinction of ~1.8 magthrough the balmer decrement and one of the largest host-integratedmetallicities ever of around solar (12 + log(o/h) = 8.93+/-0.13). this presentsone of the very few robust metallicity measurements of grb hosts at z~1, andestablishes that grb hosts at z~1 can also be very metal rich. it conclusivelyrules out a metallicity cut-off in grb host galaxies and argues against ananti-correlation between metallicity and energy release in grbs.

1312.4547	prompt emission of grb 121217a from gamma-rays to the nir	the mechanism that causes the prompt-emission episode of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) is still widely debated despite there being thousands of promptdetections. the favoured internal shock model relates this emission tosynchrotron radiation. however, it does not always explain the spectral indicesof the shape of the spectrum, often fit with empirical functions.multi-wavelength observations are therefore required to help investigate thepossible underlying mechanisms that causes the prompt emission. we present grb121217a, for which we were able to observe its near-infrared (nir) emissionduring a secondary prompt-emission episode with the gamma-ray burst opticalnear-infrared detector (grond) in combination with the swift and fermisatellites, covering an energy range of 0.001 kev to 100 kev. we determine aphotometric redshift of z=3.1+/-0.1 with a line-of-sight extinction of a_v~0mag, utilising the optical/nir sed. from the afterglow, we determine a bulklorentz factor of gamma~250 and an emission radius of r&lt;10^18 cm. theprompt-emission broadband spectral energy distribution is well fit with abroken power law with b1=-0.3+/-0.1, b2=0.6+/-0.1 that has a break ate=6.6+/-0.9 kev, which can be interpreted as the maximum injection frequency.self-absorption by the electron population below energies of e_a&lt;6 kev suggesta magnetic field strength of b~10^5 g. however, all the best fit modelsunderpredict the flux observed in the nir wavelengths, which also onlyrebrightens by a factor of ~2 during the second prompt emission episode, instark contrast to the x-ray emission, which rebrightens by a factor of ~100,suggesting an afterglow component is dominating the emission. we present grb121217a one of the few grbs for which there are multi-wavelength observationsof the prompt-emission period and show that it can be understood with asynchrotron radiation model.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1502.00630	multiwavelength analysis of three sne associated with grbs observed by  grond	after the discovery of the first connection between grbs and sne almost twodecades ago, tens of sn-like rebrightenings have been discovered and aboutseven solid associations have been spectroscopically confirmed to date. usinggrond optical/nir data and swift x-ray/uv data, we estimate the intrinsicextinction, luminosity, and evolution of three sn rebrightenings in grbafterglow light curves at z~0.5. the sne 2008hw, 2009nz, and 2010ma exhibit0.80, 1.15, and 1.78 times the optical (r band) luminosity of sn 1998bw,respectively. while sn 2009nz evolves similarly to sn 1998bw, sne 2008hw and2010ma show earlier peak times. the quasi-bolometric light curves werecorrected for the contribution of the nir bands using data available in theliterature and blackbody fits. the large luminosity of sn 2010ma (1.4x10^43erg/s) is confirmed, while sne 2008hw and 2009nz reached a peak luminositycloser to sn 1998bw. physical parameters of the sn explosions, such assynthesised nickel mass, ejecta mass, and kinetic energy, are estimated usingarnett's analytic approach, which resulted in nickel masses of around 0.4-0.5msun. by means of the a very comprehensive data set, we found that theluminosity and the nickel mass of sne 2008hw, 2009nz, and 2010ma resemblesthose of other known grb-associated sne. this findings strengthens previousclaims of grb-sne being brighter than type-ic sne unaccompanied by grbs.

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

1505.04415	super-solar metallicity at the position of the ultra-long grb130925a	over the last decade there has been immense progress in the follow-up ofshort and long grbs, resulting in a significant rise in the detection rate ofx-ray and optical afterglows, in the determination of grb redshifts, and of theidentification of the underlying host galaxies. nevertheless, our theoreticalunderstanding on the progenitors and central engines powering these vastexplosions is lagging behind, and a newly identified class of `ultra-long' grbshas fuelled speculation on the existence of a new channel of grb formation. inthis paper we present high signal-to-noise x-shooter observations of the hostgalaxy of grb130925a, which is the fourth unambiguously identified ultra-longgrb, with prompt gamma-ray emission detected for ~20ks. the grb line of sightwas close to the host galaxy nucleus, and our spectroscopic observations coverboth this region along the bulge/disk of the galaxy, in addition to a brightstar-forming region within the outskirts of the galaxy. from our broadwavelength coverage we obtain accurate metallicity and dust-extinctionmeasurements at both the galaxy nucleus, and an outer star-forming region, andmeasure a super-solar metallicity at both locations, placing this galaxy withinthe 10-20% most metal-rich grb host galaxies. such a high metal enrichment hasimplications on the progenitor models of both long and ultra-long grbs,although the edge-on orientation of the host galaxy does not allow us to ruleout a large metallicity variation along our line of sight. the spatiallyresolved spectroscopic data presented in this paper offer important insightinto variations in the metal and dust abundance within grb host galaxies. theyalso illustrate the need for ifu observations on a larger sample of grb hostgalaxies at varies metallicities to provide a more quantitative view on therelation between the grb circumburst and the galaxy-whole properties.

1505.06743	grb hosts through cosmic time - vlt/x-shooter emission-line spectroscopy  of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.6	[abridged] we present data and initial results from vlt/x-shooteremission-line spectroscopy of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.6, thelargest sample of grb host spectroscopy available to date. most of our grbswere detected by swift and 76% are at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 with a median z~1.6. based onbalmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measuresystemic redshifts, star formation rates (sfrs), visual attenuations, oxygenabundances (12+log(o/h)), and emission-line widths. we find a strong change ofthe typical physical properties of grb hosts with redshift. the median sfr, forexample, increases from ~0.6 m_sun/yr at z~0.6 up to ~15 m_sun/yr at z~2. ahigher ratio of [oiii]/[oii] at higher redshifts leads to an increasingdistance of grb-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the bptdiagram. oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between12+log(o/h)=7.9 and 12+log(o/h)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(o/h)~8.5. thefraction of grb-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20%at z&lt;1 in the adopted metallicity scale. this is significantly less than thefraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that grbs arescarce in high-metallicity environments. at z~3, sensitivity limits us toprobing only the most luminous grb hosts for which we derive metallicities of z~&lt; 0.5 z_sun. together with a high incidence of galaxies with similarmetallicity in our sample at z~1.5, this indicates that the metallicitydependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z~3.

1507.04663	total eclipse of the heart: the am cvn gaia14aae / assasn-14cn	we report the discovery and characterisation of a deeply eclipsing amcvn-system, gaia14aae (= assasn-14cn). gaia14aae was identified independentlyby the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn; shappee et al. 2014)and by the gaia science alerts project, during two separate outbursts. a thirdoutburst is seen in archival pan-starrs-1 (ps1; schlafly et al. 2012; tonry etal. 2012; magnier et al. 2013) and asas-sn data. spectroscopy reveals a hot,hydrogen-deficient spectrum with clear double-peaked emission lines, consistentwith an accreting double degenerate classification. we use follow-up photometryto constrain the orbital parameters of the system. we find an orbital period of49.71 min, which places gaia14aae at the long period extremum of theoutbursting am cvn period distribution. gaia14aae is dominated by the lightfrom its accreting white dwarf. assuming an orbital inclination of 90 degreesfor the binary system, the contact phases of the white dwarf lead to lowerlimits of 0.78 m solar and 0.015 m solar on the masses of the accretor anddonor respectively and a lower limit on the mass ratio of 0.019. gaia14aae isonly the third eclipsing am cvn star known, and the first in which the wd istotally eclipsed. using a helium wd model, we estimate the accretor's effectivetemperature to be 12900+-200 k. the three out-burst events occurred within 4months of each other, while no other outburst activity is seen in the previous8 years of catalina real-time transient survey (crts; drake et al. 2009),pan-starrs-1 and asas-sn data. this suggests that these events might berebrightenings of the first outburst rather than individual events.

1509.09234	the central engine of grb 130831a and the energy breakdown of a  relativistic explosion	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most luminous explosions in the universe, yetthe nature and physical properties of their energy sources are far fromunderstood. very important clues, however, can be inferred by studying theafterglows of these events. we present optical and x-ray observations of grb130831a obtained by swift, chandra, skynet, ratir, maidanak, ison, not, lt andgtc. this burst shows a steep drop in the x-ray light-curve at $\simeq 10^5$ safter the trigger, with a power-law decay index of $\alpha \sim 6$. such a rarebehaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (fs) model andindicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at $10^5$ s, must be of"internal origin", produced by a dissipation process within anultrarelativistic outflow. we propose that the source of such an outflow, whichmust produce the x-ray flux for $\simeq 1$ day in the cosmological rest frame,is a newly born magnetar or black hole. after the drop, the faint x-rayafterglow continues with a much shallower decay. the optical emission, on theother hand, shows no break across the x-ray steep decrease, and the late-timedecays of both the x-ray and optical are consistent. using both the x-ray andoptical data, we show that the emission after $\simeq 10^5$ s can be explainedwell by the fs model. we model our data to derive the kinetic energy of theejecta and thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a grb withemission of internal origin visible for a long time. furthermore, we break downthe energy budget of this grb into the prompt emission, the late internaldissipation, the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it withthe energy of the associated supernova, sn 2013fu.

0806.1182	photometry and spectroscopy of grb 060526: a detailed study of the  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst	aims: with this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglowlight curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (grb) 060526 at $z=3.221$.methods: we present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for agrb afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultravioletto the near infrared. the data set contains 412 data points in total to whichwe add additional data from the literature. furthermore, we presentlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. the afterglowlight curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power lawfits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.the absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive columndensities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis fromwhich we derive the metallicity of the host of grb 060526. results: thetemporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law withbreaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. it shows deviationsfrom the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energyinjections from the central engine, although some significant microvariabilityremains. the broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows nosignificant extinction along the line of sight. the metallicity derived from\ion{s}{ii} and \ion{fe}{ii} of [s/h] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [fe/h] =--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparableto the metallicity of other grb hosts at similar redshifts. at the position ofthe afterglow, no host is detected to f775w(ab) = 28.5 mag with the hst,implying an absolute magnitude of the host m(1500 \aa{})$&gt;$--18.3 mag which isfainter than most long-duration hosts, although the grb may be associated witha faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.
