0903.3384	low-energy astrophysics: stimulating the reduction of energy consumption  in the next decade	in this paper we address the consumption of energy by astronomers whileperforming their professional duties. although we find that astronomy uses anegligible fraction of the us energy budget, the rate at which energy isconsumed by an average astronomer is similar to that of a typical high-flyingbusinessperson. we review some of the ways in which astronomers are alreadyacting to reduce their energy consumption. in the coming decades, all citizenswill have to reduce their energy consumption to conserve fossil fuel reservesand to help avert a potentially catastrophic change in the earth's climate. thechallenges are the same for astronomers as they are for everyone: decreasingthe distances we travel and investing in energy-efficient infrastructure. thehigh profile of astronomy in the media, and the great public interest in ourfield, can play a role in promoting energy-awareness to the wider population.our specific recommendations are therefore to 1) reduce travel when possible,through efficient meeting organization, and by investing in high-bandwidthvideo conference facilities and virtual-world software, 2) createenergy-efficient observatories, computing centers and workplaces, powered bysustainable energy resources, and 3) actively publicize these pursuits.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0909.2650	infrared luminosities and dust properties of z ~ 2 dust-obscured  galaxies	we present sharc-ii 350um imaging of twelve 24um-bright (f_24um &gt; 0.8 mjy)dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) and carma 1mm imaging of a subset of 2 dogs, allselected from the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. detectionsof 4 dogs at 350um imply ir luminosities which are consistent within a factorof 2 of expectations based on a warm dust spectral energy distribution (sed)scaled to the observed 24um flux density. the 350um upper limits for the 8non-detected dogs are consistent with both mrk231 and m82 (warm dust seds), butexclude cold dust (arp220) seds. the two dogs targeted at 1mm were not detectedin our carma observations, placing strong constraints on the dust temperature:t_dust &gt; 35-60 k. assuming these dust properties apply to the entire sample, wefind dust masses of ~3x10^8 m_sun. in comparison to other dusty z ~ 2 galaxypopulations such as sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs) and other spitzer-selectedhigh-redshift sources, this sample of dogs has higher ir luminosities (2x10^13l_sun vs. 6x10^12 l_sun for the other galaxy populations), warmer dusttemperatures (&gt;35-60 k vs. ~30 k), and lower inferred dust masses (3x10^8 m_sunvs. 3x10^9 m_sun). herschel and scuba-2 surveys should be able to detecthundreds of these power-law dominated dogs. we use hst and spitzer/irac data toestimate stellar masses of these sources and find that the stellar to gas massratio may be higher in our 24um-bright sample of dogs than in smgs and otherspitzer-selected sources. although larger sample sizes are needed to provide adefinitive conclusion, the data are consistent with an evolutionary trend inwhich the formation of massive galaxies at z~2 involves a sub-millimeterbright, cold-dust and star-formation dominated phase followed by a 24um-bright,warm-dust and agn-dominated phase.

0909.4303	deep spitzer 24mic cosmos imaging -- i. the evolution of luminous dusty  galaxies - confronting the models	we present the first results obtained from the identification of ~30,000sources in the 24mic observations of the cosmos field at s24&gt;~80mujy. usingaccurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolvewith unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-ir background across cosmicages. we find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originatefrom galaxies at z&lt;~1 and z&lt;~2 respectively, supporting the scenario wherehighly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z&gt;~2) contribute onlymarginally to the cib. assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection stronglyincreases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forminggalaxies have undergone with lookback time. nonetheless this rising trend showsa clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by thecomplexity of seds in the mid-ir. finally, we compare our results with thepredictions from different models of galaxy formation. we note thatsemi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributionsobserved at 24mic. furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit r-k colors muchbluer than observed and the predicted k-band fluxes are systematicallyunderestimated at z&gt;0.5. unless these discrepancies result from an incorrecttreatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicteddensity of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would pointto more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in thesimulations. the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonablywell the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although noneof them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts.

0911.1126	the build-up of the hubble sequence in the cosmos field	we use ~8,600 &gt;5e10 msol cosmos galaxies to study how the morphological mixof massive ellipticals, bulge-dominated disks, intermediate-bulge disks,bulge-less disks and irregular galaxies evolves from z=0.2 to z=1. themorphological evolution depends strongly on mass. at m&gt;3e11 msol, no evolutionis detected in the morphological mix: ellipticals dominate since z=1, and thehubble sequence has quantitatively settled down by this epoch. at the 1e11 msolmass scale, little evolution is detected, which can be entirely explained withmajor mergers. most of the morphological evolution from z=1 to z=0.2 takesplace at masses 5e10 - 1e11 msol, where: (i) the fraction of spiralssubstantially drops and the contribution of early-types increases. thisincrease is mostly produced by the growth of bulge-dominated disks, which varytheir contribution from ~10% at z=1 to &gt;30% at z=0.2 (cf. the ellipticalfraction grows from ~15% to ~20%). thus, at these masses, transformations fromlate- to early-types result in disk-less elliptical morphologies with astatistical frequency of only 30% - 40%. otherwise, the processes which areresponsible for the transformations either retain or produce a non-negligibledisk component. (ii) the bulge-less disk galaxies, which contribute ~15% to theintermediate-mass galaxy population at z=1, virtually disappear by z=0.2. themerger rate since z=1 is too low to account for the disappearance of thesemassive bulge-less disks, which most likely grow a bulge via secular evolution.

1001.1736	bars in early- and late-type disks in cosmos	we investigate the (large-scale) bar fraction in a mass-complete sample of m&gt; 10^10.5 msun disk galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 in the cosmos field. the fractionof barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific starformation rate (ssfr). at intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun)the bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by afactor ~2, than that in late-type disks. this trend is reversed at higherstellar mass (m &gt; 10^11 msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disksbecomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.the bar fractions for galaxies with low and high ssfrs closely follow those ofthe morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,respectively. this indicates a close correspondence between morphology and ssfrin disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. interestingly, the total bar fractionin 10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over theredshift interval explored, while for m &gt; 10^11 msun disks it remains roughlyconstant. this indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphologicaltransformations in the most massive disk galaxies have largely converged to thefamiliar hubble sequence that we observe in the local universe, while forintermediate mass disks this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2.moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limitedsamples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. finally, theevolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on thelarge-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probedwith the available photometric redshifts).

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1008.0805	mid-infrared galaxy morphology from the spitzer survey of stellar  structure in galaxies (s^4g): the imprint of the de vaucouleurs revised  hubble-sandage classification system at 3.6 microns	spitzer space telescope infrared array camera (irac) imaging provides anopportunity to study all known morphological types of galaxies in the mid-ir ata depth significantly better than ground-based near-infrared and opticalimages. the goal of this study is to examine the imprint of the de vaucouleursclassification volume in the 3.6 micron band, which is the best spitzerwaveband for galactic stellar mass morphology owing to its depth and itsreddening-free sensitivity mainly to older stars. for this purpose, we haveprepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the spitzer archive, mostof which are formally part of the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s^4g), a spitzer post-cryogenic ("warm") mission exploration sciencelegacy program survey of 2,331 galaxies closer than 40 mpc. for the purposes ofmorphology, the galaxies are interpreted as if the images are {\it blue light},the historical waveband for classical galaxy classification studies. we findthat 3.6 micron classifications are well-correlated with blue-lightclassifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxieslook very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. drasticdifferences are found only for the most dusty galaxies. consistent with aprevious study by eskridge et al. (2002), the main difference between bluelight and mid-ir types is an approximately 1 stage interval difference for s0/ato sbc or sc galaxies, which tend to appear "earlier" in type at 3.6 micronsdue to the slightly increased prominence of the bulge, the reduced effects ofextinction, and the reduced (but not completely eliminated) effect of theextreme population i stellar component. we present an atlas of all of the 207galaxies analyzed here, and bring attention to special features or galaxy typesthat are particularly distinctive in the mid-ir.

1008.2932	decomposing star formation and active galactic nucleus with spitzer  mid-infrared spectra: luminosity functions and co-evolution	we present spitzer 7-38um spectra for a 24um flux limited sample of galaxiesat z~0.7 in the cosmos field. the detailed high-quality spectra allow us tocleanly separate star formation (sf) and active galactic nucleus (agn) inindividual galaxies. we first decompose mid-infrared luminosity functions(lfs). we find that the sf 8um and 15um lfs are well described by schechterfunctions. agns dominate the space density at high luminosities, which leads tothe shallow bright-end slope of the overall mid-infrared lfs. the totalinfrared (8-1000um) lf from 70um selected galaxies shows a shallower bright-endslope than the bolometrically corrected sf 15um lf, owing to the intrinsicdispersion in the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions. we thenstudy the contemporary growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes(bhs). seven of the 31 luminous infrared galaxies with spitzer spectra hostluminous agns, implying an agn duty cycle of 23+/-9%. the time-averaged ratioof bh accretion rate and sf rate matches the local m_bh-m_bulge relation andthe m_bh-m_host relation at z ~ 1. these results favor co-evolution scenariosin which bh growth and intense sf happen in the same event but the former spansa shorter lifetime than the latter. finally, we compare our mid-infraredspectroscopic selection with other agn identification methods and discusscandidate compton-thick agns in the sample. while only half of the mid-infraredspectroscopically selected agns are detected in x-ray, ~90% of them can beidentified with their near-infrared spectral indices.

1203.5542	quest for cosmos submillimeter galaxy counterparts using carma and vla:  identifying three high-redshift starburst galaxies	we report on interferometric observations at 1.3 mm at 2"-3" resolution usingthe combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma). weidentify multi-wavelength counterparts of three submillimeter galaxies (smgs;f(1mm)&gt;5.5 mjy) in the cosmos field, initially detected with mambo and aztecbolometers at low, ~10"-30", resolution. all three sources -- aztec/c1, cosbo-3and cosbo-8 -- are identified to coincide with positions of 20 cm radiosources. cosbo-3, however, is not associated with the most likely radiocounterpart, closest to the mambo source position, but that further away fromit. this illustrates the need for intermediate-resolution (~2") mm-observationsto identify the correct counterparts of single-dish detected smgs. all of ourthree sources become prominent only at nir wavelengths, and their mm-to-radioflux based redshifts suggest that they lie at redshifts z&gt;~2. as a proof ofconcept, we show that photometric redshifts can be well determined for smgs,and we find photometric-redshifts of 5.6+/-1.2, 1.9+0.9(-0.5), and ~4 foraztec/c1, cosbo-3, and cosbo-8, respectively. using these we infer that thesegalaxies have radio-based star formation rates of &gt;~1000 msol/yr, and irluminosities of ~10^13 lsol consistent with properties of high-redshift smgs.in summary, our sources reflect a variety of smg properties in terms ofredshift and clustering, consistent with the framework that smgs areprogenitors of z~2 and today's passive galaxies.

(inpreparation) and fitted them with ellipses. we found the orientation of bars bystudying the galaxy ellipse fits from s4g's pipeline 4. we used the galaxyorientation data obtained by s4g's pipeline 4 to obtain intrinsic ellipticitiesand orientations of rings and the bars.  arrakis contains data on 724 ringed galaxies in the s4g. the frequency ofresonance rings in the s4g is of 16+-1% and 35+-1% for outer and innerfeatures, respectively. outer rings are mostly found in hubble stages -1&lt;=t&lt;=4.inner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1&lt;=t&lt;=7. weconfirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel andperpendicular to the bar. we confirm a tendency for inner rings to be orientedparallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of themhave random orientations with respect to the bar. these misaligned inner ringsare mostly found in late-type galaxies (t&gt;=4). this may be due to spiral modesdecoupled from the bar dominating the fourier amplitude spectrum at the radiusof the inner ring.  we find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies. the fact that rings are onlymildly favoured by bars suggests that those in unbarred galaxies either formeddue to weak departures from the axisymmetry of the galactic potential or thatthey are born because of bars that have been destroyed after the ringformation.

1401.1510	sub-millimeter galaxies as progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies	three billion years after the big bang (at redshift z=2), half of the mostmassive galaxies were already old, quiescent systems with little to no residualstar formation and extremely compact with stellar mass densities at least anorder of magnitude larger than in low redshift ellipticals, their descendants.little is known about how they formed, but their evolved, dense stellarpopulations suggest formation within intense, compact starbursts 1-2 gyrearlier (at 3&lt;z&lt;6). simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give riseto such starbursts which produce dense remnants. sub-millimeter selectedgalaxies (smgs) are prime examples of intense, gas-rich, starbursts. with anew, representative spectroscopic sample of compact quiescent galaxies at z=2and a statistically well-understood sample of smgs, we show that z=3-6 smgs areconsistent with being the progenitors of z=2 quiescent galaxies, matching theirformation redshifts and their distributions of sizes, stellar masses andinternal velocities. assuming an evolutionary connection, their space densitiesalso match if the mean duty cycle of smg starbursts is 42 (+40/-29) myr(consistent with independent estimates), which indicates that the bulk of starsin these massive galaxies were formed in a major, early surge ofstar-formation. these results suggests a coherent picture of the formationhistory of the most massive galaxies in the universe, from their initial burstof violent star-formation through their appearance as high stellar-densitygalaxy cores and to their ultimate fate as giant ellipticals.

1401.2987	the evolution of ism mass probed by dust emission -- alma observations  at z = 0.3 to 2	the use of submm dust continuum emission to probe the mass of interstellardust and gas in galaxies is empirically calibrated using samples of local starforming galaxies, planck observations of the milky way and high redshift submmgalaxies (smgs). all of these objects suggest a similar calibration, stronglysupporting the view that the rayleigh-jeans (rj) tail of the dust emission canbe used as an accurate and very fast probe of the ism in galaxies. we presentalma cycle 0 observations of the band 7 (350 ghz) dust emission in 107 galaxiesfrom z = 0.2 to 2.5. three samples of galaxies with a total of 101 galaxieswere stellar mass-selected from cosmos to have $m_* \simeq10^{11}$\msun: 37 atz$\sim0.4$, 33 at z$\sim0.9$ and 31 at z$=2$. a fourth sample with 6 irluminous galaxies at z = 2 was observed for comparison with the purelymass-selected samples. from the fluxes detected in the stacked images for eachsample, we find that the ism content has decreased a factor $\sim 6$ from $1 -2 \times 10^{10}$\msun at both z = 2 and 0.9 down to $\sim 2 \times 10^9$\msunat z = 0.4. the ir luminous sample at z = 2 shows a further $\sim 4$ timesincrease in m$_{ism}$ compared to the equivalent non-ir bright sample at thesame redshift. the gas mass fractions are $\sim 2\pm0.5, 12\pm3, 14\pm2~\rm{and} ~53\pm3$ $%$ for the four subsamples (z = 0.4, 0.9, 2 and ir brightgalaxies).

1402.6315	the baryonic tully-fisher relationship for s$^4$g galaxies and the  "condensed" baryon fraction of galaxies	we combine data from the spitzer survey for stellar structure in galaxies(s$^4$g), a recently calibrated empirical stellar mass estimator from eskew etal., and an extensive database of hi spectral line profiles to examine thebaryonic tully-fisher (btf) relation. we find 1) that the btf has lower scatterthan the classic tully-fisher (tf) relation and is better described as a linearrelationship, confirming similar previous results, 2) that the inclusion of aradial scale in the btf decreases the scatter but only modestly, as seenpreviously for the tf relation, and 3) that the slope of the btf, which we findto be $3.5\pm 0.2$ ($\delta$ log $m_{baryon}/\delta$ log $v_c$), implies thaton average a nearly constant fraction ($\sim 0.4$) of all baryons expected tobe in a halo are "condensed" onto the central region of rotationally supportedgalaxies. the condensed baryon fraction, $m_{baryon}/m_{total}$, is, to ourmeasurement precision, nearly independent of galaxy circular velocity (oursample spans circular velocities, $v_c$, between 60 and 250 km s$^{-1}$, but isextended to $v_c\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ using data from the literature). theobserved galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in this fraction is generally $\le$ a factorof 2 despite fairly liberal selection criteria. these results imply thatcooling and heating processes, such as cold vs. hot accretion, mass loss due tostellar winds, and agn driven feedback, to the degree that they affect theglobal galactic properties involved in the btf, are independent of halo massfor galaxies with $10 &lt; v_c &lt; 250$ km/s and typically introduce no more than afactor of two range in the resulting $m_{baryon}/m_{total}$. recent simulationsby aumer et al. of a small sample of disk galaxies are in excellent agreementwith our data, suggesting that current simulations are capable of reproducingthe global properties of individual disk galaxies.

1403.7203	the zcosmos redshift survey: evolution of the light in bulges and discs  since z~0.8	we studied the chronology of galactic bulge and disc formation by analysingthe relative contributions of these components to the b-band rest-frameluminosity density at different epochs. we present the first estimate of theevolution of the fraction of rest-frame b-band light in galactic bulges anddiscs since redshift z~0.8. we performed a bulge-to-disc decomposition ofhst/acs images of 3266 galaxies in the zcosmos-bright survey with spectroscopicredshifts in the range 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 0.9. we find that the fraction of b-band lightin bulges and discs is $(26 \pm 4)%$ and $(74 \pm 4)%$, respectively. whencompared with rest-frame b-band measurements of galaxies in the local universein the same mass range ($10^{9} m_{\odot}\lessapprox m \lessapprox 10^{11.5}m_{\odot}$), we find that the b-band light in discs decreases by ~30% fromz~0.7-0.9 to z~0, while the light from the bulge increases by ~30% over thesame period of time. we interpret this evolution as the consequence of starformation and mass assembly processes, as well as morphological transformation,which gradually shift stars formed at half the age of the universe fromstar-forming late-type/irregular galaxies toearlier types and ultimately intospheroids.

1404.0559	morphology and environment of galaxies with disc breaks in the s4g and  nirs0s	we study the surface brightness profiles of disc galaxies in the 3.6 micronimages from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g) andk_s-band images from the near infrared s0-sa galaxy survey (nirs0s). weparticularly connect properties of single exponential (type i), downbendingdouble exponential (type ii), and upbending double exponential (type iii) discprofile types, to structural components of galaxies by using detailedmorphological classifications, and size measurements of rings and lenses. wealso study how the local environment of the galaxies affects the profile typesby calculating parameters describing the environmental density and the tidalinteraction strength. we find that in majority of type ii profiles the breakradius is connected with structural components such as rings, lenses, andspirals. the exponential disc sections of all three profile types, whenconsidered separately, follow the disc scaling relations. however, the outerdiscs of type ii, and the inner discs of type iii, are similar in scalelengthto the single exponential discs. although the different profile types havesimilar mean environmental parameters, the scalelengths of the type iiiprofiles show a positive correlation with the tidal interaction strength.

1406.2327	late-stage galaxy mergers in cosmos to z~1	the role of major mergers in galaxy and black hole formation is not wellconstrained. to help address this, we develop an automated method to identifylate-stage galaxy mergers before coalescence of the galactic cores. theresulting sample of mergers is distinct from those obtained using pair-findingand morphological indicators. our method relies on median-filtering ofhigh-resolution images in order to distinguish two concentrated galaxy nucleiat small separations. using mock images, we derive statistical contaminationand incompleteness corrections for the fraction of late-stage mergers. we applyour new method to a magnitude-limited (i &lt; 23) sample of 44,164 galaxies fromthe cosmos hst/acs catalog. using a mass-complete sample with $\log m_*/m_\odot&gt; 10.6$ and $0.25 &lt; z \leq 1.00$, we find ~5% of systems are late-stage mergerswith separations between 2.2 and 8 kpc. correcting for incompleteness andcontamination, the fractional merger rate increases strongly with redshift as$(1+z)^{3.8\pm0.9}$, in agreement with earlier studies and with dark matterhalo merger rates. separating the sample into star-forming and quiescentgalaxies shows that the merger rate for star-forming galaxies increasesstrongly redshift, $(1+z)^{4.5\pm1.3}$, while the merger rate for quiescentgalaxies is consistent with no evolution, $(1+z)^{1.1\pm1.2}$. limiting oursample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from zcosmos, we find that thestar formation rates and x-ray selected agn activity in likely late-stagemergers are enhanced by factors of ~2 relative to a control sample. combiningour sample with more widely separated pairs, we find that $8\pm5\%$ of starformation and $20\pm8\%$ of agn activity is triggered by close encounters (&lt;143kpc) or mergers, once more suggesting that major mergers are not the onlychannels for star formation and black hole growth.

1408.5922	spectral calibration in the mid-infrared: challenges and solutions	we present spectra obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope of 33 k giants and 20 a dwarfs to assess theirsuitability as spectrophotometric standard stars. the k giants confirm previousfindings that the strength of the sio absorption band at 8 um increases forboth later optical spectral classes and redder (b-v)_0 colors, but withconsiderable scatter. for k giants, the synthetic spectra underpredict thestrengths of the molecular bands from sio and oh. for these reasons, theassumed true spectra for k giants should be based on neither the assumptionthat molecular band strengths in the infrared can be predicted accurately fromoptical spectral class or color nor synthetric spectra. the oh bands in kgiants grow stronger with cooler stellar temperatures, and they are strongerthan predicted by synthetic spectra. as a group, a dwarfs are better behavedand more predictable than the k giants, but they are more likely to show redexcesses from debris disks. no suitable a dwarfs were located in parts of thesky continuously observable from spitzer, and with previous means of estimatingthe true spectra of k giants ruled out, it was necessary to use models of adwarfs to calibrate spectra of k giants from observed spectral ratios of thetwo groups and then use the calibrated k giants as standards for the fulldatabase of infrared spectra from spitzer. we also describe a lingeringartifact that affects the spectra of faint blue sources at 24 um.

1410.0009	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): precise  stellar mass distributions from automated dust correction at 3.6 microns	the mid-infrared is an optimal window to trace stellar mass in nearbygalaxies and the 3.6$\mu m$ irac band has been exploited to this effect, butsuch mass estimates can be biased by dust emission. we present our pipeline toreveal the old stellar flux at 3.6$\mu m$ and obtain stellar mass maps for morethan 1600 galaxies available from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s$^{4}$g). this survey consists of images in two infrared bands (3.6and 4.5$\mu m$), and we use the independent component analysis (ica) methodpresented in meidt et al. (2012) to separate the dominant light from old starsand the dust emission that can significantly contribute to the observed 3.6$\mum$ flux. we exclude from our ica analysis galaxies with low signal-to-noiseratio (s/n &lt; 10) and those with original [3.6]-[4.5] colors compatible with anold stellar population, indicative of little dust emission (mostly early hubbletypes, which can directly provide good mass maps). for the remaining 1251galaxies to which ica was successfully applied, we find that as much as 10-30%of the total light at 3.6$\mu m$ typically originates from dust, and locally itcan reach even higher values. this contamination fraction shows a correlationwith specific star formation rates, confirming that the dust emission that wedetect is related to star formation. additionally, we have used our largesample of mass estimates to calibrate a relationship of effective mass-to-lightratio ($m/l$) as a function of observed [3.6]-[4.5] color: $\log(m/l)=-0.339(\pm 0.057) \times ([3.6]-[4.5]) -0.336 (\pm 0.002)$. our final pipelineproducts have been made public through irsa, providing the astronomicalcommunity with an unprecedentedly large set of stellar mass maps ready to usefor scientific applications.

1410.4875	evolution of the specific star formation rate function at z&lt;1.4 -  dissecting the mass-sfr plane in cosmos and goods	the relation between the stellar mass and the star formation ratecharacterizes how the instantaneous star formation is determined by the galaxypast star formation history and by the growth of the dark matter structures. wedeconstruct the m-sfr plane by measuring the specific sfr functions in severalstellar mass bins from z=0.2 out to z=1.4. our analysis is primary based on amips 24$\mu m$ selected catalogue combining the cosmos and goods surveys. weestimate the sfr by combining mid- and far-infrared data for 20500 galaxies.the ssfr functions are derived in four stellar mass bins within the range9.5&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5. first, we demonstrate the importance of taking intoaccount selection effects when studying the m-sfr relation. secondly, we find amass-dependent evolution of the median ssfr with redshift varying as $ssfr\propto (1+z)^{b}$, with $b$ increasing from $b=2.88$ to $b=3.78$ between$m=10^{9.75}msun$ and $m=10^{11.1}msun$, respectively. at low masses, thisevolution is consistent with the cosmological accretion rate and predictionsfrom semi-analytical models (sam). this agreement breaks down for more massivegalaxies showing the need for a more comprehensive description of thestar-formation history in massive galaxies. third, we obtain that the shape ofthe ssfr function is invariant with time at z&lt;1.4 but depends on the mass. weobserve a broadening of the ssfr function ranging from 0.28 dex at$m=10^{9.75}msun$ to 0.46 dex at $m=10^{11.1}msun$. such increase in thescatter of the m-sfr relation suggests an increasing diversity of sfhs as thestellar mass increases. finally, we find a gradual decline of the ssfr withmass as $log(ssfr) \propto -0.17m$. we discuss the numerous physical processes,as gas exhaustion in hot gas halos or secular evolution, which can graduallyreduce the ssfr and increase the sfh diversity.

1412.3799	physical properties of z&gt;4 submillimeter galaxies in the cosmos field	we study the physical properties of a sample of 6 smgs in the cosmos field,spectroscopically confirmed to lie at z&gt;4. we use new gmrt 325 mhz and 3 ghzjvla data to probe the rest-frame 1.4 ghz emission at z=4, and to estimate thesizes of the star-forming (sf) regions of these sources, resp. combining oursize estimates with those available in the literature for aztec1 and aztec3 weinfer a median radio-emitting size for our z&gt;4 smgs of(0.63"+/-0.12")x(0.35"+/-0.05") or 4.1x2.3 kpc^2 (major times minor axis;assuming z=4.5) or lower if we take the two marginally resolved smgs asunresolved. this is consistent with the sizes of sf regions in lower-redshiftsmgs, and local normal galaxies, yet higher than the sizes of sf regions oflocal ulirgs. our smg sample consists of a fair mix of compact and more clumpysystems with multiple, perhaps merging, components. with an average formationtime of ~280 myr, derived through modeling of the uv-ir seds, the studied smgsare young systems. the average stellar mass, dust temperature, and irluminosity we derive are m*~1.4x10^11 m_sun, t_dust~43 k, andl_ir~1.3x10^13l_sun, resp. the average l_ir is up to an order of magnitudehigher than for smgs at lower redshifts. our smgs follow the correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity as derived for herschel-selected0.1&lt;z&lt;2 galaxies. we study the ir-radio correlation for our sources and find adeviation from that derived for z&lt;3 ulirgs (&lt;q_ir&gt;=1.95+/-0.26 for our sample,compared to q~2.6 for ir luminous galaxies at z&lt;2). in summary, we find thatthe physical properties derived for our z&gt;4 smgs put them at the high end ofthe l_ir-t_dust distribution of smgs, and that our smgs form a morphologicallyheterogeneous sample. thus, further in-depth analyses of large, statisticalsamples of high-redshift smgs are needed to fully understand their role ingalaxy formation and evolution.

1502.00640	alma constraints on the faint millimetre source number counts and their  contribution to the cosmic infrared background	we have analysed 18 alma continuum maps in bands 6 and 7, with rms down to7.8$\mu$jy, to derive differential number counts down to 60$\mu$jy and100$\mu$jy at $\lambda=$1.3 mm and $\lambda=$1.1 mm, respectively. the areacovered by the combined fields is $\rm 9.5\times10^{-4}deg^2$ at 1.1mm and $\rm6.6\times10^{-4}deg^{2}$ at 1.3mm. we improved the source extraction method byrequiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with thebeam size. this method enabled us to remove spurious detections that haveplagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. we detected 50 faintsources with s/n$&gt;$3.5 down to 60$\mu$jy, hence improving the statistics by afactor of four relative to previous studies. the inferred differential numbercounts are $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.1 mm flux $s_{\lambda= 1.1~mm} = 130~\mu$jy, and $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1.1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.3mm flux $\rm s_{\lambda = 1.3~mm} = 60~\mu$jy. at the faintest flux limits,i.e. 30$\mu$jy and 40$\mu$jy, we obtain upper limits on the differential numbercounts of $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s) &lt; 7\times10^5~deg^2$ and $\rmdn/d(log_{10}s)&lt;3\times10^5~deg^2$, respectively. our results provide a newlower limit to cib intensity of 17.2${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.1mm and of12.9${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. moreover, the flattening of the integratednumber counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close tothe cib intensity. our data imply that galaxies with sfr$&lt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$certainly contribute less than 50% to the cib while more than 50% of the cibmust be produced by galaxies with $\rm sfr&gt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$. the differentialnumber counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. consequently, this supportsthe galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.

1503.06477	the physical conditions in a pre super star cluster molecular cloud in  the antennae galaxies	we present an analysis of the physical conditions in an extreme molecularcloud in the antennae merging galaxies. this cloud has properties consistantwith those required to form a globular cluster. we have obtained alma co and870$\mu$m observations of the antennae galaxy system with $\sim 0".5$resolution. this cloud stands out in the data with a radius of $\lesssim 24$~pcand mass of $&gt;5\times 10^6$~m$_\odot$. the cloud appears capable of forming aglobular cluster, but the lack of associated thermal radio emission indicatesthat star formation has not yet altered the environment. the lack of thermalradio emission places the cloud in an early stage of evolution, which we expectto be short-lived ($\lesssim 1$~myr) and thus rare. given its mass and kineticenergy, for the cloud to be confined (as its appearance strongly suggests) itmust be subject to an external pressure of p/$k_b \gtrsim 10^8$~k~cm$^{-3}$ --10,000 times higher than typical interstellar pressure. this would supporttheories that high pressures are required to form globular clusters and mayexplain why extreme environments like the antennae are preferred environmentsfor generating such objects. given the cloud temperature of $\sim 25$~k, theinternal pressure must be dominated by non-thermal processes, most likelyturbulence. we expect the molecular cloud to collapse and begin star formationin $\lesssim 1$~myr.

astro-ph;0308188	millimeter observations of grb 030329: continued evidence for a  two-component jet	we present the results of a dedicated campaign on the afterglow of grb 030329with the millimeter interferometers of the owens valley radio observatory(ovro), the berkeley-illinois-maryland association (bima), and with the mambo-2bolometer array on the iram 30-m telescope. these observations allow us totrace the full evolution of the afterglow of grb 030329 at frequencies of 100ghz and 250 ghz for the first time. the millimeter light curves exhibit twomain features: a bright, constant flux density portion and a steep power-lawdecline. the absence of bright, short-lived millimeter emission is used to showthat the grb central engine was not actively injecting energy well after theburst. the millimeter data support a model, advocated by berger et al., of atwo-component jet-like outflow in which a narrow angle jet is responsible forthe high energy emission and early optical afterglow, and a wide-angle jetcarrying most of the energy is powering the radio and late optical afterglowemission

astro-ph;0407322	using bars as signposts of galaxy evolution at high and low redshifts	an analysis of the nicmos deep field shows that there is no evidence of adecline in the bar fraction beyond z~0.7, as previously claimed; bothbandshifting and spatial resolution must be taken into account when evaluatingthe evolution of the bar fraction. two main caveats of this study were a lackof a proper comparison sample at low redshifts and a larger number of galaxiesat high redshifts. we address these caveats using two new studies. for a properlocal sample, we have analyzed 134 spirals in the near-infrared using 2mass(main results presented by menendez-delmestre in this volume) which serves asan ideal anchor for the low-redshift universe. in addition to measuring themean bar properties, we find that bar size is correlated with galaxy size andbrightness, but the bar ellipticity is not correlated with these galaxyproperties. the bar length is not correlated with the bar ellipticity. forlarger high redshift samples we analyze the bar fraction from the 2-squaredegree cosmos acs survey. we find that the bar fraction at z~0.7 is ~50%,consistent with our earlier finding of no decline in bar fraction at highredshifts.

astro-ph;0507645	infrared spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) is carrying out acomprehensive multi-wavelength survey on a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. the1-850um spectral energy distributions are presented using broadband imagingdata from spitzer, 2mass, iso, iras, and scuba. the infrared colors derivedfrom the globally-integrated spitzer data are generally consistent with theprevious generation of models that were developed based on global data fornormal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailedinvestigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for variouslocations within the three large, nearby galaxies ngc3031 (m81), ngc5194 (m51),and ngc7331. strong correlations exist between the local star formation rateand the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local starformation activity level. preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colorswithin ngc3031, ngc5194, and ngc7331. if the galaxy-to-galaxy variations inspectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of therange present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infraredluminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24um flux will beuncertain at the factor-of-five level (total range). the correspondinguncertainties using the redshifted 8.0um flux (e.g. observed 24um flux for az=2 source) are factors of 10-20. considerable caution should be used wheninterpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities.

astro-ph;0604267	the opaque nascent starburst in ngc 1377: spitzer sings observations	we analyze extensive data on ngc1377 from the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). within the category of nascent starbursts, that wepreviously selected by their infrared to radio continuum ratios in large excessof the average and their hot dust, ngc1377 has the largest infrared excess yetmeasured. optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of arecent accretion event. infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaquesource dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micronsilicate band). we provide physical evidence against non-stellar activity beingthe heating source. hii regions are detected through the single [neii] line,probing &lt;1% of the ionizing radiation. not only is the optical depth very high,but &gt;85% of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. the only other detectedemission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excited mainly byshocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. the newobservations support our interpretation in terms of an extremely youngstarburst (&lt;1 myr). more generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron arelikely observed within a few myr of the onset of a starburst and after a longquiescence, prior to the replenishment of the ism with cosmic rays. the similarinfrared-radio properties of ngc1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxiessuggest that ngc1377 constitutes an archetype to better understand starburstevolution. although rare locally because observed in a brief evolutionarystage, nascent starbursts may represent a non-negligible fraction ofmerger-induced starbursts dominating deep infrared counts. since they differdramatically from usual starburst templates, they bear important consequencesfor the interpretation of deep surveys.

astro-ph;0609042	the evolution of the number density of large disk galaxies in cosmos	we study a sample of approximately 16,500 galaxies with i_ab &lt;= 22.5 in thecosmos field. structural information on the galaxies is derived by fittingsingle sersic models to their two-dimensional surface brightness distributions.we investigate the evolution of the number density of disk galaxies larger than5 kpc between redshift z~1 and the present epoch. to this end, we use themeasurements of the half-light radii to construct, as a function of redshift,the size function of both the total disk galaxy population and of disk galaxiessplit in four bins of bulge-to-disk ratio. furthermore, we use a selectedsample of roughly 1800 sdss galaxies to calibrate our results with respect tothe local universe. we find that: (i) the number density of disk galaxies withintermediate sizes (r_{1/2}~5-7 kpc) remains nearly constant from z~1 to today.(ii) the number density of the largest disks (r_{1/2}&gt;7 kpc) decreases by afactor of about two out to z~1. (iii) there is a constancy in the numberdensity of large bulgeless disks out to z~1; the deficit of large disks atearly epochs seems to arise from a smaller number of bulged disks. our resultsindicate that the bulk of the large disk galaxy population has completed itsgrowth by z~1, and support the hypothesis that secular evolution processesproduce - or at least add stellar mass to - the bulge components of diskgalaxies.
