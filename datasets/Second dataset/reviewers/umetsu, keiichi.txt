0902.2437	amiba: system performance	the y.t. lee array for microwave background anisotropy (amiba) startedscientific operation in early 2007. this work describes the optimization of thesystem performance for the measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect forsix massive galaxy clusters at redshifts $0.09 - 0.32$. we achieved a pointsource sensitivity of $63\pm 7$ mjy with the seven 0.6m dishes in 1 hour ofon-source integration in 2-patch differencing observations. we measured andcompensated for the delays between the antennas of our platform-mountedinterferometer. beam switching was used to cancel instrumental instabilitiesand ground pick up. total power and phase stability were good on time scales ofhours, and the system was shown to integrate down on equivalent timescales of300 hours per baseline/correlation, or about 10 hours for the entire array.while the broadband correlator leads to good sensitivity, the small number oflags in the correlator resulted in poorly measured bandpass response. wecorrected for this by using external calibrators (jupiter and saturn). usingjupiter as the flux standard, we measured the disk brightness temperature ofsaturn to be $149^{+5}_{-12}$ k.

0902.3971	new multiply-lensed galaxies identified in acs/nic3 observations of  cl0024+1654 using an improved mass model	we present an improved strong-lensing analysis of cl0024+1654 ($z$=0.39)using deep hst/acs/nic3 images, based on 33 multiply-lensed images of 11background galaxies. these are found with a model that assumes massapproximately traces light, with a low order expansion to allow for flexibilityon large scales. the model is constrained initially by the well known 5-imagesystem ($z$=1.675) and refined as new multiply-lensed systems are identifiedusing the model. photometric redshifts of these new systems are then used toconstrain better the mass profile by adopting the standard cosmologicalrelation between redshift and lensing distance. our model requires only 6 freeparameters to describe well all positional and redshift data. the resultinginner mass profile has a slope of $d\log m/d\log r\simeq -0.55$, consistentwith new weak-lensing measurements where the data overlap, at $r\simeq200$kpc/$h_{70}$. the combined profile is well fitted by a high concentration nfwmass profile, $c_{\rm vir}\sim 8.6\pm1.6$, similar to other well studiedclusters, but larger than predicted with standard $\lambda$cdm. a well definedradial critical curve is generated by the model and is clearly observed at $r\simeq 12\arcsec$, outlined by elongated images pointing towards the centre ofmass. the relative fluxes of the multiply-lensed images are found to agree wellwith the modelled magnifications, providing an independent consistency check.

0903.1103	locuss: subaru weak lensing study of 30 galaxy clusters	(abridged) we use subaru data to conduct a detailed weak-lensing study of thedark matter distribution in a sample of 30 x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3. a weak-lensing signal is detected at high statistical significancein each cluster, the total detection s/n ranging from 5 to 13. in this paper weconcentrate on fitting spherical models to the tangential distortion profilesof the clusters. when the models are fitted to the clusters individually, weare unable to discriminate statistically between sis and nfw models. howeverwhen the tangential distortion profiles of the individual clusters arecombined, and models fitted to the stacked profile, the sis model is rejectedat 6- and 11-sigma, respectively, for low- and high-mass bins. we also use theindividual cluster nfw model fits to investigate the relationship betweencluster mass (m_vir) and concentration (c_vir), finding an anti-correlation ofc_vir and m_vir. the best-fit c_vir-m_vir relation is: c_vir(m_vir) proptom_vir^{-alpha} with alpha=0.41+/-0.19 -- i.e. a non-zero slope is detected at2sigma significance. we then investigate the optimal radius within which tomeasure cluster mass, finding that the typical fractional errors are improvedto sigma(m_delta)/m_delta ~ 0.1-0.2 for cluster masses at higher over-densitiesdelta=500-2000, from 0.2-0.3 for the virial over-density (~110). furthercomparisons between mass measurements based on spherical model fitting and themodel-independent aperture mass method reveal that the 2d aperture massenclosed within a cylinder of a given aperture radius is systematically greaterthan the 3d spherical mass obtained from nfw model fitting: m_2d/m_3d= 1.34 and1.40 for delta=500 and 110, respectively. the amplitude of this effect agreeswell with that predicted by integrating the nfw model along the line-of-sight.

0908.0069	the mass structure of the galaxy cluster cl0024+1654 from a full lensing  analysis of joint subaru and acs/nic3 observations	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the rich galaxy clustercl0024+1654 (z=0.395) based on deep subaru br_{c}z' imaging and our recentcomprehensive strong lensing analysis of hst/acs/nic3 observations. we obtainthe weak lensing distortion and magnification of undilted samples of red andblue background galaxies by carefully combining all color and positionalinformation. unlike previous work, the weak and strong lensing are in excellentagreement where the data overlap. the joint mass profile continuously steepensout to the virial radius with only a minor contribution \sim 10% in the massfrom known subcluster at a projected distance of \sim 700kpc/h. the projectedmass distribution for the entire cluster is well fitted with a singlenavarro-frenk-white model with a virial mass, m_{vir} = (1.2 \pm 0.2) \times10^{15} m_{sun}/h, and a concentration, c_{vir} = 9.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}. this modelfit is fully consistent with the depletion of the red background counts,providing independent confirmation. careful examination and interpretation ofx-ray and dynamical data strongly suggest that this cluster system is in a postcollision state, which we show is consistent with our well-defined mass profilefor a major merger occurring along the line of sight, viewed approximately2-3gyr after impact when the gravitational potential has had time to relax inthe center, before the gas has recovered and before the outskirts are fullyvirialized. finally, our full lensing analysis provides a model-independentconstraint of m_{2d}(&lt;r_{vir}) = (1.4 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h for theprojected mass of the whole system, including any currently unbound materialbeyond the virial radius, which can constrain the sum of the two pre-mergercluster masses when designing simulations to explore this system.

1002.4811	suzaku observation of abell 1689: anisotropic temperature and entropy  distributions associated with the large-scale structure	(abridged) we present results of suzaku observations of the intraclustermedium (icm) in abell 1689, combined with complementary analysis of the sdssdata and weak and strong lensing analysis of subaru/suprime-cam and hst/acsobservations. faint x-ray emission from the icm around the virial radius isdetected at 4.0 sigma significance. we find anisotropic gas temperature andentropy distributions in cluster outskirts correlated with large-scalestructure of galaxies. the high temperature and entropy region in thenortheastern (ne) outskirts is connected to an overdense filamentary structure.the outskirt regions in contact with low density void environments have low gastemperatures and entropies, deviating from hydrostatic equilibrium. theseresults suggest that thermalization of the icm occurs faster along thefilamentary structures than the void regions. a joint x-ray and lensinganalysis shows that the hydrostatic mass is $\sim60-90%$ of spherical lensingone but comparable to a triaxial halo mass within errors in $0.6r_{2500} \simltr \simlt 0.8r_{500}$, and that it is significantly biased as low as $\simlt60%$within $0.4r_{2500}$, irrespective of mass models. the thermal gas pressurewithin $r_{500}$ is, at most, $\sim50$--60% of the total pressure to balancefully the gravity of the spherical lensing mass, and $\sim30$--40% around thevirial radius. although these constitute lower limits when one considers thepossible halo triaxiality, these small relative contributions of thermalpressure would require additional sources of pressure, such as bulk and/orturbulent motions.

1007.3816	locuss: calibrating mass-observable scaling relations for cluster  cosmology with subaru weak lensing observations	we present a joint weak-lensing/x-ray study of galaxy cluster mass-observablescaling relations, motivated by the critical importance of accurate calibrationof mass proxies for future x-ray missions, including erosita. we use a sampleof 12 clusters at z\simeq0.2 that we have observed with subaru and xmm-newtonto construct relationships between the weak-lensing mass (m), and three x-rayobservables: gas temperature (t), gas mass (mgas), and quasi-integrated gaspressure (yx) at overdensities of \delta=2500, 1000, and 500 with respect tothe critical density. we find that mgas at \delta\le1000 appears to be the mostpromising mass proxy of the three, because it has the lowest intrinsic scatterin mass at fixed observable: \sigma_lnm\simeq0.1, independent of clusterdynamical state. the scatter in mass at fixed t and yx is a factor of \sim2-3larger than at fixed mgas, which are indicative of the structural segregationthat we find in the m-t and m-yx relationships. undisturbed clusters are foundto be \sim40% and \sim20% more massive than disturbed clusters at fixed t andyx respectively at \sim2\sigma significance. in particular, a1914 - awell-known merging cluster - significantly increases the scatter and lowers thethe normalization of the relation for disturbed clusters. we also investigatedthe covariance between intrinsic scatter in m-mgas and m-t relations, findingthat they are positively correlated. this contradicts the adaptive meshrefinement simulations that motivated the idea that yx may be a low scattermass proxy, and agrees with more recent smoothed particle hydrodynamicsimulations based on the millennium simulation. we also propose a method toidentify a robust mass proxy based on principal component analysis. thestatistical precision of our results are limited by the small sample size andthe presence of the extreme merging cluster in our sample.

1009.1943	constraining intra-cluster gas models with amiba13	clusters of galaxies have been used extensively to determine cosmologicalparameters. a major difficulty in making best use of sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz)and x-ray observations of clusters for cosmology is that using x-rayobservations it is difficult to measure the temperature distribution andtherefore determine the density distribution in individual clusters of galaxiesout to the virial radius. observations with the new generation of szinstruments are a promising alternative approach. we use clusters of galaxiesdrawn from high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement (amr) cosmologicalsimulations to study how well we should be able to constrain the large-scaledistribution of the intra-cluster gas (icg) in individual massive relaxedclusters using amiba in its configuration with 13 1.2-m diameter dishes(amiba13) along with x-ray observations. we show that non-isothermal betamodels provide a good description of the icg in our simulated relaxed clusters.we use simulated x-ray observations to estimate the quality of constraints onthe distribution of gas density, and simulated sz visibilities (amiba13observations) for constraints on the large-scale temperature distribution ofthe icg. we find that amiba13 visibilities should constrain the scale radius ofthe temperature distribution to about 50% accuracy. we conclude that theupgraded amiba, amiba13, should be a powerful instrument to constrain thelarge-scale distribution of the icg.

1103.0202	triaxiality and non-thermal gas pressure in abell 1689	clusters of galaxies are uniquely important cosmological probes of theevolution of the large scale structure, whose diagnostic power depends quitesignificantly on the ability to reliably determine their masses. clusters aretypically modeled as spherical systems whose intracluster gas is in stricthydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium gas pressure is providedentirely by thermal pressure), with the gravitational field dominated by darkmatter, assumptions that are only rough approximations. in fact, numericalsimulations indicate that galaxy clusters are typically triaxial, rather thanspherical, and that turbulent gas motions (induced during hierarchical mergerevents) provide an appreciable pressure component. extending our previous work,we present results of a joint analysis of x-ray, weak and strong lensingmeasurements of abell 1689. the quality of the data allows us to determine boththe triaxial shape of the cluster and the level of non-thermal pressure that isrequired if the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium. we find thatthe dark matter axis ratios are 1.24 +/- 0.13 and 2.02 +/- 0.01 on the plane ofthe sky and along the line of sight, respectively, and that about 20% of thepressure is non-thermal. our treatment demonstrates that the dynamicalproperties of clusters can be determined in a (mostly) bias-free way, enhancingthe use of clusters as more precise cosmological probes.

1105.0444	a precise cluster mass profile averaged from the highest-quality lensing  data	we outline our methods for obtaining high precision mass profiles, combiningindependent weak-lensing distortion, magnification, and strong-lensingmeasurements. for massive clusters the strong and weak lensing regimescontribute equal logarithmic coverage of the radial profile. the utility ofhigh-quality data is limited by the cosmic noise from large scale structurealong the line of sight. this noise is overcome when stacking clusters, as tooare the effects of cluster asphericity and substructure, permitting a stringenttest of theoretical models. we derive a mean radial mass profile of foursimilar mass clusters of high-quality hst and subaru images, in the ranger=40kpc/h to 2800kpc/h, where the inner radial boundary is sufficiently largeto avoid smoothing from miscentering effects. the stacked mass profile isdetected at 58-sigma significance over the entire radial range, with thecontribution from the cosmic noise included. we show that the projected massprofile has a continuously steepening gradient out to beyond the virial radius,in remarkably good agreement with the standard navarro-frenk-white formpredicted for the family of cdm-dominated halos in gravitational equilibrium.the central slope is constrained to lie in the range,-dln{\rho}/dln{r}=0.89^{+0.27}_{-0.39}. the mean concentration isc_{vir}=7.68^{+0.42}_{-0.40} (at a mean virial mass 1.54^{+0.11}_{-0.10}\times10^{15} m_{sun}/h), which is high for relaxed, high-mass clusters, butconsistent with lcdm when a sizable projection bias estimated from n-bodysimulations is considered. this possible tension will be more definitivelyexplored with new cluster surveys, such as clash, locuss, subaru hsc, andxxm-xxl, to construct the c-m relation over a wider mass range.

1105.2295	the universal einstein radius distribution from 10,000 sdss clusters	we present results from strong-lens modelling of 10,000 sdss clusters, toestablish the universal distribution of einstein radii. detailed lensinganalyses have shown that the inner mass distribution of clusters can beaccurately modelled by assuming light traces mass, successfully uncoveringlarge numbers of multiple-images. approximate critical curves and the effectiveeinstein radius of each cluster can therefore be readily calculated, from thedistribution of member galaxies and scaled by their luminosities. we use asubsample of 10 well-studied clusters covered by both sdss and hst to calibrateand test this method, and show that an accurate determination of the einsteinradius and mass can be achieved by this approach "blindly", in an automatedway, and without requiring multiple images as input. we present the results ofthe first 10,000 clusters analysed in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.55$, and compare themto theoretical expectations. we find that for this all-sky representativesample the einstein radius distribution is log-normal in shape, with $&lt;log(\theta_{e}\arcsec)&gt;=0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$,$\sigma=0.316^{+0.004}_{-0.002}$, and with higher abundance of large$\theta_{e}$ clusters than predicted by $\lambda$cdm. we visually inspect eachof the clusters with $\theta_{e}&gt;40 \arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) and find that$\sim20%$ are boosted by various projection effects detailed here, remainingwith $\sim40$ real giant-lens candidates, with a maximum of $\theta_{e}=69\pm12\arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) for the most massive candidate, in agreement withsemi-analytic calculations. the results of this work should be verified furtherwhen an extended calibration sample is available.

1201.1616	clash: precise new constraints on the mass profile of abell 2261	we precisely constrain the inner mass profile of abell 2261 (z=0.225) for thefirst time and determine this cluster is not "over-concentrated" as foundpreviously, implying a formation time in agreement with {\lambda}cdmexpectations. these results are based on strong lensing analyses of new 16-bandhst imaging obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). combining this with revised weak lensing analyses of subaruwide field imaging with 5-band subaru + kpno photometry, we place tight newconstraints on the halo virial mass m_vir = 2.2\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70(within r \approx 3 mpc/h70) and concentration c = 6.2 \pm 0.3 when assuming aspherical halo. this agrees broadly with average c(m,z) predictions from recent{\lambda}cdm simulations which span 5 &lt;~ &lt;c&gt; &lt;~ 8. our most significantsystematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight. to estimatethis, we also derive a mass profile based on archival chandra x-rayobservations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile atr2500 ~ 600 kpc. agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axisratio along our line of sight. for this elongated halo model, we find m_vir =1.7\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70 and c_vir = 4.6\pm0.2, placing rough lowerlimits on these values. the need for halo elongation can be partially obviatedby non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors inthe x-ray mass measurements. we estimate the effect of background structuresbased on mmt/hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find these tend to lowermvir further by ~7% and increase cvir by ~5%.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1204.3630	clash: mass distribution in and around macs j1206.2-0847 from a full  cluster lensing analysis	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the galaxy cluster macsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.439) from a combined weak-lensing distortion, magnification,and strong-lensing analysis of wide-field subaru bvriz' imaging and our recent16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) program. we find goodagreement in the regions of overlap between several weak and strong lensingmass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuringconsistency. the subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large scalestructure with the major axis running approximately north-west south-east(nw-se), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showingelongation with a \sim 2:1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. our full-lensingmass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln\sigma/dlnr\sim -1 at clusteroutskirts (r&gt;1mpc/h), whereas the mass distribution excluding the nw-se excessregions steepens further out, well described by the navarro-frenk-white form.assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass m_{vir}=(1.1\pm 0.2\pm0.1)\times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h and a halo concentration c_{vir} = 6.9\pm 1.0\pm1.2 (\sim 5.7 when the central 50kpc/h is excluded), which falls in the range4&lt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;7 of average c(m,z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent lambdacold dark matter simulations. our full lensing results are found to be inagreement with x-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and whencombined with chandra gas mass measurements, yield a cumulative gas massfraction of 13.7^{+4.5}_{-3.0}% at 0.7mpc/h (\approx 1.7r_{2500}), a typicalvalue observed for high mass clusters.

1205.0052	a multi-wavelength study of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in the  triple-merger cluster macs j0717.5+3745 with mustang and bolocam	we present 90, 140, and 268ghz sub-arcminute resolution imaging of thesunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) in macsj0717.5+3745. our 90ghz sze data resultin a sensitive, 34ujy/bm map at 13" resolution using mustang. our 140 and268ghz sze imaging, with resolutions of 58" and 31" and sensitivities of 1.8and 3.3mjy/beam respectively, was obtained using bolocam. we compare these mapsto a 2-dimensional pressure map derived from chandra x-ray observations. ourmustang data confirm previous indications from chandra of a pressureenhancement due to shock-heated, &gt;20kev gas immediately adjacent to extendedradio emission seen in low-frequency radio maps. the mustang data also detectpressure substructure that is not well-constrained by the x-ray data in theremnant core of a merging subcluster. we find that the small-scale pressureenhancements in the mustang data amount to ~2% of the total pressure measuredin the 140ghz bolocam observations. the x-ray template also fails on largerscales to accurately describe the bolocam data, particularly at the location ofa subcluster known to have a high line of sight optical velocity (~3200km/s).our bolocam data are adequately described when we add an additional component -not described by a thermal sze spectrum - coincident with this subcluster.using flux densities extracted from our model fits, and marginalizing over thetemperature constraints for the region, we fit a thermal+kinetic sze spectrumto our data and find the subcluster has a best-fit line of sight propervelocity of 3600+3440/-2160km/s. this agrees with the optical velocityestimates for the subcluster. the probability of velocity&lt;0 given ourmeasurements is 2.1%. repeating this analysis using flux densities measurednon-parametrically results in a 3.4% probability of a velocity&lt;=0. we note thatthis tantalizing result for the kinetic sze is on resolved, subcluster scales.

1208.1766	miscentring in galaxy clusters: dark matter to brightest cluster galaxy  offsets in 10,000 sdss clusters	we characterise the typical offset between the dark matter (dm) projectedcentre and the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in 10,000 sdss clusters. to placeconstraints on the centre of dm, we use an automated strong-lensing analysis,mass-modelling technique which is based on the well-tested assumption thatlight traces mass. the cluster galaxies are modelled with a steep power-law,and the dm component is obtained by smoothing the galaxy distribution fitting alow-order 2d polynomial (via spline interpolation), while probing a whole rangeof polynomial degrees and galaxy power laws. we find that the offsets betweenthe bcg and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the dm, \delta, aredistributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are welldescribed by a log-normal distribution with &lt;log_{10}(\delta [h^{-1}mpc])&gt;=-1.895^{+0.003}_{-0.004}, and \sigma=0.501\pm0.004 (95% confidencelevels), or &lt;log_{10}(\delta [\arcsec])&gt;=0.564\pm0.005, and\sigma=0.475\pm0.007. some of the offsets originate in prior misidentificationsof the bcg or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm,whose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that ~10% of theclusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributingto higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. our resultsconstitute the first statistically-significant high-resolution distributions ofdm-to-bcg offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly showthat there exists such a typical non-zero offset in the probed catalogue. theoffsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higherseparations are generally found for higher-z clusters in agreement with thehierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could help characterise themerger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters, in future studies.[abridged]

1209.5129	the contribution of radio galaxy contamination to measurements of the  sunyaev-zel'dovich decrement in massive galaxy clusters at 140 ghz with  bolocam	we describe in detail our characterization of the compact radio sourcepopulation in 140 ghz bolocam observations of a set of 45 massive galaxyclusters. we use a combination of 1.4 and 30 ghz data to select a total of 28probable cluster-member radio galaxies and also to predict their 140 ghz fluxdensities. all of these galaxies are steep-spectrum radio sources and they arefound preferentially in the cool-core clusters within our sample. inparticular, 11 of the 12 brightest cluster member radio sources are associatedwith cool-core systems. although none of the individual galaxies are robustlydetected in the bolocam data, the ensemble-average flux density at 140 ghz isconsistent with, but slightly lower than, the extrapolation from lowerfrequencies assuming a constant spectral index. in addition, our data indicatean intrinsic scatter of 30 percent around the power-law extrapolated fluxdensities at 140 ghz, although our data do not tightly constrain this scatter.for our cluster sample, which is composed of high-mass and moderate-redshiftsystems, we find that the maximum fractional change in the sunyaev-zel'dovichsignal integrated over any single cluster due to the presence of these radiosources is 20 percent, and only 1/4 of the clusters show a fractional change ofmore than 1 percent. the amount of contamination is strongly dependent oncluster morphology, and nearly all of the clusters with more than 1 percentcontamination are cool-core systems. this result indicates that radiocontamination is not significant compared to current noise levels in 140 ghzimages of massive clusters and is in good agreement with the level of radiocontamination found in previous results based on lower frequency data orsimulations.

1210.3359	mass, shape and thermal properties of a1689 by a multi-wavelength x-ray,  lensing and sunyaev-zel'dovich analysis	knowledge of mass and concentration of galaxy clusters is crucial tounderstand their formation and evolution. unbiased estimates require theunderstanding of the shape and orientation of the halo as well as itsequilibrium status. we propose a novel method to determine the intrinsicproperties of galaxy clusters from a multi-wavelength data set spanning fromx-ray spectroscopic and photometric data to gravitational lensing to thesunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze). the method relies on two quite non informativegeometrical assumptions: the distributions of total matter or gas areapproximately ellipsoidal and co-aligned; they have different, constant axialratios but share the same degree of triaxiality. weak and strong lensing probethe features of the total mass distribution in the plane of the sky. x-ray datameasure size and orientation of the gas in the plane of the sky. comparisonwith the sz amplitude fixes the elongation of the gas along the line of sight.these constraints are deprojected thanks to bayesian inference. the massdistribution is described as a navarro-frenk-white halo with arbitraryorientation, gas density and temperature are modelled with parametric profiles.we applied the method to abell 1689. independently of the priors, the clusteris massive, m_{200}=(1.3+-0.2)*10^{15}m_sun, and over-concentrated,c_{200}=8+-1, but still consistent with theoretical predictions. the totalmatter is triaxial (minor to major axis ratio ~0.5+-0.1 exploiting priors fromn-body simulations) with the major axis nearly orientated along the line ofsight. the gas is rounder (minor to major axis ratio ~0.6+-0.1) and deviatesfrom hydrostatic equilibrium. the contribution of non-thermal pressure is~20-50 per cent in inner regions, &lt;~ 300 kpc, and ~25+-5 per cent at ~1.5 mpc.

1211.1632	sunyaev-zel'dovich-measured pressure profiles from the bolocam x-ray/sz  galaxy cluster sample	we describe sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect measurements and analysis of theintracluster medium (icm) pressure profiles of a set of 45 massive galaxyclusters imaged using bolocam at the caltech submillimeter observatory. we haveused masses determined from chandra x-ray observations to scale each cluster'sprofile by the overdensity radius r500 and the mass-and-redshift-dependentnormalization factor p500. we deproject the average pressure profile of oursample into 13 logarithmically spaced radial bins between 0.07r500 and 3.5r500.we find that a generalized navarro, frenk, and white (gnfw) profile describesour data with sufficient goodness-of-fit and best-fit parameters (c500, alpha,beta, gamma, p0 = 1.18, 0.86, 3.67, 0.67, 4.29). we also use the x-ray data todefine cool-core and disturbed subsamples of clusters, and we constrain theaverage pressure profiles of each of these subsamples. we find that given theprecision of our data the average pressure profiles of disturbed and cool-coreclusters are consistent with one another at r&gt;~0.15r500, with cool-core systemsshowing indications of higher pressure at r&lt;~0.15r500. in addition, for thefirst time, we place simultaneous constraints on the mass scaling of clusterpressure profiles, their ensemble mean profile, and their radius-dependentintrinsic scatter between 0.1r500 and 2.0r500. the scatter among profiles isminimized at radii between ~0.2r500 and ~0.5r500, with a value of ~20%. thebest-fit mass scaling has a power-law slope of 0.49, which is shallower thanthe nominal prediction of 2/3 from self-similar hydrostatic equilibrium models.these results for the intrinsic scatter and mass scaling are largely consistentwith previous analyses, most of which have relied heavily on x-ray derivedpressures of clusters at significantly lower masses and redshifts compared toour sample.

1302.0095	suzaku observations of abell 1835 outskirts: deviation from hydrostatic  equilibrium	we present results of four-pointing suzaku x-ray observations (total ~200 ks)of the intracluster medium (icm) in the abell 1835 galaxy cluster (kt ~ 8 kev,z = 0.253) out to the virial radius (r_vir ~ 2.9 mpc) and beyond. faint x-rayemission from the icm out to r_vir is detected. the temperature graduallydecreases with radius from ~8 kev in the inner region to ~2 kev at r_vir. theentropy profile is shown to flatten beyond r_500, in disagreement with ther_1.1 dependence predicted from the accretion shock heating model. the thermalpressure profile in the range 0.3r_500 &lt; r &lt; r_vir agrees well with thatobtained from the stacked sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations with theplanck satellite. the hydrostatic mass profile in the cluster outskirts (r_500&lt; r &lt; r_vir) falls well short of the weak lensing one derived fromsubaru/suprime-cam observations, showing an unphysical decrease with radius.the gas mass fraction at r_vir defined with the lensing total mass agrees withthe cosmic baryon fraction from the wmap 7-year data. all these resultsindicate, rather than the gas-clumping effect, that the bulk of the icm in thecluster outskirts is far from hydrostatic equilibrium and infalling matterretained some of its kinetic energy. finally, combining with our recent suzakuand lensing analysis of abell 1689, a cluster of similar mass, temperature, andredshift, we show that the cluster temperature distribution in the outskirts issignificantly correlated with the galaxy density field in the surroundinglarge-scale environment at (1-2)r_vir.

1302.0514	model-free multi-probe lensing reconstruction of cluster mass profiles	lens magnification by galaxy clusters induces characteristic spatialvariations in the number counts of background sources, amplifying theirobserved fluxes and expanding the area of sky, the net effect of which, knownas magnification bias, depends on the intrinsic faint-end slope of the sourceluminosity function. the bias is strongly negative for red galaxies, dominatedby the geometric area distortion, whereas it is mildly positive for bluegalaxies, enhancing the blue counts toward the cluster center. we generalizethe bayesian approach of umetsu et al. for reconstructing projected clustermass profiles, by incorporating multiple populations of background sources formagnification bias measurements and combining them with complementary lensdistortion measurements, effectively breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy andimproving the statistical precision of cluster mass measurements. the approachcan be further extended to include strong-lensing projected mass estimates,thus allowing for non-parametric absolute mass determinations in both the weakand strong regimes. we apply this method to our recent clash lensingmeasurements of macs j1206.2-0847, and demonstrate how combining multi-probelensing constraints can improve the reconstruction of cluster mass profiles.this method will also be useful for a stacked lensing analysis, combining alllensing-related effects in the cluster regime, for a definitive determinationof the averaged mass profile.

0712.3441	combining lens distortion and depletion to map the mass distribution of  a1689	[abridged] we derive a projected 2d mass map of the well studied galaxycluster a1689 based on an entropy-regularized maximum-likelihood combination ofthe lens magnification and distortion of red background galaxies registered indeep subaru images. the known strong lensing information is also readilyincorporated in this approach, represented as a central pixel with a meansurface density close to the critical value. we also utilize the distortionmeasurements to locally downweight the intrinsic clustering noise, whichotherwise perturbs the depletion signal. the projected mass profilecontinuously steepens with radius and is well fitted by the nfw model, but witha surprising large concentration c_vir=13.4^{+5.3}_{-3.3}, lying far from thepredicted value of c_vir ~ 5, corresponding to the measured virial mass,m_vir=(2.1\pm 0.2)\times 10^15m_{\odot}, posing a challenge to the standardassumptions defining the lcdm model. we examine the consistency of our resultswith estimates derived with the standard weak lensing estimators and bycomparison with the inner mass profile obtained from strong lensing. all thereconstructions tested here imply a virial mass in the range,m_vir=(1.5-2.1)\times 10^15m_{\odot}, and the combined acs and subaru-2d massreconstruction yields a tight constraint on the concentration parameter,c_vir=12.7 \pm 1(stat.) \pm 2.8(systematic) (c_200 ~ 10), improving upon thestatistical accuracy of our earlier 1d analysis. importantly, our best fittingprofile properly reproduces the observed einstein radius of 45 arcsec (z_s=1),in contrast to other weak lensing work, reporting lower concentration profiles,which underestimate the observed einstein radius.

1303.6588	cluster lensing profiles derived from a redshift enhancement of  magnified boss-survey galaxies	we report the first detection of a redshift-depth enhancement of backgroundgalaxies magnified by foreground clusters. using 300,000 boss-survey galaxieswith accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we measure their mean redshift depthbehind four large samples of optically selected clusters from the sdss surveys,totalling 5,000-15,000 clusters. a clear trend of increasing mean redshifttowards the cluster centers is found, averaged over each of the four clustersamples. in addition we find similar but noisier behaviour for an independentx-ray sample of 158 clusters lying in the foreground of the current boss skyarea. by adopting the mass-richness relationships appropriate for each surveywe compare our results with theoretical predictions for each of the four sdsscluster catalogs. the radial form of this redshift enhancement is well fittedby a richness-to-mass weighted composite navarro-frenk-white profile with aneffective mass ranging between m_200 ~ 1.4-1.8 10^14 m_sun for the opticallydetected cluster samples, and m_200 ~ 5.0 10^14 m_sun for the x-ray sample.this lensing detection helps to establish the credibility of these sdss clustersurveys, and provides a normalization for their respective mass-richnessrelations. in the context of the upcoming bigboss, subaru-pfs, and euclid-nispspectroscopic surveys, this method represents an independent means of derivingthe masses of cluster samples for examining the cosmological evolution, andprovides a relatively clean consistency check of weak-lensing measurements,free from the systematic limitations of shear calibration.

1305.1703	platform deformation phase correction for the amiba-13 co-planar  interferometer	we present a new way to solve the platform deformation problem of co-planarinterferometers. the platform of a co-planar interferometer can be deformed dueto driving forces and gravity. a deformed platform will induce extra componentsinto the geometric delay of each baseline, and change the phases of observedvisibilities. the reconstructed images will also be diluted due to the errorsof the phases. the platform deformations of the yuan-tseh lee array formicrowave background anisotropy (amiba) were modelled based on photogrammetrydata with about 20 mount pointing positions. we then used the differentialoptical pointing error between two optical telescopes to fit the modelparameters in the entire horizontal coordinate space. with the platformdeformation model, we can predict the errors of the geometric phase delays dueto platform deformation with given azimuth and elevation of the targets andcalibrators. after correcting the phases of the radio point sources in theamiba interferometric data, we recover 50% - 70% flux loss due to phase errors.this allows us to restore more than 90% of a source flux. the method outlinedin this work is not only applicable to the correction of deformation for otherco-planar telescopes but also to single dish telescopes with deformationproblems. this work also forms the basis of the upcoming science results ofamiba-13.

1307.0982	tangential velocity of the dark matter in the bullet cluster from  precise lensed image redshifts	we show that the fast moving component of the "bullet cluster" (1e0657-56)can induce potentially resolvable redshift differences between multiply-lensedimages of background galaxies. the moving cluster effect can be expressed asthe scalar product of the lensing deflection angle with the tangential velocityof the mass components, and it is maximal for clusters colliding in the planeof the sky with velocities boosted by their mutual gravity. the bullet clusteris likely to be the best candidate for the first measurement of this effect dueto the large collision velocity and because the lensing deflection and thecluster fields can be calculated in advance. we derive the deflection fieldusing multiply-lensed background galaxies detected with the hubble spacetelescope. the velocity field is modeled using self-consistentn-body/hydrodynamical simulations constrained by the observed x-ray andgravitational lensing features of this system. we predict that thetriply-lensed images of systems "g" and "h" straddling the critical curve ofthe bullet component will show the largest frequency shifts up to ~0.5 km/sec.this is within the range of the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array(alma) for molecular emission, and is near the resolution limit of the newgeneration high-throughput optical-ir spectrographs. a detection of this effectmeasures the tangential motion of the subclusters directly, thereby clarifyingthe tension with lcdm, which is inferred from gas motion less directly. thismethod may be extended to smaller redshift differences using the ly-alphaforest towards qsos lensed by more typical clusters of galaxies. moregenerally, the tangential component of the peculiar velocities of clustersderived by our method complements the radial component determined by thekinematic sz effect, providing a full 3-dimensional description of velocities.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1404.1375	clash: weak-lensing shear-and-magnification analysis of 20 galaxy  clusters	we present a joint shear-and-magnification weak-lensing analysis of a sampleof 16 x-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters at 0.19&lt;z&lt;0.69selected from the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). ouranalysis uses wide-field multi-color imaging, taken primarily with suprime-camon the subaru telescope. from a stacked shear-only analysis of thex-ray-selected subsample, we detect the ensemble-averaged lensing signal with atotal signal-to-noise ratio of ~25 in the radial range of 200 to 3500kpc/h. thestacked tangential-shear signal is well described by a family of standarddensity profiles predicted for dark-matter-dominated halos in gravitationalequilibrium, namely the navarro-frenk-white (nfw), truncated variants of nfw,and einasto models. for the nfw model, we measure a mean concentration of$c_{200c}=4.01^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ at $m_{200c}=1.34^{+0.10}_{-0.09}10^{15}m_{\odot}$. we show this is in excellent agreement with lambdacold-dark-matter (lcdm) predictions when the clash x-ray selection function andprojection effects are taken into account. the best-fit einasto shape parameteris $\alpha_e=0.191^{+0.071}_{-0.068}$, which is consistent with thenfw-equivalent einasto parameter of $\sim 0.18$. we reconstruct projected massdensity profiles of all clash clusters from a joint likelihood analysis ofshear-and-magnification data, and measure cluster masses at severalcharacteristic radii. we also derive an ensemble-averaged total projected massprofile of the x-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual massprofiles. the stacked total mass profile, constrained by theshear+magnification data, is shown to be consistent with our shear-basedhalo-model predictions including the effects of surrounding large-scalestructure as a two-halo term, establishing further consistency in the contextof the lcdm model.

(2012), corresponding to$m_{200m} \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{m}_\odot\,h^{-1}$, however we findno significant detection of gravitational redshift signal for less richedclusters, which may be related to bulk motions from substructure and spuriouscluster detections. second, we find all three catalogues generatemass-dependent levels of lensing magnification bias, which enhances the meanredshift of flux-selected background galaxies from the boss survey. themagnitude of this lensing effect is generally consistent with the correspondingrichness-mass relations advocated for the surveys. we conclude that allcatalogues comprise a high proportion of reliable clusters, and that the gmbcgand redmapper cluster finder algorithms favor more relaxed clusters with ameaningful gravitational redshift signal, as anticipated by the red-sequencecolour selection of the gmbcg and redmapper samples.

astro-ph;0505452	can the steep mass profile of a1689 be explained by a triaxial dark  halo?	the steep mass profile of a1689 derived from recent detailed lensingobservations is not readily reconciled with the low concentration halospredicted by the standard cdm model. however, halo triaxiality may act to biasthe profile constraints derived assuming a spherically symmetric massdistribution, since lensing relates only to the projected mass distribution. adegree of halo triaxiality is inherent to the cdm structure formation, arisingfrom the collision-less nature of the dark matter. here we compare thecdm-based model predictions of triaxial halo with the precise lensingmeasurements of a1689 based on the acs/hst and subaru data, over a wide rangeof 10kpc&lt;r&lt;2mpc. the model lensing profiles cover the intrinsic spread of halomass and shape, and are projected over all inclinations when comparing with thedata. we show that the model parameters are only weakly constrained andstrongly degenerate mainly because of the lack of information along the line ofsight. in particular, the limits on the concentration parameter become lessrestrictive with increasing triaxiality. yet, by comparing the obtainedconstraints with expected probability distributions for the axis ratio andconcentration parameters computed from numerical simulations, we find that ~6%of cluster-size halos in the cdm model can match the a1689 lensing observationsat the 2-sigma level, corresponding to cases where the major-axis of the halois aligned with the line of sight. thus halo triaxiality could reduce theapparent discrepancy between theory and observation. this hypothesis needs tobe further explored by a statistical lensing study for other clusters as wellas by complementary three-dimensional information derived using x-ray,kinematics, and sz effect observations.

astro-ph;0506713	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation as a function of  environment	we discuss the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution based on deeppanoramic imaging of two distant clusters taken with suprime-cam as part of thepisces project. by combining with the sdss data as a local counterpart forcomparison, we construct a large sample of galaxies that spans wide ranges inenvironment, time, and stellar mass (or luminosity). we find that colours ofgalaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($m_v&gt;m_v^*+1$), change from blueto red at a break density as we go to denser regions. based on local and globaldensities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, andclusters. we show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already builtat $z=0.83$. in contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnituderelation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and thebuild-up at the faint-end has not started yet. a possible interpretation ofthese results is that galaxies evolve in the 'down-sizing' fashion. that is,massive galaxies complete their star formation first and the truncation of starformation is propagated to smaller objects as time progresses. this trend islikely to depend on environment since the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation is delayed in lower-density environments. therefore, we may suggestthat the evolution of galaxies took place earliest in massive galaxies and inhigh density regions, and it is delayed in less massive galaxies and in lowerdensity regions.

astro-ph;0607542	how well can weak lensing measure the mass of galaxy clusters?	the technique of weak-lensing aperture mass densitometry, so called thezeta-statistic, has recently been popular in actual observations formeasurement of individual cluster mass. it has however been anticipated thatthe line-of-sight projection by foreground and background matter can adverselyaffect the cluster mass determination with not only substantial errordispersion but also a sizable positive systematic bias. additionally, thefinite number of background galaxies even at a reasonable observing depth canalso introduce poisson noise to the mass estimate. in this paper, wequantitatively investigate the degree of errors separately contributed by thetwo sources to the mass determination of those galaxy clusters withm_{200}&gt;10^{14}m_{\odot}. we find that the aperture mass of zeta-statisticturns out to be a mass estimator of much reduced systematic bias, due to thecancellation by the positively biased local background mass sheet. however, theerror dispersion of m_{200} arising from both projection effect and poissonnoise is found to be still sizable (40%-90%), even for the shear-selected,clean sample where multiple clusters located within a suitable projectedaperture are removed. we also investigate how to remedy this large-errorproblem in weak lensing measurements, and propose a plausible alternative massestimator, m(&lt;theta_{1000}), an aperture mass measured within about half thevirial radius. the aperture mass m(&lt;theta_{1000}) is free of bias and has asubstantially reduced error dispersion, 39% for the worst case of high-z,low-mass clusters, that can be smaller than the error dispersion of m_{200} asmuch as a factor 3.

astro-ph;0608499	using weak lensing dilution to improve measurements of the luminous and  dark matter in a1689	the e/so sequence of a cluster defines a boundary redward of which a reliableweak lensing signal can be obtained from background galaxies, uncontaminated bycluster members. for bluer colors, both background and cluster members arepresent, reducing the distortion signal by the proportion of unlensed clustermembers. in deep subaru and hst/acs images of a1689 the tangential distortionof galaxies with bluer colors falls rapidly toward the cluster center relativeto the lensing signal of the red background. we use this dilution effect toderive the cluster light profile and luminosity function to large radius, withthe advantage that no subtraction of far-field background counts is required.the light profile declines smoothly to the limit of the data, r&lt;2mpc/h, with aconstant slope, dlog(l)/dlog(r)=-1.12+-0.06, unlike the lensing mass profilewhich steepens continuously with radius, so that m/l peaks at an intermediateradius, ~100kpc/h. a flatter behavior is found for the more physicallymeaningful ratio of dark-matter to stellar-matter, when accounting for thecolor-mass relation of cluster members. the cluster luminosity function has aflat slope, alpha=-1.05+-0.07, independent of radius and with no faint upturnto m_i'&lt;-12. we establish that the very bluest objects are negligiblycontaminated by the cluster v-i'&lt;0.2, because their distortion profile risestowards the center following the red background, but offset higher by ~20%.this larger amplitude is consistent with the greater estimated depth of thefaint blue galaxies, z~=2.0 compared to z~=0.85 for the red background, apurely geometric effect related to cosmological parameters. finally, we improveupon our earlier mass profile by combining both the red and blue backgroundpopulations, clearly excluding low concentration cdm profiles.

astro-ph;0702649	subaru weak lensing study of seven merging clusters: distributions of  mass and baryons	we present and compare projected distributions of mass, galaxies, and theintracluster medium (icm) for a sample of merging clusters of galaxies based onthe joint weak-lensing, optical photometric, and x-ray analysis. our samplecomprises seven nearby abell clusters, for which we have conducted systematic,deep imaging observations with suprime-cam on subaru telescope. our seventarget clusters, representing various merging stages and conditions, allow usto investigate in details the physical interplay between dark matter, icm, andgalaxies associated with cluster formation and evolution. a1750 and a1758 arebinary systems consisting of two cluster-sized components, a520, a754, a1758n,a1758s, and a1914 are on-going cluster mergers, and a2034 and a2142 arecold-front clusters. in the binary clusters, the projected mass, optical light,and x-ray distributions are overall similar and regular without significantsubstructures. on-going and cold-front merging clusters, on the other hand,reveal highly irregular mass distributions. overall the mass distributionappears to be similar to the galaxy luminosity distribution, whereas theirdistributions are quite different from the icm distribution in a various ways.we also measured for individual targets the global cluster parameters such asthe cluster mass,the mass-to-light ratio, and the icm temperature. a comparisonof the icm and virial temperatures of merging clusters from x-ray andweak-lensing analyses, respectively, shows that the icm temperature of on-goingand cold-front clusters is significantly higher than the cluster virialtemperature by a factor of $\sim 2$. this temperature excess in the icm couldbe explained by the effects of merger boosts.

astro-ph;0702651	observational constraints on the icm temperature enhancement by cluster  mergers	we present results from a combined weak lensing and x-ray analysis of themerging cluster a1914 at a redshift of $z=0.1712$ based on $r_{\rm}$-bandimaging data with subaru/suprime-cam and archival chandra x-ray data. based onthe weak-lensing and x-ray data we explore the relationships between clusterglobal properties, namely the gravitational mass, the bolometric x-layluminosity and temperature, the gas mass and the gas mass fraction, as afunction of radius. we found that the gas mass fractions within $r_{2500}$ and$r_{{\rm vir}}$ are consistent with the results of earlier x-ray clusterstudies and of cosmic microwave background studies based on the wmapobservations, respectively. however, the observed temperature, $k_b t_{\rmave}=9.6\pm0.3 {\rm kev}$, is significantly higher than the virial temperature,$k_b t_{\rm vir}=4.7\pm0.3 {\rm kev}$ derived from the weak lensing distortionmeasurement. the x-ray bolometric luminosity and temperature  ($l_x-t$) relation is consistent with the $l_x-t$ relation derived byprevious statistical x-ray studies of galaxy clusters. such correlations amongthe global cluster properties are invaluable observational tools for studyingthe cluster merger physics. our results demonstrate that the combination ofx-ray and weak-lensing observations is a promising, powerful probe of thephysical processes associated with cluster mergers as well as of their massproperties.

astro-ph;9911465	a possible route to spontaneous reduction of the heat conductivity by a  temperature gradient driven instability in electron-ion plasmas	we have shown that there exists low-frequency growing modes driven by aglobal temperature gradient in electron and ion plasmas, by linear perturbationanalysis within the frame work of plasma kinetic theory. the driving force ofthe instability is the local deviation of the distribution function from themaxwell-boltzmann due to global temperature gradient. application to theintracluster medium shows that scattering of the particles due to waves excitedby the instability is possible to reduce mean free paths of electron and iondown to five to seven order of magnitude than the mean free paths due tocoulomb collisions. this may provide a hint to explain why hot and cool gas canco-exist in the intracluster medium in spite of the very short evaporation timescale due to thermal conduction if the conductivity is the classical spitzervalue. our results suggest that the realization of the global thermalequilibrium is postponed by the local instability which is induced for quickerrealization of local thermal equilibrium state in plasmas. the instabilityprovides a new possibility to create and grow cosmic magnetic fields withoutany seed magnetic field.

0810.0969	mass and hot baryons in massive galaxy clusters from subaru weak lensing  and amiba sze observations	we present a multiwavelength analysis of a sample of four hot (t_x&gt;8kev)x-ray galaxy clusters (a1689, a2261, a2142, and a2390) using joint amibasunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) and subaru weak lensing observations, combinedwith published x-ray temperatures, to examine the distribution of mass and theintracluster medium (icm) in massive cluster environments. our observationsshow that a2261 is very similar to a1689 in terms of lensing properties. manytangential arcs are visible around a2261, with an effective einstein radius\sim 40 arcsec (at z \sim 1.5), which when combined with our weak lensingmeasurements implies a mass profile well fitted by an nfw model with a highconcentration c_{vir} \sim 10, similar to a1689 and to other massive clusters.the cluster a2142 shows complex mass substructure, and displays a shallowerprofile (c_{vir} \sim 5), consistent with detailed x-ray observations whichimply recent interaction. the amiba map of a2142 exhibits an sze featureassociated with mass substructure lying ahead of the sharp north-west edge ofthe x-ray core suggesting a pressure increase in the icm. for a2390 we obtainhighly elliptical mass and icm distributions at all radii, consistent withother x-ray and strong lensing work. our cluster gas fraction measurements,free from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, are overall in good agreementwith published x-ray and sze observations, with the sample-averaged gasfraction of &lt;f_{gas}&gt; = 0.133 \pm 0.027, for our sample &lt;m_{vir}&gt; = (1.2 \pm0.1) \times 10^{15} m_{sun} h^{-1}. when compared to the cosmic baryon fractionf_b = \omega_b/\omega_m constrained by the wmap 5-year data, this indicates&lt;f_{gas}&gt;/f_b = 0.78 \pm 0.16, i.e., (22 \pm 16)% of the baryons are missingfrom the hot phase of clusters.

0810.3129	dynamical study of a1689 from wide-field vlt/vimos spectroscopy: mass  profile, concentration parameter, and velocity anisotropy	we examine the dynamics structure of the rich cluster a1689, combiningvlt/vimos spectroscopy with subaru/suprime-cam imaging. the radial velocitydistribution of $\sim 500$ cluster members is bounded by a pair of clearlydefined velocity caustics, with a maximum amplitude of $\sim|4000|$ km/s at$\simeq$ 300 h$^{-1}$ kpc, beyond which the amplitude steadily declines,approaching zero velocity at a limiting radius of $\sim$ 2 h$^{-1}$ mpc. wederive the 3d velocity anisotropy and galaxy number density profiles using amodel-independent method to solve the jeans equation, simultaneouslyincorporating the observed velocity dispersion profile, the galaxy counts fromdeep subaru imaging, and our previously derived cluster mass profile from ajoint lensing and x-ray analysis. the velocity anisotropy is found to bepredominantly radial at large radius, becoming increasingly tangential towardsthe center, in accord with expectations. we also analyze the galaxy dataindependently of our previous analysis using two different methods: the firstis based on a solution of the jeans equation assuming an nfw form for the massdistribution, whereas in the second method the caustic amplitude is used todetermine the escape velocity. the cluster virial mass derived by both of thesedynamical methods is in good agreement with results from our earlier lensingand x-ray analysis. we also confirm the high nfw concentration parameter, withresults from both methods combined to yield $c_{\rm vir}&gt;13$ (1$\sigma$). theinferred virial radius is consistent with the limiting radius where thecaustics approach zero velocity and where the counts of cluster members dropoff, suggesting that infall onto a1689 is currently not significant.

0811.1675	tests of amiba data integrity	we describe methods used to validate data from the y.t. lee array formicrowave background anisotropy (amiba), an interferometric array designed tomeasure the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and the anisotropy of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb). we perform several statistical tests on data frompointed galaxy cluster observations taken in 2007 and noise data from long-termblank sky observations and measurements with the feeds covered by theabsorbers. we apply power spectrum analysis, cross power spectrum analysisamong different outputs with different time lags in our analog correlator, andsample variance law tests to noise data. we find that (1) there is no timevariation of electronic offsets on the time scale of our two-patch observations(~10 minutes); (2) noise is correlated by less than 10% between different lags;and (3) the variance of noise scales with the inverse of time. to test thegaussianity of the data, we apply kolmogorov-smirnov (k-s) tests to clusterdata, and find that a 5% significance level efficiently detects data sets withknown hardware problems without rejecting an excess of acceptable data. we alsocalculate third- and fourth-order moments and cumulants for the noise residualvisibilities and find that about 95% of our data are within the 99% confidenceregions of gaussianity.
