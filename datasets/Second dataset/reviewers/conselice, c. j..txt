0706.2622	structure through colour: a pixel approach towards understanding  galaxies	we present a study of pixel colour magnitude diagrams (pcmds) for a sample of69 nearby galaxies chosen to span a wide range of hubble types. our goal is todetermine how useful a pixel approach is for studying galaxies according totheir stellar light distributions and content. the galaxy images were analysedon a pixel-by-pixel basis to reveal the structure of the individual pcmds. wefind that the average surface brightness (or projected mass density) in eachpixel varies according to galaxy type. early-type galaxies exihibit a clear``prime sequence'' and some pcmds of face-on spirals reveal ``inverse-l''structures. we find that the colour dispersion at a given magnitude is found tobe approximately constant in early-type galaxies but this quantity varies inthe mid and late-types. we investigate individual galaxies and find that thepcmds can be used to pick out morphological features. we discuss the discoveryof ``red hooks'' in the pcmds of six early-type galaxies and two spirals andpostulate their origins. we develop quantitative methods to characterise thepcmds, including measures of the blue-to-red light ratio and colourdistributions of each galaxy and we organise these by morphological type. wecompare the colours of the pixels in each galaxy with the stellar populationmodels of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) to calculate star formation histories foreach galaxy type and compare these to the stellar mass within each pixel. mapsof pixel stellar mass and mass-to-light ratio are compared to galaxy images. weapply the pcmd technique to three galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field totest the usefulness of the analysis at high redshift. we propose that theseresults can be used as part of a new system of automated classification ofgalaxies that can be applied at high redshift.

0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0909.4074	uv continuum slope and dust obscuration from z~6 to z~2: the star  formation rate density at high redshift	we provide a systematic measurement of the rest-frame uv continuum slope betaover a wide range in redshift (z~2-6) and rest-frame uv luminosity (0.1-2l*) toimprove estimates of the sfr density at high redshift. we utilize the deepoptical and infrared data (acs/nicmos) over the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields,as well as the udf for our primary ubvi "dropout" sample. we correct theobserved distributions for selection biases and photometric scatter. we findthat the uv-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantiallyredder at z~2-4 than it is at z~5-6. lower luminosity galaxies are also foundto be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z~2.5 and z~4. we do not find alarge number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections atz~4, and particularly at z&gt;~5, even though such sources could be readilyselected from our data. this suggests that star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~5 almostuniversally have very blue uv-continuum slopes, and that there are not likelyto be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z&gt;~5 that are missed in"dropout" searches. using the same relation between uv-continuum slope and dustextinction as found to be appropriate at z~0 and z~2, we estimate the averagedust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and uv luminosity in aconsistent way. we find that the estimated dust extinction increasessubstantially with cosmic time for the most uv luminous galaxies, but remainssmall (&lt;~2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. because these samelower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the uv, theoverall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts. we includethe contribution from ulirgs in our sfr density estimates at z~2-6, but findthat they contribute only ~20% of the total at z~2.5 and &lt;~10% at z&gt;~4.

0911.1158	the morphology of passively evolving galaxies at z ~ 2 from hst/wfc3  deep imaging in the hubble ultradeep field	we present near-ir images, obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst) andthe wfc3/ir camera, of six passive and massive galaxies at redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4(ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}; stellar mass m~10^{11} m_{sun}), selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey (goods). these images, which have aspatial resolution of ~1.5 kpc, provide the deepest view of the opticalrest-frame morphology of such systems to date. we find that the light profileof these galaxies is regular and well described by a sersic model with indextypical of today's spheroids. their size, however, is generally much smallerthan today's early types of similar stellar mass, with four out of six galaxieshaving r_e ~ 1 kpc or less, in quantitative agreement with previous similarmeasures made at rest-frame uv wavelengths. the images reach limiting surfacebrightness mu~26.5 mag arcsec^{-2} in the f160w bandpass; yet, there is noevidence of a faint halo in the galaxies of our sample, even in their stackedimage. we also find that these galaxies have very weak "morphologicalk-correction" between the rest-frame uv (from the acs z-band), and therest--frame optical (wfc3 h-band): the sersic index, physical size and overallmorphology are independent or only mildly dependent on the wavelength, withinthe errors.

1002.1056	star formation in the outer filaments of ngc 1275	we present photometry of the outer star clusters in ngc 1275, the brightestgalaxy in the perseus cluster. the observations were taken using the hubblespace telescope advanced camera for surveys. we focus on two stellar regions inthe south and south-east, far from the nucleus of the low velocity system (~22kpc). these regions of extended star formation trace the h alpha filaments,drawn out by rising radio bubbles. in both regions bimodal distributions ofcolour (b-r)_0 against magnitude are apparent, suggesting two populations ofstar clusters with different ages; most of the h alpha filaments show nodetectable star formation. the younger, bluer population is found to beconcentrated along the filaments while the older population is dispersed evenlyabout the galaxy. we construct colour-magnitude diagrams and derive ages of atmost 10^8 years for the younger population, a factor of 10 younger than theyoung population of star clusters in the inner regions of ngc 1275. we concludethat a formation mechanism or event different to that for the young innerpopulation is needed to explain the outer star clusters and suggest thatformation from the filaments, triggered by a buoyant radio bubble either risingabove or below these filaments, is the most likely mechanism.

1002.2365	the effects of an agn on host galaxy colour and morphology measurements	we assess the effects of simulated active galactic nuclei (agns) on thecolour and morphology measurements of their host galaxies. to test themorphology measurements, we select a sample of galaxies not known to host agnsand add a series of point sources scaled to represent specified fractions ofthe observed v band light detected from the resulting systems; we then comparemorphology measurements of the simulated systems to measurements of theoriginal galaxies. agn contributions &gt;20 per cent bias most of the morphologymeasurements tested, though the extent of the apparent bias depends on themorphological characteristics of the original galaxies. we test colourmeasurements by adding to non-agn galaxy spectra a quasar spectrum scaled tocontribute specified fractions of the rest-frame b band light detected from theresulting systems. a quasar fraction of 5 per cent can move the nuv-r colour ofan elliptical galaxy from the uv-optical red sequence to the green valley, and20 per cent can move it into the blue cloud. combining the colour andmorphology results, we find that a galaxy/agn system with an agn contribution&gt;20 per cent may appear bluer and more bulge-dominated than the underlyinggalaxy. we conclude that (1) bulge-dominated, e/s0/sa, and early-typemorphology classifications are accurate for red agn host galaxies and may beaccurate for blue host galaxies, unless the agn manifests itself as awell-defined point source; and (2) although highly unobscured agns, such as thequasar used for our experiments, can significantly bias the measured colours ofagn host galaxies, it is possible to identify such systems by examining opticalimages of the hosts for the presence of a point source and/or measuring thelevel of nuclear obscuration.

1007.1459	extragalactic background light inferred from aegis galaxy sed-type  fractions	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is of fundamental importance bothfor understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for gamma-rayastronomy, but the overall spectrum of the ebl between 0.1-1000 microns hasnever been determined directly from galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed)observations over a wide redshift range. the evolving, overall spectrum of theebl is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. thisis achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame k-band galaxyluminosity function up to redshift 4 (cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with adetermination of galaxy sed-type fractions. these are based on fitting swiretemplates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshiftrange from 0.2 to 1 from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). the changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forminggalaxies, starburst galaxies and agn galaxies in that redshift range areestimated, and two alternative extrapolations of sed-types to higher redshiftsare considered. this allows calculation of the evolution of the luminositydensities from the uv to the ir, the evolving star formation rate density ofthe universe, the evolving contribution to the bolometric ebl from thedifferent galaxy populations including agn galaxies and the buildup of the ebl.our ebl calculations are compared with those from a semi-analytic model, fromanother observationally-based model and observational data. the ebluncertainties in our modeling based directly on the data are quantified, andtheir consequences for attenuation of very high energy gamma-rays due to pairproduction on the ebl are discussed. it is concluded that the ebl is wellconstrained from the uv to the mid-ir, but independent efforts from infraredand gamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in thefar-ir.

0704.2136	the colour selection of distant galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey  early data release	we investigate colour selection techniques for high redshift galaxies in theukidss ultra deep survey early data release (uds edr). combined with very deepsubaru optical photometry, the depth (k_ab = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of theuds edr allows us to investigate optical/near-ir selection using a large sampleof over 30,000 objects. by using the b-z, z-k colour-colour diagram (the bzktechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z &gt; 1.4, which can befurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pbzk and sbzkrespectively). our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature notpreviously seen in bzk diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving trackof early type galaxies at z &lt; 1.4. we also compare the bzk technique with ther-k colour selection of extremely red objects (eros) and the j-k selection ofdistant red galaxies (drgs), and quantify the overlap between thesepopulations. we find that the majority of drgs, at these relatively brightmagnitudes are also eros. since previous studies have found that drgs at thesemagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these drg/ero galaxieshave seds consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or agn at z &lt; 2.finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pbzk galaxies, similarto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosityfunction of passive z &gt; 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1104.2904	agn environments at z&lt;1.5 in the ukidss ultra-deep survey	we investigate the environments of both x-ray and radio-loud agn within theukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) using deep infrared selection to sample thegalaxy density field in the redshift range 1.0 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.5. using angularcross-correlation techniques we find that both x-ray and radio-loud agnpreferentially reside in overdense environments. we also find that both typesof agn cluster more strongly with those galaxies classified as `passive' ratherthan those that are actively star-forming. we infer clustering scale lengthscomparable to those of passive red galaxies, suggesting that typical agn atthese epochs reside in dark-matter halos of mass m &gt;~ 10^13 m_sun. a closerlook at the small-scale environments of the agn reveals that the neighbouringgalaxies of radio-loud agn have u-b colours more skewed towards the`green-valley' and the red sequence, whereas the neighbours of x-ray agn showno difference to the general galaxy population. this suggests that althoughboth agn types live in overdense environments, the radio-loud agn may bepreferentially located in more evolved cluster cores, in a similar environmentto low-powered radio agn in the local universe.

1105.2522	the tumultuous formation of the hubble sequence at z &gt; 1 examined with  hst/wfc3 observations of the hubble ultra deep field	we examine in this paper a stellar mass selected sample of galaxies at 1 &lt; z&lt; 3 within the hubble ultra deep field, utilising wfc3 imaging to study therest-frame optical morphological distribution of galaxies at this epoch. wemeasure how apparent morphologies (disk, elliptical, peculiar) correlate withphysical properties, such as quantitative structure and spectral-types. oneprimary result is that apparent morphology does not correlate strongly withstellar populations, nor with galaxy structure at this epoch, suggesting achaotic formation history for hubble types at z &gt; 1. by using a locally defineddefinition of disk and elliptical galaxies based on structure andspectral-type, we find no true ellipticals at z &gt; 2, and a fraction of3.2+/-2.3% at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2. local counterparts of disk galaxies are at a similarlevel of 7-10%, much lower than the 75% fraction at lower redshifts. we furthercompare wfc3 images with the rest-frame uv view of galaxies from acs imaging,showing that galaxies imaged with acs that appear peculiar often contain an`elliptical' like morphology in wfc3. we show through several simulations thatthis larger fraction of elliptical-like galaxies is partially due to thecourser psf of wfc3, and that the `elliptical' class very likely includesearly-type disks. we also measure the merger history for our sample using casparameters, finding a redshift evolution increasing with redshift, and a peakmerger fraction of ~30% at z~2 for the most massive galaxies with m_*&gt; 10^{10}m_sol, consistent with previous results from acs and nicmos. we compare ourresults to semi-analytical model results and find a relatively good agreementbetween our morphological break-down and the predictions. finally, we arguethat the peculiars, ellipticals and peculiar ellipticals have similarproperties, suggesting similar formation modes, likely driven by major mergers.

(3) the frequency of agn is ~40% at z=2-3.most (~65%) agn hosts have disky (n&lt;=2) morphologies. ultra-compact galaxiesappear quiescent in terms of both agn activity and star formation. (4) largestellar surface densities imply massive galaxies at z=2-3 formed via rapid,highly dissipative events at z&gt;2. the large fraction of n&lt;=2 disky systemssuggests cold mode accretion complements gas-rich major mergers at z&gt;2. inorder for massive galaxies at z=2-3 to evolve into present-day massive e/s0s,they need to significantly increase (n, r_e). dry minor and major mergers mayplay an important role in this process.

1108.0402	the relationship between star formation rates, local density and stellar  mass up to z ~ 3 in the goods nicmos survey	we investigate the relation between star formation rates and local galaxyenvironment for a stellar mass selected galaxy sample in the redshift range 1.5&lt; z &lt; 3. we use near-infra-red imaging from an extremely deep hubble spacetelescope survey, the goods-nicmos survey (gns) to measure local galaxydensities based on the nearest neighbour approach, while star-formation ratesare estimated from rest-frame uv-fluxes. due to our imaging depth we canexamine galaxies down to a colour-independent stellar mass completeness limitof log m\ast = 9.5 m\odot at z ~ 3. we find a strong dependence of starformation activity on galaxy stellar mass over the whole redshift range, whichdoes not depend on local environment. the average star formation rates arelargely independent of local environment apart from in the highest relativeover-densities. galaxies in over-densities of a factor of &gt; 5 have on averagelower star formation rates by a factor of 2 - 3, but only up to redshifts of z~ 2. we do not see any evidence for agn activity influencing these relations.we also investigate the influence of the very local environment onstar-formation activity by counting neighbours within 30 kpc radius. this showsthat galaxies with two or more close neighbours have on average significantlylower star formation rates as well as lower specific star formation rates up toz ~ 2.5. we suggest that this might be due to star formation quenching inducedby galaxy merging processes.

1110.3794	candels observations of the structural properties and evolution of  galaxies in a cluster at z=1.62	we discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in az=1.62 proto-cluster using near-ir imaging data from hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 data of the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphologyrelation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally havemorphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistentwith ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. the sizedistribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (&lt;1kpc), massive galaxies compared to candels field galaxies at z=1.6. as aresult the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizescompared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance.combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent clustergalaxies is relatively slow from z~1.6 to the present, growing as(1+z)^(-0.6+/-0.1). if this result is generalizable, then it implies thatphysical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to havecaused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slowersubsequent growth at z&lt;1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. thequiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lowerredshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggestthat they contain extended stellar disks. we argue the cluster galaxies requiredissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the diskmaterial and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, andcolor of early-type galaxies in z&lt;1 clusters.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

0711.1083	the faint and extremely red k-band selected galaxy population in the  deep2/palomar fields	we present in this paper an analysis of the faint and red near-infraredselected galaxy population found in near-infrared imaging from the palomarobservatory wide-field infrared survey. this survey covers 1.53 deg^2 to5-sigma detection limits of k_vega = 20.5-21 and j_vega = 22.5, and overlapswith the deep2 spectroscopic redshift survey. we discuss the details of thisnir survey, including our j and k band counts. we show that the k-band galaxypopulation has a redshift distribution that varies with k-magnitude, with mostk &lt; 17 galaxies at z &lt; 1.5 and a significant fraction (38.3+/-0.3%) of k &gt; 19systems at z &gt; 1.5. we further investigate the stellar masses and morphologicalproperties of k-selected galaxies, particularly extremely red objects, asdefined by (r-k) &gt; 5.3 and (i-k) &gt; 4. one of our conclusions is that the eroselection is a good method for picking out galaxies at z &gt; 1.2, and within ourmagnitude limits, the most massive galaxies at these redshifts. the ero limitfinds 75% of all m_* &gt; 10^{11} m_0 galaxies at z ~ 1.5 down to k_vega = 19.7.we further find that the morphological break-down of k &lt; 19.7 eros is dominatedby early-types (57+/-3%) and peculiars (34+/-3%). however, about a fourth ofthe early-types are distorted ellipticals, and within cas parameter space thesebridge the early-type and peculiar population, suggesting a morphologicalevolutionary sequence. we also investigate the use of a (i-k) &gt; 4 selection tolocate eros, finding that it selects galaxies at slightly higher averageredshifts (&lt;z&gt; = 1.43+/-0.32) than the (r-k) &gt; 5.3 limit with &lt;z&gt; =1.28+/-0.23. finally, by using the redshift distribution of k &lt; 20 selectedgalaxies, and the properties of our eros, we are able to rule out allmonolithic collapse models for the formation of massive galaxies.

1205.3368	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy environments and star formation  rate variations	we present a detailed investigation into the effects of galaxy environment ontheir star formation rates (sfr) using galaxies observed in the galaxy and massassembly survey (gama). we use three independent volume-limited samples ofgalaxies within z &lt; 0.2 and mr &lt; -17.8. we investigate the known sfr-densityrelationship and explore in detail the dependence of sfr on stellar mass anddensity. we show that the sfr-density trend is only visible when we include thepassive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. thissfr-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-formingpopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. while there is a strongdependence of the ewh?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that thesetrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationshipis absent when considering a "star-forming" sample of galaxies. we find thatstellar mass has the strongest influence on sfr and ewh?a with the environmenthaving no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the starforming population. we also show that the sfr-density relationship is absentfor both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. we conclude that thestellar mass has the largest impact on the current sfr of a galaxy, and anyenvironmental effect is not detectable. the observation that the trends withdensity are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies thatthe timescales must be very short for any quenching of the sfr in infallinggalaxies. alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situevolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into denseenvironments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.

1206.0943	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): colour and luminosity dependent  clustering from calibrated photometric redshifts	we measure the two-point angular correlation function of a sample of4,289,223 galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag from the sloan digital sky survey as afunction of photometric redshift, absolute magnitude and colour down to m_r -5log h = -14 mag. photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz modelmagnitudes and two petrosian radii using the artificial neural network packageannz, taking advantage of the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) spectroscopicsample as our training set. the photometric redshifts are then used todetermine absolute magnitudes and colours. for all our samples, we estimate theunderlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using monte-carloresampling. these redshift distributions are used in limber's equation toobtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to theangular correlation function. we confirm an increase in clustering strength forsub-l* red galaxies compared with ~l* red galaxies at small scales in allredshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almostindependent of luminosity for ~l* galaxies and fainter. a linear relationbetween relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminositiesl~0.03l*. we find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the l* populationcan be described by the passive evolution model of tegmark &amp; peebles (1998). avisual inspection of a random sample of our r &lt; 19.4 sample of sdss galaxiesreveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination ratetowards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies.we correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.

1206.2319	herschel observations of a z~2 stellar mass selected galaxy sample drawn  from the goods nicmos survey	we present a study of the far-ir properties of a stellar mass selected sampleof 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 galaxies with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 9.5 drawn from the goods nicmossurvey (gns), the deepest h-band hubble space telescope survey of its typeprior to the installation of wfc3. we use far-ir and sub-mm data from the pacsand spire instruments on-board herschel, taken from the pacs evolutionary probe(pep) and herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key projectsrespectively. we find a total of 22 gns galaxies, with median log(m_*/m_sun) =10.8 and z = 2.0, associated with 250 um sources detected with snr &gt; 3. wederive mean total ir luminosity log l_ir (l_sun) = 12.36 +/- 0.05 andcorresponding star formation rate sfr_(ir+uv) = (280 +/- 40) m_sun/yr for theseobjects, and find them to have mean dust temperature t_dust ~ 35 k. we findthat the sfr derived from the far-ir photometry combined with uv-basedestimates of unobscured sfr for these galaxies is on average more than a factorof 2 higher than the sfr derived from extinction corrected uv emission alone,although we note that the ir-based estimate is subject to substantial malmquistbias. to mitigate the effect of this bias and extend our study to fainterfluxes, we perform a stacking analysis to measure the mean sfr in bins ofstellar mass. we obtain detections at the 2-4 sigma level at spire wavelengthsfor samples with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 10. in contrast to the herschel detected gnsgalaxies, we find that estimates of sfr_(ir+uv) for the stacked samples arecomparable to those derived from extinction corrected uv emission, although theuncertainties are large. we find evidence for an increasing fraction of dustobscured star formation with stellar mass, finding sfr_ir/sfr_uv \proptom_*^{0.7 +/- 0.2}, which is likely a consequence of the mass--metallicityrelation.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1209.1636	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the mass-metallicity relationship	context: the mass-metallicity relationship (mmr) of star-forming galaxies iswell-established, however there is still some disagreement with respect to itsexact shape and its possible dependence on other observables. aims: we measurethe mmr in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we compare our measuredmmr to that measured in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and study thedependence of the mmr on various selection criteria to identify potentialcauses for disparities seen in the literature. methods: we use strong emissionline ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. we then apply a range ofselection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines,as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in theinferred mmr. results: the shape and position of the mmr can differsignificantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used.after selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we findthat the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061&lt; z&lt;0.35 in gama is inreasonable agreement with that found in the sdss despite the difference in theluminosity range probed. conclusions: in view of the significant variations ofthe mmr brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteriaand method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the mmr fromdifferent surveys and studies directly. we also conclude that there could be amodest level of evolution over 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.35 within the gama sample.

1210.4173	the dependence of quenching upon the inner structure of galaxies at  0.5&lt;z&lt; 0.8 in the deep2/aegis survey	the shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'.although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exactmechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.this paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenchingprocesses through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surfacestellar mass density and sersic index (n). we analyze the rest-frame u-b colorcorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies inthe redshift range 0.5&lt; z&lt;0.8 from the deep2/aegis survey. we find that sersicindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters andresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. there exists,however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. we hypothesize that their sersicvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, agns, and/or poor fits,leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternativeto sersic index. not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tightrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies ismost physically linked with quenching. furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority ofthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since theirgim2d bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses ofsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass mustabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. we discuss atwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates arecontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and asecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellarmass build-up.

0712.2017	the relation between stellar populations, structure and environment for  dwarf elliptical galaxies from the magpop-itp	dwarf galaxies, as the most numerous type of galaxy, offer the potential tostudy galaxy formation and evolution in detail in the nearby universe. althoughthey seem to be simple systems at first view, they remain poorly understood. inan attempt to alleviate this situation, the magpop eu research and trainingnetwork embarked on a study of dwarf galaxies named magpop-itp (peletier etal., 2007). in this paper, we present the analysis of a sample of 24 dwarfelliptical galaxies (des) in the virgo cluster and in the field, using opticallong-slit spectroscopy. we examine their stellar populations in combinationwith their light distribution and environment. we confirm and strengthenprevious results that des are, on average, younger and more metal-poor thannormal elliptical galaxies, and that their [alpha/fe] abundance ratios scatteraround solar. this is in accordance with the downsizing picture of galaxyformation where mass is the main driver for the star formation history. we alsofind new correlations between the luminosity-weighted mean age, the large-scaleasymmetry, and the projected virgocentric distance. we find that environmentplays an important role in the termination of the star formation activity byram pressure stripping of the gas in short timescales, and in thetransformation of disky dwarfs to more spheroidal objects by harassment overlonger timescales. this points towards a continuing infall scenario for theevolution of des.

1306.1238	new image statistics for detecting disturbed galaxy morphologies at high  redshift	testing theories of hierarchical structure formation requires estimating thedistribution of galaxy morphologies and its change with redshift. one aspect ofthis investigation involves identifying galaxies with disturbed morphologies(e.g., merging galaxies). this is often done by summarizing galaxy imagesusing, e.g., the cas and gini-m20 statistics of conselice (2003) and lotz etal. (2004), respectively, and associating particular statistic values withdisturbance. we introduce three statistics that enhance detection of disturbedmorphologies at high-redshift (z ~ 2): the multi-mode (m), intensity (i), anddeviation (d) statistics. we show their effectiveness by training amachine-learning classifier, random forest, using 1,639 galaxies observed inthe h band by the hubble space telescope wfc3, galaxies that had beenpreviously classified by eye by the candels collaboration (grogin et al. 2011,koekemoer et al. 2011). we find that the mid statistics (and the a statistic ofconselice 2003) are the most useful for identifying disturbed morphologies.  we also explore whether human annotators are useful for identifying disturbedmorphologies. we demonstrate that they show limited ability to detectdisturbance at high redshift, and that increasing their number beyondapproximately 10 does not provably yield better classification performance. wepropose a simulation-based model-fitting algorithm that mitigates these issuesby bypassing annotation.

1306.2424	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): linking star formation histories and  stellar mass growth	we present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (m* &lt;10^10 msun) galaxies from observations within the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. for ~73,000 galaxies between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, we calculate starformation rates (sfr) and specific star formation rates (ssfr = sfr/m*) fromspectroscopic halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived frombalmer decrements. we find a dependence of ssfr on stellar mass, such thatssfrs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and forthe full sample, ssfrs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. we usesimple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories toinvestigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale andthe formation redshift. we find that parametrizations previously fit to samplesof z~1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of ssfrs and stellar massesobserved in the gama sample between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32. in particular, a large numberof low-mass (m* &lt; 10^10 msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher ssfrsthan can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. for such alarge number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such highssfrs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining sfhwith stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.

1306.6333	chronos: a nir spectroscopic galaxy survey. from the formation of  galaxies to the peak of activity	chronos is our response to esa's call for white papers to define the sciencefor the future l2, l3 missions. chronos targets the formation and evolution ofgalaxies, by collecting the deepest nir spectroscopic data, from the formationof the first galaxies at z~10 to the peak of formation activity at z~1-3. thestrong emission from the atmospheric background makes this type of surveyimpossible from a ground-based observatory. the spectra of galaxies representthe equivalent of a dna fingerprint, containing information about the pasthistory of star formation and chemical enrichment. the proposed survey willallow us to dissect the formation process of galaxies including the timescalesof quenching triggered by star formation or agn activity, the effect ofenvironment, the role of infall/outflow processes, or the connection betweenthe galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes. to provide these data,the mission requires a 2.5m space telescope optimised for a campaign of verydeep nir spectroscopy. a combination of a high multiplex and very longintegration times will result in the deepest, largest, high-qualityspectroscopic dataset of galaxies from z=1 to 12, spanning the history of theuniverse, from 400 million to 6 billion years after the big bang, i.e. coveringthe most active half of cosmic history.

1401.5477	morphologies of z~0.7 agn host galaxies in candels: no trend of merger  incidence with agn luminosity	the processes that trigger active galactic nuclei (agn) remain poorlyunderstood. while lower luminosity agn may be triggered by minor disturbancesto the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to triggerluminous agn. major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for agntriggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques.there is however little observational evidence for a strong connection betweenagn and major mergers. we analyse the morphological properties of agn hostgalaxies as a function of agn and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to acarefully matched sample of control galaxies. agn are x-ray selected in theredshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and have luminosities 41 &lt; log(l_x [erg/s]) &lt;44.5. 'fake agn' are simulated in the control galaxies by adding point sourceswith the magnitude of the matched agn. we find that agn host and controlgalaxies have comparable assymetries, sersic indices and ellipticities atrestframe ~950nm. agn host galaxies show neither higher average asymmetries norhigher fractions of very disturbed objects. there is no increase in theprevalence of merger signatures with agn luminosity. at 95% confidence we findthat major mergers are responsible for &lt;6% of all agn in our sample as well as&lt;40% of the highest luminosity agn log(l_x [erg/s]) ~ 43.5). major mergerstherefore either play only a very minor role in the triggering of agn in theluminosity range studied or time delays are too long for merger features toremain visible.

1402.4139	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): testing galaxy formation models through  the most massive galaxies in the universe	we have analysed the growth of brightest group galaxies and brightest clustergalaxies (bggs/bcgs) over the last 3 billion years using a large sample of 883galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly survey. by comparing the stellarmass of bggs and bcgs in groups and clusters of similar dynamical masses, wefind no significant growth between redshift $z=0.27$ and $z=0.09$. we alsoexamine the number of bggs/bcgs that have line emission, finding thatapproximately 65 per cent of bggs/bcgs show h$\alpha$ in emission. from thegalaxies where the necessary spectroscopic lines were accurately recovered (54per cent of the sample), we find that half of this (i.e. 27 per cent of thesample) harbour on-going star formation with rates up to$10\,$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and the other half (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample)have an active nucleus (agn) at the centre. bggs are more likely to haveongoing star formation, while bcgs show a higher fraction of agn activity. byexamining the position of the bggs/bcgs with respect to their host dark matterhalo we find that around 13 per cent of them do not lie at the centre of thedark matter halo. this could be an indicator of recent cluster-cluster mergers.we conclude that bggs and bcgs acquired their stellar mass rapidly at higherredshifts as predicted by semi-analytic models, mildly slowing down at lowredshifts.

1406.4800	filamentary star formation in ngc 1275	we examine the star formation in the outer halo of ngc~1275, the centralgalaxy in the perseus cluster (abell 426), using far ultraviolet and opticalimages obtained with the hubble space telescope. we have identified apopulation of very young, compact star clusters with typical ages of a few myr.the star clusters are organised on multiple-kiloparsec scales. many of thesestar clusters are associated with "streaks" of young stars, the combination ofwhich has a cometary appearance. we perform photometry on the star clusters anddiffuse stellar streaks, and fit their spectral energy distributions to obtainages and masses. these young stellar populations appear to be normal in termsof their masses, luminosities and cluster formation efficiency; &lt;10% of theyoung stellar mass is located in star clusters. our data suggest star formationis associated with the evolution of some of the giant gas filaments in ngc~1275that become gravitationally unstable on reaching and possibly stalling in theouter galaxy. the stellar streaks then could represent stars moving onballistic orbits in the potential well of the galaxy cluster. we propose amodel where star-forming filaments, switched on ~50~myr ago and are currentlyfeeding the growth of the ngc~1275 stellar halo at a rate of ~2-3 solar massesper year. this type of process may also build stellar halos and form isolatedstar clusters in the outskirts of youthful galaxies.

1409.5122	the host galaxies of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei to z=2.5:  structure, star-formation and their relationships from candels and  herschel/pacs	we study the relationship between the structure and star-formation rate (sfr)of x-ray selected low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe two chandra deep fields, using hubble space telescope imaging from thecosmic assembly near infrared extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and deepfar-infrared maps from the pep+goods-herschel survey. we derive detaileddistributions of structural parameters and fir luminosities from carefullyconstructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of theagns. at z~1, agns show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive(non-agn) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxydisturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpystructure). in contrast, at z~2, agns show similar levels of galaxy disturbanceas inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which mayarise due to a more pronounced bulge in agn hosts or due to extinguishednuclear light. we undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but ourresults do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. the mean sfrand its distribution among agns and inactive galaxies are similar at z&gt;1.5. atz&lt;1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the sfrs of agnswith bulge-dominated light profiles. these trends suggest an evolution in therelation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards aminor role for mergers and interactions at z&gt;1.5.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

1507.00350	the formation history of massive cluster galaxies as revealed by carla	we use a sample of 37 of the densest clusters and protoclusters across $1.3\le z \le 3.2$ from the clusters around radio-loud agn (carla) survey to studythe formation of massive cluster galaxies. we use optical $i'$-band andinfrared 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m images to statistically select sources withinthese protoclusters and measure their median observed colours; $\langlei'-[3.6] \rangle$. we find the abundance of massive galaxies within theprotoclusters increases with decreasing redshift, suggesting these objects mayform an evolutionary sequence, with the lower redshift clusters in the samplehaving similar properties to the descendants of the high redshiftprotoclusters. we find that the protocluster galaxies have an approximatelyunevolving observed-frame $i'-[3.6]$ colour across the examined redshift range.we compare the evolution of the $\langle i'-[3.6] \rangle$ colour of massivecluster galaxies with simplistic galaxy formation models. taking the fullcluster population into account, we show that the formation of stars within themajority of massive cluster galaxies occurs over at least 2gyr, and peaks at $z\sim 2$-3. from the median $i'-[3.6]$ colours we cannot determine the starformation histories of individual galaxies, but their star formation must havebeen rapidly terminated to produce the observed red colours. finally, we showthat massive galaxies at $z&gt;2$ must have assembled within 0.5gyr of themforming a significant fraction of their stars. this means that few massivegalaxies in $z&gt;2$ protoclusters could have formed via dry mergers.

0705.2528	the millennium galaxy catalogue: the connection between close pairs and  asymmetry; implications for the galaxy merger rate	we compare the use of galaxy asymmetry and pair proximity for measuringgalaxy merger fractions and rates for a volume limited sample of 3184 galaxieswith -21 &lt; m(b) -5 log h &lt; -18 mag. and 0.010 &lt; z &lt; 0.123 drawn from themillennium galaxy catalogue. our findings are that:  (i) galaxies in close pairs are generally more asymmetric than isolatedgalaxies and the degree of asymmetry increases for closer pairs. at least 35%of close pairs (with projected separation of less than 20 h^{-1} kpc andvelocity difference of less than 500 km s^{-1}) show significant asymmetry andare therefore likely to be physically bound.  (ii) among asymmetric galaxies, we find that at least 80% are eitherinteracting systems or merger remnants. however, a significant fraction ofgalaxies initially identified as asymmetric are contaminated by nearby stars orare fragmented by the source extraction algorithm. merger rates calculated viaasymmetry indices need careful attention in order to remove the above sourcesof contamination, but are very reliable once this is carried out.  (iii) close pairs and asymmetries represent two complementary methods ofmeasuring the merger rate. galaxies in close pairs identify future mergers,occurring within the dynamical friction timescale, while asymmetries aresensitive to the immediate pre-merger phase and identify remnants.  (iv) the merger fraction derived via the close pair fraction and asymmetriesis about 2% for a merger rate of (5.2 +- 1.0) 10^{-4} h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}.these results are marginally consistent with theoretical simulations (dependingon the merger time-scale), but imply a flat evolution of the merger rate withredshift up to z ~1.

1511.05150	a mature galaxy cluster at z=1.58 around the radio galaxy 7c1753+6311	we report on the discovery of a z=1.58 mature cluster around thehigh-redshift radio galaxy 7c1753+6311, first identified in the clusters aroundradio-loud agn survey. two-thirds of the excess galaxies within the central1mpc lie on a red sequence with a colour that is consistent with an averageformation redshift of zf~3. we show that 80+/-6% of the red sequence galaxiesin the cluster core are quiescent, while the remaining 20% are red due to dustystar formation. we demonstrate that the cluster has an enhanced quiescentgalaxy fraction that is three times that of the control field. we also showthat this enhancement is mass dependent: 91+/-9% of the m* &gt;10^{10.5}msuncluster galaxies are quiescent, compared to only 36+/-2% of field galaxies,whereas the fraction of quiescent galaxies with lower masses is the same in thecluster and field environments. the presence of a dense core and a well-formed,quiescent red sequence suggest that this is a mature cluster. this means thatdistant radio galaxies do not solely reside in young, uncollapsedprotoclusters, rather they can be found in clusters in a wide range ofevolutionary states.

(2) half of the mid-type spiral and star-forming galaxies appear as a latermorphological type in the mid-uv, as astro/uit also found in the far-uv. some-times these differences are dramatic. the mid-uv images show a considerablerange in the scale and surface brightness of individual star-forming regions.almost all mid-type spirals have their small bulges bi-sected by a dust-lane.  (3) most of the heterogeneous subset of late-type, irregular, peculiar, andmerging galaxies display f300w morphologies that are similar to those seen inf814w, but with differences due to recognizable dust features absorbing thebluer light, and due to uv-bright hot stars, star-clusters, and star-formingridges.  in the rest-frame mid-uv, early- to mid-type galaxies are more likely to bemisclassified as later types than vice versa. this morphological k-correctionexplains only part of the excess faint blue galaxies seen in deep hst fields.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0502204	the mass assembly histories of galaxies of various morphologies in the  goods fields	we present an analysis of the growth of stellar mass with cosmic timepartitioned according to galaxy morphology. using a well-defined catalog of2150 galaxies based, in part, on archival data in the goods fields, we assignmorphological types in three broad classes (ellipticals, spirals,peculiar/irregulars) to a limit of z_ab=22.5 and make the resulting catalogpublicly available. we combine redshift information, optical photometry fromthe goods catalog and deep k-band imaging to assign stellar masses. we findlittle evolution in the form of the galaxy stellar mass function from z~1 toz=0, especially at the high mass end where our results are most robust.although the population of massive galaxies is relatively well established atz~1, its morphological mix continues to change, with an increasing proportionof early-type galaxies at later times. by constructing type-dependent stellarmass functions, we show that in each of three redshift intervals, e/s0'sdominate the higher mass population, while spirals are favored at lower masses.this transition occurs at a stellar mass of 2--3 times 10^{10} msun at z~0.3(similar to local studies) but there is evidence that the relevant mass scalemoves to higher mass at earlier epochs. such evolution may represent themorphological extension of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon, in which the mostmassive galaxies stop forming stars first, with lower mass galaxies becomingquiescent later. we infer that more massive galaxies evolve into spheroidalsystems at earlier times, and that this morphological transformation may onlybe completed 1--2 gyr after the galaxies emerge from their active star formingphase. we discuss several lines of evidence suggesting that merging may play akey role in generating this pattern of evolution.

astro-ph;0603032	the effects of interactions on the structure and morphology of  elliptical/lenticular galaxies in pairs	we present a photometric and structural analysis of 42 e/s0 galaxies in (e/s0+ s) pairs observed in the bvri color bands. we empirically determine theeffects of interactions on their morphology, structure and stellar populationsas seen from the light concentration (c), asymmetry (a), and clumpiness (s)parameters. we further compare these values to a control sample of 67 mostlyisolated, non-interacting e/s0 galaxies. the paired e/s0 galaxies occupy a morescattered loci in cas space than non-interacting e/s0's, and the structuraleffects of interactions on e/s0's are minor, in contrast to disk galaxiesinvolved in interactions. this suggests that observational methods forrecognizing interactions at high z, such the cas methodology, would hardlydetect e/s0's involved in interactions (related to early phases of the socalled `dry-mergers'). we however find statistical differences in a whencomparing isolated and interacting e/s0s. in the mean, paired e/s0 galaxieshave a values 2.96+-0.72 times larger than the ones of non-interacting e/s0's.for the subset of presumably strongly interacting e/s0's, a and s can beseveral times larger than the typical values of the isolated e/s0's. we showthat the asymmetries are consistent with several internal and externalmorphological distortions. we conclude that the interacting e/s0s in pairsshould be dense, gas poor galaxies in systems spaning a wide range ofinteraction stages, with typical merging timescales &gt;~ 0.1-0.5 gyr. we use theobserved phenomenology of these galaxies to predict the approximate loci of`dry pre-mergers' in the cas space.(abridged)

astro-ph;0607242	aegis: the diversity of bright near-ir selected distant red galaxies	we use deep and wide near infrared (nir) imaging from the palomar telescopecombined with deep2 spectroscopy and hubble space telescope (hst) and chandraspace telescope imaging to investigate the nature of galaxies that are red innir colors. we locate these `distant red galaxies' (drgs) through the color cut(j-k)_{vega} &gt; 2.3 over 0.7 deg^{2}, where we find 1010 drg candidates down tok_s = 20.5. we combine 95 high quality spectroscopic redshifts with photometricredshifts from brijk photometry to determine the redshift and stellar massdistributions for these systems, and morphological/structural and x-rayproperties for 107 drgs in the extended groth strip. we find that many bright(j-k)_{vega}&gt;2.3 galaxies with k_s&lt;20.5 are at redshifts z&lt;2, with 64% between1&lt;z&lt;2. the stellar mass distributions for these galaxies is broad, ranging from10^{9}-10^{12} m_solar, but with most z&gt;2 systems massive with m_*&gt;10^{11}m_solar. hst imaging shows that the structural properties and morphologies ofdrgs are also diverse, with the majority elliptical/compact (57%), and theremainder edge-on spirals (7%), and peculiar galaxies (29%). the drgs at z &lt;1.4 with high quality spectroscopic redshifts are generally compact, with smallhalf light radii, and span a range in rest-frame optical properties. thespectral energy distributions for these objects differ from higher redshiftdrgs: they are bluer by one magnitude in observed (i-j) color. a pure ir colorselection of high redshift populations is not sufficient to identify uniquepopulations, and other colors, or spectroscopic redshifts are needed to producehomogeneous samples.

astro-ph;0609466	far-infrared characterization of an ultra-luminous starburst associated  with a massively-accreting black hole at z=1.15	as part of the "all wavelength extended groth strip international survey"(aegis), we describe the panchromatic characterization of an x-ray luminousactive galactic nucleus (agn) in a merging galaxy at z=1.15. this object isdetected at infrared (8mic, 24mic, 70mic, 160mic), submillimeter (850mic) andradio wavelengths, from which we derive a bolometric luminosity l_bol ~ 9x10^12lsol. we find that the agn clearly dominates the hot dust emission below 40micbut its total energetic power inferred from the hard x-rays is substantiallyless than the bolometric output of the system. about 50% of the infraredluminosity is indeed produced by a cold dust component that probably originatesfrom enshrouded star formation in the host galaxy. in the context of a coevalgrowth of stellar bulges and massive black holes, this source might represent a``transition'' object sharing properties with both quasars and luminousstarbursts. study of such composite galaxies will help address how the starformation and disk-accretion phenomena may have regulated each other at highredshift and how this coordination may have participated to the build-up of therelationship observed locally between the masses of black holes and stellarspheroids.

astro-ph;0610842	aegis: extinction and star formation tracers from line emission	strong nebular emission lines are a sensitive probe of star formation andextinction in galaxies, and the [o ii] line detects star forming populationsout to z&gt;1. however, star formation rates from emission lines depend oncalibration of extinction and the [o ii]/h-alpha line ratio, and separatingstar formation from agn emission. we use calibrated line luminosities from thedeep2 survey and palomar k magnitudes to show that the behavior of emissionline ratios depends on galaxy magnitude and color. for galaxies on the blueside of the color bimodality, the vast majority show emission signatures ofstar formation, and there are strong correlations of extinction and [oii]/h-alpha with restframe h magnitude. the conversion of [o ii] toextinction-corrected h-alpha and thus to star formation rate has a significantslope with m_h, 0.23 dex/mag. red galaxies with emission lines have a muchhigher scatter in their line ratios, and more than half show agn signatures. weuse 24 micron fluxes from spitzer/mips to demonstrate the differing populationsprobed by nebular emission and by mid-ir luminosity. although extinction iscorrelated with luminosity, 98% of ir-luminous galaxies at z~1 are stilldetected in the [o ii] line. mid-ir detected galaxies are mostly bright andintermediate color, while fainter, bluer galaxies with high [o ii] luminosityare rarely detected at 24 microns.
