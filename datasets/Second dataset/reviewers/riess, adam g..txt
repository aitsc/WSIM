0905.0695	a redetermination of the hubble constant with the hubble space telescope  from a differential distance ladder	we report observations of 240 cepheid variables obtained with the nearinfrared camera (nicmos) through the f160w filter on the hubble space telescope(hst). the cepheids are distributed across six recent hosts of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and the "maser galaxy" ngc 4258, allowing us to directlycalibrate the peak luminosities of the sne ia from the precise, geometricdistance measurements provided by the masers. new features of our measurementinclude the use of the same instrument for all cepheid measurements across thedistance ladder and homogeneity of the cepheid periods and metallicities thusnecessitating only a differential measurement of cepheid fluxes and reducingthe largest systematic uncertainties in the determination of the fiducial sn ialuminosity. the nicmos measurements reduce differential extinction in the hostgalaxies by a factor of 5 over past optical data. combined with an expanded of240 sne ia at z&lt;0.1 which define their magnitude-redshift relation, we findh_0=74.2 +/-3.6, a 4.8% uncertainty including both statistical and systematicerrors. we show that the factor of 2.2 improvement in the precision of h_0 is asignificant aid to the determination of the equation-of-state of dark energy, w= p/(rho c^2). combined with the wmap 5-year measurement of omega_m h^2, wefind w= -1.12 +/- 0.12 independent of high-redshift sne ia or baryon acousticoscillations (bao). this result is also consistent with analyses based on thecombination of high-z sne ia and bao. the constraints on w(z) now with high-zsne ia and bao are consistent with a cosmological constant and improved by afactor of 3 from the refinement in h_0 alone. we show future improvements inh_0 are likely and will further contribute to multi-technique studies of darkenergy.

0905.0697	cepheid calibrations of modern type ia supernovae:implications for the  hubble constant	this is the first of two papers reporting measurements from a program todetermine the hubble constant to 5% precision from a refurbished distanceladder. we present new observations of 110 cepheid variables in the hostgalaxies of two recent type ia supernovae (sne ia), ngc 1309 and ngc 3021,using the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope (hst). wealso present new observations of the hosts previously observed with hst whosesne ia provide the most precise luminosity calibrations: sn 1994ae in ngc 3370,sn 1998aq in ngc 3982, sn 1990n in ngc 4639, and sn 1981b in ngc 4536, as wellas the maser host, ngc 4258. increasing the interval between observationsenabled the discovery of new, longer-period cepheids, including 57 with p&gt;60days, which extend these period-luminosity (pl) relations. we present 93measurements of the metallicity parameter, 12 + log[o/h], measured from hiiregions in the vicinity of the cepheids and show these are consistent withsolar metallicity. we find the slope of the seven dereddened pl relations to beconsistent with that of the large magellanic cloud cepheids and with parallaxmeasurements of galactic cepheids, and we address the implications for thehubble constant. we also present multi-band light curves of sn 2002fk (in ngc1309) and sn 1995al (in ngc 3021) which may be used to calibrate theirluminosities. in the second paper we present observations of the cepheids inthe h-band obtained with the near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometeron hst, further mitigating systematic errors along the distance ladderresulting from dust and chemical variations. the quality and homogeneity ofthese sn and cepheid data provide the basis for a more precise determination ofthe hubble constant.

0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0908.4274	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  hubble diagram and cosmological parameters	we present measurements of the hubble diagram for 103 type ia supernovae(sne) with redshifts 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.42, discovered during the first season (fall2005) of the sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey. these datafill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift sn ia surveys. wecombine the sdss-ii measurements with new distance estimates for published sndata from the essence survey, the supernova legacy survey, the hubble spacetelescope, and a compilation of nearby sn ia measurements. combining the snhubble diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the sdssluminous red galaxy sample and with cmb temperature anisotropy measurementsfrom wmap, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and omega_m, assuming aspatially flat cosmological model (fwcdm) with constant dark energy equation ofstate parameter, w. for the fwcdm model and the combined sample of 288 sne ia,we find w = -0.76 +- 0.07(stat) +- 0.11(syst), omega_m = 0.306 +- 0.019(stat)+- 0.023(syst) using mlcs2k2 and w = -0.96 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.12(syst), omega_m= 0.265 +- 0.016(stat) +- 0.025(syst) using the salt-ii fitter. we trace thediscrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame uv modelcombined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; thesedifferences mostly affect the distance estimates for the snls and hstsupernovae. we present detailed discussions of systematic errors for bothlight-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies inrest-frame $u$-band. for the salt-ii approach, we also see strong evidence forredshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta). restricting theanalysis to the 136 sne ia in the nearby+sdss-ii samples, we find much betteragreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties.

0910.5597	type ii-p supernovae from the sdss-ii supernova survey and the  standardized candle method	we apply the standardized candle method (scm) for type ii plateau supernovae(sne ii-p), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a sn to its luminosityduring the plateau, to 15 sne ii-p discovered over the three season run of thesloan digital sky survey - ii supernova survey. the redshifts of these sne -0.027 &lt; z &lt; 0.144 - cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature;in particular, our sne ii-p sample contains nearly as many sne in the hubbleflow (z &gt; 0.01) as all of the current literature on the scm combined. we findthat the sdss sne have a very small intrinsic i-band dispersion (0.22 mag),which can be attributed to selection effects. when the scm is applied to thecombined sdss-plus-literature set of sne ii-p, the dispersion increases to 0.29mag, larger than the scatter for either set of sne separately. we show that thestandardization cannot be further improved by eliminating sne with positiveplateau decline rates, as proposed in poznanski et al. (2009). we thoroughlyexamine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the scm to beuseful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the fe iivelocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompassthe intrinsic variations of type ii-p sne will be needed.

1001.3428	the rise and fall of type ia supernova light curves in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we analyze the rise and fall times of type ia supernova (sn ia) light curvesdiscovered by the sdss-ii supernova survey. from a set of 391 light curvesk-corrected to the rest frame b and v bands, we find a smaller dispersion inthe rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. this is inqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations inradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of thedecline rates. the differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggestthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properlymodel the range of sn ia light curve shapes. we select a subset of 105 lightcurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves anddevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall timesindependently. we find the average time from explosion to b-band peakbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days. our average rise time is shorter than the19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different lightcurve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. we findthat slow declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that thedistribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single-peaked. thisdistribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was firstsuggested by strovink (2007) from an analysis of a small set of local sne ia.we divide the sdss-ii sample in half based on the rise minus fall value, tr-tf&lt;= 2 days and tr-tf&gt;2 days, to search for differences in their host galaxyproperties and hubble residuals; we find no difference in host galaxyproperties or hubble residuals in our sample.

1001.3925	access: enabling an improved flux scale for astrophysics	improvements in the precision of the astrophysical flux scale are needed toanswer fundamental scientific questions ranging from cosmology to stellarphysics. the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe isaccelerating was based upon the measurement of astrophysical standard candlesthat appeared fainter than expected. to characterize the underlying physicalmechanism of the "dark energy" responsible for this phenomenon requires animprovement in the visible-nir flux calibration of astrophysical sources to 1%precision. these improvements will also enable large surveys of white dwarfstars, e.g. gaia, to advance stellar astrophysics by testing and providingconstraints for the mass-radius relationship of these stars.  access (absolute color calibration experiment for standard stars) is arocket-borne payload that will enable the transfer of absolute laboratorydetector standards from nist to a network of stellar standards with acalibration accuracy of 1% and a spectral resolving power of r = 500 across the0.35-1.7 micron bandpass.  among the strategies being employed to minimize calibration uncertaintiesare: (1) judicious selection of standard stars (previous calibration heritage,minimal spectral features, robust stellar atmosphere models), (2) execution ofobservations above the earth's atmosphere (eliminates atmospheric contaminationof the stellar spectrum), (3) a single optical path and detector (to minimizevisible to nir cross-calibration uncertainties), (4) establishment of an apriori error budget, (5) on-board monitoring of instrument performance, and (6)fitting stellar atmosphere models to the data to search for discrepancies andconfirm performance.

1001.4995	measurements of the rate of type ia supernovae at redshift z &lt; ~0.3 from  the sdss-ii supernova survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) ratebased on data from the sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey.the adopted sample of supernovae (sne) includes 516 sne ia at redshift z\lesssim 0.3, of which 270 (52%) are spectroscopically identified as sne ia.the remaining 246 sne ia were identified through their light curves; 113 ofthese objects have spectroscopic redshifts from spectra of their host galaxy,and 133 have photometric redshifts estimated from the sn light curves. based onconsideration of 87 spectroscopically confirmed non-ia sne discovered by thesdss-ii sn survey, we estimate that 2.04+1.61-0.95 % of the photometric sne iamay be misidentified. the sample of sne ia used in this measurement representsan order of magnitude increase in the statistics for sn ia rate measurements inthe redshift range covered by the sdss-ii supernova survey. if we assume a snia rate that is constant at low redshift (z &lt; 0.15), then the sn observationscan be used to infer a value of the sn rate of rv = (2.69+0.34+0.21-0.30-0.01)x10^{-5} sne yr^{-1} mpc-3 (h0 /(70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}))^{3} at a mean redshiftof ~ 0.12, based on 79 sne ia of which 72 are spectroscopically confirmed.however, the large sample of sne ia included in this study allows us to placeconstraints on the redshift dependence of the sn ia rate based on the sdss-iisupernova survey data alone. fitting a power-law model of the sn rateevolution, r_v(z) = a_p x ((1 + z)/(1 + z0))^{\nu}, over the redshift range 0.0&lt; z &lt; 0.3 with z0 = 0.21, results in a_p = (3.43+0.15-0.15) x 10^{-5} sneyr^{-1} mpc-3 (h0 /(70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}))^{3} and \nu = 2.04+0.90-0.89.

1002.2494	empirical delay time distributions of type ia supernovae from the  extended goods/hst supernova survey	using the hubble space telescope acs imaging of the goods north and southfields during cycles 11, 12, and 13, we derive empirical constraints on thedelay-time distribution function for type ia supernovae. we extend our previousanalysis to the three-year sample of 56 sne ia over the range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.8, usinga markov chain monte carlo to determine the best-fit unimodal delay-timedistribution function. the test, which ultimately compares the star formationrate density history to the unbinned volumetric sn ia rate history from thegoods/hst-sn survey, reveals a sn ia delay-time distribution that is tightlyconfined to 3-4 gyrs (to &gt;95% confidence). this result is difficult to resolvewith any intrinsic delay-time distribution function (bimodal or otherwise), inwhich a substantial fraction (e.g., &gt;10%) of events are ``prompt'', requiringless than approximately 1 gyr to develop from formation to explosion. theresult is, however, strongly motivated by the decline in the number of sne iaat z&gt;1.2. sub-samples of the hst-sn data confined to lower redshifts (z&lt;1) showplausible delay-time distributions that are dominated by prompt events, whichis more consistent with results from low-redshift supernova samples andsupernova host galaxy properties. scenarios in which a substantial fraction ofz&gt;1.2 supernovae are extraordinarily obscured by dust may partly explain thedifferences in low-z and high-z results. other possible resolutions may includeenvironmental dependencies (such as gas-phase metallicity) that affect theprogenitor mechanism efficiency, especially in the early universe.

1005.4687	the effect of host galaxies on type ia supernovae in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we present an analysis of the host galaxy dependencies of type ia supernovae(sne ia) from the full three year sample of the sdss-ii supernova survey. werediscover, to high significance, the strong correlation between host galaxytypeand the width of the observed sn light curve, i.e., fainter, quicklydeclining sne ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly decliningia's favor star-forming galaxies. we also find evidence (at between 2 to 3sigma) that sne ia are ~0.1 magnitudes brighter in passive host galaxies, thanin star-forming hosts, after the sn ia light curves have been standardizedusing the light curve shape and color variations: this difference in brightnessis present in both the salt2 and mcls2k2 light curve fitting methodologies. wesee evidence for differences in the sn ia color relationship between passiveand star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the mlcs2k2 technique, we see thatsne ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of r_v ~1, while sne ia instar-forming hosts require r_v ~2. the significance of these trends depends onthe range of sn colors considered. we demonstrate that these effects can beparameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a confidence of&gt;4 sigma) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical fitto our data. our results suggest that future cosmological analyses of sn iasamples should include host galaxy information.

1009.1903	characterizing the contaminating distance distribution for bayesian  supernova cosmology	measurements of the equation of state of dark energy from surveys ofthousands of type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be limited by spectroscopicfollow-up and must therefore rely on photometric identification, increasing thechance that the sample is contaminated by core collapse supernovae (cc sne).bayesian methods for supernova cosmology can remove contamination bias whilemaintaining high statistical precision but are sensitive to the choice ofparameterization of the contaminating distance distribution. we use simulationsto investigate the form of the contaminating distribution and its dependence onthe absolute magnitudes, light curve shapes, colors, extinction, and redshiftsof core collapse supernovae. we find that the cc luminosity function dominatesthe distance distribution function, but its shape is increasingly distorted asthe redshift increases and more cc sne fall below the survey magnitude limit.the shapes and colors of the cc light curves generally shift the distancedistribution, and their effect on the cc distances is correlated. we comparethe simulated distances to the first year results of the sdss-ii sn survey andfind that the sdss distance distributions can be reproduced with simulated ccsne that are ~1 mag fainter than the standard richardson et al. (2002)luminosity functions, which do not produce a good fit. to exploit the fullpower of the bayesian parameter estimation method, parameterization of thecontaminating distribution should be guided by the current knowledge of the ccluminosity functions, coupled with the effects of the survey selection andmagnitude-limit, and allow for systematic shifts caused by the parameters ofthe distance fit.

1010.2749	a mismatch in the ultraviolet spectra between low-redshift and  intermediate-redshift type ia supernovae as a possible systematic uncertainty  for supernova cosmology	we present keck high-quality rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) through opticalspectra of 21 type ia supernovae (sne ia) in the redshift range 0.11 &lt; z &lt; 0.37and a mean redshift of 0.22 that were discovered during the sloan digital skysurvey-ii (sdss-ii) sn survey. using the broad-band photometry of the sdsssurvey, we are able to reconstruct the sn host-galaxy spectral energydistributions (seds), allowing for a correction for the host-galaxycontamination in the sn ia spectra. comparison of composite spectra constructedfrom a subsample of 17 high-quality spectra to those created from alow-redshift sample with otherwise similar properties shows that the keck/sdsssne ia have, on average, extremely similar rest-frame optical spectra but showa uv flux excess. this observation is confirmed by comparing synthesizedbroad-band colors of the individual spectra, showing a difference in meancolors at the 2.4 - 4.4 sigma level for various uv colors. we further see aslight difference in the uv spectral shape between sne with low-mass andhigh-mass host galaxies. additionally, we detect a relationship between theflux ratio at 2770 and 2900 a and peak luminosity that differs from thatobserved at low redshift. we find that changing the uv sed of an sn ia withinthe observed dispersion can change the inferred distance moduli by ~0.1 mag.this effect only occurs when the data probe the rest-frame uv. we suggest thatthis discrepancy could be due to differences in the host-galaxy population ofthe two sn samples or to small-sample statistics.

1201.2434	observational probes of cosmic acceleration	the accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprisingcosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominatedby some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or thateinstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. the profoundimplications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimentalefforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure withpercent-level precision or higher. we review in detail the four most wellestablished methods for making such measurements: type ia supernovae, baryonacoustic oscillations (bao), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters.we pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniquesand to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "stageiv" dark energy facilities such as bigboss, lsst, euclid, and wfirst. webriefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-spacedistortions, the alcock-paczynski test, and direct measurements of h_0. wepresent extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation ofstate and parameterized deviations from gr, achievable with stage iii and stageiv experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, bao, weak lensing, andcmb data. we also show the level of precision required for other methods toprovide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. weemphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the mostpowerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertaintiesand to take advantage of complementary information. surveys to probe cosmicacceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue thelongstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greaterdetail over ever larger scales.

1306.4050	color dispersion and milky way reddening among type ia supernovae	past analyses of type ia supernovae (sne ia) have identified an irreduciblescatter of 5-10% in distance widely attributed to an intrinsic dispersion inluminosity. another, equally valid, source of this scatter is intrinsicdispersion in color. misidentification of the true source of this scatter canbias both the retrieved color-luminosity relation and cosmological parametermeasurements. the size of this bias depends on the magnitude of the intrinsiccolor dispersion relative to the distribution of colors that correlate withdistance. we produce a realistic simulation of a misattribution of intrinsicscatter, and find a negative bias in the recovered color-luminosity relation,beta, of dbeta -1.0 (~33%) and a positive bias in the equation of stateparameter, w, of dw +0.04 (~4%). we re-analyze current published data sets withthe assumptions that the distance scatter is predominantly the result of color.unlike previous analyses, we find that the data are consistent with a milky wayreddening law r_v=3.1, and that a milky way dust model better predicts theasymmetric color-luminosity trends than the conventional luminosity scatterhypothesis. we also determine that accounting for color variation reduces thecorrelation between various host galaxy properties and hubble residuals by~20%.

1401.0484	parallax beyond a kiloparsec from spatially scanning the wide field  camera 3 on the hubble space telescope	we use a newly developed observing mode on the hubble space telescope (hst)and wide field camera 3 (wfc3), spatial scanning, to increase source sampling athousand-fold and measure changes in source positions to a precision of 20--40microarcseconds, more than an order of magnitude better than attainable inpointed observations. this observing mode can usefully measure the parallaxesof bright stars at distances of up to 5 kpc, a factor of ten farther thanachieved thus far with hst. long-period classical cepheid variable stars in themilky way, nearly all of which reside beyond 1 kpc, are especially compellingtargets for parallax measurements from scanning, as they may be used to anchora determination of the hubble constant to ~1%. we illustrate the method bymeasuring to high precision the parallax of a classical cepheid, sy aurigae, ata distance of more than 2 kpc, using 5 epochs of spatial-scan data obtained atintervals of 6 months. rapid spatial scans also enable photometric measurementsof bright milky way cepheids---which would otherwise saturate even in theshortest possible pointed observations---on the same flux scale asextragalactic cepheids, which is a necessity for reducing a leading source ofsystematic error in the hubble constant. we demonstrate this capability withphotometric measurements of sy aur on the same system used for cepheids in typeia supernova host galaxies. while the technique and results presented here arepreliminary, an ongoing program with hst is collecting such parallaxmeasurements for another 18 cepheids to produce a better anchor for thedistance scale.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

1408.1089	a luminous, blue progenitor system for a type-iax supernova	type-iax supernovae (sn iax) are stellar explosions that arespectroscopically similar to some type-ia supernovae (sn ia) at maximum light,except with lower ejecta velocities. they are also distinguished by lowerluminosities. at late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from othersn, but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-masselements) suggests a physical connection to normal sn ia. these are not rare;sn iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal sn ia rate. the leadingmodels for sn iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen whitedwarfs that do not completely unbind the star, implying they are "lesssuccessful" cousins of normal sn ia, where complete disruption is observed.here we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of thetype-iax sn 2012z in deep pre-explosion imaging. its luminosity, colors,environment, and similarity to the progenitor of the galactic helium nova v445puppis, suggest that sn 2012z was the explosion of a white dwarf accreting froma helium-star companion. observations in the next few years, after sn 2012z hasfaded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernovawas actually the explosive death of a massive star.

(2011) h$_0$measurement. we find little evidence that sne ia in locally star-formingenvironments are fainter after light curve correction than sne ia in locallypassive environments. we find a difference of only 0.000$\pm$0.018 (stat+sys)mag for sne fit with salt2 and 0.029$\pm$0.027 (stat+sys) mag for sne fit withmlcs2k2 (r$_v$ = 2.5), which suggests that proposed changes to recentmeasurements of h$_0$ and w are not significant and numerically smaller thanthe parameter measurement uncertainties. we find the greatly reducedsignificance of these distance modulus differences compared to rigault et al.(2013) and rigault et al. (2015) result from two improvements with fairly equaleffects, our larger sample size and the use of jla and riess et al. (2011)sample selection criteria. without these improvements, we recover the resultsof rigault et al. (2015). we find that both populations have more similardispersion in distance than found by rigault et al. (2013), rigault et al.(2015), and kelly et al. (2015), with slightly smaller dispersion for locallypassive sne ia fit with mlcs, the opposite of the effect seen by rigault et al.(2015) and kelly et al.

astro-ph;0107318	the unique type ia supernova 2000cx in ngc 524	we present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the typeia supernova (sn ia) 2000cx in the s0 galaxy ngc 524, which reveal it to bepeculiar. photometrically, sn 2000cx is different from all known sne ia, andits light curves cannot be fit well by the fitting techniques currentlyavailable. there is an apparent asymmetry in the $b$-band peak, in which thepremaximum brightening is relatively fast (similar to that of the normal sn1994d), but the postmaximum decline is relatively slow (similar to that of theoverluminous sn 1991t). the color evolution of sn 2000cx is also peculiar: the$(b - v)_0$ color has a unique plateau phase and the $(v - r)_0$ and $(v -i)_0$ colors are very blue.  although the premaximum spectra of sn 2000cx are similar to those of sn1991t-like objects (with weak si ii lines), its overall spectral evolution isquite different. the si ii lines that emerged near maximum $b$-band brightnessstay strong in sn 2000cx until about three weeks past maximum. the change inthe excitation stages of iron-peak elements is slow. both the iron-peak and theintermediate-mass elements are found to be moving at very high expansionvelocities in the ejecta of sn 2000cx.  we discuss theoretical models for sn 2000cx. sn 2000cx may be an overluminousobject like sn 1991t, but with a larger yield of $^{56}$ni and a higher kineticenergy in the ejecta. we also briefly discuss the implications of ourobservations for the luminosity vs. light-curve width relation.

(1998a) and perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernovaluminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. more importantly, theyextend the redshift range of consistently observed sn ia to z~1, where thesignature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausiblesystematic effects. consequently, these measurements not only provide anotherquantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitutea powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.we find a rate for sn ia of 1.4+/-0.5e-04 h^3/mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of0.5. we present distances and host extinctions for 230 sn ia. these place thefollowing constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of stateparameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then h0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and o_l - 1.4o_m = 0.35+/-0.14. including the constraint of a flat universe, we find o_m =0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. adopting aprior based on the 2df redshift survey constraint on o_m and assuming a flatuniverse, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy liesin the range -1.48&lt;w&lt;-0.72 at 95% confidence. if we further assume that w&gt;-1,we obtain w&lt;-0.73 at 95% confidence. these constraints are similar in precisionand in value to recent results reported using the wmap satellite, also incombination with the 2df redshift survey.

astro-ph;0406547	high redshift supernova rates	we use a sample of 42 supernovae detected with the advanced camera forsurveys on-board the hubble space telescope as part of the great observatoriesorigins deep survey to measure the rate of core collapse supernovae to z~0.7and type ia supernovae to z~1.6. this significantly increases the redshiftrange where supernova rates have been estimated from observations.  the rate of core collapse supernovae can be used as an independent probe ofthe cosmic star formation rate. based on the observations of 17 core collapsesupernovae, we measure an increase in the core collapse supernova rate by afactor of 1.6 in the range 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.7, and an overall increase by a factor of 7to z~0.7 in comparison to the local core collapse supernova rate. the increasein the rate in this redshift range in consistent with recent measurements ofthe star formation rate derived from uv-luminosity densities and ir datasets.  based on 25 type ia supernovae, we find a sn ia rate that is a factor 3-5higher at z~1 compared to earlier estimates at lower redshifts (z&lt;0.5),implying that the type ia supernova rate traces a higher star formation rate atredshifts z&gt;1 compared to low redshift. at higher redshift (z&gt;1), we find asuggested decrease in the type ia rate with redshift. this evolution of the iarate with redshift is consistent with a type ia progenitor model where there isa substantial delay between the formation of the progenitor star and theexplosion of the supernova. assuming that the type ia progenitor stars haveinitial main sequence masses 3-8 m_sun, we find that 5-7% of the availableprogenitors explode as type ia supernovae.
