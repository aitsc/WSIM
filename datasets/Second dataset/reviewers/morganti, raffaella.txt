0902.0863	broad hi absorption in the candidate binary black-hole 4c37.11 (b2  0402+379)	we report the discovery of extremely broad 21-cm hi absorption (fwzi ~1600km/s) detected with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope in the radiosource 4c37.11 (b2 0402+379). this object has been claimed to host asuper-massive binary black hole (rodriguez et al. 2006). the main features inthe absorption profile are two components, separated by ~1100 km/s. the hiabsorption in 4c37.11 is unusual because it is the first case where such broadabsorption is found to be centred on the systemic velocity of the host galaxyand not asymmetric and blueshifted as is seen in all other galaxies with broadhi absorption. given the large width of the absorption, we suggest that apossible explanation for the extreme properties of the hi absorption is that itis the kinematic signature of a binary black hole. if this interpretation iscorrect, the combined black hole mass derived from the absorption profile isconsistent with that derived from the luminosity of the spheroid. if the broadabsorption is indeed due to a binary black hole, this finding confirms theimportance of the gaseous component in the merging process of supermassiveblack holes.

0903.5331	eso 381-47, an early-type galaxy with extended hi and a star forming  ring	eso 381-47 is an early type galaxy with an extended hi disk. galex and verydeep optical images reveal a distinct stellar ring far outside the optical bodywith a diameter of ~30 kpc, which has undergone recent star formation at 1.8 x10^-4 msun/yr/kpc^-2, consistent with other new results which detect low levelstar formation below the traditional kennicutt relation in the outer parts ofspiral galaxies. the morphology of this galaxy resembles the recentlyidentified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, orxuv-disks. new hi observations of this galaxy taken at the atca and in the cnbarray at the vla show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~90 kpc)ring around the central s0 galaxy. the hi data cube can be well modeled by awarped ring. the faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy iskinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibitvelocities consistent with the rotation of the hi ring at larger radius. thepeak of the stellar ring, as seen in the optical and uv, is slightly displacedto the inside relative to the peak of the hi ring. we discuss the manner inwhich this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wavethrough an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision atthe center of the disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up atearly times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. gas accretion andresonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered toexplain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the galex and deepoptical data.

0910.4238	is centaurus a special? a neutral hydrogen perspective	due to the proximity, the neutral hydrogen belonging to centaurus a can beobserved at high resolution with good sensitivity. this allows to study themorphology and kinematics in detail in order to understand the evolution ofthis radio-loud source (e.g. merger history, agn activity). at the same time,it is important to compare the results to other sources of the same class (i.e.early-type galaxies in general and radio galaxies in particular) to see howcentaurus a fits into the global picture of early-type/radio galaxy evolution.the amount of hi, the morphology of a warped disk with hi clouds surroundingthe disk and the regular kinematics of the inner part of the hi disk are notunusual for early-type galaxies. the growing evidence that mergers are notnecessarily responsible for agn activity fits with the observational resultthat the recent merger event in centaurus a is not connected to the currentphase of activity. based on these results, we conclude that centaurus a hastypical neutral hydrogen properties for an early-type and radio galaxy and itcan therefore - from an hi perspective - be seen as a typical example of itsclass.

0911.4531	hi in radio galaxies: prospects for upcoming wide-field surveys	we present results of an ongoing systematic study of the large-scaleproperties of neutral hydrogen (hi) gas in nearby radio galaxies. our main goalis to investigate the importance of gas-rich galaxy mergers and interactionsamong radio-loud agn. from an hi study of a complete sample of classicallow-power radio galaxies we find that the host galaxies of extended fanaroff &amp;riley type-i radio sources are generally hi poor (&lt; 10e8 m_sun) and show noindications for gas-rich galaxy mergers or ongoing gas-rich interactions. incontrast, the host galaxies of a significant fraction of low-power compactradio sources contain enormous discs/rings of hi gas (with sizes up to 190 kpcand masses up to 2 x 10e10 m_sun). this segregation in hi mass with radiosource size likely indicates that these compact radio sources are eitherconfined by large amounts of gas in the central region, or that their fuelingis inefficient and different from the fueling process of classical fr-i radiosources. to a first order, the overall hi properties of our complete sample(detection rate, mass and morphology) appear similar to those of radio-quietearly-type galaxies. if confirmed by better statistics, this would imply thatlow-power radio-agn activity may be a short phase that occurs at some pointduring the lifetime of many early-type galaxies. we discuss how upcoming hisurveys (e.g. with askap and apertif) are essential for studying in astatistical way the the connection between the presence and morphology of aradio-loud agn and the properties of the cold hi gas associated with its hostgalaxy.

1001.2389	cold and warm gas outflows in radio agn	the study of the conditions and the kinematics of the gas in the centralregion of agn provides important information on the relevance of feedbackeffects connected to the nuclear activity. quantifying these effects is key forconstraining galaxy evolution models. here we present a short summary of ourrecent efforts to study the occurrence and the impact of gas outflows inradio-loud agn that are in their first phase of their evolution. clear evidencefor agn-induced outflows have been found for the majority of these young radiosources. the outflows are detected both in (warm) ionized as well in (cold)atomic neutral gas and they are likely to be driven (at least in most of thecases) by the interaction between the expanding jet and the medium. the massoutflow rates of the cold gas (hi) appear to be systematically higher thanthose of the ionized gas. the former reach up to ~50 msun/yr, and are in thesame range as "mild" starburst-driven superwinds in ulirgs, whilst the latterare currently estimated to be a few solar masses per year. however, the kineticpowers associated with these gaseous outflow are a relatively small fraction (afew x 10^-4) of the eddington luminosity of the galaxy. thus, they do notappear to match the requirements of the galaxy evolution feedback models.

1005.4208	a collisional origin for the leo ring	extended hi structures around galaxies are of prime importance to probegalaxy formation scenarios. the giant hi ring in the leo group is one of thelargest and most intriguing hi structures in the nearby universe. whether itconsists of primordial gas, as suggested by the apparent absence of any opticalcounterpart and the absence of an obvious physical connection to nearbygalaxies, or of gas expelled from a galaxy in a collision is actively debated.we present deep wide field-of-view optical images of the ring region obtainedwith megacam on the cfht. they reveal optical counterparts to several hi and uvcondensations along the ring, in the g', r', and i' bands, which likelycorrespond to stellar associations formed within the gaseous ring. analyzingthe spectral energy distribution of one of these star-forming regions, we foundit to be typical for a star-forming region in pre-enriched tidal debris. wethen use simulations to test the hypothesis that the leo ring results from ahead-on collision between leo group members ngc 3384 and m96. according to ourmodel which is able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main observationalproperties of the system, the leo ring is consistent with being a collisionalring. it is thus likely another example of extended intergalactic gas made-upof pre-enriched collisional debris.

1007.2059	early-type galaxies in different environments: an hi view	we present an analysis of deep wsrt observations of the hi in 33 nearbyearly-type galaxies selected from a sample studied earlier at opticalwavelengths with the sauron integral-field spectrograph. the sample covers bothfield environments and the virgo cluster. our analysis shows that gas accretionplays a role in the evolution of field early-type galaxies, but less so forthose in clusters. for detection limits of a few times 10^6 msun, hi isdetected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies, while &lt;10% of the virgo objectsare detected. in about half of the detections, the hi forms a regularlyrotating disc or ring. all hi discs have counterparts of ionised gas and innerhi discs are also detected in molecular gas. the cold ism is dominated bymolecular gas (m_h2/m_hi ~ 10). we conclude that accretion of hi is common forfield early-type galaxies, but the amount of material involved is usuallysmall. cluster galaxies appear not to accrete hi. the few galaxies with asignificant young sub-population all have inner gas discs, but for theremaining galaxies there is no trend between stellar population and hi. someearly-type galaxies are very gas rich, but only have an old population. thestellar populations of field galaxies are typically younger than those invirgo. this is likely related to differences in accretion history. in about 50%of the galaxies we detect a central continuum source. in many objects thisemission is from a low-luminosity agn, in some it is consistent with theobserved star formation. galaxies with hi in the central regions are morelikely detected in continuum. this is due to a higher probability for starformation to occur in such galaxies and not to hi-related agn fuelling.(abridged)

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1112.5093	radio jets and outflows of cold gas	massive gas outflows are considered a key component in the process of galaxyformation and evolution. it is, therefore, not surprising that a lot of effortis going in quantifying their impact via detailed observations. this shortcontribution presents recent results obtained from hi and co observations ofdifferent objects where the agn - and in particular the radio jet - is likelyplaying an important role in producing the gas outflows. these preliminaryresults are reinforcing the conclusion that these outflows have a complex andmultiphase structure where cold gas in different phases (atomic and molecular)is involved and likely represent a major component. these results will alsoprovide important constraints for establishing how the interaction betweenagn/radio jet and the surrounding ism occurs and how efficiently the gas shouldcool to produce the observed properties of the outflowing gas. hi likelyrepresents an intermediate phase in this process, while the molecular gas wouldbe the final stage. whether the estimated outflow masses match what expectedfrom simulations of galaxy formation, it is still far from clear.

1112.5221	classical radio source propagating into outer hi disc in ngc 3801	we present observations of a large-scale disc of neutral hydrogen (hi) in thenearby fanaroff &amp; riley type-i radio galaxy ngc 3801 with the westerborksynthesis radio telescope. the hi disc (34 kpc in diameter and with m_hi = 1.3x 10^9 m_sun) is aligned with the radio jet axis. this makes ngc 3801 an idealsystem for investigating the evolution of a small radio source through its hostgalaxy's cold ism. the large-scale hi disc is perpendicular to a known inner codisc and dust-lane. we argue that the formation history of the large-scale hidisc is in agreement with earlier speculation that ngc 3801 was involved in apast gas-rich galaxy-galaxy merger (although other formation histories arediscussed). the fact that ngc 3801 is located in an environment of severalhi-rich companions, and shows indications of ongoing interaction with thenearby companion ngc 3802, strengthens this possibility. the large amounts ofambient cold ism, combined with x-ray results by croston et al (2007) on thepresence of over-pressured radio jets and evidence for an obscuring torus, areproperties that are generally not, or no longer, associated with more evolvedfr-i radio sources. we do show, however, that the hi properties of ngc 3801 arecomparable to those of a significant fraction of nearby low-power compact radiosources, suggesting that studies of ngc 3801 may reveal important insight intoa more general phase in the evolution of at least a significant fraction ofnearby radio galaxies.

1201.0885	simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the link with fast rotators,  slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies (etgs) through mergers with asample of 70 high-resolution numerical simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies. these simulations encompass various mass ratios, initial conditionsand orbital parameters. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with massratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators accordingto the atlas3d criterion: they preserve the structure of the input fastrotating spiral progenitors. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1)lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the slow rotators hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. the mass ratio of theprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators inbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitorgalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. the importance of theinitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxymergers of the galmer project.

1201.1503	strong molecular hydrogen emission and kinematics of the multiphase gas  in radio galaxies with fast jet-driven outflows	observations of ionized and neutral gas outflows in radio-galaxies (rgs)suggest that agn radio jet feedback has a galaxy-scale impact on the host ism,but it is still unclear how the molecular gas is affected. we present deepspitzer irs spectroscopy of 8 rgs that show fast hi outflows. all of thesehi-outflow rgs have bright h2 mid-ir lines that cannot be accounted for by uvor x-ray heating. this suggests that the radio jet, which drives the hioutflow, is also responsible for the shock-excitation of the warm h2 gas. inaddition, the warm h2 gas does not share the kinematics of the ionized/neutralgas. the mid-ir ionized gas lines are systematically broader than the h2 lines,which are resolved by the irs (with fwhm up to 900km/s) in 60% of the detectedh2 lines. in 5 sources, the neii line, and to a lesser extent the neiii and nevlines, exhibit blue-shifted wings (up to -900km/s with respect to the systemicvelocity) that match the kinematics of the outflowing hi or ionized gas. the h2lines do not show broad wings, except tentative detections in 3 sources. thisshows that, contrary to the hi gas, the h2 gas is inefficiently coupled to theagn jet-driven outflow of ionized gas. while the dissipation of a smallfraction (&lt;10%) of the jet kinetic power can explain the dynamical heating ofthe molecular gas, our data show that the bulk of the warm molecular gas is notexpelled from these galaxies.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

0711.1775	the shape of the dark matter halo in the early-type galaxy ngc 2974	we present hi observations of the elliptical galaxy ngc 2974, obtained withthe very large array. these observations reveal that the previously detected hidisc in this galaxy (kim et al. 1988) is in fact a ring. by studying theharmonic expansion of the velocity field along the ring, we constrain theelongation of the halo and find that the underlying gravitational potential isconsistent with an axisymmetric shape.  we construct mass models of ngc 2974 by combining the hi rotation curve withthe central kinematics of the ionised gas, obtained with the integral-fieldspectrograph sauron. we introduce a new way of correcting the observedvelocities of the ionised gas for asymmetric drift, and hereby disentangle therandom motions of the gas caused by gravitational interaction from those causedby turbulence. to reproduce the observed flat rotation curve of the hi gas, weneed to include a dark halo in our mass models. a pseudo-isothermal sphereprovides the best model to fit our data, but we also tested an nfw halo andmodified newtonian dynamics (mond), which fit the data marginally worse.  the mass-to-light ratio m/l_i increases in ngc 2974 from 4.3 (m/l_i)sun atone effective radius to 8.5 (m/l_i)sun at 5 re. this increase of m/l alreadysuggests the presence of dark matter: we find that within 5 re at least 55 percent of the total mass is dark.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1207.4348	recurrent radio emission and gas supply: the case of the radio galaxy b2  0258+35	outlined is the discovery of a very faint, diffuse, low surface-brightness(0.5 \mjybeam, 1.4 \mjyarcminsq on average) structure around the radio sourceb2 0258+35 hosted by an hi-rich early-type galaxy (ngc 1167). since b2 0258+35is a young compact steep spectrum (css) source, the newly discovered structurecould represent a remnant from an earlier stage of agn activity.  we go on by explaining in detail all the possibilities for triggering theradio activity in b2 0258+35 regarding gas accretion in a recurrent agnactivity framework.  ngc 1167 hosts a very regular, extended and massive \hi\ disc that has beenstudied in great detail. previous studies of the \hi\ closer to the core seemto go against the assumption of a circum-nuclear disc of \hi\ as the source ofthe accreting gas.  we consider the cooling of gas from the hot, x-ray halo as a possiblealternative option for the fueling of the agn, as suggested in the case ofother sources of similar radio power as b2 0258+35.  estimates are given for the age of the faint diffuse emission as well as forthe current accretion rate, which are in good agreement with literature values.  if our assumptions about the accretion mechanism are correct, similarlarge-scale, relic-like structures should be more commonly found aroundearly-type galaxies and this will be hopefully confirmed by the next generationof sensitive, low-frequency radio surveys.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1302.2236	tracing the extreme interplay between radio jets and the ism in ic5063	we report the discovery with the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex) of anoutflow of molecular gas in the radio-loud seyfert galaxy ic5063 (z = 0.0110).in addition to the emission of the large-scale co disk, a prominent blueshiftedwing is observed in the co(2-1) spectrum. ic5063 represents one of the bestcases of a fast jet-driven hi (and ionized gas) outflow, which is located atthe site of a radio-bright feature about 0.5 kpc from the nucleus. it ispossible that the blueshifted part of the molecular gas is associated with thisoutflow and is accelerated by the interaction with the radio jet. the outflowof molecular gas is characterized by an h$_2$ mass of the outflowing componentof between 2.25 +/- 0.70 x 10^7 m_sun and 1.29 +/- 0.40 x 10^8 m_sun and a massoutflow rate between 22 and 129 m_sun/yr depending on the assumption foralpha_x and assuming a luminosity ratio l'_co(2-1)/l'_co(1-0) = 1. thisconfirms that this may indeed be the dominant component in outflows driven bythe nuclear activity that are also found in other objects. however, this highmass outflow rate cannot easily be supported for a long time, suggesting thatthe gas outflow in ic5063 happens in bursts and is in a particularly strongphase at present. owing to its proximity, ic5063 serves as an excellentlaboratory for understanding the impact of radio jets on the gas-richinter-stellar medium.

0712.2852	stellar populations, neutral hydrogen and ionised gas in field  early-type galaxies	we present a study of the stellar populations of a sample of 39 local, fieldearly-type galaxies whose hi properties are known from interferometric data.our aim is to understand whether stellar age and chemical composition depend onthe hi content of galaxies. as a by-product of our analysis, we also studytheir ionised gas content and how it relates to the neutral hydrogen gas.stellar populations and ionised gas are studied from optical long-slit spectra.we determine stellar age, metallicity and alpha-to-iron ratio by analysing aset of lick/ids line-strength indices measured from the spectra after modellingand subtracting the ionised-gas emission. we do not find any trend in thestellar populations parameters with m(hi). however, we do find that, at stellarvelocity dispersion below 230 km/s, 2/3 of the galaxies with less than 100million solar masses of hi are centrally rejuvenated, while none of thehi-richer systems are. furthermore, none of the more massive(velocity-dispersion&gt;230 km/s) objects are centrally rejuvenated independentlyon their hi mass. concerning the ionised gas, we detect emission in 60% of thesample. this is generally extended and always carachterised by liner-likeemission-line ratios at any radius. we find that a large hi mass is necessary(but not sufficient) for a galaxy to host bright ionised-gas emission. aplausible interpretation of our results is that gas-rich mergers play asignificant role in e/s0 formation, especially at lower mass. within thispicture, hi-poor, centrally-rejuvenated objects could form in mergers where gasangular-momentum removal (and therefore inflow) is efficient; hi-rich galaxieswith no significant age gradients (but possibly uniformly young) could beformed in interactions characterised by high-angular momentum gas.

1307.4535	the location and impact of jet-driven outflows of cold gas: the case of  3c293	the nearby radio galaxy 3c293 is one of a small group of objects whereextreme outflows of neutral hydrogen have been detected. however, due to thelimited spatial resolution of previous observations, the exact location of theoutflow was not able to be determined. in this letter, we present new higherresolution vla observations of the central regions of this radio source anddetect a fast outflow of hi with a fwzi velocity of \delta v~1200 km/sassociated with the inner radio jet, approximately 0.5 kpc west of the centralcore. we investigate possible mechanisms which could produce the observed hioutflow and conclude that it is driven by the radio-jet. however, this outflowof neutral hydrogen is located on the opposite side of the nucleus to theoutflow of ionised gas previously detected in this object. we calculate a massoutflow rate in the range of 8-50 solar masses/yr corresponding to a kineticenergy power injected back into the ism of 1.38x10^{42} - 1.00x10^{43} erg/s or0.01 - 0.08 percent of the eddington luminosity. this places it just outsidethe range required by some galaxy evolution simulations for negative feedbackfrom the agn to be effective in halting star-formation within the galaxy.

0801.4769	cold gas &amp; mergers: fundamental difference in hi properties of different  types of radio galaxies?	we present results of a study of large-scale neutral hydrogen (hi) gas innearby radio galaxies. we find that the early-type host galaxies of differenttypes of radio sources (compact, fr-i and fr-ii) appear to containfundamentally different large-scale hi properties: enormous regular rotatingdisks and rings are present around the host galaxies of a significant fractionof low power compact radio sources, while no large-scale hi is detected in lowpower, edge-darkened fr-i radio galaxies. preliminary results of a study ofnearby powerful, edge-brightened fr-ii radio galaxies show that these systemsgenerally contain significant amounts of large-scale hi, often distributed intail- or bridge-like structures, indicative of a recent galaxy merger orcollision. our results suggest that different types of radio galaxies may havea different formation history, which could be related to a difference in thetriggering mechanism of the radio source. if confirmed by larger studies withthe next generation radio telescopes, this would be in agreement with previousoptical studies that suggest that powerful fr-ii radio sources are likelytriggered by galaxy mergers and collisions, while the lower power fr-i sourcesare fed in other ways (e.g. through the accretion of hot igm). the giant hidisks/rings associated with some compact sources could - at least in some cases- be the relics of much more advanced mergers.

1310.7588	detection of a high brightness temperature radio core in the agn-driven  molecular outflow candidate ngc 1266	we present new high spatial resolution karl g. jansky very large array (vla)hi absorption and very long baseline array (vlba) continuum observations of theactive galactic nucleus (agn)-driven molecular outflow candidate ngc 1266.although other well-known systems with molecular outflows may be driven by starformation in a central molecular disk, the molecular mass outflow rate reportedin alatalo et al. (2011) in ngc 1266 of 13 m$_{\odot}$ year$^{-1}$ exceeds starformation rate estimates from a variety of tracers. this suggests that anadditional energy source, such as an agn, may play a significant role inpowering the outflow. our high spatial resolution hi absorption data revealcompact absorption against the radio continuum core co-located with theputative agn, and the presence of a blueshifted spectral component re-affirmsthat gas is indeed flowing out of the system. our vlba observations at 1.65 ghzreveal one continuum source within the densest portion of the molecular gas,with a diameter d &lt; 8 mas (1.2 pc), a radio power $p_{\mathrm{rad}}$ = 1.48$\times$ 10$^{20}$ w hz$^{-1}$, and a brightness temperature $t_{\mathrm{b}}$ &gt;1.5 x 10$^7$ k that is most consistent with an agn origin. the radio continuumenergetics implied by the compact vlba source, as well as archival vlacontinuum observations at lower spatial resolution, further support thepossibility that the agn in ngc 1266 could be driving the molecular outflow.these findings suggest that even low-level agns may be able to launch massiveoutflows in their host galaxies.

(2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1411.6107	radio jets clearing the way through galaxies: the view from hi and  molecular gas	massive gas outflows are considered a key component in the process of galaxyformation and evolution. because of this, they are the topic of many studiesaimed at learning more about their occurrence, location and physical conditionsas well as the mechanism(s) at their origin. this contribution presents recentresults on two of the best examples of jet-driven outflows traced by cold andmolecular gas. thanks to high-spatial resolution observations, we have beenable to locate the region where the outflow occurs. this appears to becoincident with bright radio features and regions where the interaction betweenradio plasma jet and ism is known to occur, thus strongly supporting the ideaof jet-driven outflows. we have also imaged the distribution of the outflowinggas. the results clearly show the effect that expanding radio jets and lobeshave on the ism. this appears to be in good agreement with what predicted fromnumerical simulations. furthermore, the results show that cold gas isassociated with these powerful phenomena and can be formed - likely viaefficient cooling - even after a strong interaction and fast shocks. thediscovery of similar fast outflows of cold gas in weak radio sources is furtherincreasing the relevance that the effect of the radio plasma can have on thesurrounding medium and on the host galaxy.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1505.02981	star formation in the outer regions of the early type galaxy ngc 4203	ngc 4203 is a nearby early-type galaxy surrounded by a very large,low-column-density hi disc. in this paper we study the star formationefficiency in the gas disc of ngc 4203 by using the uv, deep optical imagingand infrared data. we confirm that the hi disc consists of two distinctcomponents: an inner star forming ring with radius from $\sim$ 1 to $\sim$ 3r$_{eff}$, and an outer disc. the outer hi disc is 9 times more massive thanthe inner hi ring. at the location of the inner hi ring we detect spiral-likestructure both in the deep $g'-r'$ image and in the 8 $\mu$m $spitzer$-iracimage, extending in radius up to $\sim$ 3 r$_{eff}$. these two gas componentshave a different star formation efficiency likely due to the differentmetallicity and dust content. the inner component has a star formationefficiency very similar to the inner regions of late-type galaxies. althoughthe outer component has a very low star formation efficiency, it is similar tothat of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and dwarfs. we suggest that thesedifferences can be explained with different gas origins for the two componentssuch as stellar mass loss for the inner hi ring and accretion from the intergalactic medium (igm) for the outer hi disc. the low level star formationefficiency in the outer hi disc is not enough to change the morphology of ngc4203, making the depletion time of the hi gas much too long.

1505.07190	the fast molecular outflow in the seyfert galaxy ic5063 as seen by alma	we use high-resolution (0.5 arcsec) co(2-1) observations performed with almato trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the seyfert 2 galaxy ic5063. afast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet, with thehighest outflow velocities about 0.5kpc from the nucleus, at the location ofthe brighter hot-spot in the w lobe. the data show that a massive, fast outflowwith velocities up to 650 km/s of cold molecular gas is present, in addition toone detected earlier in warm h2, hi and ionised gas. both the central agn andthe radio jet could energetically drive the outflow. however, thecharacteristics of the outflowing gas point to the radio jet being the maindriver. this is important, because ic5063, although one of the most powerfulseyfert galaxies, is a relatively weak radio source (p = 3x10^23 w/hz). all theobserved characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jetexpanding into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds andinflating a cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium.this model is consistent with results obtained by recent simulations such asthose of wagner et al.. a stronger, direct interaction between the jet and agas cloud is present at the location of the brighter w lobe. even assuming themost conservative values for the conversion factor co-to-h2, the mass of theoutflowing gas is between 1.9 and 4.8x10^7 msun. these amounts are much largerthan those of the outflow of warm gas (molecular and ionized) and somewhatlarger than of the hi outflow. this suggests that most of the observed coldmolecular outflow is due to fast cooling after being shocked. this gas is theend product of the cooling process. our co observations demonstrate that fastoutflows of molecular gas can be driven by relativistic jets.

1509.05236	the hi tully-fisher relation of early-type galaxies	we study the hi k-band tully-fisher relation and the baryonic tully-fisherrelation for a sample of 16 early-type galaxies, taken from the atlas3d sample,which all have very regular hi disks extending well beyond the optical body (&gt;5 r_eff). we use the kinematics of these disks to estimate the circularvelocity at large radii for these galaxies. we find that the tully-fisherrelation for our early-type galaxies is offset by about 0.5-0.7 magnitudes fromthe relation for spiral galaxies. the residuals with respect to the spiraltully-fisher relation correlate with estimates of the stellar mass-to-lightratio, suggesting that the offset between the relations is mainly driven bydifferences in stellar populations. we also observe a small offset between ourtully-fisher relation with the relation derived for the atlas3d sample based onco data representing the galaxies' inner regions (&lt; 1 r_eff). this indicatesthat the circular velocities at large radii are systematically 10% lower thanthose near 0.5-1 r_eff, in line with recent determinations of the shape of themass profile of early-type galaxies. the baryonic tully-fisher relation of oursample is distinctly tighter than the standard one, in particular when usingmass-to-light ratios based on dynamical models of the stellar kinematics. wefind that the early-type galaxies fall on the spiral baryonic tully-fisherrelation if one assumes m/l_k = 0.54 m_sun/l_sun for the stellar populations ofthe spirals, a value similar to that found by recent studies of the dynamics ofspiral galaxies. such a mass-to-light ratio for spiral galaxies would implythat their disks are 60-70% of maximal. our analysis increases the range ofgalaxy morphologies for which the baryonic tully-fisher relations holds,strengthening previous claims that it is a more fundamental scaling relationthan the classical tully-fisher relation.

astro-ph;0309477	hi on large and small scales in starburst radio galaxies	the study of the optical continuum of radio galaxies shows that about 30%have a young stellar population component. among them are the most far-irbright radio galaxies. a further indication of the relatively gas richenvironment of these galaxies (possibly related to the recent merger from whichthey originate) is the high fraction being detected in hi. here we presentrecent results obtained from the study of neutral hydrogen (detected either inemission or absorption) in a group of starburst radio galaxies. in someobjects, large-scale (tens of kpc) structures involving hi masses exceeding10^9 m_sun are observed. in these cases, the hi can be used to study the originand evolution of these systems and the timescales involved. in this respect,the parameters obtained from the study of the stellar populations and from thehi can be complementary. in other objects, very broad (&gt; 1000 km/s), mostlyblueshifted hi is detected in absorption. this result shows that, despite theextremely energetic phenomena occurring near an agn - including the powerfulradio jet - some of the outflowing gas remains, or becomes again, neutral. thiscan give new and important insights in the physical conditions of the gaseousmedium around an agn. the possible origin of the extreme kinematics isdiscussed.

astro-ph;0404521	the interplay between radio-activity and the ism in radio galaxies	radio-loud agns can inhabit regions with a very rich ism. the presence ofthis rich medium is likely related to the origin and evolution of the hostgalaxy and of the active nucleus. recent observations show that a largefraction of radio galaxies contains a significant young stellar population.this supports the idea that mergers are responsible for both the starburstphase and the triggering of the nuclear activity. the gas that reaches thecentral regions can have quite disturbed kinematics, likely due to the effectsof the agn activity and in particular of the powerful radio jets. the recentdetection of fast nuclear gas outflows, observed both in ionised and neutralgas, is giving new and important insights into the physical conditions of thegaseous medium around the nucleus and the interaction between the agn and thismedium. finally, as another example of the interplay between the radio activityand the ism, the possibility of star formation induced by the passage of theradio jet will be discussed.

astro-ph;0501414	the giant star forming halo associated with the radio galaxy pks1932-46	we report the discovery of a giant (~160 kpc) knotty extended emission linenebula associated with the radio galaxy pks1932-46 at z=0.23. the 2-d long slitspectra, obtained with vlt-fors2 at a large angle (~63 degr) to the radiosource axis, shows that the nebula extends well beyond the radio structure andthe ionization cones of the active nucleus. this is one of the largest ionizednebulae yet detected around a radio galaxy at any redshift. the analysis of theionization, morphological and kinematic properties of the knots suggests thatthese are star forming objects, probably compact hii galaxies. we propose thatthe giant structure is a star forming halo associated with the debris of themerger that triggered the activity. this study reinforces the view that radiogalaxies are activated by major mergers which also trigger substantial starformation. the star formation activity can extend on the scale of a galaxygroup, beyond the old stellar halo of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0604557	minkowski's object: a starburst triggered by a radio jet, revisited	we present neutral hydrogen, ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared imaging,and optical spectroscopy, of minkowski's object (mo), a star forming peculiargalaxy near ngc 541. the observations strengthen evidence that star formationin mo was triggered by the radio jet from ngc 541. key new results are thediscovery of a 4.9e8 solar mass double hi cloud straddling the radio jetdownstream from mo, where the jet changes direction and decollimates; strongdetections of mo, also showing double structure, in uv and h-alpha; andnumerous hii regions and associated clusters in mo. in uv, mo resembles theradio-aligned, rest-frame uv morphologies in many high redshift radio galaxies(hzrgs), also thought to be caused by jet-induced star formation. mo's stellarpopulation is dominated by a 7.5 myr-old, 1.9e7 solar mass instantaneous burst,with current star formation rate 0.52 solar masses per year (concentratedupstream from where the hi column density is high). this is unlike thejet-induced star formation in centaurus a, where the jet interacts withpre-existing cold gas; in mo the hi may have cooled out of a warmer, clumpyintergalactic or interstellar medium as a result of jet interaction, followedby collapse of the cooling clouds and subsequent star formation (consistentwith numerical simulations). since the radio source that triggered starformation in mo is much less luminous, and therefore more common, than powerfulhzrgs, and because the environment around mo is not particularly special interms of abundant dense, cold gas, jet-induced star formation in the earlyuniverse might be even more prevalent than previously thought.

astro-ph;0610114	the westerbork sings survey: i. overview and image atlas	we have obtained moderately deep radio continuum imaging at 18 and 22cm withthe westerbork array of 34 nearby galaxies drawn from the spitzer sings andstarburst samples to enable complimentary analysis. the sub-sample have anoptical major axis diameter in excess of 5 arcmin and are north of declination12.5 deg. sub-sample galaxies span a very wide range of morphological types andstar formation rates. resolved detection was possible for every galaxy. thisconstitutes a first time detection at ghz radio frequencies for about half ofthe sample. analysis of both total intensity and polarization properties of thesample will be published in companion papers. both the hi and oh main-lines ofthe target galaxies were within the observed band-pass, albeit with only coarsevelocity resolution. only two low mass elliptical galaxies were undetected inhi. four of the sub-sample galaxies were detected in oh main-line absorption,including two new detections. the results are presented in the form of an imageatlas for which a standard transfer function and image size are used throughoutand whereby the radio continuum, dss optical and integrated hi are displayedside-by-side. continuum and hi line photometry are tabulated for all targets.

astro-ph;0702498	dominant nuclear outflow driving mechanisms in powerful radio galaxies	in order to identify the dominant nuclear outflow mechanisms in activegalactic nuclei, we have undertaken deep, high resolution observations of twocompact radio sources (pks 1549-79 and pks 1345+12) with the advanced camerafor surveys (acs) aboard the hubble space telescope. not only are these targetsknown to have powerful emission line outflows, but they also contain all thepotential drivers for the outflows: relativistic jets, quasar nuclei andstarbursts. acs allows the compact nature (&lt;0.15") of these radio sources to beoptically resolved for the first time. through comparison with existing radiomaps we have seen consistency in the nuclear position angles of both theoptical emission line and radio data. there is no evidence for bi-conicalemission line features on the large-scale and there is a divergance in therelative position angles of the optical and radio structure. this enables us toexclude starburst driven outflows. however, we are unable to clearlydistinguish between radiative agn wind driven outflows and outflows powered byrelativistic radio jets. the small scale bi-conical features, indicative ofsuch mechanisms could be below the resolution limit of acs, especially ifaligned close to the line of sight. in addition, there may be offsets betweenthe radio and optical nuclei induced by heavy dust obscuration, nebularcontinuum or scattered light from the agn.

astro-ph;9901129	bepposax observations of 2 jy lobe-dominated broad-line sources. i. the  discovery of a hard x-ray component	we present new bepposax lecs, mecs and pds observations of fivelobe-dominated, broad-line active galactic nuclei selected from the 2-jy sampleof southern radio sources. these include three radio quasars and two broad-lineradio galaxies. rosat pspc data, available for all the objects, are also usedto better constrain the spectral shape in the soft x-ray band. the collecteddata cover the energy range 0.1 - 10 kev, reaching ~ 50 kev for one source(pictor a). the main result from the spectral fits is that all sources have ahard x-ray spectrum with energy index alpha_x ~ 0.75 in the 2 - 10 kev range.this is at variance with the situation at lower energies where these sourcesexhibit steeper spectra. spectral breaks ~ 0.5 at 1 - 2 kev characterize infact the overall x-ray spectra of our objects. the flat, high-energy slope isvery similar to that displayed by flat-spectrum/core-dominated quasars, whichsuggests that the same emission mechanism (most likely inverse compton)produces the hard x-ray spectra in both classes. finally, a (weak) thermalcomponent is also present at low energies in the two broad-line radio galaxiesincluded in our study.
