0908.4341	odin observations of water in molecular outflows and shocks	aims. we investigate the ortho-water abundance in outflows and shocks inorder to improve our knowledge of shock chemistry and of the physics behindmolecular outflows. methods. we have used the odin space observatory to observethe h2o(110-101) line. we obtain strip maps and single pointings of 13 outflowsand two supernova remnants where we report detections for eight sources. wehave used radex to compute the beam averaged abundances of o-h2o relative toh2. in the case of non-detection, we derive upper limits on the abundance.results. observations of co emission from the literature show that the volumedensity of h2 can vary to a large extent, a parameter that puts severeuncertainties on the derived abundances. our analysis shows a wide range ofabundances reflecting the degree to which shock chemistry is affecting theformation and destruction of water. we also compare our results with recentresults from the swas team. conclusions. elevated abundances of ortho-water arefound in several sources. the abundance reaches values as high as what would beexpected from a theoretical c-type shock where all oxygen, not in the form ofco, is converted to water. however, the high abundances we derive could also bedue to the low densities (derived from co observations) that we assume. thewater emission may in reality stem from high density regions much smaller thanthe odin beam. we do not find any relationship between the abundance and themass loss rate. on the other hand, there is a relation between the derivedwater abundance and the observed maximum outflow velocity.

0910.2738	a submillimetre search for cold extended debris disks in the beta  pictoris moving group	the beta pictoris moving group is a nearby stellar association of young(12myr) co-moving stars including the classical debris disk star beta pictoris.due to their proximity and youth they are excellent targets when searching forsubmillimetre emission from cold, extended, dust components produced bycollisions in kuiper-belt-like disks. they also allow an age independent studyof debris disk properties as a function of other stellar parameters. weobserved 7 infrared-excess stars in the beta pictoris moving group with thelaboca bolometer array, operating at a central wavelength of 870 micron at the12-m submillimetre telescope apex. the main emission at these wavelengths comesfrom large, cold dust grains, which constitute the main part of the total dustmass, and hence, for an optically thin case, make better estimates on the totaldust mass than earlier infrared observations. fitting the spectral energydistribution with combined optical and infrared photometry gives information onthe temperature and radial extent of the disk. from our sample, beta pic,hd181327, and hd172555 were detected with at least 3-sigma certainty, while allothers are below 2-sigma and considered non-detections. the image of beta picshows an offset flux density peak located near the south-west extension of thedisk, similar to the one previously found by scuba at the jcmt. we present sedfits for detected sources and give an upper limit on the dust mass forundetected ones. we find a mean fractional dust luminosity f_dust=11x10^{-4} att=12myr, which together with recent data at 100myr suggests an f_dust proptot^{-alpha} decline of the emitting dust, with alpha &gt; 0.8.

0911.5247	o18o and c18o observations of rho oph a	observations of the (n_j=1_1-1_0) ground state transition of o_2 with theodin satellite resulted in a about 5 sigma detection toward the dense core rhooph a. at the frequency of the line, 119 ghz, the odin telescope has a beamwidth of 10', larger than the size of the dense core, so that the precisenature of the emitting source and its exact location and extent are unknown.the current investigation is intended to remedy this. telluric absorption makesground based o_2 observations essentially impossible and observations had to bedone from space. mm-wave telescopes on space platforms were necessarily small,which resulted in large, several arcminutes wide, beam patterns. although theearth's atmosphere is entirely opaque to low-lying o_2 transitions, it allowsground based observations of the much rarer o18o in favourable conditions andat much higher angular resolution with larger telescopes. in addition, rho opha exhibits both multiple radial velocity systems and considerable velocitygradients. extensive mapping of the region in the proxy c18o (j=3-2) line canbe expected to help identify the o_2 source on the basis of its line shape anddoppler velocity. line opacities were determined from observations of opticallythin 13c18o (j=3-2) at selected positions. during several observing periods,two c18o intensity maxima in rho oph a were searched for in the 16o18o(2_1-0_1) line at 234 ghz with the 12m apex telescope. our observationsresulted in an upper limit on the integrated o18o intensity of &lt; 0.01 k km/s (3sigma) into the 26.5" beam. we conclude that the source of observed o_2emission is most likely confined to the central regions of the rho oph a cloud.in this limited area, implied o_2 abundances could thus be higher thanpreviously reported, by up to two orders of magnitude.

1009.1450	detection of oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ towards orion~kl	we report observations of the reactive molecular ions oh$^+$, h$_2$o$^+$, andh$_3$o$^+$ towards orion kl with herschel/hifi. all three $n=1-0$fine-structure transitions of oh$^+$ at 909, 971, and 1033ghz and bothfine-structure components of the doublet {\it ortho}-h$_2$o$^+$ $1_{11}-0_{00}$transition at 1115 and 1139ghz were detected; an upper limit was obtained forh$_3$o$^+$. oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ are observed purely in absorption, showing anarrow component at the source velocity of 9 kms$^{-1}$, and a broadblueshifted absorption similar to that reported recently for hf and {\itpara}-h$_{2}^{18}$o, and attributed to the low velocity outflow of orion kl. weestimate column densities of oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ for the 9 km s$^{-1}$component of $9 \pm 3 \times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $7 \pm 2 \times10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$, and those in the outflow of $1.9 \pm 0.7 \times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $1.0 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$. upper limits of$2.4\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $8.7\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ were derived forthe column densities of {\it ortho} and {\it para}-h$_3$o$^+$ from transitionsnear 985 and 1657ghz. the column densities of the three ions are up to an orderof magnitude lower than those obtained from recent observations of w31c andw49n. the comparatively low column densities may be explained by a higher gasdensity despite the assumption of a very high ionization rate.

1011.3339	deuterated formaldehyde in rho ophiuchi a	from mapping observations of h2co, hdco, and d2co, we have determined how thedegree of deuterium fractionation changes over the central 3'x3' region of rhooph a. the multi-transition data of the various h2co isotopologues, as well asfrom other molecules (e.g., ch3oh and n2d+) present in the observed bands, wereanalysed using both the standard type rotation diagram analysis and, inselected cases, a more elaborate method of solving the radiative transfer foroptically thick emission. in addition to molecular column densities, theanalysis also estimates the kinetic temperature and h2 density. toward the sm1core in rho oph a, the h2co deuterium fractionation is very high. in fact, theobserved d2co/hdco ratio is 1.34+/-0.19, while the hdco/h2co ratio is0.107+/-0.015. this is the first time, to our knowledge, that the d2co/hdcoabundance ratio is observed to be greater than 1. the kinetic temperature is inthe range 20-30 k in the cores of rho oph a, and the h2 density is (6-10)x10^5cm-3. we estimate that the total h2 column density toward the deuterium peak is(1-4)x10^23 cm-2. as depleted gas-phase chemistry is not adequate, we suggestthat grain chemistry, possibly due to abstraction and exchange reactions alongthe reaction chain h2co -&gt; hdco -&gt; d2co, is at work to produce the very highdeuterium levels observed.

1106.5440	herschel observations of the herbig-haro objects hh52-54	we are aiming at the observational estimation of the relative contribution tothe cooling by co and h2o, as this provides decisive information for theunderstanding of the oxygen chemistry behind interstellar shock waves. methods.the high sensitivity of hifi, in combination with its high spectral resolutioncapability, allows us to trace the h2o outflow wings at unprecedentedsignal-to-noise. from the observation of spectrally resolved h2o and co linesin the hh52-54 system, both from space and from ground, we arrive at thespatial and velocity distribution of the molecular outflow gas. solving thestatistical equilibrium and non-lte radiative transfer equations provides uswith estimates of the physical parameters of this gas, including the coolingrate ratios of the species. the radiative transfer is based on an ali code,where we use the fact that variable shock strengths, distributed along thefront, are naturally implied by a curved surface. based on observations of coand h2o spectral lines, we conclude that the emission is confined to the hh54region. the quantitative analysis of our observations favours a ratio of theco-to-h2o-cooling-rate &gt;&gt; 1. from the best-fit model to the co emission, wearrive at an h2o abundance close to 1e-5. the line profiles exhibit twocomponents, one of which is triangular and another, which is a superposed,additional feature. this additional feature likely originates from a regionsmaller than the beam where the ortho-water abundance is smaller than in thequiescent gas. comparison with recent shock models indicate that a planar shockcan not easily explain the observed line strengths and triangular lineprofiles.we conclude that the geometry can play an important role. althoughabundances support a scenario where j-type shocks are present, higher coolingrate ratios than predicted by these type of shocks are derived.

1111.0461	water emission from the chemically rich outflow l1157	in the framework of the herschel-wish key program, several ortho-h2o andpara-h2o emission lines, in the frequency range from 500 to 1700 ghz, wereobserved with the hifi instrument in two bow-shock regions (b2 and r) of thel1157 cloud. the primary aim is to analyse water emission lines as a diagnosticof the physical conditions in the blue (b2) and red-shifted (r) lobes tocompare the excitation conditions. a total of 5 ortho- and para-h216o plus oneo-h218o transitions were observed in b2 and r with a wide range of excitationenergies (27 k&lt;=eu&lt;=215 k). the h2o spectra, observed in the two shockedregions, show that the h2o profiles are markedly different in the two regions.in particular, at the bow-shock r, we observed broad (~30 km s-1 with respectto the ambient velocity) red-shifted wings where lines at different excitationpeak at different red-shifted velocities. the b2 spectra are associated with anarrower velocity range (~6 km s-1), peaking at the systemic velocity. theexcitation analysis suggests, for b2, low values of column density nh2o&lt;=5{\times}1013 cm-2, a density range of 105 &lt;=nh2 &lt;=107 cm-3, and warmtemperatures (&gt;=300 k). the presence of the broad red-shifted wings andmultiple peaks in the spectra of the r region, prompted the modelling of twocomponents. high velocities are associated with relatively low temperatures(~100k),nh2o{\simeq}5{\times}1012-5{\times}1013 cm-2 and densitiesnh2{\simeq}106-108 cm-3.lower velocities are associated with higher excitationconditions with tkin&gt;=300 k, very dense gas (nh2 ~108 cm-3) and low columndensity (nh2o&lt;5{\times}1013 cm-2).

1111.6016	the herschel hifi water line survey in the low-mass proto-stellar  outflow l1448	as part of the wish (water in star-forming regions with herschel) keyproject, we report on the observations of several ortho- and para-h2o linesperformed with the hifi instrument towards two bright shock spots (r4 and b2)along the outflow driven by the l1448 low-mass proto-stellar system, located inthe perseus cloud. these data are used to identify the physical conditionsgiving rise to the h2o emission and infer any dependence with velocity. theseobservations provide evidence that the observed water lines probe a warm(t_kin~400-600 k) and very dense (n 10^6 - 10^7 cm^-3) gas, not traced by othermolecules, such as low-j co and sio, but rather traced by mid-ir h2 emission.in particular, h2o shows strong differences with sio in the excitationconditions and in the line profiles in the two observed shocked positions,pointing to chemical variations across the various velocity regimes andchemical evolution in the different shock spots. physical and kinematicaldifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. at the r4 position, twovelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with thecomponent at higher velocity (r4-hv) being less extended and less dense thanthe low velocity component (r4-lv). h2o column densities of about 2 10^13 and 410^14 cm^-2 have been derived for the r4-lv and the r4-hv components,respectively. the conditions inferred for the b2 position are similar to thoseof the r4-hv component, with h2o column density in the range 10^14 - 5 10^14cm^-2, corresponding to h2o/h2 abundances in the range 0.5 - 1 10^-5. theobserved line ratios and the derived physical conditions seem to be moreconsistent with excitation in a low velocity j-type shock with largecompression rather than in a stationary c-shock, although none of thesestationary models seems able to reproduce all the characteristics of theobserved emission.

1204.0009	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish): ii. evolution of 557  ghz 110-101 emission in low-mass protostars	(abridged) water is a key tracer of dynamics and chemistry in low-massprotostars, but spectrally resolved observations have so far been limited insensitivity and angular resolution. in this first systematic survey ofspectrally resolved water emission in low-mass protostellar objects, h2o wasobserved in the ground-state transition at 557 ghz with hifi on herschel in 29embedded class 0 and i protostars. complementary far-ir and sub-mm continuumdata (including pacs data from our program) are used to constrain the spectralenergy distribution of each source. h2o intensities are compared to inferredenvelope and outflow properties and co 3-2 emission. h2o emission is detectedin all objects except one. the line profiles are complex and consist of severalkinematic components. the profiles are typically dominated by a broad gaussianemission feature, indicating that the bulk of the water emission arises inoutflows, not the quiescent envelope. several sources show multiple shockcomponents in either emission or absorption, thus constraining the internalgeometry of the system. furthermore, the components include inverse p-cygniprofiles in 7 sources (6 class 0, 1 class i) indicative of infalling envelopes,and regular p-cygni profiles in 4 sources (3 class i, 1 class 0) indicative ofexpanding envelopes. "bullets" moving at &gt;50 km/s are seen in 4 class 0sources; 3 of these are new detections. in the outflow, the h2o/co abundanceratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasingfrom 10^-3 at &lt;5 km/s to &gt;10^-1 at &gt;10 km/s. the h2o abundance in the outerenvelope is low, ~10^-10. the different h2o profile components show a clearevolutionary trend: in the class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflowcomponents originating inside an infalling envelope. when the infall diminishesduring the class i phase, the outflow weakens and h2o emission disappears.

1209.0294	h2o line mapping at high spatial and spectral resolution - herschel  observations of the vla1623 outflow	apart from being an important coolant, h2o is known to be a tracer ofhigh-velocity molecular gas. recent models predict relatively high abundancesbehind interstellar shockwaves. the dynamical and physical conditions of theh2o emitting gas, however, are not fully understood yet. we aim to determinethe abundance and distribution of h2o, its kinematics and the physicalconditions of the gas responsible for the h2o emission. the observed lineprofile shapes help us understand the dynamics in molecular outflows. we mappedthe vla1623 outflow, in the ground-state transitions of o-h2o, with the hifiand pacs instruments. we also present observations of higher energy transitionsof o-h2o and p-h2o obtained with hifi and pacs towards selected outflowpositions. from comparison with non-lte radiative transfer calculations, weestimate the physical parameters of the water emitting regions. the observedwater emission line profiles vary over the mapped area. spectral features andcomponents, tracing gas in different excitation conditions, allow us toconstrain the density and temperature of the gas. the h2o emission originatesin a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm h2 gas(t\gtrsim200k). thus, the h2o emission traces a gas component significantlywarmer than the gas responsible for the low-j co emission. the h2o columndensities at the co peak positions are low, i.e. n(h2o) \simeq (0.03-10)x10e14cm-2. the h2o abundance with respect to h2 in the extended outflow is estimatedat x(h2o)&lt;1x10e-6, significantly lower than what would be expected from mostrecent shock models. the h2o emission traces a gas component moving atrelatively high velocity compared to the low-j co emitting gas. however, otherdynamical quantities such as the momentum rate, energy and mechanicalluminosity are estimated to be the same, independent of the molecular tracerused, co or h2o.

1301.4821	water in star forming regions with herschel (wish) iii. far-infrared  cooling lines in low-mass young stellar objects	(abridged) far-infrared herschel-pacs spectra of 18 low-mass protostars ofvarious luminosities and evolutionary stages are studied. we quantify theirfar-infrared line emission and the contribution of different atomic andmolecular species to the gas cooling budget during protostellar evolution. wealso determine the spatial extent of the emission and investigate theunderlying excitation conditions. most of the protostars in our sample showstrong atomic and molecular far-infrared emission. water is detected in 17objects, including 5 class i sources. the high-excitation h2o line at 63.3micron is detected in 7 sources. co transitions from j=14-13 up to 49-48 arefound and show two distinct temperature components on boltzmann diagrams withrotational temperatures of ~350 k and ~700 k. h2o has typical excitationtemperatures of ~150 k. emission from both class 0 and i sources is usuallyspatially extended along the outflow direction but with a pattern depending onthe species and the transition. the h2o line fluxes correlate strongly withthose of the high-j co lines, as well as with the bolometric luminosity andenvelope mass. they correlate less strongly with oh and not with [oi] fluxes.the pacs data probe at least two physical components. the h2o and co emissionlikely arises in non-dissociative (irradiated) shocks along the outflow wallswith a range of pre-shock densities. some oh is also associated with thiscomponent, likely resulting from h2o photodissociation. uv-heated gascontributes only a minor fraction to the co emission observed by pacs, based onthe strong correlation between the shock-dominated co 24-23 line and the co14-13 line. [oi] and some of the oh emission probe dissociative shocks in theinner envelope. the total far-infrared cooling is dominated by h2o and co, with[oi] increasing for class i sources.

1303.2464	physical properties of outflows: comparing co and h2o based parameters  in class 0 sources	context. the observed physical properties of outflows from low-mass sourcesput constraints on possible ejection mechanisms. historically, these quantitieshave been derived from co using ground-based observations. it is thus importantto investigate whether parameters such as momentum rate (thrust) and mechanicalluminosity (power) are the same when different molecular tracers are used.aims. we aim at determining the outflow momentum, dynamical time-scale, thrust,energy and power using co and h2o as tracers of outflow activity. methods.within the framework of the wish key program, three molecular outflows fromclass 0 sources have been mapped using the hifi instrument aboard herschel. weuse these observations together with previously published h2 data to infer thephysical properties of the outflows. we compare the physical properties derivedhere with previous estimates based on co observations. results. inspection ofthe spatial distribution of h2o and h2 confirms that these molecules areco-spatial. the most prominent emission peaks in h2 coincide with strong h2oemission peaks and the estimated widths of the flows when using the two tracersare comparable. conclusions. for the momentum rate and the mechanicalluminosity, inferred values are independent of which tracer that is used, i.e.,the values agree to within a factor of 4 and 3 respectively.

1306.2855	herschel's "cold debris disks": background galaxies or quiescent rims of  planetary systems?	(abridged) infrared excesses associated with debris disk host stars detectedso far peak at wavelengths around ~100{\mu}m or shorter. however, six out of 31excess sources in the herschel otkp dunes have been seen to show significant -and in some cases extended - excess emission at 160{\mu}m, which is larger thanthe 100{\mu}m excess. this excess emission has been suggested to stem fromdebris disks colder than those known previously. using several methods, were-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated withunrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highlyunlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. fortrue disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the seds and the diskradii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as ablackbody. this requires the grains to be larger than ~100{\mu}m, regardless oftheir material composition. to explain the dearth of small grains, we exploreseveral conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of lowdynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. ourqualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two ofthese scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. we show that suchdisks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial sizedistribution. they should be composed of macroscopic solids larger thanmillimeters, but smaller than kilometers in size. thus planetesimal formation,at least in the outer regions of the systems, has stopped before "cometary" or"asteroidal" sizes were reached.

1312.0924	herschel hifi observations of ionised carbon in the {\beta} pictoris  debris disk	context: the dusty debris disk around the $\sim$20 myr old main-sequencea-star {\beta} pictoris is known to contain gas. evidence points towards asecondary origin of the gas as opposed to being a direct remnant form theinitial protoplanetary disk, although the dominant gas production mechanism isso far not identified. the origin of the observed overabundance of c and ocompared to solar abundances of metallic elements, e.g. na and fe, is alsounclear. aims: our goal is to constrain the spatial distribution of c in thedisk, and thereby the gas origin and its abundance pattern. methods: we usedthe hifi instrument onboard herschel to observe and spectrally resolve ciiemission at 158 $\mu$m from the {\beta} pic debris disk. assuming keplerianrotation, we use the spectrally resolved line profile to constrain the spatialdistribution of the gas. results: we show that most of the gas is locatedaround $\sim$100 au or beyond. we estimate a total c gas mass of$1.3\times10^{-2}$ m$_\oplus$. the data suggest that more gas is located on thesouthwest side of the disk than on the northeast side. the data are consistentwith the hypothesis of a well-mixed gas (constant c/fe ratio throughout thedisk). assuming instead a spatial profile expected from a simplified accretiondisk model, we found it to give a significantly worse fit to the observations.conclusions: since the bulk of the gas is found outside 30 au, we argue thatthe cometary objects known as "falling evaporating bodies" are unlikely to bethe dominant source of gas; production from grain-grain collisions orphotodesorption seems more likely. the incompatibility of the observations witha simplified accretion disk model could favour a preferential depletionexplanation for the overabundance of c and o. more stringent constraints on thespatial distribution will be available from alma observations of ci at 609$\mu$m.

1401.6896	how dusty is alpha centauri? excess or non-excess over the infrared  photospheres of main-sequence stars	[abridged] debris discs around main-sequence stars indicate the presence oflarger rocky bodies. the components of the nearby binary acentauri have higherthan solar metallicities, which is thought to promote giant planet formation.we aim to determine the level of emission from debris in the acen system.having already detected the temperature minimum, tmin, of acena, we hereattempt to do so also for the companion acenb. using the acen stars astemplates, we study possible effects tmin may have on the detectability ofunresolved dust discs around other stars. we use herschel and apex photometryto determine the stellar spectral energy distributions. in addition, we useapex for spectral line mapping to study the complex background around acen seenin the photometric images. models of stellar atmospheres and discs are used toestimate the amount of debris around these stars. for solar-type stars, afractional dust luminosity fd 2e-7 could account for seds that do not exhibitthe tmin-effect. slight excesses at the 2.5 sigma level are observed at 24 mufor both stars, which, if interpreted to be due to dust, would correspond to fd(1-3)e-5. dynamical disc modelling leads to rough mass estimates of theputative zodi belts around the acen stars, viz. &lt;~4e-6 mmoon of 4 to 1000 musize grains, distributed according to n a^-3.5. similarly, for filled-in tminemission, corresponding ekbs could account for ~1e-3 mmoon of dust. lightscattered and/or thermally emitted by exo-zodi discs will have profoundimplications for future spectroscopic missions designed to search forbiomarkers in the atmospheres of earth-like planets. the f-ir sed of acenb ismarginally consistent with the presence of a minimum temperature region in theupper atmosphere. we also show that an acena-like temperature minimum mayresult in an erroneous apprehension about the presence of dust around otherstars.

0803.1294	q1 eri: a solar-type star with a planet and a dust belt	only very few solar-type stars exhibiting an infrared excess and harbouringplanets are known to date. indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disksystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.consequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poorstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or thephysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias andselection effects. finding more examples would be very significant. theselected target, q1 eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess aplanet, q1 eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at iras wavelengths, but hadremained undetected in the millimeter regime. therefore, submm flux densitieswould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of theplanetary disk. consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1eri. the detected dust toward q1 eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable factthat the entire sed, from the ir to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a singletemperature blackbody function (60 k). this would imply that the emittingregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much largerthan the orbital distance of q1 eri b, and that the emitting particles areconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. however, the 870 micron source isextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 au. therefore, aphysically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 k),located at 300 au from the star and about 60 au wide. the minimum mass of 0.04mearth (3 mmoon) of 1 mm-size icy ring-particles is considerable, given thestellar age of about 1 gyr. these big grains form an inner edge at about 25 au,which may suggest the presence of an unseen outer planet (q1 eri c).

1406.6302	water distribution in shocked regions of the ngc1333-iras4a protostellar  outflow	we present the study of the h2o spatial distribution at two bright shockedregions along iras4a, one of the strongest h2o emitters among the class 0outflows. we obtained herschel-pacs maps of the iras4a outflow and hifiobservations of two shocked positions. the largest hifi beam of 38 arcsec at557 ghz was mapped in several key water lines with different upper energylevels, to reveal possible spatial variations of the line profiles. we detectfour h2o lines and co (16-15) at the two selected positions. in addition,transitions from related outflow and envelope tracers are detected. differentgas components associated with the shock are identified in the h2o emission. inparticular, at the head of the red lobe of the outflow, two distinct gascomponents with different excitation conditions are distinguished in the hifiemission maps: a compact component, detected in the ground-state water lines,and a more extended one. assuming that these two components correspond to twodifferent temperature components observed in previous h2o and co studies, theexcitation analysis of the h2o emission suggests that the compact (about 3arcsec) component is associated with a hot (t~1000 k) gas with densities~(1-4)x10^5 cm^{-3}, whereas the extended one (10-17 arcsec) traces a warm(t~300-500 k) and dense gas (~(3-5)x10^7 cm^{-3}). finally, using the co(16-15) emission observed at r2, we estimate the h2o/h2 abundance of the warmand hot components to be (7-10)x10^{-7} and (3-7)x10^{-5}. our data allowed us,for the first time, to resolve spatially the two temperature componentspreviously observed with hifi and pacs. we propose that the compact hotcomponent may be associated with the jet that impacts the surrounding material,whereas the warm, dense, and extended component originates from the compressionof the ambient gas by the propagating flow.

astro-ph;0007319	the iso-lws map of the serpens cloud core: i. the seds of the ir/smm  sources	iso-lws mapping observations of the serpens molecular cloud core arepresented. the spectral range is 50 - 200 micron and the map size is 8' x 8'.these observations suffer from severe source confusion at fir wavelengths andwe employ a maximum likelihood method for the spectro-spatial deconvolution.the strong and fairly isolated source smm1 firs1 presented a test case, whosemodelled spectral energy distribution (sed), within observational errors, isidentical to the observed one. the model results for the other infrared andsubmillimetre sources are therefore likely to represent their correct seds.simulations demonstrating the reliability and potential of the developed methodsupport this view. for the majority of sources the peak of the seds is foundwithin the spectral range of the lws and derived temperatures are generallyhigher (&gt;30k) than have been found by earlier deconvolution attempts using irasdata. smm sizes are found to be only a few arcsec in diameter. in addition, thesmms are generally optically thick even at lws wavelengths. self-consistentradiative transfer calculations indicates that the smms are optically thick outto even longer wavelengths. models were calculated for five sources, for whichsufficient data were available, viz. smm 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. these models areoptically thick out to millimetre wavelengths (wavelength of unit optical depth900 to 1400 micron). envelope masses for these smms are in the range 2-6 msun,which is of course considerably more massive than estimates based on theoptically thin assumption. the luminosities are in the range 10-70 lsun,suggesting the formation of low-mass to intermediate mass stars, so that theexistence of such massive envelopes argues for extreme youth of the smms in theserpens cloud core.

astro-ph;0202092	the iso-lws map of the serpens cloud core. ii. the line spectra	we present spectrophotometric iso imaging with the lws and the cam-cvf of theserpens molecular cloud core. the lws map is centred on the far infrared andsubmillimetre source smm1 and its size is 8' x 8'. the fine structure lineemission in [oi] and [cii] is extended and can be successfully modelled tooriginate in a pdr with g_0 = 15 and n(h2) about 10^4 - 10^5 cm^-3. extendedemission is also observed in the rotational line emission of h2o and high-j co.however, lack of sufficient angular resolution prevents us from excluding thepossibility that the emssion regions of these lines are point like, which couldbe linked to the embedded objects smm9 and smm4. toward the class0 source smm1,the lws observations reveal, in addition to fine structure line emission, arich spectrum of molecular lines. the sub-thermally excited and optically thickco, h2o and oh lines are tracing an about 10^3 au source with temperatureshigher than 300 k and densities above 10^6 cm^-3. we show that geometry is ofconcern for the correct interpretation of the data and based on 2d-radiativetransfer modelling of the disk/torus around smm1, which successfully reproducesthe entire observed sed and the observed line profiles of co isotopomers, wecan exclude the disk to be the source of the lws-molecular line emission. thecam-cvf permits us to see a region of rotational h2 emission. this h2 gas has atemperature of 10^3 k, which suggests that the heating of the gas is achievedthrough relatively slow shocks. although we are not able to establish any firmconclusion regarding the detailed nature of the shock waves, our observationsof the molecular line emission from smm1 can be explainable in terms of anadmixture of j-shocks and of c-shocks.

astro-ph;0303139	submillimeter emission from water in the w3 region	we have mapped the submillimeter emission from the 1(10)-1(01) transition ofortho-water in the w3 star-forming region. a 5'x5' map of the w3 irs4 and w3irs5 region reveals strong water lines at half the positions in the map. therelative strength of the odin lines compared to previous observations by swassuggests that we are seeing water emission from an extended region. across muchof the map the lines are double-peaked, with an absorption feature at -39 km/s;however, some positions in the map show a single strong line at -43 km/s. weinterpret the double-peaked lines as arising from optically thick,self-absorbed water emission near the w3 irs5, while the narrower blue-shiftedlines originate in emission near w3 irs4. in this model, the unusual appearanceof the spectral lines across the map results from a coincidental agreement invelocity between the emission near w3 irs4 and the blue peak of the morecomplex lines near w3 irs5. the strength of the water lines near w3 irs4suggests we may be seeing water emission enhanced in a photon-dominated region.

astro-ph;0503469	hst and spectroscopic observations of the l1551 irs5 jets (hh154)	we have carried out a thorough optical study of the closest star formationjet. the inner arcminute surrounding the class 0/i binary protostar l1551 irs5and its associated jet (hh154) have been observed using the hubble spacetelescope with the wfpc2 camera, the eso new technology telescope with the emmispectrograph and the nordic optical telescope with the alfosc spectrograph.this data set is compared to earlier ground based imaging with the aim to studythe evolution of this particular jet, and its possible interaction with themolecular material in the bipolar molecular outflow associated with thissource. the velocity field of the jet is mapped out. the highest velocities arefound in the vicinity of the recently discovered x-ray source emanating from ashock in this jet. the energy radiated by the x-ray source is compatible withthese velocities. the \halpha and \hbeta emission from the jet is used todetermine the extinction, which is found to increase inwards in the jet towardsthe protostar. the extinction towards the x-ray source is consistent with theone determined from the x-ray spectrum.

astro-ph;0509589	odin detection of o2	we present the detection of molecular oxygen with odin toward the densemolecular core rho oph a, which is part of a region of active star formation.the observed spectral line is the (n,j = 1,1-1,0) ground state transition ofmolecular oxygen at 119 ghz (2.5 mm wavelength). the center of the line is atthe lsr velocity of a number of optically thin lines from other species in theregion and the o2 line also has a very similar, narrow, line width. within the10 arcmin beam, the integrated line intensity is 28 mk km/s, which correspondsto 5 sigma of the rms noise. a standard lte analysis results in an o2 abundanceof 5e(-8), with an uncertainty of at least a factor of two. we show thatstandard methods, however, do not apply in this case, as the coupling of theodin beam to the source structure needs to be accounted for. preliminary modelresults indicate o2 abundances to be higher by one order of magnitude thansuggested by the standard case. this model predicts the 487 ghz line of o2 tobe easily detectable by the future herschel-hifi facility, but to be out ofreach for observations on a shorter time scale with the odin space observatory.

astro-ph;0509836	outflows from young objects observed with the iso-lws i. fine structure  lines [o i] 63, [o i]145 and [c ii]157 micron	far infrared fine structure line data from the iso archive have beenextracted for several hundred ysos and their outflows, including molecular (co)outflows, optical jets and herbig-haro (hh) objects. given the importance ofthese lines to astrophysics, their excitation and transfer ought to beinvestigated in detail and, at this stage, the reliability of the diagnosticpower of the fine structure transitions of o i and c ii has been examined.several issues, such as the extremely small intensity ratios of the oxygen 63micron to 145 micron lines, are still awaiting an explanation. it isdemonstrated that, in interstellar cloud conditions, the 145 micron line isprone to masing, but that this effect is likely an insufficient cause of theline ratio anomaly observed from cold dark clouds. very optically thickemission could in principle also account for this, but would need similar,prohibitively high column densities and must therefore be abondoned as a viableexplanation. one is left with [o i] 63 micron self absorption by cold andtenuous foreground gas, as has been advocated for distant luminous sources.recent observations with the submillimeter observatory odin support thisscenario also in the case of nearby dark molecular clouds. on the basis of thislarge statistical material we are led to conclude that in star forming regions,the [o i] and [c ii] lines generally have only limited diagnostic value.

astro-ph;0609102	x-ray and hei 1.0830 mu emission from protostellar jets	context. the high energies of protostellar jets, implied by recentobservations of x-rays from such flows, came very much as a surprise. inferredshock velocities are considerably higher than what was previously known, henceputting even larger energy demands on the driving sources of the jets. thestatistics of x-ray emitting jets are still poor, yet a few cases exist whichseem to imply a correlation between the presence of hei 1.0830 mu emission andx-ray radiation in a given source. aims. this tentative correlation needsconfirmation and explanation. if the jet regions of hei 1.0830 mu emission areclosely associated with those producing x-rays, high resolution infaredspectroscopy can be used to observationally study the velocity fields in thehot plasma regions of the jets. this would provide the necessary evidence totest and further develop theoretical models of intermediately fast (&gt; 500 -1500 km/s) interstellar shock waves. methods. the hh 154 jet flow from theembedded protostellar binary l 1551 irs 5 provides a case study, since adequateir and x-ray spectroscopic data are in existence. the thermal x-ray spectrum isfed into a photoionization code to compute, in particular, the line emission ofhei and hi and to account for the observed unusual line intensity ratios.results. the advanced model is capable of accounting for most observables, butshows also major weaknesses. it seems not unlikely that these could, inprinciple, be overcome by a time dependent hydrodynamical calculation withself-consistent cooling. however, such sophisticated model development isdecisively beyond the scope of the present work. conclusions. continued x-rayobservations, coordinated with simultaneous high resolution infraredspectroscopy, are highly desirable.

astro-ph;0702474	molecular oxygen in the rho ophiuchi cloud	molecular oxygen, o2 has been expected historically to be an abundantcomponent of the chemical species in molecular clouds and, as such, animportant coolant of the dense interstellar medium. however, a number ofattempts from both ground and from space have failed to detect o2 emission. thework described here uses heterodyne spectroscopy from space to search formolecular oxygen in the interstellar medium. the odin satellite carries a 1.1 msub-millimeter dish and a dedicated 119 ghz receiver for the ground state lineof o2. starting in 2002, the star forming molecular cloud core rho oph a wasobserved with odin for 34 days during several observing runs. we detect aspectral line at v(lsr) = 3.5 km/s with dv(fwhm) = 1.5 km/s, parameters whichare also common to other species associated with rho ohp a. this feature isidentified as the o2 (n_j = 1_1 - 1_0) transition at 118 750.343 mhz. theabundance of molecular oxygen, relative to h2,, is 5e-8 averaged over the odinbeam. this abundance is consistently lower than previously reported upperlimits.
