0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0905.1956	an evolutionary paradigm for dusty active galaxies at low redshift	we apply methods from bayesian inferencing and graph theory to a dataset of102 mid-infrared spectra, and archival data from the optical to the millimeter,to construct an evolutionary paradigm for z&lt;0.4 infrared-luminous galaxies(ulirgs). we propose that the ulirg lifecycle consists of three phases. thefirst phase lasts from the initial encounter until approximately coalescence.it is characterized by homogeneous mid-ir spectral shapes, and ir emissionmainly from star formation, with a contribution from an agn in some cases. atthe end of this phase, a ulirg enters one of two evolutionary paths dependingon the dynamics of the merger, the available quantities of gas, and the massesof the black holes in the progenitors. on one branch, the contributions fromthe starburst and the agn to the total ir luminosity decline and increaserespectively. the ir spectral shapes are heterogeneous, likely due to feedbackfrom agn-driven winds. some objects go through a brief qso phase at the end. onthe other branch, the decline of the starburst relative to the agn is lesspronounced, and few or no objects go through a qso phase. we show that the 11.2micron pah feature is a remarkably good diagnostic of evolutionary phase, andidentify six ulirgs that may be archetypes of key stages in this lifecycle.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1108.4037	ultra steep spectrum radio sources in the lockman hole: servs  identifications and redshift distribution at the faintest radio fluxes	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources have been successfully used toselect powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z&gt;~2). typically restricted tolarge-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has graduallybecome possible to extend the uss search to sub-mjy levels, thanks to therecent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. here a firstdetailed analysis of the nature of the faintest uss sources is presented. byusing giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array radio observationsof the lockman hole at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz, a sample of 58 uss sources, with610 mhz integrated fluxes above 100 microjy, is assembled. deep infrared dataat 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the spitzer extragalactic representative volumesurvey (servs) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of thesesources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](ab)=19.8 mag.spectroscopic redshifts for 14 uss sources, together with photometric redshiftestimates, improved by the use of the deep servs data, for a further 19objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 andtailing off at high redshifts. the remaining 25 uss sources, with no redshiftestimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]&gt;22-23 mag, from local measurements), whichsuggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mjy usspopulation. the comparison with the square kilometre array design studiessimulated skies models indicate that fanaroff-riley type i radio sources andradio-quiet active galactic nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest usspopulation, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the usstechnique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at thesub-mjy level.

1206.4263	the vista deep extragalactic observations (video) survey	in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible andinfrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) deep extragalactic observations(video) survey. video is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared z,y,j,h andk_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and largestructures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from thepresent day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (agn) and the most massivegalaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. with its depth and area,video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn andstarburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters werebeginning to virialize. video therefore offers a unique data set with which toinvestigate the interplay between agn, starbursts and environment, and the roleof feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.  we provide data over the video-xmm3 tile, which also covers thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey deep-1 field (cfhtls-d1). thereleased video data reach a 5-sigma ab-magnitude depth of z=25.7, y=24.5,j=24.4, h=24.1 and k_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth ofy=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find goodastrometric agreement with the two-micron all sky survey, and source counts inagreement with the recently released ultravista survey data. the addition ofthe video data to the cfhtls-d1 optical data increases the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophicoutliers over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absenceof an i-band luminosity prior.

1207.2795	deep observations of co line emission from star-forming galaxies in a  cluster candidate at z=1.5	we report results from a deep jansky very large array (jvla) search for co1-0 line emission from galaxies in a candidate galaxy cluster at z~1.55 in thecosmos field. we target 4 galaxies with optical spectroscopic redshifts in therange z=1.47-1.59. two of these 4 galaxies, id51613 and id51813, are nominallydetected in co line emission at the 3-4 sigma level. we find co luminosities of2.4x10^10 k km/s pc^2 and 1.3x10^10 k km/s pc^2, respectively. taking advantagefrom the clustering and 2-ghz bandwidth of the jvla, we perform a search foremission lines in the proximity of optical sources within the field of view ofour observations. we limit our search to galaxies with k&lt;23.5 (ab) andz_phot=1.2-1.8. we find 2 bright optical galaxies to be associated withsignificant emission line peaks (&gt;4 sigma) in the data cube, which we identifywith the co line emission. to test the reliability of the line peaks found, weperformed a parallel search for line peaks using a bayesian inference method.monte carlo simulations show that such associations are statisticallysignificant, with probabilities of chance association of 3.5% and 10.7% for id51207 and id 51380, respectively. modeling of their optical/ir seds indicatesthat the co detected galaxies and candidates have stellar masses and sfrs inthe range (0.3-1.1)x10^11 m_sun and 60-160 m_sun/yr, with sfes comparable tothat found in other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. by comparingthe space density of co emitters derived from our observations with the spacedensity derived from previous co detections at z~1.5, and with semi-analyticpredictions for the co luminosity function, we suggest that the latter tend tounderestimate the number of co galaxies detected at high-redshift. finally, weargue about the benefits of future blind co searches in clustered fields withupcoming submm/radio facilities.

0801.1842	the nature of star formation in distant ultraluminous infrared galaxies  selected in a remarkably narrow redshift range	we present mid-infrared spectra of thirty two high redshift ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, selected via the stellar photospheric feature at rest-frame1.6um, and an observed-frame 24um flux of &gt;500mujy. nearly all the samplereside in a redshift range of &lt;z&gt;=1.71+/-0.15, and have rest-frame 1-1000umluminosities of 10^12.9 - 10^13.8 lsun. most of the spectra exhibit prominentpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, and weak silicateabsorption, consistent with a starburst origin for the ir emission. ourselection method appears to be a straightforward and efficient way of findingdistant, ir-luminous, star-forming galaxies in narrow redshift ranges. there ishowever evidence that the mid-ir spectra of our sample differ systematicallyfrom those of local ulirgs; our sample have comparable pah equivalent widthsbut weaker apparent silicate absorption, and (possibly) enhanced pah6.2um/7.7um and 6.2um/11.2um flux ratios. furthermore, the composite mid-irspectrum of our sample is almost identical to that of local starbursts with irluminosities of 10^10-10^11 lsun rather than that of local ulirgs. thesedifferences are consistent with a reduced dust column, which can plausibly beobtained via some combination of (1) star formation that is extended overspatial scales of 1-4kpc, and (2) star formation in unusually gas-rich regions.

1309.3922	mid- to far infrared properties of star-forming galaxies and active  galactic nuclei	we study the mid- to far-ir properties of a 24um-selected flux-limited sample(s24 &gt; 5mjy) of 154 intermediate redshift (&lt;z&gt;~0.15), infrared luminousgalaxies, drawn from the 5muses survey. by combining existing mid-irspectroscopy and new herschel spire submm photometry from the hermes program,we derived robust total infrared luminosity (lir) and dust mass (md) estimatesand infered the relative contribution of the agn to the infrared energy budgetof the sources. we found that the total infrared emission of galaxies with weak6.2um pah emission (ew&lt;0.2um) is dominated by agn activity, while for galaxieswith ew&gt;0.2um more than 50% of the lir arises from star formation. we alsofound that for galaxies detected in the 250-500um herschel bands an agn has astatistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and thefar-ir colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formationactivity. for star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between thelir-to-rest-frame 8um luminosity ratio, ir8 = lir\l8, and the strength of pahfeatures. we found that this anti-correlation is primarily driven by variationsin the pahs emission, and not by variations in the 5-15um mid-ir continuumemission. using the [neiii]/[neii] line ratio as a tracer of the hardness ofthe radiation field, we confirm that galaxies with harder radiation fields tendto exhibit weaker pah features, and found that they have higher ir8 values andhigher dust-mass-weighted luminosities (lir/md), the latter being a proxy forthe dust temperature (td). we argue that these trends originate either fromvariations in the environment of the star-forming regions or are caused byvariations in the age of the starburst. finally, we provide scaling relationsthat will allow estimating lir, based on single-band observations with themid-infrared instrument, on board the upcoming jwst.

1310.0723	learning the fundamental mir spectral components of galaxies with  non-negative matrix factorisation	the mid-infrared (mir) spectra observed with the \textit{spitzer} infraredspectrograph (irs) provide a valuable dataset for untangling the physicalprocesses and conditions within galaxies.  this paper presents the first attempt to blindly learn fundamental spectralcomponents of mir galaxy spectra, using non-negative matrix factorisation(nmf). nmf is a recently developed multivariate technique shown to besuccessful in blind source separation problems. unlike the more popularmultivariate analysis technique, principal component analysis, nmf imposes thecondition that weights and spectral components are non-negative. this moreclosely resembles the physical process of emission in the mid-infrared,resulting in physically intuitive components. by applying nmf to galaxy spectrain the cornell atlas of spitzer/irs sources (cassis), we find similarcomponents amongst different nmf sets. these similar components include two foragn emission and one for star formation. [... abbreviated...] we show an nmfset with seven components can reconstruct the general spectral shape of a widevariety of objects, though struggle to fit the varying strength of emissionlines. we also show that the seven components can be used to separate outdifferent types of objects. we model this separation with gaussian mixturesmodelling and use the result to provide a classification tool.  we also show the nmf components can be used to separate out the emission fromagn and star formation regions and define a new star formation/agn diagnosticwhich is consistent with all mid-infrared diagnostics already in use but hasthe advantage that it can be applied to mid-infrared spectra with low signal tonoise or with limited spectral range. the 7 nmf components and code forclassification are made public on arxiv and are available at:\url{https://github.com/pdh21/nmf_software/}

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1401.2300	herschel observations of far-infrared cooling lines in intermediate  redshift (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies	we report the first results from a spectroscopic survey of the [cii] 158umline from a sample of intermediate redshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8) (ultra)-luminousinfrared galaxies, (u)lirgs (lir&gt;10^11.5 lsun), using the spire-fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) on board the herschel space observatory. this isthe first survey of [cii] emission, an important tracer of star-formation, at aredshift range where the star-formation rate density of the universe increasesrapidly. we detect strong [cii] 158um line emission from over 80% of thesample. we find that the [cii] line is luminous, in the range (0.8-4)x10^(-3)of the far-infrared continuum luminosity of our sources, and appears to arisefrom photodissociation regions on the surface of molecular clouds. thel[cii]/lir ratio in our intermediate redshift (u)lirgs is on average ~10 timeslarger than that of local ulirgs. furthermore, we find that the l[cii]/lir andl[cii]/lco(1-0) ratios in our sample are similar to those of local normalgalaxies and high-z star-forming galaxies. ulirgs at z~0.5 show manysimilarities to the properties of local normal and high-z star forminggalaxies. our findings strongly suggest that rapid evolution in the propertiesof the star forming regions of luminous infrared galaxies is likely to haveoccurred in the last 5 billion years.

1401.4503	tracing the cosmic growth of super massive black holes to z ~ 3 with  herschel	we study a sample of herschel-pacs selected galaxies within the goods-southand the cosmos fields in the framework of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)project. starting from the rich multi-wavelength photometric data-setsavailable in both fields, we perform a broad-band spectral energy distribution(sed) decomposition to disentangle the possible active galactic nucleus (agn)contribution from that related to the host galaxy. we find that 37 per cent ofthe herschel-selected sample shows signatures of nuclear activity at the 99 percent confidence level. the probability to reveal agn activity increases forbright ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt; 10^{11} \rm l_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at$z&gt;0.3$, becoming about 80 per cent for the brightest ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt;10^{12} \rm l_{\odot}$) infrared (ir) galaxies at $z \geq 1$. finally, wereconstruct the agn bolometric luminosity function and the super-massive blackhole growth rate across cosmic time up to $z \sim 3$ from a far-infrared (fir)perspective. this work shows general agreement with most of the panchromaticestimates from the literature, with the global black hole growth peaking at $z\sim 2$ and reproducing the observed local black hole mass density withconsistent values of the radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm rad}$($\sim$0.07).

1401.6079	hermes: spectral energy distributions of submillimeter galaxies at z &gt;4	we present a study of the infrared properties for a sample of sevenspectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies at $z&gt;$4.0. by combiningground-based near-infrared, spitzer irac and mips, herschel spire, andground-based submillimeter/millimeter photometry, we construct their spectralenergy distributions (sed) and a composite model to fit the seds. the modelincludes a stellar emission component at $\lambda_{\rm rest} &lt;$ 3.5$ \mu$m; ahot dust component peaking at $\lambda_{rest} \sim$ 5$\,\mu$m; and cold dustcomponent which becomes significant for $\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt;$ 50$\,\mu$m. sixobjects in the sample are detected at 250 and 350$ \mu$m. the dust temperaturesfor the sources in this sample are in the range of 40$-$80 k, and their $l_{\rmfir}$ $\sim$ 10$^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$ qualifies them as hyper$-$luminous infraredgalaxies (hyperlirgs). the mean fir-radio index for this sample is around $&lt; q&gt; = 2.2$ indicating no radio excess in their radio emission. most sources inthe sample have 24$ \mu$m detections corresponding to a rest-frame 4.5$ \mu$mluminosity of log$_{10}$(l$_{4.5}$ / l$_{\odot}$) = 11 $\sim$ 11.5. theirl$_{\rm 4.5}$/$l_{\rm fir}$ ratios are very similar to those of starburstdominated submillimeter galaxies at $z \sim$ 2. the $l_{\rm co}-l_{\rm fir}$relation for this sample is consistent with that determined for local ulirgsand smgs at $z \sim$ 2. we conclude that submillimeter galaxies at $z &gt;$ 4 arehotter and more luminous in the fir, but otherwise very similar to those at $z\sim$ 2. none of these sources show any sign of the strong qso phase beingtriggered.

0802.2458	properties of dusty tori in agn: i. the case of swire/sdss quasars	we derive the properties of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei (agn) fromthe comparison of observed spectral energy distributions (seds) of sdss quasarsand a precomputed grid of torus models. the observed seds comprise sdssphotometry, 2mass j, h, and k data, whenever available and mid-infrared (mir)data from the spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) survey. theadopted model is that of fritz et al., 2006. the fit is performed by standardchi^2 minimisation, the model however can be multi-component comprising astellar and a starburst components, whenever necessary. models with lowequatorial optical depth, tau_9.7, were allowed as well as ``traditional''models with tau_9.7 &gt; 1.0, corresponding to a_v &gt; 22 and the results werecompared. fits using high optical depth tori models only produced dust morecompactly distributed than in the configuration where all tau_9.7 models werepermitted. tori with decreasing dust density with the distance from the centrewere favoured while there was no clear preference for models with or withoutangular variation of the dust density. the computed outer radii of the tori areof some tens of parsecs large but can reach, in a few cases, a few hundreds ofparsecs. the mass of dust, m_dust, and infrared luminosity, l_ir, integrated inthe wavelength range between 1 and 1000 micron, do not show significantvariations with redshift, once the observational biases are taken into account.objects with 70 micron detections, representing 25% of the sample, are studiedseparately and the starburst contribution (whenever present) to the irluminosity can reach, in the most extreme but very few cases, 80%.

1409.5605	a far-infrared spectroscopic survey of intermediate redshift (ultra)  luminous infrared galaxies	we present herschel far-ir photometry and spectroscopy as well as groundbased co observations of an intermediate redshift (0.21 &lt; z &lt; 0.88) sample ofherschel-selected (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies (l_ir &gt; 10^11.5l_sun).with these measurements we trace the dust continuum, far-ir atomic lineemission, in particular [cii]\,157.7microns, as well as the molecular gas ofz~0.3 (u)lirgs and perform a detailed investigation of the interstellar mediumof the population. we find that the majority of herschel-selected intermediateredshift (u)lirgs have l_cii/l_fir ratios that are a factor of about 10 higherthan that of local ulirgs and comparable to that of local normal and high-$z$star forming galaxies. using our sample to bridge local and high-z [cii]observations, we find that the majority of galaxies at all redshifts and allluminosities follow a l_cii-l_fir relation with a slope of unity, from whichlocal ulirgs and high-z agn dominated sources are clear outliers. we alsoconfirm that the strong anti-correlation between the l_cii/l_fir ratio and thefar-ir color l_60/l_100 observed in the local universe holds over a broad rangeof redshifts and luminosities, in the sense that warmer sources exhibit lowerl_cii/l_fir at any epoch. intermediate redshift ulirgs are also characterisedby large molecular gas reservoirs and by lower star formation efficienciescompared to that of local ulirgs. the high l_cii/l_fir ratios, the moderatestar formation efficiencies (l_lir/l_co or l_ir/m_gas) and the relatively lowdust temperatures of our sample (which are also common characteristics ofhigh-z star forming galaxies with ulirg-like luminosities) indicate that theevolution of the physical properties of (u)lirgs between the present day and z&gt; 1 is already significant by z ~ 0.3.

1501.07602	mapping the average agn accretion rate in the sfr-m* plane for herschel  selected galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation of agn accretion, star formation rate (sfr), andstellar mass (m$_*$) using a sample of $\approx$ 8600 star-forming galaxies upto z=2.5 selected with \textit{herschel} imaging in the goods and cosmosfields. for each of them we derive sfr and m$_*$, both corrected, whennecessary, for emission from an active galactic nucleus (agn), through thedecomposition of their spectral energy distributions (seds). about 10 per centof the sample are detected individually in \textit{chandra} observations of thefields. for the rest of the sample we stack the x-ray maps to get average x-rayproperties. after subtracting the x-ray luminosity expected from star formationand correcting for nuclear obscuration, we derive the average agn accretionrate for both detected sources and stacks, as a function of m$_{*}$, sfr andredshift. the average accretion rate correlates with sfr and with m$_*$. thedependence on sfr becomes progressively more significant at z$&gt;$0.8. this maysuggest that sfr is the original driver of these correlations. we find thataverage agn accretion and star formation increase in a similar fashion withoffset from the star-forming "main-sequence". our interpretation is thataccretion onto the central black hole and star formation broadly trace eachother, irrespective of whether the galaxy is evolving steadily on themain-sequence or bursting.

1506.05475	the composite nature of dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) at z~2-3 in the  cosmos field: i. a far-infrared view	dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) are bright 24 um-selected sources with extremeobscuration at optical wavelengths. they are typically characterized by arising power-law continuum of hot dust (t_d ~ 200-1000k) in the near-irindicating that their mid-ir luminosity is dominated by an an active galacticnucleus (agn). dogs with a fainter 24 um flux display a stellar bump in thenear-ir and their mid-ir luminosity appears to be mainly powered by dusty starformation. alternatively, it may be that the mid-ir emission arising from agnactivity is dominant but the torus is sufficiently opaque to make the near-iremission from the agn negligible with respect to the emission from the hostcomponent. in an effort to characterize the astrophysical nature of theprocesses responsible for the ir emission in dogs, this paper exploits herscheldata (pacs + spire) on a sample of 95 dogs within the cosmos field. we derive awealth of far-ir properties (e.g., total ir luminosities; mid-to-far ir colors;dust temperatures and masses) based on sed fitting. of particular interest arethe 24 um-bright dogs (f_24um &gt; 1mjy). they present bluer far-ir/mid-ir colorsthan the rest of the sample, unveiling the potential presence of an agn. theagn contribution to the total 8-1000 um flux increases as a function of therest-frame 8 um-luminosity irrespective of the redshift. this confirms thatfaint dogs (l_8 um&lt; 10^12 l_sun) are dominated by star-formation while brighterdogs show a larger contribution from an agn.

1507.01144	the host galaxies of micro-jansky radio sources	we combine a deep 0.5~deg$^2$, 1.4~ghz deep radio survey in the lockman holewith infrared and optical data in the same field, including the servs andukidss near-infrared surveys, to make the largest study to date of the hostgalaxies of radio sources with typical radio flux densities $\sim 50 \;\mu$jy.87% (1274/1467) of radio sources have identifications in servs to $ab\approx23.1$ at 3.6 or 4.5$\mu$m, and 9% are blended with bright objects (mostlystars), leaving only 4% (59 objects) which are too faint to confidentlyidentify in the near-infrared. we are able to estimate photometric redshiftsfor 68% of the radio sources. we use mid-infrared diagnostics to show that thesource population consists of a mixture of star forming galaxies, rapidlyaccreting (cold mode) agn and low accretion rate, hot mode agn, with neitheragn nor starforming galaxies clearly dominating. we see the breakdown in the$k-z$ relation in faint radio source samples, and show that it is due to radiosource populations becoming dominated by sources with radio luminosities $\sim10^{23}\;{\rm whz^{-1}}$. at these luminosities, both the star forming galaxiesand the cold mode agn have hosts with stellar luminosities about a factor oftwo lower than those of hot mode agn, which continue to reside in only the mostmassive hosts. we show that out to at least $z\sim 2$, galaxies with stellarmasses $&gt;10^{11.5}\, m_{\odot}$ have a radio-loud fraction up to $\sim 30$%.this is consistent with there being a sufficient number of radio sources thatradio-mode feedback could play a role in galaxy evolution.

(1994), guiderdoni et al. (1997) and the evolvingmodels of xu et al. (1998), over 7 orders of magnitude in 15um flux density.the counts agree with other estimates from the isocam instrument at overlappingflux densities (elbaz et al. 1999), provided a consistent flux calibration isused. luminosity evolution at a rate of (1+z)^3, incorporating mid-ir spectralfeatures, provides a better fit to the 15um differential counts than (1+z)^4density evolution. no-evolution models are excluded, and implying that belowaround 10mjy at 15um the source counts become dominated by an evolvingcosmological population of dust-shrouded starbursts and/or active galaxies.

astro-ph;0107585	the scuba 8-mjy survey - ii: multiwavelength analysis of bright sub-mm  sources	we present the results of a multi-wavelength study of the 19 most significantsub-mm sources detected in the scuba 8-mjy survey. as described in scott et al.(2001), this survey covers ~260 arcmin^2 using the sub-millimetre camera scuba,to a limiting source detection limit s(850um) ~ 8 mjy. one advantage of thisrelatively bright flux-density limit is that accurate astrometric positions arepotentially achievable for every source using existing radio and/or mm-waveinterferometers. however, an associated advantage is that sed-based redshiftconstraints should be more powerful than in fainter sub-mm surveys. here wetherefore exploit the parallel scuba 450um data, in combination with existingradio and iso data at longer and shorter wavelengths to set constraints on theredshift of each source. we also analyse new and existing optical andnear-infrared imaging of our scuba survey fields to select potentialidentifications consistent with these constraints. our derived sed-basedredshift constraints, and the lack of statistically significant associationswith even moderately bright galaxies allow us to conclude that all 19 sourceslie at z &gt; 1, and at least half of them apparently lie at z &gt; 2.

(2002, paper i): eight of them were identifiedas stars, one is definitely an agn, a second seems likely to be an agn, too,while the remaining 22 appear to be normal spiral or starburst galaxies. usingmodel spectral energy distributions (seds) of similar galaxies, we comparemethods for estimating the star formation rates (sfrs) in these objects,finding that an estimator based on integrated (3-1000um) ir luminosityreproduces the model sfrs best. applying this estimator to model fits to theseds of our 22 spiral and starburst galaxies, we find that they are formingstars at rates of ~1-100 m_sol/yr, with a median value of ~40m_sol/yr, assumingan einstein - de sitter universe with a hubble constant of 50 km/s/mpc, andstar formation taking place according to a salpeter (1955) imf across the massrange 0.1-100m_sol. we split the redshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.6 into two equal-volumebins to compute raw estimates of the star formation rate density contributed bythese sources, assuming the same cosmology and imf as above and computingerrors based on estimated uncertainties in the sfrs of individual galaxies. wecompare these results with other estimates of the sfr density made with thesame assumptions, showing them to be consistent with the results of flores etal. (1999) from their iso survey of the cfrs 1415+52 field. however, therelatively small volume of our survey means that our sfr density estimatessuffer from a large sampling variance, implying that our results, bythemselves, do not place tight constraints on the global mean sfr density.

astro-ph;0202427	the evolution of type 1 agn in the ir (15mu). the view from elais-s1	we present the 15 micron luminosity function of type 1 agn (qso + seyfert 1).our sample of 21 high-redshift sources is selected from the preliminaryanalysis catalogue in the s1 field of the european large area iso survey(elais). to study the cosmological evolution of the agn1 luminosity function,our sample has been combined with a local sample of 41 sources observed byiras. we find that the luminosity function of agn1 at 15 micron is fairly wellrepresented by a double-power-law-function. there is evidence for significantcosmological evolution consistent with a pure luminosity evolution (ple) modell(z) (1+z)^k, with k=3.0-3.3. the value of k depends on the existence or not ofan evolution cut-off at redshift ~2, and on the adopted cosmology. from theluminosity function and its evolution we estimate a contribution of agn1 to thecosmic infrared background (cirb) of nui_nu ~ 6 x 10^{-11}w m^{-2} sr^{-1} at15 micron. this corresponds to ~2-3% of the total observed cirb at thiswavelength. under the usual assumptions of unified models for agn, the expectedcontribution of the whole agn population to the cirb at 15 micron is 10-15%.

astro-ph;0205173	new method for isocam data reduction - ii. mid-infrared extragalactic  source counts in the southern elais field	we present the 15 micron extragalactic source counts from the final analysiscatalogue of the european large area iso survey southern hemisphere field s1,extracted using the lari method. the large number of extragalactic sources(about 350) detected over this area between 0.5 and 100 mjy guarantee a highstatistical significance of the source counts in the previously poorly coveredflux density range between iras and the deep isocam surveys. the bright countsin s1 (&gt; 2mjy) are consistent with a flat, euclidean slope, suggesting thedominance of a non-evolving population. in contrast, at fainter fluxes (&lt; 2mjy) our counts show a strong departure from no evolution models, with a verysteep super-euclidean slope down to our flux limit. strong luminosity anddensity evolution is needed at least for the population of star-forminggalaxies, together with a luminosity break around 10^10.8 lsun in their localluminosity function in order to reproduce our sharp increase of the countsbelow 2 mjy and the redshift distributions observed for 15 micron sources atdifferent flux levels. the contribution of the strongly evolving starburstpopulation (down to 50 microjy) to the 15 micron cosmic background is estimatedto be 2.2 nw m^-2 sr^-1 (67% of the total mid-infrared background estimate).

astro-ph;0208412	near and mid-infrared colours of star-forming galaxies in elais fields	we present j and k-band near-infrared photometry of a sample of mid-infraredsources detected by the infrared space observatory (iso) as part of theeuropean large area iso-survey (elais) and study their classification andstar-forming properties. we have used the preliminary elais catalogue for the6.7 micron (lw2) and 15 micron (lw3) fluxes. all of the high-reliability lw2sources and 80 per cent of the lw3 sources are identified in the near-ir surveyreaching k = 17.5 mag. the near- to mid-ir flux ratios can effectively be usedto separate stars from galaxies in mid-ir surveys. the stars detected in oursurvey region are used to derive a new accurate calibration for the elaisisocam data in both the lw2 and lw3 filters. we show that near to mid-ircolour-colour diagrams can be used to further classify galaxies, as well asstudy star-formation. the isocam elais survey is found to mostly detectstrongly star-forming late-type galaxies, possibly starburst powered galaxies,and it also picks out obscured agn. the elais galaxies yield an average mid-irflux ratio lw2/lw3 = 0.67 +/- 0.27. we discuss this [6.7/15] ratio as a starformation tracer using iso and iras data of a local comparison sample. we findthat the [k/15] ratio is also agood indicator of activity level in galaxies andconclude that the drop in the [6.7/15] ratio seen in strongly star-forminggalaxies is a result of both an increase of 15 mic emission and an apparentdepletion of 6.7 mic emission. near-ir data together with the mid-ir give thepossibility to estimate the relative amount of interstellar matter in thegalaxies.

astro-ph;9901087	likelihood analysis of the local group acceleration	we compute the acceleration on the local group using 11206 iras galaxies fromthe recently completed all-sky pscz redshift survey. measuring the accelerationvector in redshift space generates systematic uncertainties due to the redshiftspace distortions in the density field. we therefore assign galaxies to theirreal space positions by adopting a non-parametric model for the velocity fieldthat solely relies on the linear gravitational instability and linear biasinghypotheses. remaining systematic contributions to the measured accelerationvector are corrected for by using pscz mock catalogues from n-body experiments.the resulting acceleration vector points approx. 15 degrees away from the cmbdipole apex, with a remarkable alignment between small and large scalecontributions. a considerable fraction of the measured acceleration isgenerated within 40 h-1 mpc with a non-negligible contribution from scalesbetween 90 and 140 h-1 mpc after which the acceleration amplitude seems to haveconverged. the local group acceleration from pscz appears to be consistent withthe one determined from the iras 1.2 jy galaxy catalogue once the differentcontributions from shot noise have been taken into account. the results areconsistent with the gravitational instability hypothesis and do not indicateany strong deviations from the linear biasing relation on large scales. amaximum-likelihood analysis of the comulative pscz dipole is performed within aradius of 150 h-1 mpc in which we account for nonlinear effects, shot noise andfinite sample size. we obtain \beta = 0.70 (+ 0.35)(-0.2) at 1 \sigmaconfidence level.
