0907.1157	a spectroscopic survey of the youngest field stars in the solar  neighbourhood. i. the optically bright sample	we present the first results of a ground-based programme conducted on 1-4mclass telescopes. our sample consists of 1097 active and presumably youngstars, all of them being optical counterparts of rass x-ray sources in thenorthern hemisphere. we concentrate on the 704 optically brightest(v_ticho&lt;=9.5 mag) candidates. we acquired high-res spectroscopy in thehalpha/li spectral regions for 426 of such stars without relevant literaturedata. we describe the sample and the observations and we start to discuss itsphysical properties. we used a cross-correlation technique and other tools toderive accurate radial/rotational velocities and to perform a spectralclassification for both single and sb2 stars. the spectral subtractiontechnique was used to derive chromospheric activity levels and li abundances.we estimated the fraction of young single stars and multiple systems in stellarsoft x-ray surveys and the contamination by more evolved systems, like rscvn's. we classified stars on the basis of li abundance and give a glimpse oftheir sky distribution. the sample appears to be a mixture of youngpleiades-/hyades- like stars plus an older li-poor population (~1-2 gyr). 7stars with li abundance compatible with the age of ic 2602 (~30 myr) or youngerwere detected as well, although 2 appear to be li-rich giants. the discovery ofa large number of li-rich giants is another outcome of this survey. thecontamination of soft x-ray surveys by old systems in which the activity levelis enhanced by tidal synchronisation is not negligible, especially for k-typestars. 5 stars with li content close to the primordial abundance are probablyassociated with known moving groups in the solar neighbourhood. some of themare ptts candidates according to their positions in the hr diagram.

0909.5035	evidence for early disk-locking among low-mass members of the orion  nebula cluster	we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for 91 pms stars in oncwith masses in the range 0.10-0.25msun carried out with the multi-fiberspectrograph flames@eso. our aim is to better understand the disk-lockingscenario in very low-mass stars. we have derived radial velocities, vsini, andfull width at 10% of the halpha emission peak. using published measurements ofinfrared excess as disk tracer, and equivalent width of the nir caii linelambda8542, mid-ir difference [3.6]-[8.0]micron derived by spitzer data, and10% halpha width as diagnostic of the level of accretion, we have looked forany correlation between vsini divided by the radius and presence of disk andaccretion. four low-mass stars are sb2 systems. the distribution of rotationperiods derived from our vsini measurements is unimodal with a peak of fewdays. our &lt;sini&gt; is lower than the one expected for a random distribution. wefind no evidence for a population of fast rotators close to the break-upvelocity. a clear correlation between vsini/r and delta(ic-k) has been found.while for stars with no circumstellar disk a spread in the rotation rates isseen, stars with a circumstellar disk show an abrupt drop in their rotationrates by a factor of ~5. on the other hand, only a partial correlation betweenvsini and accretion is observed when other indicators are used. the x-raycoronal activity level shows no dependence on vsini/r suggesting that all starsare in a saturated regime limit. the critical velocity is probably below ourvsini detection limit of 9 km/s. the onc low-mass stars in our sample atpresent seem to be not locked, but the clear correlation we find betweenrotation and ir color excess suggests that they were locked once. in addition,the percentage of accretors seems to scale inversely to the stellar mass.

1111.4615	fundamental properties of five kepler stars using global asteroseismic  quantities and ground-based observations	we present an asteroseismic study of the solar-like stars kic 11395018, kic10273246, kic 10920273, kic 10339342, and kic 11234888 using short-cadence timeseries of more than eight months from the kepler satellite. for four of thesestars, we derive atmospheric parameters from spectra acquired with the nordicoptical telescope. the global seismic quantities (average large frequencyseparation and frequency of maximum power), combined with the atmosphericparameters, yield the mean density and surface gravity with precisions of 2%and ~0.03 dex, respectively. we also determine the radius, mass, and age withprecisions of 2-5%, 7-11%, and ~35%, respectively, using grid-based analyses.we determine asteroseismic distances to these stars with a precision betterthan 10%, and constrain the stellar inclination for three of the stars. an liabundance analysis yields an independent estimate of the age, but this isinconsistent with the asteroseismically determined age for one of the stars. wecompare the results from five different grid-based analyses, and we find thatthey all provide radius and mass values to within 2.4sigma. the absence of ametallicity constraint when the average large frequency separation is measuredwith a precision of 1% biases the fitted radius and mass for the stars withnon-solar metallicity (metal-rich kic 11395018 and metal-poor kic 10273246),while including a metallicity constraint reduces the uncertainties in both ofthese parameters by almost a factor of two. we found that including the averagesmall frequency separation improves the determination of the age only for kic11395018 and kic 11234888, and for the latter this improvement was due to thelack of strong atmospheric constraints.

(i) for the field stars wefind that the temperatures derived by means of the ldr method are in excellentagreement with those found by the spectral synthesis. this result is extremelyencouraging because it shows that spectra can be used to firmly derivepopulation characteristics (e.g., mass and age) of the observed stars. (ii) forthe ic 4651 stars we use the determined effective temperature to derive thefollowing results. a) the reddening e(b-v) of the cluster is 0.12+/-0.02,largely independent of the color-temperature calibration used. b) the age ofthe cluster is 1.2+/-0.2 gyr. c) the typical mass of the analysed giant starsis 2.0+/-0.2m_sun. moreover, we find a systematic difference of about 0.2 dexin log g between spectroscopic and evolutionary values. we conclude that, inspite of known limitations, a classical spectroscopic analysis of giant starsmay indeed result in very reliable stellar parameters. we caution that thequality of the agreement, on the other hand, depends on the details of theadopted spectroscopic analysis.

1303.3027	lithium abundance in the metal-poor open cluster ngc 2243	lithium is a fundamental element for studying the mixing mechanisms acting inthe stellar interiors, for understanding the chemical evolution of the galaxyand the big bang nucleosynthesis. the study of li in stars of open clusters(hereafter oc) allows a detailed comparison with stellar evolutionary modelsand permits us to trace its galactic evolution. the oc ngc 2243 is particularlyinteresting because of its low metallicity ([fe/h]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$ dex). wemeasure the iron and lithium abundance in stars of the metal-poor oc ngc 2243.the first aim is to determine whether the li dip extends to such lowmetallicities, the second is to compare the results of our li analysis in thisoc with those present in 47 tuc, a globular cluster of similar metallicity. weperformed a detailed analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with themulti-object facility flames at the eso vlt 8.2m telescope. lithium abundancewas derived through line equivalent widths and the osmarcs atmosphere models.we determine a li dip center of 1.06 $m_\odot$, which is much smaller than thatobserved in solar metallicity and metal-rich clusters. this finding confirmsand strengthens the conclusion that the mass of the stars in the li dipstrongly depends on stellar metallicity. the mean li abundance of the clusteris $\log n{\rm (li)}=2.70$ dex, which is substantially higher than thatobserved in 47 tuc. we estimated an iron abundance of [fe/h]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$dex for ngc 2243, which is similar (within the errors) to previous findings.the [$ \alpha$/fe] content ranges from $0.00\pm0.14$ for ca to $0.20\pm0.22$for ti, which is low when compared to thick disk stars and to pop ii stars, butcompatible with thin disk objects. we found a mean radial velocity of 61.9$\pm$ 0.8 \kms for the cluster.

1304.0005	the gaps programme with harps-n at tng. i: observations of the  rossiter-mclaughlin effect and characterisation of the transiting system  qatar-1	a long-term multi-purpose observational programme has started withharps-n@tng aimed to characterise the global architectural properties ofexoplanetary systems. in this first paper we fully characterise the transitingsystem qatar-1. we exploit harps-n high-precision radial velocity measurementsobtained during a transit to measure the rossiter-mclaughlin effect in theqatar-1 system, and out-of-transit measurements to redetermine thespectroscopic orbit. new photometric transit light-curves are analysed and aspectroscopic characterisation of the host star atmospheric parameters isperformed based on various methods (line equivalent width ratios, spectralsynthesis, spectral energy distribution). we achieved a significant improvementin the accuracy of the orbital parameters and derived the spin-orbit alignmentof the system; this information, combined with the spectroscopic determinationof the host star properties, allows us to derive the fundamental physicalparameters for star and planet (masses and radii). the orbital solution for theqatar-1 system is consistent with a circular orbit and the system presents asky-projected obliquity of lambda = -8.4+-7.1 deg. the planet, with a mass of1.33+-0.05 m_j, is found to be significantly more massive than previouslyreported. the host star is confirmed to be metal-rich ([fe/h]= 0.20+-0.10) andslowly rotating (vsini = 1.7+-0.3 km/s), though moderately active, as indicatedby strong chromospheric emission in the ca ii h&amp;k line cores (logr'_hk about-4.60). the system is well aligned and fits well within the general lambda vsteff trend. we definitely rule out any significant orbital eccentricity. theevolutionary status of the system is inferred based on gyrochronology, and thepresent orbital configuration and timescale for orbital decay are discussed interms of star-planet tidal interactions.

1304.4130	astrophysical false positives in direct imaging for exoplanets: a white  dwarf close to a rejuvenated star	as is the case for all techniques involved in the research for exoplanets,direct imaging has to take into account the probability of so-calledastrophysical false positives, which are phenomena that mimic the signature ofobjects we are seeking. in this work we aim to present a case of a falsepositive found during a direct imaging survey conducted with vlt/naco. apromising exoplanet candidate was detected around the k2-type star hd\,8049 injuly 2010.its contrast of $\delta h$=7.05 at 1.57 arcsec allowed us to guessthe presence of a 35 \mjup companion at 50 projected au, for the nominal systemage and heliocentric distance.to check whether it was gravitationally bound tothe host star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed thesystem one year later and concluded a high probability of a bound system. wealso used radial velocity measurements of the host star, spanning a time rangeof $\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties, aswell as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectralenergy distribution. we also obtained for the companion $u$-band imaging withefosc and $nir$ spectroscopy. combining all these information we conclude thatthe companion of hd\,8049 is a white dwarf (wd), with temperature$t_{eff}=18800 \pm 2100$ k and mass $m_{wd}=0.56 \pm 0.08 m_{\odot}$. thesignificant radial velocity trend coupled with the imaging data indicate thatthe most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of about 50 au.the discrepancybetween the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star. themoderately large level of chromospheric activity and fast rotation, mimickingthe properties of a young star, might be induced by the exchange of mass withthe progenitor of the wd. this example demonstrates some of the challenges indetermining accurate age estimates and identifications of faint companions.

1308.5563	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects iii. photospheric and  chromospheric properties of class iii objects	we analyzed x-shooter/vlt spectra of 24 classiii sources from three nearbystar-forming regions (sigmaorionis, lupusiii, and twhya). we determined theeffective temperature, surface gravity, rotational velocity, and radialvelocity by comparing the observed spectra with synthetic bt-settl modelspectra. we investigated in detail the emission lines emerging from the stellarchromospheres and combined these data with archival x-ray data to allow for acomparison between chromospheric and coronal emissions. both x-ray and halphaluminosity as measured in terms of the bolometric luminosity are independent ofthe effective temperature for early-m stars but decline toward the end of thespectral m sequence. for the saturated early-m stars the average emission levelis almost one dex higher for x-rays than for halpha: log(l_x/l_bol) = -2.85 +-0.36 vs. log(l_halpha/l_bol) = -3.72 +- 0.21. when all chromospheric emissionlines (including the balmer series up to h11, caii hk, the caii infraredtriplet, and several hei lines) are summed up the coronal flux still dominatesthat of the chromosphere, typically by a factor 2-5. flux-flux relationsbetween activity diagnostics that probe different atmospheric layers (from thelower chromosphere to the corona) separate our sample of active pre-mainsequence stars from the bulk of field m dwarfs studied in the literature. fluxratios between individual optical emission lines show a smooth dependence onthe effective temperature. the balmer decrements can roughly be reproduced byan nlte radiative transfer model devised for another young star of similar age.future, more complete chromospheric model grids can be tested against this dataset.

1310.2069	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: iv -- accretion in  low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects in lupus	we present x-shooter/vlt observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-massstellar and sub-stellar objects (ysos) in the lupus star forming region,spanning a range in mass from ~0.03 to ~1.2msun, but mostly with 0.1msun &lt;mstar &lt; 0.5msun. our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship betweenexcess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, toinvestigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of thecentral object. the accretion luminosity (lacc), and from it the accretion rate(macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the uv to thenear-ir, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. the flux andluminosity (ll) of a large number of emission lines of h, he, caii, etc.,observed simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. theluminosity of all the lines is well correlated with lacc. we provide empiricalrelationships between lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which havea lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. ourmeasurements extend the pab and brg relationships to lacc values about twoorders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. we confirmthat different methodologies to measure lacc and macc yield significantlydifferent results: ha line profile modelling may underestimate macc by 0.6 to0.8dex with respect to macc derived from continuum-excess measures. suchdifferences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between maccand other ysos properties reported in the literature. we derive macc in therange 2e-12 -- 4e-8 msun/yr and conclude that macc is proportional tomstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than inprevious studies. a number of properties indicate that the physical conditionsof the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in macc.

1401.4905	three planetary companions around m67 stars	for the past six years we have carried out a search for massive planetsaround main sequence and evolved stars in the open cluster (oc) m67, usingradial velocity (rv) measurements obtained with harps at eso (la silla), sophieat ohp and hrs at het. additional rv data come from coralie at the euler swisstelescope. we aim to perform a long-term study on giant planet formation inopen clusters and determine how it depends on stellar mass and chemicalcomposition.  we report the detection of three new extrasolar planets: two in orbit aroundthe two g dwarfs ybp1194 and ybp1514, and one around the evolved star s364. theorbital solution for ybp1194 yields a period of 6.9 days, an eccentricity of0.24, and a minimum mass of 0.34 mj. ybp1514 shows periodic rv variations of5.1 days, a minimum mass of 0.40 mj, and an eccentricity of 0.39. the bestkeplerian solution for s364 yields a period of 121.7 days, an eccentricity of0.35 and a minimum mass of 1.54 mj. an analysis of h_alpha core fluxmeasurements as well as of the line bisectors spans revealed no correlationwith the rv periods, indicating that the rv variations are best explained bythe presence of a planetary companion. remarkably, ybp1194 is one of the bestsolar twins identified so far, and ybp1194b is the first planet found around asolar twin that belongs to a stellar cluster. in contrast with early reportsand in agreement with recent findings, our results show that massive planetsaround stars of open clusters are as frequent as those around field stars.

1403.6728	the gaps programme with harps-n at tng. iii: the retrograde orbit of  hat-p-18b	the measurement of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting exoplanetsplaces constraints on the orientation of the orbital axis with respect to thestellar spin axis, which can shed light on the mechanisms shaping the orbitalconfiguration of planetary systems. here we present the interesting case of thesaturn-mass planet hat-p-18b, which orbits one of the coolest stars for whichthe rossiter-mclaughlin effect has been measured so far. we acquired aspectroscopic time-series, spanning a full transit, with the harps-nspectrograph mounted at the tng telescope. the very precise radial velocitymeasurements delivered by the harps-n pipeline were used to measure therossiter-mclaughlin effect. complementary new photometric observations ofanother full transit were also analysed to obtain an independent determinationof the star and planet parameters. we find that hat-p-18b lies on acounter-rotating orbit, the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axisand the planet orbital axis being lambda=132 +/- 15 deg. by joint modelling ofthe radial velocity and photometric data we obtain new determinations of thestar (m_star = 0.770 +/- 0.027 m_sun; r_star= 0.717 +/- 0.026 r_sun;vsin(i_star) = 1.58 +/- 0.18 km/s) and planet (m_pl = 0.196 +/- 0.008 m_j; r_pl= 0.947 +/- 0.044 r_j) parameters. our spectra provide for the host star aneffective temperature t_eff = 4870 +/- 50 k, a surface gravity of log(g_star) =4.57 +/- 0.07 cm/s, and an iron abundance of [fe/h] = 0.10 +/- 0.06. hat-p-18bis one of the few planets known to transit a star with t_eff &lt; 6250 k on aretrograde orbit. objects such as hat-p-18b (low planet mass and/or relativelylong orbital period) most likely have a weak tidal coupling with their parentstars, therefore their orbits preserve any original misalignment. as such, theyare ideal targets to study the causes of orbital evolution in coolmain-sequence stars.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

1408.5011	accretion-ejection connection in the young brown dwarf candidate  iso-cha1 217	as the number of observed brown dwarf outflows is growing it is important toinvestigate how these outflows compare to the well studied jets from youngstellar objects. a key point of comparison is the relationship between outflowand accretion activity and in particular the ratio between the mass outflow andaccretion rates ($\dot{m}_{out}$/$\dot{m}_{acc}$). the brown dwarf candidateiso-chai 217 was discovered by our group, as part of a spectro-astrometricstudy of brown dwarfs, to be driving an asymmetric outflow with theblue-shifted lobe having a position angle of $\sim$ 20$^{\circ}$. the aim hereis to further investigate the properties of iso-chai 217, the morphology andkinematics of its outflow, and to better constrain($\dot{m}_{out}$/$\dot{m}_{acc}$). the outflow is spatially resolved in the$[sii]\lambda \lambda 6716,6731$ lines and is detected out to $\sim$ 1\farcs6in the blue-shifted lobe and ~ 1" in the red-shifted lobe. the asymmetrybetween the two lobes is confirmed although the velocity asymmetry is lesspronounced with respect to our previous study. using thirteen differentaccretion tracers we measure log($\dot{m}_{acc}$) [m$_{sun}$/yr]= -10.6 $\pm$0.4. as it was not possible to measure the effect of extinction on the iso-chai217 outflow $\dot{m}_{out}$ was derived for a range of values of a$_{v}$, up toa value of a$_{v}$ = 2.5 mag estimated for the source extinction. the logarithmof the mass outflow ($\dot{m}_{out}$) was estimated in the range -11.7 to -11.1for both jets combined. thus $\dot{m}_{out}$/$\dot{m}_{acc}$ [\msun/yr] liesbelow the maximum value predicted by magneto-centrifugal jet launching models.finally, both model fitting of the balmer decrements and spectro-astrometricanalysis of the h$\alpha$ line show that the bulk of the h i emission comesfrom the accretion flow.

1408.5719	evidence from stellar rotation of enhanced disc dispersal: (i) the case  of the triple visual system bd-21 1074 in the $\beta$ pictoris association	the early stage of stellar evolution is characterized by a star-disc lockingmechanism. the disc-locking prevents the star to spin its rotation up, and itstimescale depends on the disc lifetime. some mechanisms can significantlyshorten this lifetime, allowing a few stars to start spinning up much earlierthan other stars. in the present study, we aim to investigate how theproperties of the circumstellar environment can shorten the disc lifetime. wehave identified a few multiple stellar systems, composed of stars with similarmasses, which belong to associations with a known age. since all parametersthat are responsible for the rotational evolution, with the exception ofenvironment properties and initial stellar rotation, are similar for allcomponents, we expect that significant differences among the rotation periodscan only arise from differences in the disc lifetimes. a photometric timeseriesallowed us to measure the rotation periods of each component, whilehigh-resolution spectra provided us with the fundamental parameters, $v\sin{i}$and chromospheric line fluxes. the rotation periods of the components differsignificantly, and the component b, which has a closer companion c, rotatesfaster than the more distant and isolated component a. we can ascribe therotation period difference to either different initial rotation periods ordifferent disc-locking phases arising from the presence of the close companionc. in the specific case of bd$-$21 1074, the second scenario seems to be morefavored. in our hypothesis of different disc-locking phase, any planet orbitingthis star is likely formed very rapidly owing to a gravitational instabilitymechanism, rather than core accretion. only a large difference of initialrotation periods alone could account for the observed period difference,leaving comparable disc lifetimes.

1501.04450	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of pre-main sequence stellar spectra	this paper describes the analysis of uves and giraffe spectra acquired by thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey in the fields of young clusters whosepopulation includes pre-main sequence (pms) stars. both methods that have beenextensively used in the past and new ones developed in the contest of thegaia-eso survey enterprise are available and used. the internal precision ofthese quantities is estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by suchdifferent methods, while the accuracy is estimated by comparison withindependent external data, like effective temperature and surface gravityderived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars.specific strategies are implemented to deal with fast rotation, accretionsignatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling. the analysis carried out onspectra acquired in young clusters' fields during the first 18 months ofobservations, up to june 2013, is presented in preparation of the first releaseof advanced data products. stellar parameters obtained with the higherresolution and larger wavelength coverage from uves are reproduced withcomparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lowerresolution of the giraffe setup adopted for young stars, which allows us toprovide with confidence stellar parameters for the much larger giraffe sample.precisions are estimated to be $\approx$ 120 k r.m.s. in teff, $\approx$0.3 dexr.m.s. in logg, and $\approx$0.15 dex r.m.s. in [fe/h], for both the uves andgiraffe setups.

astro-ph;0610560	photospheric temperature measurements in young main sequence stars	as part of our program to study stellar photospheric and chromosphericactivity, we have examined several young solar type stars with activity levelsintermediate between the sun and the very active rs cvn binaries. we haveanalysed contemporaneous spectroscopic data obtained at catania observatory(serra la nave station, mt. etna) and photometric data acquired in thestromgren bands with an automatic photometric telescope (apt) at fairbornobservatory (arizona, usa). surface inhomogeneities have been detected from therotational modulation of stellar brightness as well as from the modulation ofseveral photospheric line-depth ratios (ldrs). the presence of chromosphericplage-like regions has been inferred from the rotational modulation of thehalpha line equivalent width (ew_halpha) evaluated with the spectral synthesismethod. the most relevant results are the strong correlation between thebrightness and temperature curves derived respectively from photometry and theldrs as well as the striking anti-correlation between brightness and halphaemission. this suggests a close spatial association of spots and plages, asfrequently observed for the largest sunspot groups (e.g., catalano et al.(1998)) and for some very active rs cvn systems (catalano et al. 2002).moreover, a simple spot/plage model applied to the observed flux curves allowsa rough reconstruction of photospheric and chromospheric features of young mainsequence stars.
