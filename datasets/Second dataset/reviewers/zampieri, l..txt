0901.2075	sn 2005cs in m51 ii. complete evolution in the optical and the  near-infrared	we present the results of the one year long observational campaign of thetype ii-plateau sn 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). this extensive dataset makes sn 2005cs the best observedlow-luminosity, 56ni-poor type ii-plateau event so far and one of the bestcore-collapse supernovae ever. the optical and near-infrared spectra shownarrow p-cygni lines characteristic of this sn family, which are indicative ofa very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. theoptical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactivetail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. numerous unfilteredobservations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity tomonitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. in addition tooptical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (togetherwith already published uv observations) allow us to construct for the firsttime a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. finally,comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, weinfer for sn 2005cs a 56ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejectedmass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.

0902.0466	a comparative analysis of standard accretion disks spectra: an  application to ultraluminous x-ray sources	we compare standard models of accretion disks around black holes that includethe appropriate zero-torque inner boundary condition and relativistic effectson the emission and propagation of radiation. the comparison is performedadopting the multicolor disk blackbody model (mcd) as reference and looking forthe parameter space in which it is in statistical agreement with "morephysical" accretion disk models. we find simple 'recipes' that can be used foradjusting the estimates of the physical inner radius of the disk, the blackhole mass and the accretion rate inferred using the parameters of the mcd fits.we applied these results to four ulxs for which mcd spectral fits of theirx-ray soft spectral components have been published and find that, in threecases (ngc 1313 x-1, x-2 and m 81 x-9), the black hole masses inferred for astandard disk around a schwarzschild black hole are in the interval ~100-200solar masses. only if the black hole is maximally rotating are the massescomparable to the much larger values previously derived in the literature.

0909.1017	low metallicity natal environments and black hole masses in  ultraluminous x-ray sources	we review the available estimates of the masses of the compact object inultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) and critically reconsider the stellar-massversus intermediate-mass black hole interpretations. black holes of severalhundreds to thousands of $m_\odot$ are not required for the majority of ulxs,although they might be present in the handful of known hyper-luminous ($\sim10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) objects and/or some sources showing timing features intheir power density spectra. at the same time, however, stellar mass bhs may bequite a reasonable explanation for ulxs below $\sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, butthey need super-eddington accretion and some suitable dependence of the beamingfactor on the accretion rate in order to account for ulxs above this(isotropic) luminosity. we investigate in detail a 'third way' in which aproportion of ulxs contain $\approx 30-90 m_\odot$ black holes formed in a lowmetallicity environment and accreting in a slightly critical regime and findthat it can consistently account for the properties of bright ulxs. surveys ofulx locations looking for a statistically meaningful relationship between ulxposition, average luminosity and local metallicity will provide a definitivetest of our proposal.

1003.3643	ultraluminous x-ray sources forming in low metallicity natal  environments	in the last few years multiwavelength observations have boosted ourunderstanding of ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs). yet, the most fundamentalquestions on ulxs still remain to be definitively answered: do they containstellar or intermediate mass black holes? how do they form? we investigate thepossibility that the black holes hosted in ulxs originate from massive (40-120$m_\odot$) stars in low metallicity natal environments. such black holes have atypical mass in the range $\sim 30-90 m_\odot$ and may account for theproperties of bright (above $\sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) ulxs. more than $\sim10^5$ massive black holes might have been generated in this way in the metalpoor cartwheel galaxy during the last $10^7$ years and might power most of theulxs observed in it. support to our interpretation comes from ngc 1313 x-2, thefirst ulx with a tentative identification of the orbital period in the opticalband, for which binary evolution calculations show that the system is mostlikely made by a massive donor dumping matter on a $50-100 m_\odot$ black hole.

1101.1824	the he-rich stripped-envelope core-collapse supernova 2008ax	extensive optical and near-infrared (nir) observations of the type iibsupernova 2008ax are presented, covering the first year after the explosion.the light curve is mostly similar in shape to that of the prototypical type iibsn 1993j, but shows a slightly faster decline rate at late phases and lacks theprominent narrow early-time peak of sn 1993j. from the bolometric light curveand ejecta expansion velocities, we estimate that about 0.07-0.15 solar massesof 56ni were produced during the explosion and that the total ejecta mass wasbetween 2 and 5 solar masses, with a kinetic energy of at least 10^51 erg. thespectral evolution of sn 2008ax is similar to that of the type ib sn 2007y,exhibiting high-velocity ca ii features at early phases and signs ofejecta-wind interaction from h-alpha observations at late times. nir spectrashow strong he i lines similar to the type ib sn 1999ex, and a large number ofemission features at late times. particularly interesting are the strong,double-peaked he i lines in late nir spectra, which - together withdouble-peaked [o i] emission in late optical spectra - provide clues forasymmetry and large-scale ni mixing in the ejecta.

1102.5468	the type iip sn 2007od in ugc 12846: from a bright maximum to dust  formation in the nebular phase	ultraviolet (uv), optical and near infrared (nir) observations of the typeiip supernova (sn) 2007od are presented, covering from the maximum light to thelate phase, allowing to investigate in detail different physical phenomena inthe expanding ejecta. these data turn this object into one of the most peculiariip ever studied. the early light curve of sn 2007od is similar to that of abright iips with a short plateau, a bright peak (mv = -18 mag), but a veryfaint optical light curve at late time. however, with the inclusion of midinfrared (mir) observations during the radioactive decay we have estimate am(56ni) ~ 2\times10^-2 m\odot. modeling the bolometric light curve, ejectaexpansion velocities and black-body temperature, we estimate a total ejectedmass was 5 - 7.5 m\odot with a kinetic energy of at least 0.5 \times 10^51 erg.the early spectra reveal a boxy h{\alpha} profile and high velocities featuresof the balmer series that suggest interaction between the ejecta and a closecircum-stellar matter (csm). sn 2007od may be, therefore, an intermediate casebetween a type iin sn and a typical type iip sn. also late spectra show a clearevidence of csm and the presence of dust formed inside the ejecta. the episodesof mass loss short before explosion, the bright plateau, along with therelatively small amount of 56ni and the faint [o i] observed in the nebularspectra are consistent with a super-asympthotic giant branch (super-agb)progenitor (m~9.7 - 11 m\odot).

1103.4099	vlt/fors2 observations of the optical counterpart of the isolated  neutron star rbs 1774	x-ray observations performed with rosat led to the discovery of a group(seven to date) of x-ray dim and radio-silent middle-aged isolated neutronstars (a.k.a. xdinss), which are characterised by pure blackbody spectra(kt~40-100 ev), long x-ray pulsations (p=3-12 s), and appear to be endowed withrelatively high magnetic fields, (b~10d13-14 g). rbs 1774 is one of the fewxdinss with a candidate optical counterpart, which we discovered with the vlt.we performed deep observations of rbs 1774 in the r band with the vlt todisentangle a non-thermal power-law spectrum from a rayleigh-jeans, whosecontributions are expected to be very much different in the red part of thespectrum. we did not detect the rbs 1774 candidate counterpart down to a 3sigma limiting magnitude of r~27. the constraint on its colour, (b-r)&lt;0.6,rules out that it is a background object, positionally coincident with thex-ray source. our r-band upper limit is consistent with the extrapolation ofthe b-band flux (assuming a 3 sigma uncertainty) for a set of power-laws f_nu~nu^alpha with spectral indeces alpha&lt;0.07. if the optical spectrum of rbs 1774were non-thermal, its power-law slope would be very much unlike those of allisolated neutron stars with non-thermal optical emission, suggesting that it ismost likely thermal. for instance, a rayleigh-jeans with temperature t_o = 11ev, for an optically emitting radius r_o=15 km and a source distance d=150 pc,would be consistent with the optical measurements. the implied low distance iscompatible with the 0.04 x-ray pulsed fraction if either the star spin axis isnearly aligned with the magnetic axis or with the line of sight, or it isslightly misaligned with respect to both the magnetic axis and the line ofsight by 5-10 degrees

1108.0688	radiation-hydrodynamical modelling of core-collapse supernovae: light  curves and the evolution of photospheric velocity and temperature	we have developed a relativistic, radiation-hydrodynamics lagrangian code,specifically tailored to simulate the evolution of the main observables (lightcurve, evolution of photospheric velocity and temperature) in core-collapsesupernova (cc-sn) events. the distinctive features of the code are an accuratetreatment of radiative transfer coupled to relativistic hydrodynamics, aself-consistent treatment of the evolution of the innermost ejecta taking intoaccount the gravitational effects of the central compact remnant, and a fullyimplicit lagrangian approach to the solution of the coupled non-linear finitedifference system of equations. our aim is to use it as numerical tool toperform calculations of grid of models to be compared with observation ofcc-sne. in this paper we present some testcase simulations and a comparisonwith observations of sn 1987a, as well as with the results obtained with othernumerical codes. we also briefly discuss the influence of the main physicalparameters (ejected mass, progenitor radius, explosion energy, amount of\chem{56}{ni}) on the evolution of the ejecta, and the implications of ourresults in connection with the possibility to "standardize" hydrogen-richcc-sne for using them as candles to measure cosmological distances.

1111.2497	sn 2009e: a faint clone of sn 1987a	in this paper we investigate the properties of sn 2009e, which exploded in arelatively nearby spiral galaxy (ngc 4141) and that is probably the faintest1987a-like supernova discovered so far. spectroscopic observations whichstarted about 2 months after the supernova explosion, highlight significantdifferences between sn 2009e and the prototypical sn 1987a. modelling the dataof sn 2009e allows us to constrain the explosion parameters and the propertiesof the progenitor star, and compare the inferred estimates with those availablefor the similar sne 1987a and 1998a. the light curve of sn 2009e is lessluminous than that of sn 1987a and the other members of this class, and themaximum light curve peak is reached at a slightly later epoch than in sn 1987a.late-time photometric observations suggest that sn 2009e ejected about 0.04solar masses of 56ni, which is the smallest 56ni mass in our sample of1987a-like events. modelling the observations with a radiation hydrodynamicscode, we infer for sn 2009e a kinetic plus thermal energy of about 0.6 foe, aninitial radius of ~7 x 10^12 cm and an ejected mass of ~19 solar masses. thephotospheric spectra show a number of narrow (v~1800 km/s) metal lines, withunusually strong ba ii lines. the nebular spectrum displays narrow emissionlines of h, na i, [ca ii] and [o i], with the [o i] feature being relativelystrong compared to the [ca ii] doublet. the overall spectroscopic evolution isreminiscent of that of the faint 56ni-poor type ii-plateau supernovae. thissuggests that sn 2009e belongs to the low-luminosity, low 56ni mass, low-energytail in the distribution of the 1987a-like objects in the same manner as sn1997d and similar events represent the faint tail in the distribution ofphysical properties for normal type ii-plateau supernovae.

0710.3763	supernova rates from the southern intermediate redshift eso supernova  search (stress)	to measure the supernova (sn) rates at intermediate redshift we performed thesouthern intermediate redshift eso supernova search (stress). unlike most ofthe current high redshift sn searches, this survey was specifically designed toestimate the rate for both type ia and core collapse (cc) sne. we counted thesne discovered in a selected galaxy sample measuring sn rate per unit blue bandluminosity. our analysis is based on a sample of ~43000 galaxies and on 25spectroscopically confirmed sne plus 64 selected sn candidates. our approach isaimed at obtaining a direct comparison of the high redshift and local rates andat investigating the dependence of the rates on specific galaxy properties,most notably their colour. the type ia sn rate, at mean redshift z=0.3, amountsto 0.22^{+0.10+0.16}_{-0.08 -0.14} h_{70}^2 snu, while the cc sn rate, atz=0.21, is 0.82^{+0.31 +0.30}_{-0.24 -0.26} h_{70}^2 snu. the quoted errors arethe statistical and systematic uncertainties. with respect to local value, thecc sn rate at z=0.2 is higher by a factor of ~2 already at redshift, whereasthe type ia sn rate remains almost constant. this implies that a significantfraction of sn ia progenitors has a lifetime longer than 2-3 gyr. we alsomeasured the sn rates in the red and blue galaxies and found that the sn iarate seems to be constant in galaxies of different colour, whereas the cc snrate seems to peak in blue galaxies, as in the local universe. sn rates perunit volume were found to be consistent with other measurements showing asteeper evolution with redshift for cc sne with respect to sne ia. finally wehave exploited the link between star formation (sf) and sn rates to predict theevolutionary behaviour of the sn rates and compare it with the path indicatedby observations.

1210.1411	moderately luminous type ii supernovae	core-collapse supernovae (cc-sne) descend from progenitors more massive thanabout 8 msun. because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta mayeventually interact with the circumstellar medium (csm) via highly energeticprocesses detectable in the radio, x-ray, ultraviolet (uv) and, sometimes, inthe optical domains. in this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and nearinfrared observations of five type ii sne, namely sne 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,1995ad, and 1996w. together with few other sne they form a group of moderatelyluminous type ii events. we collected photometry and spectroscopy with severaltelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectralevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. both photometry andspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. the lightcurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95&lt;m_{b}&lt;-18.70$). the ejectedmasses of ^56\ni for three sne span a wide range of values($2.8\times10^{-2}$msun$&lt;$m(\ni)$&lt;1.4\times10^{-1}$msun), while for a fourth(sn2010aj) we could determine a stringent upper limit ($7\times10^{-3}$msun).clues of interaction, such as the presence of high velocity (hv) features ofthe balmer lines, are visible in the photospheric spectra of sne 2009dd and1996w. for sn2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type iin to astandard type ii sn. modelling the observations of sne 2009dd, 2010aj and1995ad with radiation hydrodynamics codes, we infer kinetic plus thermalenergies of about 0.2-0.5 foe, initial radii of 2-5$\times10^{13}$ cm andejected masses of $\sim$5.0-9.5 msun. these values suggest moderate-mass,super-asymptotic giant branch (sagb) or red super-giants (rsg) stars as snprecursors, in analogy with other luminous type iip sne 2007od and 2009bw.

1211.6441	dynamics of stellar black holes in young star clusters with different  metallicities - i. implications for x-ray binaries	we present n-body simulations of intermediate-mass (3000-4000 msun) youngstar clusters (scs) with three different metallicities (z=0.01, 0.1 and 1zsun), including metal-dependent stellar evolution recipes and binaryevolution. following recent theoretical models of wind mass loss and corecollapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends onthe metallicity of the progenitor stars. in particular, massive metal-poorstars (z&lt;=0.3 zsun) are enabled to form massive stellar black holes (msbhs,with mass &gt;=25 msun) through direct collapse. we find that three-bodyencounters, and especially dynamical exchanges, dominate the evolution of themsbhs formed in our simulations. in scs with z=0.01 and 0.1 zsun, about 75 percent of simulated msbhs form from single stars and become members of binariesthrough dynamical exchanges in the first 100 myr of the sc life. this is afactor of &gt;~3 more efficient than in the case of low-mass (&lt;25 msun) stellarblack holes. a small but non-negligible fraction of msbhs power wind-accreting(10-20 per cent) and roche lobe overflow (rlo, 5-10 per cent) binary systems.the vast majority of msbh binaries that undergo wind accretion and/or rlo wereborn from dynamical exchange. this result indicates that msbhs can power x-raybinaries in low-metallicity young scs, and is very promising to explain theassociation of many ultraluminous x-ray sources with low-metallicity andactively star forming environments.

1305.0565	a minor merger scenario for the ultraluminous x-ray source eso 243-49  hlx-1 - ii. constraints from photometry	the point-like x-ray source hlx-1, close to the s0 galaxy eso 243-49, is thebrightest known ultraluminous x-ray source and one the strongestintermediate-mass black hole candidates. we argue that the counterpart of hlx-1may be the nucleus of a satellite galaxy, undergoing minor merger with the s0galaxy. we investigate this scenario by running a set of n-body/smoothedparticle hydrodynamics simulations of the minor merger between a s0 galaxy anda gas-rich bulgy satellite galaxy, and by comparing the results with theavailable photometric hubble space telescope (hst) data of eso 243-49 and ofthe hlx-1 counterpart. in particular, we derive synthetic surface brightnessprofiles for the simulated counterpart of hlx-1 in six hst filters, rangingfrom far ultraviolet (fuv) to infrared wavelengths. such synthetic profilesinclude a contribution from the stellar population associated with thesimulated disrupted satellite and a contribution from an irradiated disc model.these are in reasonable agreement with the observed surface brightness profilesof the hlx-1 counterpart, provided that the merger is at sufficiently latestage (&gt;~2.5 gyr since the first pericentre passage). the main differencebetween models and observations is in the fuv band, where the hst image shows afuzzy and extended emission. we show that the spectral energy distribution ofthe bulge of eso 243-49 cannot be explained with a single old stellarpopulation, but requires the existence of a younger stellar component. this isin good agreement with the star formation history derived from our n-bodysimulations, and is a further hint for the minor merger scenario.

1309.6101	quasi-periodic oscillations and energy spectra from the two brightest  ultra-luminous x-ray sources in m82	ultra-luminous x-ray sources are thought to be accreting black holes thatmight host intermediate mass black holes (imbh), proposed to exist bytheoretical studies, even though a firm detection (as a class) is stillmissing. the brightest ulx in m82 (m82 x-1) is probably one of the bestcandidates to host an imbh. in this work we analyzed the data of the recentrelease of observations obtained from m82 x-1 taken by xmm-newton. we performeda study of the timing and spectral properties of the source. we report on thedetection of (46+-2) mhz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in the powerdensity spectra of two observations. a comparison of the frequency of thesehigh-frequency qpos with previous detections supports the 1:2:3 frequencydistribution as suggested in other studies. we discuss the implications if the(46+-2) mhz qpo detected in m82 x-1 is the fundamental harmonic, in analogywith the high-frequency qpos observed in black hole binaries. for one of theobservations we have detected for the first time a qpo at 8 mhz (albeit at alow significance), that coincides with a hardening of the spectrum. we suggestthat the qpo is a milli-hertz qpo originating from the close-by transient ulxm82 x-2, with analogies to the low-frequency qpos observed in black holebinaries.

1506.05808	periodic signals from the circinus region: two new cataclysmic variables  and the ultraluminous x-ray source candidate gc x-1	the examination of two 2010 chandra acis exposures of the circinus galaxyresulted in the discovery of two pulsators: cxo j141430.1-651621 and cxouj141332.9-651756. we also detected 26-ks pulsations in cg x-1, consistentlywith previous measures. for ~40 other sources, we obtained limits on periodicmodulations. in cxo j141430.1-651621, which is ~2 arcmin outside the circinusgalaxy, we detected signals at 6120(1) s and 64.2(5) ks. in the longestobservation, the source showed a flux of ~1.1e-13 erg/cm^2/s (absorbed, 0.5-10kev) and the spectrum could be described by a power-law with photon index ~1.4.from archival observations, we found that the luminosity is variable by ~50 percent on time-scales of weeks-years. the two periodicities pin down cxoj141430.1-651621 as a cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar subtype.the period of cxou j141332.9-651756 is 6378(3) s. it is located inside thecircinus galaxy, but the low absorption indicates a galactic foreground object.the flux was ~5e-14 erg/cm^2/s in the chandra observations and showed ~50 percent variations on weekly/yearly scales; the spectrum is well fit by a powerlaw ~0.9. these characteristics and the large modulation suggest that cxouj141332.9-651756 is a magnetic cataclysmic variable, probably a polar. for cgx-1, we show that if the source is in the circinus galaxy, its properties areconsistent with a wolf-rayet plus black hole binary. we consider theimplications of this for ultraluminous x-ray sources and the prospects ofadvanced ligo and virgo. in particular, from the current sample of wr-bhsystems we estimate an upper limit to the detection rate of stellar bh-bhmergers of ~16 events per yr.

1512.05606	what brakes the crab pulsar?	optical observations provide convincing evidence that the optical phase ofthe crab pulsar follows the radio one closely. since optical data do not dependon dispersion measure variations, they provide a robust and independentconfirmation of the radio timing solution. the aim of this paper is to find aglobal mathematical description of crab pulsar's phase as a function of timefor the complete set of published jodrell bank radio ephemerides (jbe) in theperiod 1988-2014. we apply the mathematical techniques developed for analyzingoptical observations to the analysis of jbe. we break the whole period into aseries of episodes and express the phase of the pulsar in each episode as thesum of two analytical functions. the first function is the best-fitting localbraking index law, and the second function represents small residuals from thislaw with an amplitude of only a few turns, which rapidly relaxes to the localbraking index law. from our analysis, we demonstrate that the power law indexundergoes "instantaneous" changes at the time of observed jumps in rotationalfrequency (glitches). we find that the phase evolution of the crab pulsar isdominated by a series of constant braking law episodes, with the braking indexchanging abruptly after each episode in the range of values between 2.1 and2.6. deviations from such a regular phase description behave as oscillationstriggered by glitches and amount to fewer than 40 turns during the aboveperiod, in which the pulsar has made more than 2.0e10 turns. our analysis doesnot favor the explanation that glitches are connected to phenomena occurring inthe interior of the pulsar. on the contrary, timing irregularities and changesin slow down rate seem to point to electromagnetic interaction of the pulsarwith the surrounding environment.

astro-ph;0104101	spectral variability in transonic discs around black holes	transonic discs with accretion rates relevant to intrinsically brightgalactic x-ray sources ($l\approx 10^{38}$-$10^{39} {\rm erg s}^{-1}$) exhibita time dependent cyclic behaviour due to the onset of a thermal instabilitydriven by radiation pressure. in this paper we calculate radiation spectraemitted from thermally-unstable discs to provide detailed theoreticalpredictions for observationally relevant quantities. the emergent spectrum hasbeen obtained by solving self-consistently the vertical structure and radiativetransfer in the disc atmosphere. we focus on four particular stages of the discevolution, the maximal evacuation stage and three intermediate stages duringthe replenishment phase. the disc is found to undergo rather dramatic spectralchanges during the evolution, emitting mainly in the 1-10 kev band duringoutburst and in the 0.1-1 kev band off-outburst. local spectra, althoughdifferent in shape from a blackbody at the disc effective temperature, may becharacterized in terms of a hardening factor $f$. we have found that $f$ israther constant both in radius and in time, with a typical value $\sim 1.65$.

astro-ph;0304249	radiative acceleration and transient, radiation-induced electric fields	the radiative acceleration of particles and the electrostatic potentialfields that arise in low density plasmas hit by radiation produced by atransient, compact source are investigated. we calculate the dynamicalevolution and asymptotic energy of the charged particles accelerated by thephotons and the radiation-induced electric double layer in the fullrelativistic, klein-nishina regime. for fluxes in excess of $10^{27}$ ${\rmerg} {\rm cm}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1}$, the radiative force on a diluted plasma($n\la 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$) is so strong that electrons are accelerated rapidlyto relativistic speeds while ions lag behind owing to their larger inertia. theions are later effectively accelerated by the strong radiation-induced doublelayer electric field up to lorentz factors $\approx 100$, attainable in thecase of negligible compton drag. the asymptotic energies achieved by both ionsand electrons are larger by a factor 2--4 with respect to what one couldnaively expect assuming that the electron-ion assembly is a rigidly coupledsystem. the regime we investigate may be relevant within the framework of giantflares from soft gamma-repeaters.

astro-ph;0309264	low luminosity type ii supernovae: spectroscopic and photometric  evolution	in this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric observations for fourcore collapse supernovae (sne), namely sne 1994n, 1999br, 1999eu and 2001dc.together with sn 1997d, we show that they form a group of exceptionallylow-luminosity events. these sne have narrow spectral lines (indicating lowexpansion velocities) and low luminosities at every phase (significantly lowerthan those of typical core-collapse supernovae). the very low luminosity duringthe ^{56}co radioactive decay tail indicates that the mass of ^{56}ni ejectedduring the explosion is much smaller (m(ni) ~ 2-8 x 10^{-3} mo) than theaverage (m(ni) ~ 6-10 x 10^{-2} mo). two supernovae of this group (sn 1999brand sn 2001dc) were discovered very close to the explosion epoch, allowing usto determine the lengths of their plateaux (~ 100 days) as well asestablishiing the explosion epochs of the other, less-completely observed sne.it is likely that this group of sne represent the extreme low-luminosity tailof a single continuous distribution of sn ii-p events. their kinetic energy isalso exceptionally low. although an origin from low mass progenitors has alsobeen proposed for low-luminosity core-collapse sne, recent work providesevidence in favour of the high mass progenitor scenario. the incidence of theselow--luminosity sne could be as high as 4-5$ $ of all type ii sne.

astro-ph;0401273	cepheid calibration of type ia supernovae and the hubble constant	we investigate how a different calibration of the cepheid period-luminosity(pl) relation taking into account the metallicity corrections, affects theabsolute magnitude calibration of supernovae (sne) ia and, in turn, thedetermination of the hubble constant h_0. we exploit sn ia light curves fromliterature and previously unpublished data, to build the m_b -- delta m_{15}(b)relation and we calibrate the zero point by means of 9 type ia sne with cepheidmeasured distances. this relation was then used to build the hubble diagram andin turn to derive h_0. in the attempt to correct for the host galaxyextinction, we found that the data seems to suggest a value for the total toselective absorption ratio, r_b=3.5, which is smaller than the standard valuefor our own galaxy r_b=4.315. depending on different metallicity correctionsfor the cepheids p-l relation, values of r_b and sn sample selection criteria,we found that the values of the hubble constant h_0 is in the range 68--74 kms^{-1} mpc^{-1}, with associated uncertainties of the order of 10%. unpublishedphotometry is also presented for 18 sne of our sample (1991s, 1991t, 1992a,1992k, 1993h, 1993l, 1994d, 1994m, 1994ae, 1995d, 1995ac, 1995bd, 1996bo,1997bp, 1997br, 1999aa, 1999dk, 2000cx), which are the results of a longstanding effort for supernova monitoring at eso - la silla and asiagoobservatories.

astro-ph;0506341	the ultraluminous x-ray sources ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2	we present a detailed analysis of xmm archival data of two ultraluminousx-ray sources (ulxs) in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 1313: ngc 1313 x-1 andx-2. the spectral continuum of these sources was modeled with a soft thermalcomponent plus a power-law. if the soft component originates from an accretiondisk, the inferred mass of the compact remnant is &gt; 100 m_sun, making it anintermediate mass black hole (imbh). a detailed analysis of the residuals ofthe xmm epic-pn spectrum shows some evidence for the presence of an oxygenemission line in ngc 1313 x-1. the simultaneous presence of an excess inemission, although at a much reduced significance level, at different energiesin the x-ray spectra of ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 is suggestive of typical emissionlines from young supernova remnants. an optical counterpart for ngc 1313 x-2was also identified. on an eso 3.6 m image, the chandra error box embraces a r\~ 23 mag stellar-like object and excludes a previously proposed opticalcounterpart.

astro-ph;0509796	a variable quasi-periodic ocillation in m82 x-1. timing and spectral  analysis of xmm-newton and rossixte observations	we report results from a spectral and timing analysis of m82 x-1, one of thebrightest known ultraluminous x-ray sources. data from a new 105 ks {\itxmm-newton} observation of m82 x-1, performed in april 2004, and of archival{\it rossixte} observations are presented. a very soft thermal component ispresent in the {\it xmm} spectrum. although it is not possible to rule out aresidual contamination from the host galaxy, modelling it with a standardaccretion disk would imply a black hole mass of $\approx 10^3 m_{\odot}$. anemission line was also detected at an energy typical for fluorescent feemission. the power density spectrum of the {\it xmm} observation shows avariable qpo at frequency of 113 mhz with properties similar to that discoveredby strohmayer &amp; mushotzky (2003). the qpo was also found in 7 archival {\itrxte} observations, that include those analyzed by strohmayer &amp; mushotzky(2003) and fiorito &amp; titarchuk (2004). a comparison of the properties of thisqpo with those of the various types of qpos observed in galactic black holecandidates strongly suggests an association with the type-c, low frequencyqpos. scaling the frequency inversely to the black hole mass, the observed qpofrequency range (from 50 to 166 mhz) would yield a black hole mass anywhere inthe interval few tens to 1000 $m_\odot$.

astro-ph;0510046	simultaneous xmm-newton and eso vlt observations of sn 1995n: probing  the wind/ejecta interaction	we present the results of the first {\it xmm-newton} observation of theinteracting type iin supernova 1995n, performed in july 2003. we find that the0.2--10.0 kev unabsorbed flux dropped at a value of $\simeq 1.8 \times10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, almost one order of magnitude lower than thatof a previous {\it asca} observation of january 1998. from all the availablex-ray measurements, an interesting scenario emerges where the x-ray lightemission may be produced by a two-phase (clumpy/smooth) circumstellar medium.the x-ray spectral analysis shows statistically significant evidence for thepresence of two distinct components, that can be modeled with emission fromoptically thin, thermal plasmas at different temperatures. the exponent of theejecta density distribution inferred from these temperatures is $n\simeq 6.4$.  from the fluxes of the two spectral components we derive an estimate of themass loss rate of the supernova progenitor, ${\dot m} \sim 2 \times 10^{-4}m_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$, at the upper end of the interval exhibited by redsuper-giants. coordinated optical and infrared observations allow us toreconstruct the simultaneous infrared to x-ray flux distribution of sn 1995n.we find that, at $\sim$ 9 years after explosion, the direct x-ray thermalemission due to the wind/ejecta interaction is $\sim 5$ times larger than thetotal reprocessed ir/optical flux.

astro-ph;0605700	sn 2005cs in m51 i. the first month of evolution of a subluminous sn ii  plateau	early time optical observations of supernova (sn) 2005cs in the whirlpoolgalaxy (m51), are reported. photometric data suggest that sn 2005cs is amoderately under-luminous type ii plateau supernova (sn iip). the sn wasunusually blue at early epochs (u-b ~ -0.9 about three days after explosion)which indicates very high continuum temperatures. the spectra show relativelynarrow p-cygni features, suggesting ejecta velocities lower than observed inmore typical sne iip. the earliest spectra show weak absorption features in theblue wing of the he i 5876a absorption component and, less clearly, of h$\beta$and h$\alpha$. based on spectral modelling, two different interpretations canbe proposed: these features may either be due to high-velocity h and he icomponents, or (more likely) be produced by different ions (n ii, si ii).analogies with the low-luminosity, $^{56}$ni-poor, low-velocity sne iip arealso discussed.  while a more extended spectral coverage is necessary in order to determineaccurately the properties of the progenitor star, published estimates of theprogenitor mass seem not to be consistent with stellar evolution models.

astro-ph;0703663	a giant outburst two years before the core-collapse of a massive star	the death of massive stars produces a variety of supernovae, which are linkedto the structure of the exploding stars. the detection of several precursorstars of type ii supernovae have been reported, however we do not yet havedirect information on the progenitors of the hydrogen deficient type ib and icsupernovae. here we report that the peculiar type ib supernova sn2006jc isspatially coincident with a bright optical transient that occurred in 2004.spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggestthat the progenitor was a carbon-oxygen wolf-rayet star embedded within ahelium-rich circumstellar medium. there are different possible explanations forthis pre-explosion transient. it appears similar to the giant outbursts ofluminous blue variables (lbv) of 60-100 solar mass stars, however theprogenitor of sn2006jc was helium and hydrogen deficient. an lbv-like outburstof a wolf-rayet star could be invoked, but this would be the firstobservational evidence of such a phenomenon. alternatively a massive binarysystem composed of an lbv which erupted in 2004, and a wolf-rayet starexploding as sn2006jc, could explain the observations.

0810.0635	sn 2006gy: was it really extra-ordinary?	we present an optical photometric and spectroscopic study of the veryluminous type iin sn 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. inphotometry, a broad, bright (m_r~-21.7) peak characterizes all bvri lightcurves. afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slowluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. at late phases (&gt;237 days),because of the large luminosity drop (&gt;3 mag), only upper visibility limits areobtained in the b, r and i bands. in the near-infrared, two k-band detectionson days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or ir echoesscenarios. at all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broadp-cygni profiles and a multicomponent halpha profile, which are the typicalsignatures of type iin sne. after maximum, spectroscopic and photometricsimilarities are found between sn 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated sne(e.g. sn 1997cy, sn 1999e and sn 2002ic). this suggests that ejecta-csminteraction plays a key role in sn 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,sustaining the late-time-light curve. alternatively, the late luminosity may berelated to the radioactive decay of ~3m_sun of 56ni. models of the light curvein the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (r~6-810^(12)cm, m_ej~5-14m_sun), and that the sn ejecta collided with massive(6-10m_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. these clumps do notcompletely obscure the sn photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity isdue both to the decay of 56ni and to interaction with csm. a supermassive staris not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarilylarge explosion energy.
