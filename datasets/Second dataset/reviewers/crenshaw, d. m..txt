0902.2310	mass outflow in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548	we present a study of the intrinsic uv absorption and emission lines in anhistorically low-state spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548, which weobtained in 2004 february at high spatial and spectral resolution with thespace telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) on the hubble space telescope. weisolate a component of emission with a width of 680 km/s (fwhm) that arisesfrom an "intermediate line region" (ilr), similar to the one we discovered inngc 4151, at a distance of ~1 pc from the central continuum source. from adetailed analysis of the five intrinsic absorption components in ngc 5548 andtheir behavior over a span of 8 years, we present evidence that most of the uvabsorbers only partially cover the ilr and do not cover an extended region ofuv continuum emission, most likely from hot stars in the circumnuclear region.we also find that four of the uv absorbers are at much greater distances (&gt;70pc) than the ilr, and none have sufficient n v or c iv column densities to bethe ilr in absorption. at least a portion of the uv absorption component 3, ata radial velocity of -530 km/s, is likely responsible for most of the x-rayabsorption, at a distance &lt; 7 pc from the central source. the fact that we seethe ilr in absorption in ngc 4151 and not in ngc 5548 suggests that the ilr islocated at a relatively large polar angle (~45 degrees) with respect to thenarrow-line region outflow axis.

0903.4411	physical conditions in the inner narrow line region of the seyfert 2  galaxy markarian 573	we have examined the physical conditions within a bright emission-line knotin the inner narrow-line region (nlr) of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 573 usingoptical spectra and photoionization models. the spectra were obtained with thehubble space telescope/space telescope imaging spectrograph with the g430l andg750m gratings. comparing the spatial emission-line profiles, we found [fe x]6734 barely resolved, [o iii] 5007 centrally peaked, but broader than [fe x],and [o ii] 3727 the most extended. the spectra reveal that [fe x] is broader invelocity width and blue-shifted compared with lines from less ionized species.our estimate of the bolometric luminosity indicates that the active galacticnucleus (agn) is radiating at or above its eddington luminosity, which isconsistent with its identification as a hidden narrow-line seyfert 1. we wereable to successfully match the observed emission line ratios with athree-component photoionization model. two components, one to account for the[o iii] emission and another in which the [fe x] arises, are directly ionizedby the agn, while [o ii] forms in a third component, which is ionized by aheavily absorbed continuum. based on our assumed ionizing continuum and themodel parameters, we determined that the two directly-ionized components are ~55 pc from the agn. we have found similar radial distances for the centralknots in the seyfert 2 galaxies mrk 3 and ngc 1068, but much smaller radialdistances for the inner nlr in the seyfert 1 galaxies ngc 4151 and ngc 5548.although in general agreement with the unified model, these results suggestthat the obscuring material in seyfert galaxies extends out to at least tens ofparsecs from the agn.

0706.4317	on the effects of dissipative turbulence on the narrow emission-line  ratios in seyfert galaxies	we present a photoionization model study of the effects of micro-turbulenceand dissipative heating on emission lines for number and column densities,elemental abundances, and ionizations typical for the narrow emission lineregions (nlrs) of seyfert galaxies. earlier studies of nlr spectra generallyfound good agreement between the observations and the model predictions formost strong emission lines, such as [o iii] $\lambda$5007, [o ii]$\lambda$3727, [n ii] $\lambda$6583, [ne iii] $\lambda$3869, and the h and herecombination lines. nevertheless, the strengths of lines from species withionization potentials greater than that of he$^{+}$(54.4 ev), e.g. n$^{+4}$ andne$^{+4}$, were often under-predicted. among the explanations suggested forthese discrepancies were (selectively) enhanced elemental abundances andcontributions from shock heated gas. interestingly, the nlr lines have widthsof several 100 km s$^{-1}$, well in excess of the thermal broadening. if thisis due to micro-turbulence, and the turbulence dissipates within theemission-line gas, the gas can be heated in excess of that due tophotoionization. we show that the combined effects of turbulence anddissipative heating can strongly enhance n v $\lambda$1240 (relative to he ii$\lambda$1640), while the heating alone can boost the strength of [ne v]$\lambda$3426. we suggest that this effect is present in the nlr, particularlywithin $\sim$ 100 pc of the central engine. finally, since micro-turbulencewould make clouds robust against instabilities generated during acceleration,it is not likely to be a coincidence that the radially outflowing emission-linegas is turbulent.

0910.1614	the mid-infrared continua of seyfert galaxies	an analysis of archival mid-infrared (mid-ir) spectra of seyfert galaxiesfrom the spitzer space telescope observations is presented. we characterize thenature of the mid-ir active nuclear continuum by subtracting a templatestarburst spectrum from the seyfert spectra. the long wavelength part of thespectrum contains a strong contribution from the starburst-heated cool dust;this is used to effectively separate starburst-dominated seyferts from thosedominated by the active nuclear continuum. within the latter category, thestrength of the active nuclear continuum drops rapidly beyond ~ 20 micron. onaverage, type 2 seyferts have weaker short-wavelength active nuclear continuaas compared to type 1 seyferts. type 2 seyferts can be divided into two types,those with strong poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) bands and thosewithout. the latter type show polarized broad emission lines in their opticalspectra. the pah-dominated type 2 seyferts and seyfert 1.8/1.9s show verysimilar mid-ir spectra. however, after the subtraction of the starburstcomponent, there is a striking similarity in the active nuclear continuum ofall seyfert optical types. pah-dominated seyfert 2s and seyfert 1.8/1.9s tendto show weak active nuclear continua in general. a few type 2 seyferts withweak/absent pah bands show a bump in the spectrum between 15 and 20 micron. wesuggest that this bump is the peak of a warm (~200 k) blackbody dust emission,which becomes clearly visible when the short-wavelength continuum is weaker.this warm blackbody emission is also observed in other seyfert opticalsubtypes, suggesting a common origin in these active galactic nuclei.

0911.0675	radial velocity offsets due to mass outflows and extinction in active  galactic nuclei	we present a study of the radial velocity offsets between narrow emissionlines and host galaxy lines (stellar absorption and h i 21-cm emission) inseyfert galaxies with observed redshifts less than 0.043. we find that 35% ofthe seyferts in the sample show [o iii] emission lines with blueshifts withrespect to their host galaxies exceeding 50 km/s, whereas only 6% showredshifts this large, in qualitative agreement with most previous studies. wealso find that a greater percentage of seyfert 1 galaxies show blueshifts thanseyfert 2 galaxies. using hst/stis spatially-resolved spectra of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151, we generate geometric modelsof their narrow-line regions (nlrs) and inner galactic disks, and show howthese models can explain the blueshifted [o iii] emission lines in collapsedstis spectra of these two seyferts. we conclude that the combination of massoutflow of ionized gas in the nlr and extinction by dust in the inner disk(primarily in the form of dust spirals) is primarily responsible for thevelocity offsets in seyfert galaxies. more exotic explanations are not needed.we discuss the implications of this result for the velocity offsets found inhigher redshift agn.

0912.0456	spectral variability and reverberation time delays in the suzaku x-ray  spectrum of ngc 4051	long-exposure suzaku x-ray observations of the active galaxy ngc 4051 from2005 and 2008 are analysed, in an attempt to reach a self-consistentunderstanding of the spectral variability on long timescales and at high timeresolution. principal components analysis and a maximum likelihood method ofpower spectrum analysis are used. in common with other type i agn, the spectralvariability is dominated by a varying-normalisation power-law componenttogether with a quasi-steady, hard-spectrum offset component that contains fe katomic features. ngc 4051 displays a strong excess over a power-law at energiesabove 20 kev, some fraction of which also appears to vary with the power-lawcontinuum. the fast-timescale power spectrum has a shape consistent withprevious determinations, but significant differences are found between the lowand high flux states of the source, demonstrating that the power spectrum isnon-stationary. frequency-dependent time lags between the hard and soft bandsof up to 970+/-225s are measured. the existence of the observed lags excludesthe possibility that the hard spectral component originates as reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we instead show that the frequency- andenergy-dependent time lags may be explained as reverberation, caused byreflection from a thick shell of material with maximum lags of about 10,000s.if the reflecting material surrounds the agn, it extends to a distance about1.5x10^14 cm, 600 gravitational radii, from the illuminating source and theglobal covering factor is c(g) &gt;~ 0.4, confirming suggestions that type i agnhave high covering factors of absorbing and reflecting material. given thespectral and timing similarities with other type i agn, we infer that thisstructure is common in the type i population.

1002.0082	significant x-ray line emission in the 5-6 kev band of ngc 4051	a suzaku x-ray observation of ngc 4051 taken during 2005 nov reveals lineemission at 5.44 kev in the rest-frame of the galaxy which does not have anobvious origin in known rest-frame atomic transitions. the improvement to thefit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes its reality at &gt;99.9%confidence: we have also verified that the line is detected in the three xisunits independently. comparison between the data and monte carlo simulationsshows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p &lt;3.3 x 10^-4. consideration of three independent line detections in suzaku datataken at different epochs yields a probability p&lt; 3 x 10^-11 and thusconclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in thedata. the new line and a strong component of fe ka emission from neutralmaterial are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. spectra from2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energyas that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constantequivalent width against the observed continuum. the stability of the line fluxand energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has beensuggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a speciallocation in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk.alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of fe into cr, asdiscussed in a companion paper.

1006.1875	modeling the outflow in the narrow-line region of markarian  573:biconical illumination of a gaseous disk	we present a study of the outflowing ionized gas in the resolved narrow-lineregion (nlr) of the seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 573, and its interaction with an in-ner dust/gas disk, based on hubble space telescope (hst) wfpc2 and stisobservations. from the spectroscopic and imaging information, we determined thefundamental geometry of the outflow and inner disk, via two modeling pro- gramsused to recreate the morphology of these regions imaged with hst. we alsodetermined that the bicone of ionizing radiation from the active galacticnucleus (agn) intersects with the inner disk, illuminating a section of thedisk including inner segments of spiral arms, fully seen through structuremapping, which appear to be outflowing and expanding. in addition, we see highvelocities at projected distances of \geq 2'' (- 700 pc) from the nucleus,which could be due to rotation or to in situ acceleration of gas off the spiralarms. we find that the true half opening angle of the ionizing bicone (53degrees) is much larger than the apparent half-opening angle (34 degrees) dueto the above geometry, which may apply to a number of other seyferts as well.

1010.2750	a multi-wavelength study of the nature of type 1.8/1.9 seyfert galaxies	we focus on determining the underlying physical cause of a seyfert galaxy'sappearance as type a 1.8 or 1.9. are these "intermediate" seyfert types typicalseyfert 1 nuclei with reddened broad-line regions? or are they objects withintrinsically weak continua and broad emission lines? we compare measurementsof the optical reddening of the narrow and broad-line regions with each otherand with the x-ray column derived from xmm-newton 0.5-10 kev spectra todetermine the presence and location of dust in the line of sight. we alsosearched the literature to see if the objects showed evidence for broad-linevariability, and determined if the changes were consistent with a change inreddening or a change in the intrinsic ionizing continuum flux. we find that 10of 19 objects previously classified as seyfert 1.8/1.9s received thisdesignation due to their low continuum flux. in four objects the classificationwas due to blr reddening, either by the torus or dust structures in thevicinity of the nlr; in the remaining five objects there is not sufficientevidence to favor one scenario over the other. these findings imply that, ingeneral, samples of 1.8/1.9s are not suitable for use in studies of the gas anddust in the central torus.

1011.5993	multi-wavelength probes of obscuration towards the narrow line region in  seyfert galaxies	we present a study of reddening and absorption towards the narrow lineregions (nlr) in active galactic nuclei (agn) selected from the revisedshapley-ames, 12mu, and swift/burst alert telescope samples. for the sources inhost galaxies with inclinations of b/a &gt; 0.5, we find that mean ratio of [oiii] 5007a, from ground-based observations, and [o iv] 28.59mu, fromspitzer/infrared spectrograph observations, is a factor of 2 lower in seyfert2s than seyfert 1s. the combination of low [o iii]/[o iv] and [o iii] 4363/5007ratios in seyfert 2s suggests more extinction of emission from the nlr than inseyfert 1s. similar column densities of dusty gas, nh ~ several x 10^21 cm^-2,can account for the suppression of both [o iii] 5007a and [o iii] 4363a, ascompared to those observed in seyfert 1s. also, we find that the x-ray lineovii 22.1a is weaker in seyfert 2s, consistent with absorption by the same gasthat reddens the optical emission. using a hubble space telescope/spacetelescope imaging spectrograph slitless spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151, we estimate that only ~ 30% of the [o iii] 5007a comes from within 30 pcof the central source, which is insufficient to account for the low [oiii]/[oiv] ratios in seyfert 2s. if seyfert 2 galaxies have similar intrinsic[oiii] spatial profiles, the external dusty gas must extend further out alongthe nlr, perhaps in the form of nuclear dust spirals that have been associatedwith fueling flows towards the agn.

1102.1894	contemporaneous chandra hetg and suzaku x-ray observations of ngc 4051	we present the results of a deep 300 ks chandra hetg observation of thehighly variable narrow-line seyfert type 1 galaxy ngc 4051. the hetg spectrumreveals 28 significant soft x-ray ionised lines in either emission orabsorption; primarily originating from h-like and he-like k-shell transitionsof o, ne, mg and si (including higher order lines and strong forbidden emissionlines from o vii and ne ix) plus high ionisation l-shell transitions from fexvii to fe xxii and lower ionisation inner-shell lines (e.g. o vi). modellingthe data with xstar requires four distinct ionisation zones for the gas, alloutflowing with velocities &lt; 1000 km/s. a selection of the strongestemission/absorption lines appear to be resolved with fwhm of ~600 km/s. we alsopresent the results from a quasi-simultaneous 350 ks suzaku observation of ngc4051 where the xis spectrum reveals strong evidence for blueshifted absorptionlines at ~6.8 and ~7.1 kev, consistent with previous findings. modelling withxstar suggests that this is the signature of a highly ionised, high velocityoutflow (log \xi ~ 4.1; v ~ -0.02c) which potentially may have a significanteffect on the host galaxy environment via feedback. finally, we alsosimultaneously model the broad-band 2008 xis+hxd suzaku data with archivalsuzaku data from 2005 when the source was observed to have entered an extendedperiod of low flux in an attempt to analyse the cause of the long-term spectralvariability. we find that we can account for this by allowing for largevariations in the normalisation of the intrinsic power-law component which maybe interpreted as being due to significant changes in the covering fraction ofa compton-thick partial-coverer obscuring the central continuum emission.

0709.3076	spitzer/irs observations of seyfert 1.8s and 1.9s: a comparison with  seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s	we present spitzer space telescope mid-infrared spectra of 12 seyfert 1.8 and1.9 galaxies over the 5-38 um region. we compare the spectral characteristicsof this sample to those of 58 seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies from the spitzerarchives. an analysis of the spectral shapes, the silicate 10 um feature andthe emission line fluxes have enabled us to characterize the mid-ir propertiesof seyfert 1.8/1.9s. we find that the equivalent widths of the 10 um silicatefeature are generally weak in all seyfert galaxies, as previously reported byseveral studies. the few seyfert galaxies in this sample that show deep 10 umsilicate absorption features are highly inclined and/or merging galaxies. it islikely that these absorption features originate primarily in the dustyinterstellar medium of the host galaxy rather than in a dusty torus on parsecscales close to the central engine. we find that the equivalent width of thepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) band at 6.2 um correlates strongly withthe 20-30 um spectral index. either of these quantities are good indicators ofthe amount of starburst contribution to the mid-ir spectra. the spectra ofseyfert 1.8 and 1.9s are dominated by these starburst features, similar to mostseyfert 2s. they show strong pah bands and a strong red continuum toward 30 um.the strengths of the high-ionization forbidden narrow emission lines [o iv]25.89 um, [ne iii] 15.56 um and [ne v] 14.32 um relative to [ne ii] 12.81 umare weaker in seyfert 1.8/1.9s and seyfert 2s as compared to seyfert 1s. theweakness of high-ionization lines in seyfert 1.8-1.9s is suggestive ofintrinsically weak active galactic nuclei (agn) continua, and/or stronger starformation activity leading to enhanced [ne ii]. we discuss the implications ofthese observational results in the context of the unified model of agn.

1204.6694	feedback from mass outflows in nearby active galactic nuclei i. uv and  x-ray absorbers	we present an investigation into the impact of feedback from outflowing uvand x-ray absorbers in nearby z &lt; 0.04 agn. from studies of the kinematics,physical conditions, and variability of the absorbers in the literature, wecalculate the possible ranges in total mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosityfor each agn, summed over all of its absorbers. these calculations make use ofvalues (or limits) for the radial locations of the absorbers determined fromvariability, excited-state absorption, and other considerations. from a sampleof 10 seyfert 1 galaxies with detailed photoionization models for theirabsorbers, we find that 7 have sufficient constraints on the absorber locationsto determine feedback parameters. for the low-luminosity agn ngc 4395, thesevalues are low, although we do not have sufficient constraints on the x-rayabsorbers to make definitive conclusions. at least 5 of the 6 seyfert 1s withmoderate bolometric luminosities have mass outflow rates that are 10 - 1000times the mass accretion rates needed to generate their observed luminosities,indicating that most of the mass outflow originates from outside the inneraccretion disk. three of these (ngc 4051, ngc 3516, and ngc 3783) have kineticluminosities in the range 0.5 to 5% bolometric, which is the range typicallyrequired by feedback models for efficient self-regulation of black-hole andgalactic bulge growth. at least 2 of the other 3 (ngc 5548, ngc 4151, and ngc7469) have kinetic luminosities &gt; 0.1% bolometric, although these values mayincrease if radial locations can be determined for more of the absorbers. weconclude that the outflowing uv and x-ray absorbers in moderate-luminosity agnhave the potential to deliver significant feedback to their environments.

1308.4129	determining inclinations of active galactic nuclei via their narrow-line  region kinematics - i. observational results	active galactic nuclei (agn) are axisymmetric systems to first order; theirobserved properties are likely strong functions of inclination with respect toour line of sight. however, except for a few special cases, the specificinclinations of individual agn are unknown. we have developed a promisingtechnique for determining the inclinations of nearby agn by mapping thekinematics of their narrow-line regions (nlrs), which are often easily resolvedwith hubble space telescope (hst) [o iii] imaging and long-slit spectra fromthe space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis). our studies indicate that nlrkinematics dominated by radial outflow can be fit with simple biconical outflowmodels that can be used to determine the inclination of the bicone axis, andhence the obscuring torus, with respect to our line of sight. we present nlranalysis of 53 seyfert galaxies and resultant inclinations from models of 17individual agn with clear signatures of biconical outflow. our model resultsagree with the unified model in that seyfert 1 agn have nlrs inclined furthertoward our line of sight (los) than seyfert 2 agn. knowing the inclinations ofthese agn nlrs, and thus their accretion disk and/or torus axes, will allow usto determine how their observed properties vary as a function of polar angle.we find no correlation between the inclinations of the agn nlrs and the disksof their host galaxies, indicating that the orientation of the gas in the torusis independent from that of the host disk.

0801.4286	stellar wind variations during the x-ray high and low states of cygnus  x-1	we present results from hubble space telescope uv spectroscopy of the massivex-ray binary system, hd226868 = cyg x-1. the spectra were obtained at bothorbital conjunction phases in two separate runs in 2002 and 2003 when thesystem was in the x-ray high/soft state. the stellar wind lines suffer largereductions in strength when the black hole is in the foreground due to thex-ray ionization of the wind ions. a comparison of hst and archival iue spectrashows that similar photoionization effects occur in both the x-ray states. weconstructed model uv wind line profiles assuming that x-ray ionization occurseverywhere in the wind except the zone where the supergiant blocks the x-rayflux. the good match between the observed and model profiles indicates that thewind ionization extends to near to the hemisphere of the supergiant facing thex-ray source. the h-alpha emission strength is generally lower in the high/softstate compared to the low/hard state, but the he ii 4686 emission is relativelyconstant between states. the results suggest that mass transfer in cyg x-1 isdominated by a focused wind flow that peaks along the axis joining the starsand that the stellar wind contribution is shut down by x-ray photoionizationeffects. the strong stellar wind from the shadowed side of the supergiant willstall when coriolis deflection brings the gas into the region of x-rayillumination. this stalled gas component may be overtaken by the orbital motionof the black hole and act to inhibit accretion from the focused wind. thevariations in the strength of the shadow wind component may then lead toaccretion rate changes that ultimately determine the x-ray state.

1402.3509	determining inclinations of active galactic nuclei via their narrow-line  region kinematics - ii. correlation with observed properties	active galactic nuclei (agn) are axisymmetric systems to first order; theirobserved properties are likely strong functions of inclination with respect toour line of sight, yet the specific inclinations of all but a few agn aregenerally unknown. by determining the inclinations and geometries of nearbyseyfert galaxies using the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (nlrs), andcomparing them with observed properties, we find strong correlations betweeninclination and total hydrogen column density, infrared color, and h-betafull-width at half maximum (fwhm). these correlations provide evidence that theorientation of agn with respect to our line of sight affects how we perceivethem, beyond the seyfert type dichotomy. they can also be used to constrain 3dmodels of agn components such as the broad-line region and torus. additionally,we find weak correlations between agn luminosity and several modeled nlrparameters, which suggests that the nlr geometry and kinematics are dependentto some degree on the agn's radiation field.

1410.4569	long-term x-ray stability and uv variability of the ionized absorption  in ngc 3783	we present the results of recent chandra high-energy transmission gratingspectrometer and hubble space telescope cosmic origins spectrographobservations of the nearby seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 which shows a strong,non-varying x-ray warm absorber and physically related and kinematicallyvarying uv absorption. we compare our new observations to high-resolution, highsignal-to-noise archival data from 2001, allowing a unique investigation intothe long-term variations of the absorption over a 12 yr period. we find nostatistically significant changes in the physical properties of the x-rayabsorber, but there is a significant drop of ~40% in the uv and x-ray flux, anda significant flattening of the underlying x-ray power-law slope. largekinematic changes are seen in the uv absorbers, possibly due to radialdeceleration of the material. similar behavior is not observed in the x-raydata, likely due to its lower velocity resolution, which shows an outflowvelocity of v ~ -655 km/s in both epochs. the narrow iron k-alpha emission lineat 6.4 kev shows no variation between epochs, and its measured width places thematerial producing the line at a radial distance of ~0.03 pc from the centralblack hole.

0804.1147	new indicators for agn power: the correlation between [o iv] lambda  25.89 micron and hard x-ray luminosity for nearby seyfert galaxies	we have studied the relationship between the [o iv] lambda 25.89 micronemission line luminosities, obtained from spitzer spectra, the x-ray continuain the 2-10 kev band, primarily from asca, and the 14-195 kev band obtainedwith the swift/burst alert telescope (bat), for a sample of nearby (z &lt; 0.08)seyfert galaxies. for comparison, we have examined the relationship between the[o iii] 5007, the 2-10 kev and the 14-195 kev luminosities for the same set ofobjects. we find that both the [o iv] and [o iii] luminosities arewell-correlated with the bat luminosities. on the other hand, the [o iii]luminosities are better-correlated with 2-10 kev luminosities than are those of[o iv]. when comparing [o iv] and [o iii] luminosities for the different typesof galaxies, we find that the seyfert 2's have significantly lower [o iii] to[o iv] ratios than the seyfert 1's. we suggest that this is due to morereddening of the narrow line region (nlr) of the seyfert 2's. assuming galacticdust to gas ratios, the average amount of extra reddening corresponds to ahydrogen column density of ~ few times 10^21 cm^-2, which is a small fractionof the x-ray absorbing columns in the seyfert 2's. the combined effects ofreddening and the x-ray absorption are the probable reason why the [o iii]versus 2-10 kev correlation is better than the [o iv] versus 2-10 kev, sincethe [o iv] emission line is much less affected by extinction. overall, we findthe [o iv] to be an accurate and truly isotropic indicator of the power of theagn. this suggests that it can be useful in deconvolving the contribution ofthe agn and starburst to the spectrum of compton-thick and/or x-ray weaksources.

1411.4507	feedback from mass outflows in nearby active galactic nuclei. ii.  outflows in the narrow-line region of ngc 4151	we present a detailed study of agn feedback in the narrow-line region (nlr)of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151. we illustrate the data and techniques neededto determine the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of the outflowingionized gas as a function of position in the nlr. we find that the mass outflowrate peaks at a value of 3 solar masses per year at a distance of 70 pc fromthe central supermassive black hole (smbh), which is about 10 times the outflowrate coming from inside 13 pc, and 230 times the mass accretion rate inferredfrom the bolometric luminosity of ngc 4151. thus, most of the outflow mustarise from "in situ" acceleration of ambient gas throughout the nlr. thekinetic luminosity peaks at 90 pc and drops rapidly thereafter, indicating thatmost of the kinetic energy is deposited within about 100 pc from the smbh. bothvalues exceed the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity determined for theuv/x-ray absorber outflows in ngc 4151, indicating the importance of nlroutflows in providing feedback on scales where circumnuclear star formation andbulge growth occur.

0804.1381	long-term variability in the optical spectrum of the seyfert galaxy ngc  2992	new spectra of ngc 2992 from the cerro tololo inter-american observatory showthat this nearby agn has changed its type classification to a seyfert 2 in2006. it was originally classified as a seyfert 1.9, and has been previouslyseen as a seyfert 1.5 with strong broad halpha emission. a comparison of thereddening and equivalent hydrogen column density derived for the narrow-lineregion from these new data with those previously calculated for differentregions closer to the nucleus shows them to be very similar, and suggests thatthese different regions are all being absorbed by the same opacity source, alarge 100-pc scale dust lane running across the nucleus. however, obscurationby dust in this lane is probably not responsible for classification changeswhich occur in only a few years. it is more likely that ngc 2992's observedvariations are due to a highly variable ionizing continuum. we thereforeconclude that, although ngc 2992 was originally identified as a seyfert 1.9,this was not because of an oblique viewing angle through the atmosphere of acentral dusty torus, but because its active nucleus was identified when it wasin a low continuum state.

1412.1444	a minor merger caught in the act of fueling the agn in mrk 509	in recent observations by the hubble space telescope (hst) as part of acampaign to discover locations and kinematics of agn outflows, we found thatmrk 509 contains a 3$''$ ($\sim$2100 {\it pc}) linear filament in its centralregion. visible in both optical continuum and [oiii] imaging, this featureresembles a `check mark' of several knots of emission that travel northwest tosoutheast before jutting towards the nucleus from the southwest. spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis/hst) observations along the inner portionof the filament reveal redshifted velocities, indicating that the filament isinflowing. we present further observations of the nucleus in mrk 509 using thegemini near-infrared integral field spectrograph (nifs), from which we concludethat this structure cannot be related to previously studied, typical nlroutflows and instead embodies the remains of an ongoing minor merger with agas-rich dwarf galaxy, therefore providing a great opportunity to study thefueling of an agn by a minor merger in progress.

1501.05951	space telescope and optical reverberation mapping project. ii. swift and  hst reverberation mapping of the accretion disk of ngc 5548	recent intensive swift monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 yielded282 usable epochs over 125 days across six uv/optical bands and the x-rays.this is the densest extended agn uv/optical continuum sampling ever obtained,with a mean sampling rate &lt;0.5 day. approximately daily hst uv sampling wasalso obtained. the uv/optical light curves show strong correlations (r_max =0.57 - 0.90) and the clearest measurement to date of interband lags. these lagsare well-fit by a \tau propto \lambda^4/3 wavelength dependence, with anormalization that indicates an unexpectedly large disk radius of 0.35 +/- 0.05lt-day at 1367 a, assuming a simple face-on model. the u-band shows amarginally larger lag than expected from the fit and surrounding bands, whichcould be due to balmer continuum emission from the broad-line region assuggested by korista and goad. the uv/x-ray correlation is weaker (r_max &lt;0.45) and less consistent over time. this indicates that while swift isbeginning to measure uv/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disktheory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationshipwith x-ray variability is less well understood. combining this accretion disksize estimate with those from quasar microlensing studies suggests that agndisk sizes scale approximately linearly with central black hole mass over awide range of masses.

astro-ph;0001346	hst observations and photoionization modeling of the liner galaxy ngc  1052	we present a study of available hubble space telescope (hst) spectroscopicand imaging observations of the low ionization nuclear emission line region(liner) galaxy ngc 1052. the wfpc2 imagery clearly differentiates extendednebular halpha emission from that of the compact core. faint objectspectrograph (fos) observations provide a full set of optical and uv data(1200-6800 angstroms).  these spectral data sample the innermost region (0."86 x 0."86 ~ 82pc x 82pc)and exclude the extended halpha emission seen in the wfpc2 image. the derivedemission line fluxes allow a detailed analysis of the physical conditionswithin the nucleus. the measured flux ratio for halpha/hbeta,f{halpha}/f{hbeta}=4.53, indicates substantial intrinsic reddening,e(b-v)=0.42, for the nuclear nebular emission. this is the first finding of alarge extinction of the nuclear emission line fluxes in ngc 1052. if thecentral ionizing continuum is assumed to be attenuated by a comparable amount,then the emission line fluxes can be reproduced well by a simplephotoionization model using a central power law continuum source with aspectral index of alpha = -1.2 as deduced from the observed flux distribution.a multi-density, dusty gas gives the best fit to the observed emission linespectrum. our calculations show that the small contribution from a highlyionized gas observed in ngc 1052 can also be reproduced solely byphotoionization modeling. the high gas covering factor determined from ourmodel is consistent with the assumption that our line of sight to the centralengine is obscured.

astro-ph;0002206	on the reddening in x-ray absorbed seyfert 1 galaxies	there are several seyfert galaxies for which there is a discrepancy betweenthe small column of neutral hydrogen deduced from x-ray observations and themuch greater column derived from the reddening of the optical/uv emission linesand continuum. the standard paradigm has the dust within the highly ionized gaswhich produces o~vii and o~viii absorption edges (i.e., a ``dusty warmabsorber''). we present an alternative model in which the dust exists in acomponent of gas in which hydrogen has been stripped, but which is at too lowan ionization state to possess significant columns of o~vii and o~viii (i.e, a``lukewarm absorber''). the lukewarm absorber is at sufficient radial distanceto encompass much of the narrow emission-line region, and thus accounts for thenarrow-line reddening, unlike the dusty warm absorber. we test the model byusing a combination of photoionization models and absorption edge fits toanalyze the combined rosat/asca dataset for the seyfert 1.5 galaxy, ngc 3227.we show that the data are well fit by a combination of the lukewarm absorberand a more highly ionized component similar to that suggested in earlierstudies. we predict that the lukewarm absorber will produce strong uvabsorption lines of n v, c iv, si iv and mg ii. finally, these resultsillustrate that singly ionized helium is an important, and often overlooked,source of opacity in the soft x-ray band (100 - 500 ev).

astro-ph;0002438	resolved spectroscopy of the narrow-line region in ngc 1068: kinematics  of the ionized gas	we have determined the radial velocities of the [o iii] emitting gas in theinner narrow-line region (nlr) of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068, along a slitat position angle of 202 degrees, from stis observations at a spatialresolution of 0.1 arcsec and a spectral resolving power of approximately 1000.we use these data to investigate the kinematics of the nlr within 6 arcsec (430pc) of the nucleus. the emission-line knots show evidence for radialacceleration, to a projected angular distance of 1.7 arcsec in most cases,followed by deceleration that approaches the systemic velocity at a projecteddistance of about 4 arcsec. we find that a simple kinematic model of biconicalradial outflow can match the general trend of observed radial velocities. inthis model, the emitting material is evacuated along the bicone axis, and theaxis is inclined 5 degrees out of the plane of the sky. the acceleration of theemission-line clouds provides support for dynamical models that invokeradiation and/or wind pressure. we suggest that the deceleration of the cloudsis due to their collision with a patchy and anistropically distributed ambientmedium.

astro-ph;0009356	stis echelle observations of ngc 4151: variable ionization of the  intrinsic uv absorbers	we present echelle observations of the intrinsic uv absorption lines in theseyfert galaxy ngc 4151, which were obtained with the space telescope imagingspectrograph (stis) on the hubble space telescope on 1999 july 19. the uvcontinuum flux at 1450 angstroms decreased by factor of about four over theprevious two years and there was a corresponding dramatic increase in thecolumn densities of the low-ionization absorption lines (e.g., si ii, fe ii,and al ii), presumably as a result of a decrease in the ionizing continuum. inaddition to the absorption lines seen in previous low states, we identify alarge number of fe ii absorption lines that arise from metastable levels ashigh as 4.1 ev above the ground state, indicating high densities (&gt; 10^6cm^-3). we find that the transient absorption feature in the blue wing of thebroad c iv emission, seen in a goddard high resolution spectrograph spectrumand thought to be a high-velocity c~iv component, is actually a si iifine-structure absorption line at a radial velocity of -560 km/s (relative tosystemic). we also demonstrate that the ``satellite'' emission lines of c~ivfound in international ultraviolet explorer spectra are actually regions ofunabsorbed continuum plus broad emission that become prominent when the uvcontinuum of ngc 4151 is in a low state.

astro-ph;0012129	chandra grating spectroscopy of the seyfert galaxy ton s180	this paper presents results from spectral observations of ton s180 usingchandra and asca. the data confirm the presence of the soft excess but thechandra letg spectrum reveals it to be broad and smooth, rather than resolvedinto individual emission lines. this excess may represent either a primary orreprocessed continuum component or a blend of broad lines from an ionizedaccretion disk. the occurrence of a similar feature in five other nlsy1s leadsus to conclude that this soft x-ray component may be a characteristic ofsources accreting at a very high rate. the x-ray spectrum shows no evidence forabsorption lines, indicating that if gas exists in the line-of-sight then it isin a very high ionization-state or has an extremely broad velocitydistribution. the new asca data confirm that the narrow component of the fekalpha line peaks close to a rest-energy of 7 kev, indicating the presence of asignificant amount of highly-ionized material in the nuclear environs.

astro-ph;0101037	stis echelle observations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151: physical  conditions in the ultraviolet absorbers	we have examined the physical conditions in intrinsic uv-absorbing gas in theseyfert galaxy ngc 4151, using echelle spectra obtained with the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis). we confirm the presence of the kinematiccomponents detected in earlier ghrs observations as well as a new broadabsorption feature at a radial velocity of -1680 km/s. the uv continuum of ngc4151 decreased by a factor of 4 over the previous two years, and we argue thechanges in the column density of the low ionization absorption lines associatedwith the broad component at -490 km/s reflect the decrease in the ionizingflux. most of the strong absorption lines (e.g., n v, c iv, si iv) from thiscomponent are saturated, but show substantial residual flux in their cores,indicating that the absorber does not fully cover the source of emission. ourinterpretation is that the unocculted light is due to scattering by freeelectrons from an extended region, which reflects continuum, emission lines,and absorption lines. we have been able to constrain the densities for thekinematic components based on absorption lines from metastable states of c iiiand fe ii, and/or the ratios of ground and fine structure lines of o i,c ii,and si ii. we have generated a set of photoionization models which match theionic column densities for each component during the present low flux state andthose seen in previous high flux states with the ghrs and stis, confirming thatthe absorbers are photoionized and respond to the changes in the continuumflux. we have been able to map the relative radial positions of the absorbers,and find that the gas decreases in density with distance. none of the uvabsorbers is of sufficiently large column density or high enough ionizationstate to account for the x-ray absorption.

astro-ph;0111523	the detection of circumnuclear x-ray emission from the seyfert galaxy  ngc 3516	we present the first high-resolution, x-ray image of the circumnuclearregions of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516, using the chandra x-ray observatory(cxo). all three of the cxo observations reported were performed with one ofthe two grating assemblies in place, and here we restrict our analysis toundispersed photons (i.e. those detected in the zeroth-order). apreviously-unknown x-ray source is detected approx 6 arcsec (1.1 h_{75}^{-1}kpc) nne of the nucleus (position angle approx 29 degrees) which we designatecxou 110648.1+723412. its spectrum can be characterized as a power law with aphoton index gamma ~ 1.8--2.6, or as thermal emission with a temperaturekt~0.7--3 kev. assuming a location within ngc 3516, isotropic emission impliesa luminosity l ~ 2--8e39 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} in the 0.4--2 kev band. if dueto a single point source, the object is super-eddington for a 1.4 m_sun neutronstar. however, multiple sources or a small, extended source cannot be excludedusing the current data. large-scale extended x-ray emission is also detectedout to ~10 arcsec (~1.7 h_{75}^{-1} kpc) from the nucleus to the ne and sw, andis approximately aligned with the morphologies of the radio emission andextended narrow emission line region (enlr). the mean luminosity of thisemission is 1--5e37 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} arcsec^{-2}, in the 0.4--2 kev band.unfortunately the current data cannot usefully constrain its spectrum. theseresults are consistent with earlier suggestions of circumnuclear x-ray emissionin ngc 3516. if the extended emission is due to scattering of the nuclear x-raycontinuum, then the pressure in the x-ray emitting gas is at least two ordersof magnitude too small to provide the confining medium for the enlr clouds.

astro-ph;0112027	the density and location of the x-ray absorbing gas in ngc 3516	a new chandra observation and archival observations by asca are used toinvestigate spectral variations in the sy1 galaxy ngc 3516 over a period of 7years. a large change in flux (factor ~50 at 1kev) is observed between an ascaobservation in '94 and the chandra observation in 2000, with the source closeto the all-time maximum and minimum x-ray flux states, respectively. we findthe variations in the observed flux and spectra at these epochs to beconsistent with a constant column density of line-of-sight material reacting tochanges in the ionizing continuum. the data from the two epochs are consistentwith a simple decrease (by a factor 8-10) in the luminosity of a constant0.5-50 kev slope source and a line-of-sight absorber with an equivalenthydrogen column density of 10^21.9 cm^-2. intermediate luminosities, sampledduring other asca observations, are all fitted by the same model with a verysmall change in spectral index (well below \delta\gamma=0.2). in addition,analysis of the long (360 ks) asca observation in 1998 shows clear "color"variations that are entirely consistent with this model and are interpreted asdue to changes in the opacity of the absorbing gas. the data allow us to put aconservative upper limit of 60 ks on the recombination time which translates toa lower limit of about 2.4 times 10^6 cm^-3 on the density of the recombininggas and an upper limit of about 6 times 10^17 h_{75}^-2 cm on its distance fromthe central source. these are the best limits obtained so far on the densityand location of the x-ray absorbing gas in a type-1 agn. they indicate that theabsorbing gas is different, in terms of its density and location, from theionized gas commonly observed in type-ii agn.

astro-ph;0309096	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783. iv. variability and  modeling of the 900 ks chandra spectrum	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the data obtained from ngc 3783during the period 2000-2001 using chandra. this analysis leads us to thefollowing results. 1) ngc 3783 fluctuated in luminosity by a factor ~1.5 duringindividual observations (~170 ks duration). these fluctuations were notassociated with significant spectral variations. 2) on a longer time scale(20-120 days), we found the source to exhibit two very different spectralshapes. the main difference between these can be well-described by theappearance and disappearance of a spectral component that dominates theunderlying continuum at the longest wavelengths. the spectral variations arenot related to the brightening or the fading of the continuum at shortwavelengths in any simple way. 3) the appearance of the soft continuumcomponent is consistent with being the only spectral variation, and there is noneed to invoke changes in the opacity of the absorbers. 4) photoionizationmodeling indicates that a combination of three ionized absorbers, each splitinto two kinematic components, can explain the strengths of almost all theabsorption lines and bound-free edges. all three components are thermallystable and seem to have the same gas pressure. 5) the only real discrepancybetween our model and the observations concerns the range of wavelengthsabsorbed by the iron m-shell uta feature. this most likely arises as the resultof our underestimation of the poorly-known dielectronic recombination ratesappropriate for these ions. 6) the lower limit on the distance of the absorbinggas in ngc 3783 is between 0.2 and 3.2 pc. the assumption of pressureequilibrium imposes an upper limit of about 25 pc on the distance of theleast-ionized component from the central source.

astro-ph;0506323	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783 v. variability and  modeling of the intrinsic ultraviolet absorption	we present results on the location, physical conditions, and geometry of theoutflow in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 from a study of the variable intrinsicuv absorption. based on 18 observations with hst/stis and 6 observations withfuse, we find: 1) the absorption from the lowest-ionization species in each ofthe three strong kinematic components varied inversely with the continuum flux,indicating the ionization structure responded to changes in the photoionizingflux over the weekly timescales sampled by our observations. 2) a multi-component model with an unocculted nlr and separate blr and continuumline-of-sight covering factors predicts saturation in several lines, consistentwith the lack of observed variability. 3) column densities for the individualmetastable levels are measured from the resolved c iii *1175 absorption complexobserved in one component. based on our computed metastable level populations,the electron density of this absorber is ~3x10^4 cm^-3. photoionizationmodeling results place it at ~25 pc from the central source. 4) usingtime-dependent calculations, we are able to reproduce the detailed variabilityobserved in this absorber, and derive upper limits on the distances for theother components of 25-50 pc. 5) the ionization parameters derived for thehigher ionization uv absorbers are consistent with the modeling results for thelowest-ionization x-ray component, but with smaller total column density. theyhave similar pressures as the three x-ray ionization components. these resultsare consistent with an inhomogeneous wind model for the outflow in ngc 3783. 6)based on the predicted emission-line luminosities, global covering factorconstraints, and distances derived for the uv absorbers, they may be identifiedwith emission- line gas observed in the inner nlr of agns.

astro-ph;9711061	broad neviii 774 emission from quasars	neviii 774 is an important tracer of the high-ionization gas in qsos. weexamine the neviii emission-line properties using new hst-fos spectra of foursources, mean spectra derived from two qso samples in the hst archives, and newphotoionization calculations. the results support our previous claim that broadneviiilines are common in qsos, with an average flux of ~42% of ovi 1034 andvelocity widths that are ~2 to 5 times larger than ovi, civ 1549 and otherbroad lines in the same spectra. the strongest and most reliably measuredneviii 774 lines (in two sources) have fwhm ~ 14,500 km/s. line profile fits inthese cases show that the unusually large widths might be caused by blendingwith emission from niv 765 and oiv~\lam 789. however, standard photoionizationcalculations indicate that niv, oiv and all other lines near this wavelengthshould be too weak, leaving (very broad) neviii as the only viableidentification for the ~774 a feature. (this conclusion might be avoided ifthere are large radial velocity dispersions [&gt;~1000 km/s] in the emittingregion and the resonant absorption of continuum photons enhances the flux inweaker lines.) the calculations also indicate that the neviii emitting regionshave ionization parameters in the range 5 &gt; u &gt; 30, total hydrogen columndensities of 10^22 &lt; n_h &lt; 3 x 10^23 cm-2, and an average covering factor of&gt;30% (for solar abundances and a nominal qso continuum shape). the neviiiemitting region is therefore more extensive, more highly ionized, and has muchhigher velocities than the rest of the broad emission line region (belr). thishighly-ionized belr component would be a strong x-ray ``warm'' absorber if itlies along our line-of-sight to the x-ray continuum source.
