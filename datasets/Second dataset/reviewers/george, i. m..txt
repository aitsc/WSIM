0708.1305	an xmm-newton survey of broad iron lines in seyfert galaxies	we present an analysis of the x-ray spectra of a sample of 37 observations of26 seyfert galaxies observed by xmm-newton in order to characterize their ironk emission. all objects show evidence for iron line emission in the 6-7 kevband. a narrow core at 6.4 kev is seen almost universally in the spectra, andwe model this using a neutral compton reflection component, assumed to beassociated with distant, optically thick material such as the molecular torus.once this, and absorption by a zone of ionized gas in the line-of-sight isaccounted for, less than half of the sample observations show an acceptablefit. approximately 2/3 of the sample shows evidence for further, broadenedemission in the iron k-band. when modeled with a gaussian, the inferred energyis close to that expected for neutral iron, with a slight redshift, with anaverage velocity width of ~0.1c. the mean parameters are consistent withprevious asca results and support the idea that the broad components can beassociated with the accretion disk. before proceeding to that conclusion, wetest an alternative model comprising a blend of 3-4 narrow, unshifted emissionlines (including the 6.4 kev core), together with 1-2 zones of highly ionizedgas in the line-of-sight. around 1/3 of the objects are not adequately fit bythis model, and in general better fits are obtained with a relativistic diskline model, which has fewer free parameters. nonetheless we find thatabsorption by ionized gas affects the spectrum above 2.5 kev in approximatelyhalf the sample. there is evidence for multiple ionized zones in at least 3objects, but in all those cases a blurred reflector is required in addition tothe complex absorption.

1502.01338	revealing a hard x-ray spectral component that reverberates within one  light hour of the central supermassive black hole in ark 564	ark 564 (z=0.0247) is an x-ray-bright nls1. by using advanced x-ray timingtechniques, an excess of "delayed" emission in the hard x-ray band (4-7.5 kev)following about 1000 seconds after "flaring" light in the soft x-ray band(0.4-1 kev) was recently detected. we report on the x-ray spectral analysis ofeight xmm-newton and one suzaku observation of ark 564. high-resolutionspectroscopy was performed with the rgs in the soft x-ray band, whilebroad-band spectroscopy was performed with the epic-pn and xis/pin instruments.we analysed time-averaged, flux-selected, and time-resolved spectra. despitethe strong variability in flux during our observational campaign, thebroad-band spectral shape of ark 564 does not vary dramatically and can bereproduced either by a superposition of a power law and a blackbody emission orby a comptonized power-law emission model. high-resolution spectroscopyrevealed ionised gas along the line of sight at the systemic redshift of thesource, with a low column density and a range of ionisation states. broad-bandspectroscopy revealed a very steep intrinsic continuum and a rather weakemission feature in the iron k band; modelling this feature with a reflectioncomponent requires highly ionised gas. a reflection-dominated or anabsorption-dominated model are similarly able to well reproduce thetime-averaged data from a statistical point of view, in both cases requiringcontrived geometries and/or unlikely physical parameters. finally, throughtime-resolved analysis we spectroscopically identified the "delayed" emissionas a spectral hardening above ~4 kev; the most likely interpretation for thiscomponent is a reprocessing of the "flaring" light by gas located at 10-100 r_gfrom the central supermassive black hole that is so hot that it cancompton-upscatter the flaring intrinsic continuum emission.

astro-ph;0002206	on the reddening in x-ray absorbed seyfert 1 galaxies	there are several seyfert galaxies for which there is a discrepancy betweenthe small column of neutral hydrogen deduced from x-ray observations and themuch greater column derived from the reddening of the optical/uv emission linesand continuum. the standard paradigm has the dust within the highly ionized gaswhich produces o~vii and o~viii absorption edges (i.e., a ``dusty warmabsorber''). we present an alternative model in which the dust exists in acomponent of gas in which hydrogen has been stripped, but which is at too lowan ionization state to possess significant columns of o~vii and o~viii (i.e, a``lukewarm absorber''). the lukewarm absorber is at sufficient radial distanceto encompass much of the narrow emission-line region, and thus accounts for thenarrow-line reddening, unlike the dusty warm absorber. we test the model byusing a combination of photoionization models and absorption edge fits toanalyze the combined rosat/asca dataset for the seyfert 1.5 galaxy, ngc 3227.we show that the data are well fit by a combination of the lukewarm absorberand a more highly ionized component similar to that suggested in earlierstudies. we predict that the lukewarm absorber will produce strong uvabsorption lines of n v, c iv, si iv and mg ii. finally, these resultsillustrate that singly ionized helium is an important, and often overlooked,source of opacity in the soft x-ray band (100 - 500 ev).

astro-ph;0006339	the origin of the x-ray and ultraviolet emission in ngc 7469	we present a spectral analysis of a 30d, near-continuous observation of theseyfert 1 galaxy ngc 7469 with rxte. daily integrations show strong spectralchanges during the observation. ourmain result is that we find the x-rayspectral index to be correlated with the uv flux. furthermore, the broad-bandx-ray photon flux is also correlated with the uv continuum. these correlationspoint towards a model in which the x-rays originate via thermal comptonizationof uv seed photons. furthermore, the uv is also correlated with theextrapolation of the x-ray power law into the soft x-ray/euv region. our dataanalysis therefore re-opens the possibility the the uv photons and theirvariability arise from reprocessing, as long as the primary source of heatingis photo-electric absorption in the reprocessor, rather than comptondownscattering, a coherent picture of the x-ray/uv variability can therefore beconstructed whereby absorption and reprocessing of euv/soft x-rays in astandard accretion disk produce a variable seed photon distribution which arein turn up-scattered into the x-ray band. we also find a significantcorrelation between the 2-10 kev flux and the 6.4 kev iron k-line suggestingthat at least some portion of the line originates within ~1 lt day of the x-raycontinuum source. neither the power law photon index nor the compton reflectioncomponent are correlated with the 2-10 kev flux. the latter is not correlatedwith the iron k line flux either. we do find an apparent correlation betweenthe x-ray spectral index and the strength of the compton reflection component.in an appendix we show, however, that this can be produced by a combination ofstatistical and systematic errors. we conclude the apparent variations in thecompton reflection component may be an artifact of these effects.

astro-ph;0011242	the variable xmm-newton spectrum of markarian 766	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 766 was observed for 60 ks withthe xmm-newton observatory. the source shows a complex x-ray spectrum. the 2-10kev spectrum can be adequately represented by a power law and broad fe kaemission. between 0.7 and 2 kev the spectrum is harder and exhibits a fluxdeficit with respect to the extrapolated medium energy slope. below 0.7 kev,however, there is a strong excess of emission. the rgs spectrum shows anedge-like feature at 0.7 kev; the energy of this feature is inconsistent withthat expected for an ovii edge from a warm absorber. markarian 766 varies by afactor of ~ 2 in overall count rate in the epic and rgs instruments on atimescale of a few thousand seconds, while no significant flux changes areobserved in the ultraviolet with the om. the x-ray variability is spectrallydependent with the largest amplitude variability occurring in the 0.4-2 kevband. the spectral variability can be explained by a change in flux and slopeof the medium energy continuum emission, superimposed on a less variable (orconstant) low energy emission component.

astro-ph;0012129	chandra grating spectroscopy of the seyfert galaxy ton s180	this paper presents results from spectral observations of ton s180 usingchandra and asca. the data confirm the presence of the soft excess but thechandra letg spectrum reveals it to be broad and smooth, rather than resolvedinto individual emission lines. this excess may represent either a primary orreprocessed continuum component or a blend of broad lines from an ionizedaccretion disk. the occurrence of a similar feature in five other nlsy1s leadsus to conclude that this soft x-ray component may be a characteristic ofsources accreting at a very high rate. the x-ray spectrum shows no evidence forabsorption lines, indicating that if gas exists in the line-of-sight then it isin a very high ionization-state or has an extremely broad velocitydistribution. the new asca data confirm that the narrow component of the fekalpha line peaks close to a rest-energy of 7 kev, indicating the presence of asignificant amount of highly-ionized material in the nuclear environs.

astro-ph;0101037	stis echelle observations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151: physical  conditions in the ultraviolet absorbers	we have examined the physical conditions in intrinsic uv-absorbing gas in theseyfert galaxy ngc 4151, using echelle spectra obtained with the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis). we confirm the presence of the kinematiccomponents detected in earlier ghrs observations as well as a new broadabsorption feature at a radial velocity of -1680 km/s. the uv continuum of ngc4151 decreased by a factor of 4 over the previous two years, and we argue thechanges in the column density of the low ionization absorption lines associatedwith the broad component at -490 km/s reflect the decrease in the ionizingflux. most of the strong absorption lines (e.g., n v, c iv, si iv) from thiscomponent are saturated, but show substantial residual flux in their cores,indicating that the absorber does not fully cover the source of emission. ourinterpretation is that the unocculted light is due to scattering by freeelectrons from an extended region, which reflects continuum, emission lines,and absorption lines. we have been able to constrain the densities for thekinematic components based on absorption lines from metastable states of c iiiand fe ii, and/or the ratios of ground and fine structure lines of o i,c ii,and si ii. we have generated a set of photoionization models which match theionic column densities for each component during the present low flux state andthose seen in previous high flux states with the ghrs and stis, confirming thatthe absorbers are photoionized and respond to the changes in the continuumflux. we have been able to map the relative radial positions of the absorbers,and find that the gas decreases in density with distance. none of the uvabsorbers is of sufficiently large column density or high enough ionizationstate to account for the x-ray absorption.

astro-ph;0111419	subtleties in measuring iron k lines in agn	chandra and xmm observations are showing that the fe-k emission lines in type1 agn are composite, in general consisting of a narrow and a broad component.we review the latest chandra hetg results and compare the line profiles withthose measured by asca. the narrow fe-k line components necessitate re-modelingof the line profiles measured previously and revision of the parameters of therelativistic broad components, as well re-interpretation of variabilitystudies. we also explicitly demonstrate the effect of changes in the ascacalibration on the measurements of the fe-k lines in agn. we find that thedifferences in measured parameters are insignificant. both the intrinsic widthand ew change by less than 8%. fe-k line studies which claim much largerdifferences do not adequately model the line emission. we point out that it isincorrect to compare different calibrations, and indeed make astrophysicalinferences, using models which do not describe the data. we then present somenew results for the highest s/n broad fe-k line profile in the entire ascaarchive, from ngc 4151.

astro-ph;0309096	the ionized gas and nuclear environment in ngc 3783. iv. variability and  modeling of the 900 ks chandra spectrum	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the data obtained from ngc 3783during the period 2000-2001 using chandra. this analysis leads us to thefollowing results. 1) ngc 3783 fluctuated in luminosity by a factor ~1.5 duringindividual observations (~170 ks duration). these fluctuations were notassociated with significant spectral variations. 2) on a longer time scale(20-120 days), we found the source to exhibit two very different spectralshapes. the main difference between these can be well-described by theappearance and disappearance of a spectral component that dominates theunderlying continuum at the longest wavelengths. the spectral variations arenot related to the brightening or the fading of the continuum at shortwavelengths in any simple way. 3) the appearance of the soft continuumcomponent is consistent with being the only spectral variation, and there is noneed to invoke changes in the opacity of the absorbers. 4) photoionizationmodeling indicates that a combination of three ionized absorbers, each splitinto two kinematic components, can explain the strengths of almost all theabsorption lines and bound-free edges. all three components are thermallystable and seem to have the same gas pressure. 5) the only real discrepancybetween our model and the observations concerns the range of wavelengthsabsorbed by the iron m-shell uta feature. this most likely arises as the resultof our underestimation of the poorly-known dielectronic recombination ratesappropriate for these ions. 6) the lower limit on the distance of the absorbinggas in ngc 3783 is between 0.2 and 3.2 pc. the assumption of pressureequilibrium imposes an upper limit of about 25 pc on the distance of theleast-ionized component from the central source.

astro-ph;0402343	on the relationship between the optical emission-line and x-ray  luminosities in seyfert 1 galaxies	we have explored the relationship between the [o iii] $\lambda$5007 and the2--10 kev luminosities for a sample of broad- and narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies (blsy1 and nlsy1, respectively). we find that both types of seyfertsspan the same range in luminosity and possess similar [o iii]/x-ray ratios. thenlsy1s are more luminous than blsy1s, when normalized to their central blackhole masses, which is attributed to higher mass accretion rates. however, wefind no evidence for elevated [o iii]/x-ray ratios in nlsy1s, which would havebeen expected if they had excess euv continuum emission compared to blsy1s.also, other studies suggest that the gas in narrow-line regions (nlr) of nlsy1sand nlsy1s span a similar range in ionization, contrary to what is expected ifthose of the former are exposed to a stronger flux of euv radiation. thesimplest interpretation is that, like blsy1s, a large euv bump is not presentin nlsy1s. however, we show that the [oiii]/x-ray ratio can be lowered as aresult of absorption of the ionizing continuum by gas close to the centralsource, although there is no evidence that intrinsic line-of-sight absorptionis more common among nlsy1s, as would be expected if there were a larger amountof circumnuclear gas. other possible explanations include: 1) anisotropicemission of the ionizing radiation, 2) higher gas densities in the nlr ofnlsy1s, resulting in lower average ionization, or 3) the presence of strongwinds in the the nuclei of nlsy1s which may drive off much of the gas in thenarrow-line region, resulting in lower cover fraction and weaker [o iii]emission.

astro-ph;9606169	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: ii. relativistic iron k-alpha  emission	we present evidence for widespread relativistic effects in the centralregions of active galactic nuclei. in a sample of 18 seyfert 1 galaxiesobserved by \asca, 14 show an iron k$\alpha$ line which is is resolved, withmean width $\sigma_{\rm k\alpha}=0.43\pm 0.12$~kev for a gaussian profile (fullwidth at half maximum, fwhm$\sim 50,000$~km s$^{-1}$). however, many of theline profiles are asymmetric. a strong red wing is indicative of gravitationalredshifts close to a central black hole and accretion disk models provide anexcellent description of the data. the peak energy of the line is 6.4~kev,indicating that it arises by fluorescence in near-neutral material. our fitsimply a low inclination for the disk in these seyfert 1 galaxies, with a meanof 30\deg, consistent with orientation-dependent unification schemes.differences in the line profiles from source-to-source imply slight variationsin geometry, which cannot be accounted for solely by inclination. in mostcases, we require that the line emission arises from a range of radii. althougha small contribution to the emission from a region other than the disk is notruled out, it is not generally required and has little effect on ourconclusions regarding the disk line. our data are fit equally well withrotating (kerr) and non-rotating (schwarzschild) black hole models. we find amean spectral index in the 3-10 kev range of $&lt;\gamma_{3-10}&gt;=1.91\pm 0.07$after accounting for the effects of reflection. such observations probe theinnermost regions of agn, and arguably provide the best evidence yet obtainedfor the existence of super-massive black holes in the centers of activegalaxies.

astro-ph;9607016	the average x-ray/gamma-ray spectrum of radio-quiet seyfert 1s	we have obtained the average 1--500 kev spectrum of radio-quiet seyfert 1susing data from exosat, ginga, heao, and gro/osse. the spectral fit to thecombined average exosat and osse data is fully consistent with that for gingaand osse, confirming results from an earlier ginga/osse sample. the averagespectrum is well-fitted by a power-law x-ray continuum with an energy spectralindex of $\alpha \simeq 0.9$ moderately absorbed by an ionized medium and witha compton reflection component. a high-energy cutoff (or a break) in the thepower-law component at a few hundred kev or more is required by the data. wealso show that the corresponding average spectrum from heao a1 and a4 is fullycompatible with that obtained from exosat, ginga and osse. these resultsconfirm that the apparent discrepancy between the results of ginga (with$\alpha \simeq 0.9$) and the previous results of exosat and heao (with $\alpha\simeq 0.7$) is indeed due to ionized absorption and compton reflection firsttaken into account for ginga but not for the previous missions. also, ourresults confirm that the seyfert-1 spectra are on average cut off in gamma-raysat energies of at least a few hundred kev, not at $\sim 40$ kev (as suggestedearlier by osse data alone). the average spectrum is compatible with emissionfrom either an optically-thin relativistic thermal plasma in a disk corona, orwith a nonthermal plasma with a power-law injection of relativistic electrons.

astro-ph;9705087	asca observations of type-2 seyfert galaxies: ii. the importance of  x-ray scattering and reflection	we discuss the importance of x-ray scattering and compton reflection intype-2 seyfert galaxies, based upon the analysis of asca observations of 25such sources. consideration of the iron kalpha, [o iii] line and x-rayvariability suggest that ngc 1068, ngc 4945, ngc 2992, mrk 3, mrk 463e and mrk273 are dominated by reprocessed x-rays. we examine the properties of thesesources in more detail.  we find that the iron kalpha complex contains significant contributions fromneutral and high-ionization species of iron. compton reflection, hot gas andstarburst emission all appear to make significant contributions to the observedx-ray spectra.  mrk 3 is the only source in this subsample which does not have a significantstarburst contamination. the asca spectrum below 3 kev is dominated by hotscattering gas with u_x ~ 5, n_h ~ 4 x 10^23 cm^-2. this material is morehighly ionized than the zone of material comprising the warm absorber seen inseyfert~1 galaxies, but may contain a contribution from shock-heated gasassociated with the jet. estimates of the x-ray scattering fraction cover 0.25- 5%. the spectrum above 3 kev appears to be dominated by a compton reflectioncomponent although there is evidence that the primary continuum componentbecomes visible close to 10 kev.

astro-ph;9708046	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: iii. the evidence for  absorption &amp; emission due to photoionized gas	(abridged) we present the results from a detailed analysis of the 0.6 - 10kev spectra of 23 asca observations of 18 objects. we find that in most casesthe underlying continuum can be well-represented by a powerlaw with a photonindex gamma approx 2. however we find strong evidence for photoionized gas inthe line-of-sight to 13/18 objects. we present detailed modelling of this gasbased upon the ion photoionization code. we find the x-ray ionization parameterfor the ionized material is strongly peaked at ux approx 0.1. the columndensities of ionized material are typically in the range n_{h,z} approx10^{21}--10^{23} cm^{-2}, although highly ionized column densities up to10^{24} cm^{-2} cannot be excluded in some cases. we also investigate theimportance of the emission-spectrum from the ionized gas, finding that itsignificantly improves the fit to many sources with an intensity consistentwith material subtending a large solid angle at the central source. a deficitof counts is observed at approx 1 kev in the sources exhibiting the strongestabsorption features. we suggest this is likely to be the signature of a secondzone of (more highly) ionized gas, which might have been seen previously in thedeep fe k-shell edges observed in some ginga observations. we find evidencethat the ionized material in ngc 3227 and mcg-6-30-15 contains embedded dust,whilst there is no such evidence in the other sources

astro-ph;9803051	asca observations of the ionized gas in the seyfert galaxy ngc 3783	we present the results from asca observations of ngc 3783 carried out during1993 and 1996. variability is observed both between the two epochs and withinthe individual observations, the latter due to a non-stationary process.  we find the spectra at both epochs to contain features due to absorption byionized material, predominantly due to ovii and oviii. we find the opacity forsuch material to decrease by a factor approx 2 in the approx 0.7--1.0 kev bandbetween the epochs while the photoionizing flux increases by approx25%. bycomparison with detailed photoionization models we show this behaviour isinconsistent with that expected from a single-zone of photoionized gas. adeficit in the data compared to such models, consistent with excess absorptionby oviii, supports the suggestion that the material consists of two or morezones.  significant fe k-shell emission is also observed during both epochs. we showthis emission is dominated by the asymmetric line profile expected from theinnermost regions of the accretion flow. we find no evidence that the feemission varied in either shape or equivalent width between the two epochs.

astro-ph;9803205	the soft x-ray spectrum of scattering--dominated agn	this paper discusses the properties of scattering--dominated active galacticnuclei (agn). we define these to be agn for which the direct line-of-sight tothe continuum source is obscured by compton-thick material. the aim is toconstruct, for the first time, a model consistent with x-ray line luminosities,line ratios and various luminosity indicators. the asca spectra of six suchsources show several x-ray lines that can be reliably measured, mostly due tohighly ionized magnesium, silicon sulphur and iron. these enable us toinvestigate the physical conditions of the scattering material. the sourcesshow evidence of he-like and h-like iron lines that are likely to be producedin hot (t approx 10^6 k) photoionized gas. by measuring the ew of the lines,and by constructing a diagnostic line-ratio diagram, we demonstrate that thesilicon and magnesium lines are produced by the same gas emitting the highlyionized iron lines. the properties of this gas are rather different from theproperties of warm absorbers in type i agn. neutral 6.4 kev iron lines are alsodetected, originating in a different component which can be either compton-thinor compton-thick. the best measured iron lines suggest an enhancement ofn_{fe}/n_h by a factor approx 2 compared to solar, in both the hot and coolcompton-thin components. we further show that in four of the sources, the fekalpha(6.4kev)/hbeta (lambda 4861ang) line ratio is consistent with thatpredicted for typical narrow line region clouds, and the reddening correctedhbeta is known, provided the column density is larger than approx10^{22.5}/cm^2, alpha_{ox} is smaller than 1.3. for some sources, this is aviable alternative to the commonly assumed compton thick medium as the originof the 6.4 kev iron line.

astro-ph;9804135	new constraints on the continuum-emission mechanism of agn: intensive  monitoring of ngc 7469 in the x-ray and ultraviolet	we have undertaken near-continuous monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc7469 in the x-ray with rxte over a ~30d baseline. the source shows strongvariability with a root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of ~16 per cent, andpeak-to-peak variations of a factor of order 2. simultaneous data over thisperiod were obtained in the ultraviolet (uv) using iue, making this the mostintensive x-ray uv/x-ray variability campaign performed for any active galaxy.comparison of the continuum light curves reveals very similar amplitudes ofvariability, but different variability characteristics, with the x-rays showingmuch more rapid variations. the data are not strongly correlated at zero lag.the largest absolute value of the correlation coefficient occurs for ananticorrelation between the two bands, with the x-ray variations leading the uvby ~4d. the largest positive correlation is for the ultraviolet to lead thex-rays by ~4d. neither option appears to be compatible with any simpleinterband transfer function. the peak positive correlation at ~4d occursbecause the more prominent peaks in the uv light curve appear to lead those inthe x-rays by this amount. however, the minima of the light curves arenear-simultaneous. these observations provide new constraints on theoreticalmodels of the central regions of active galactic nuclei. models in which theobserved uv emission is produced solely by re-radiation of absorber x-rays areruled out by our data, as are those in which the x-rays are produced solely bycompton upscattering of the observed uv component by a constant distribution ofparticles.

astro-ph;9902161	the effect of intrinsic uv absorbers on the ionizing continuum and  narrow emission line ratios in seyfert galaxies	we explore the effects of uv absorbing material on the shape of the euvcontinuum radiation emitted by the active galactic nucleus, and on the relativestrengths of emission lines, formed in the narrow line regions of seyfertgalaxies, excited by this continuum. within a sample of seyfert 1.5 galaxies,objects with flatter soft x-ray slopes tend to have lower values of he ii4686/h-beta, which implies a correlation between the observed spectral energydistribution of the ionizing continuum and the narrow emission line strengths.objects with the flattest soft x-ray continua tend to possess high columndensity uv absorption and it is plausible that the differences in narrowemission line ratios among these galaxies are an indication of the effects ofabsorbing material internal to the narrow line region, rather than intrinsicdifferences in continuum shape. we have generated a set of photoionizationmodels to examine the effect of a range of uv absorbers on the ionizingcontinuum and, hence, the resulting conditions in a typical narrow line cloud.our results indicate that a low ionization uv absorber with large coveringfactor will indeed produce the combination of narrow line ratios and soft x-rayspectral characteristics observed in several seyfert 1.5 galaxies. our resultsalso suggest that low ionization uv absorption may be more common thancurrently believed.
