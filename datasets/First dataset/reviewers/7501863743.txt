17844392363	Absorbed energy in laser truing of a small vitrified CBN grinding wheel	Laser truing and dressing of abrasive grinding wheels has attracted great interest as a novel processing technique to complement conventional processing methods. Laser processes offer significant advantages over mechanical processes as lasers enable non-contact processing, and thus prevent tool wear. An energy balance model of energy absorption is presented that takes into account the space distribution of laser energy absorbed/scattered by the workpiece (circular profile). The models developed were used to predict various parameters, such as incident position, focal offset, and incident power, to compensate selective interaction during laser processing. Moreover, the incident angle for laser processing of small vitrified CBN grinding wheels was optimized. Further theoretical analysis and experiments determined the focal position of the incident beam with respect to the surface of the workpiece. Experiments were carried out using different processing parameters and grinding wheels to evaluate the effects of laser spatial properties on processing quality. The experimental results were shown to be in reasonable agreement with predicted results. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

27944473704	Effect of incident angle on laser processing of a small vitrified CBN grinding wheel	Laser incident angle is one of very important processing parameters on cylindrical surface, which affects not only the incident density of laser beam, but also the laser processing dimensional accuracy and quality. A new method to process grinding wheels using Nd:YAG laser is presented. Based on the principle of geometric optical, both modeling and experimental studies were conducted to investigate the effects of incident angle and critical angle on truing and dressing properties in laser processing a small vitrified CBN grinding wheel. The main difference in heat conductivity generated with incident angle was examined which produces laser processing amounts of materials removed quite differently. The effective truing was achieved by optimal selection of suitable laser power density through adjusting an incident angle. In addition, the underlying mechanism of laser truing and dressing process was investigated by means of modeling and experimental analysis of incident angle, critical angle and microscope structural characteristic (with SEM) that were shown to be reasonable.

33846327569	Laser truing and dressing of small vitrified CBN grinding wheel	This paper aims at the development of an alterative technique for truing and dressing a small vitrified CBN grinding wheel used for the internal finishing of small holes measuring several millimeters in diameter. In conventional truing and dressing, a single-tip diamond dresser or a rotary GC cup wheel dresser is employed. This levels off the improvement in the wheel truing accuracy because the stiffness of the grinding wheel shaft with an open-sided structure is low, and the shaft is thus deformed easily due to the truing force. In the present work, a new truing and dressing technique is proposed in which a Nd: YAG laser beam is employed as the dresser. Experiments were carried out with respect to the effects of the laser beam conditions (amplitude, width and frequency of pulse, and focus offset) and the relative motion between the laser beam and CBN wheel. It was found that the run-out of the CBN wheel was decreased significantly, and the wheel surface condition was improved greatly after laser truing and dressing.

In the decomposition and restructuring, tube plane bending is simplified into two-dimension curve project, while 3D tube bending is equivalent to two 2D space curves' projects. In 2D bending, the plane deals with modeling idea based on the extreme points and inflection points of two-dimension curve. The main idea performs narrowing of scanning path near extreme point area, but widening scanning path near inflection point. In 3D bending, the forming surface is decomposed into two planar curves by projecting on two vertical planes. Respective scanning path planning and process parameters are thus acquired.

Based on the analysis of the principle of APPA cleaning metal surface and the characteristic of the cleaning interface, a governing equation was established with heat transfer equation and energy conservation on the moving interface. Using fourth-order Rounge-Kutta method, above equation was solved and removal percentages of the cleaning contaminant at different time were obtained. In virtue of reactive kinetics theory, a reactive kinetics model of metal surface cleaning using APPA was established on the base of above calculation results. Afterwards, reactive kinetics parameters such as activation energy and pre-exponential factor were calculated. Cleaning lubricant was taken as an example and its reactive kinetics model was verified with a weighting method.

The behavior of plasma arc jet under an external transverse sinusoidal alternating magnetic field imposed perpendicular to the plasma current is analyzed theoretically, and the effect of process parameters such as gas flow rate, arc current, magnetic flow density and the distance from the nozzle outlet to the anode workpiece on the form and distribution of plasma arc are also in vestigated. The results show that it is feasible to control the shape and heat flow density of the plasma arc for the transverse alternating magnetic field, which can expand the area of plasma arc thermal treatment and flat the heat flow density upon the workpiece. Furthermore, the oscillating amplitude of plasma arc increases and the heat flow density gradient upon the workpiece decreases with the magnetic flow density enhancing. However, an overly strong magnetic field coil results in the plasma arc unstable. Under the same magnetic flow density, less gas flow rate and arc current, longer distance from the nozzle outlet to the anode causes the oscillating amplitude to increase. Contrarily, the more gas flow rate and arc current, the more heat flow density peak increases. Moreover, longer distance from nozzle outlet to workpiece descends the heat flow density peak.

However, the finishing effect of ECBS is dominated by many factors and complicated dynamic behavior of the factors.

78650931612	Analysis of surface topography characteristics in electrochemical mechanical finishing	In this paper, surface topography characteristics of electrochemical mechanical finishing (ECMF) for steel was investigated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the surface topography. And the microcosmic geometry parameters were measured by Talysurf SLI2000. Compared with original surface, the surface topography characteristics of the workpiece machined by ECMF have been analyzed with altitude density function (ADF) and auto correlation function (ACF). The results show that there exist periodicity component in surface profile before and after finishing. The auto correlation curves of ECMF surface have a smaller average period compared with grinding surface. The low-frequency component and the mean ripple peak distance of original surface profile are obviously decreased. Furthermore, the ripples and peak density are increased, and the surface roughness Ra is decreased from 0.231μm to 0.023μm. The results indicate that surface quality, material ratio of the profile and wear resistance machined by ECMF are improved obviously © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

A PECF system for spiral bevel gear (SBG) is established according to the generation of SBG tooth surfaces. An SBG (module, 12 mm; number of teeth, 38) is selected as the processing test piece, and mathematical models are developed for analyzing the characteristics of PECF. The influence of the experimental variables, including applied voltage, interelectrode gap, and finishing time, on the total removal thickness and surface roughness is discussed.

Two mathematical models were developed to describe both the oscillating amplitude of the plasma arc root and the heat flux density distribution of plasma arc on the workpiece surface. The characteristic of plasma arc under the external transverse-alternating magnetic field imposed perpendicular to the plasma current was discussed. The effect of processing parameters, such as working gas flux, arc current, magnetic flux density and the standoff from the nozzle to the workpiece, on the oscillation and heat flux distribution of plasma arc were also analyzed. The results show that it is feasible to adjust the shape and heat flux density of the plasma arc by the transverse alternating magnetic field, which expands the region of plasma arc thermal treatment and uniforms the heat flux density upon the workpiece. Furthermore, the oscillating amplitude of plasma arc decreases, and the heat flux density gradient upon the workpiece increases with decrease of the magnetic flux density. Under the same magnetic flux density, more gas flux and more arc current cause the oscillating amplitude to decrease.

82755170325	Laser cladding forming of arc-section inclined thin-walled parts with variable Z-increments	The matching of Z-increment and single cladding layer height is a key factor for improving cladding quality of thin-walled parts, so arc-section inclined thin-walled parts are formed by laser cladding forming with variable Z-increments. Under three-axis and open-loop control, the relationship curve between offset and Z-increment is obtained by laser cladding vertical and inclined thin parts. The result shows that Z-increment decreases gradually with offset increasing and when the offset ΔX is between 0.06 and 0.08 mm, the Z-increment ΔZ reaches its maximum decreasing rate. The biggest slope angle of deposited inclined thin parts is 36.6°. The offsets and Z-increments at the quinquesection points calculated by the relationship curve compose two-dimensional arrays. The optimized cross-section path is simulated by filtering and combining the arrays in accordance with the arc shape through Matlab program. Using the arrays of offsets and Z-increments obtained, arc-section inclined thin-walled parts with 136 layers are formed, and the dimension error of cladding height is under 0.78 mm, which is in agreement with the simulation and demonstrates the feasibility of forming arc-section inclined thin-walled parts with the method of variable Z-increments.

84860914739	Laser cladding forming of inclined thin-walled parts	The effects of single-layer offsets on the cladding heights of inclined thin-walled parts were investigated to improve the formed quality of the parts by laser cladding forming. Under the conditions of three-axis, open-loop control and quarter circle scanning path, the experiments were performed for inward and outward inclined thin-walled parts by laser cladding forming, respectively. To guarantee that total Z-increment could be close to the cladding height, different Z-increments of single-layer were used for corresponding level offsets of thin-walled parts. The experimental results show that the cladding height of inclined thin-walled parts decreases with the increasing offset. Moreover, the rate of reduction firstly increases, and then decreases. The thin-walled parts start to collapse when the rate increases again. The cladding heights of outward inclined thin-walled parts are higher than those of the inward ones, and the additional heights of cladding layer increases with the increasing offset up to a stable range from 0.15 mm to 0.2 mm. The utmost offset values of single-layer for inward and outward inclined thin-walled parts are 0.09~0.1 mm and 0.1 ~0.11 mm, respectively, and both the inclination angles are close to the limit of 40°. When the cladding parts reach the inclination limit, continuing increment of the offset or reduction of the Z-increment would lead to the collapse of the cladding parts seriously and the reduction of cladding height sharply. It concludes that reasonable controls of single-layer offset and Z-increment could form higher quality thin-walled parts with larger inclination angles.

84889681470	Laser bending of silicon sheet: Absorption factor and mechanisms	Laser bending of silicon sheet is a process to form three-dimensional microstructural silicon elements in an ambient environment. This study aims to investigate the process mechanism with the aid of both experimental and numerical analyses. To this end, a thin-film thermocouple was prepared to capture the temperature field within the heating zone of the laser beam. A new method was then developed to precisely determine the absorption factor by coupling numerical simulation of the laser bending results with the experimental results. It was found that each laser pulse causes a cycle of sharp temperature rise-drop in a silicon sheet. When the temperature in the heating zone is low, the sheet deforms elastically. When it is beyond the brittle-ductile transition temperature of silicon, however, plastic deformation in the sheet takes place and bending occurs. The bending angle becomes larger with increasing the number of laser beam scanning, once the temperature gradient in the scanning area is large enough. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.

Through the analysis on temperature field, stress-strain field and displacement of stainless steel layer, carbon steel layer and the bonding interface during laser bending process, the impact of interface on bending angles and bending quality are explored. The results show that during laser bending process, temperature transfers smooth across the bonding interface, while transverse stress and strain have obvious mutations. After deformation, tensile stress exists at both the top and bottom stainless steel layers and compressive stress exists at the middle carbon steel layer. When laser power is 140 W, scanning speed is 800 mm/min, the defocus amount is 10 mm, the maximum stress of Z-direction on the bonding interface is 87.5 MPa, which is smaller than the bonding strength of the laminate sheet (≥210 MPa). An effective curved laminate sheet is achieved using both experiment and simulation methods and the error is less than 5%. The simulation provides a good basis on both theory and experiment for better bending quality of SCLS.
