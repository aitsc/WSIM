0706.2962	variable stars in the open cluster ngc 6791 and its surrounding field	aims: this work presents a high--precision variability survey in the field ofthe old, super metal-rich open cluster ngc 6791.  methods: the data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision ccd timeseries measurements in the v band obtained mainly at the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, with additional data from s. pedro martir and loiano observatories,over a time span of ten nights. the field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.  results: we have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods andamplitudes of 70 known variable stars. by means of a photometric evaluation ofthe membership in ngc 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the propermotions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster andsurrounding field in the range 16&lt;v&lt;23.5. accurate periods can be given for thevariables with p&lt;4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limitedtime-baseline hampered precise determinations. we categorized the entire sampleas follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variablesand 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables forwhich we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longerthan our time baseline.  conclusions: on the basis of photometric considerations, and of the positionsof the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 newvariable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membershipis doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. we also detected an outburst ofabout 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to thecluster and we suggest that this star could be a new u gem (dwarf nova)cataclysmic variable.

0906.2628	hd 50844: the new look of delta sct stars from corot space photometry	it has also been suggested that the detection of a wealth of very lowamplitude modes in delta sct stars was only a matter of signal--to--noiseratio. access to this treasure, impossible from the ground, is one of thescientific aims of the space mission corot, a space mission developed andoperated by cnes. this work presents the results obtained on hd 50844: the140,016 datapoints were analysed using independent approaches and severalchecks performed. a level of 10^{-5} mag was reached in the amplitude spectraof the corot timeseries. the frequency analysis of the corot timeseriesrevealed hundreds of terms in the frequency range 0--30 d^{-1}. all thecross--checks confirmed this new result. the initial guess that delta sct starshave a very rich frequency content is confirmed. the spectroscopic modeidentification gives theoretical support since very high--degree modes (up toell=14) are identified. we also prove that cancellation effects are notsufficient in removing the flux variations associated to these modes at thenoise level of the corot measurements. the ground--based observations indicatethat hd 50844 is an evolved star that is slightly underabundant in heavyelements, located on the terminal age main sequence. probably due to thisunfavourable evolutionary status, no clear regular distribution is observed inthe frequency set. the predominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) has been identifiedas the fundamental radial mode combining ground-based photometric andspectroscopic data. this work is also based on observations made with esotelescopes under the eso large programme lp178.d-0361 and on data collected atthe observatorio de sierra nevada, at the observatorio astronomico nacional sanpedro martir, and at the piszkesteto mountain station of konkoly observatory.

0906.3626	ground-based observations of the beta cephei corot main target hd  180642: abundance analysis and mode identification	the known beta cephei star hd 180642 was observed by the corot satellite in2007. from the very high-precision light curve, its pulsation frequencyspectrum could be derived for the first time (degroote and collaborators). inthis paper, we obtain additional constraints for forthcoming asteroseismicmodeling of the target. our results are based on both extensive ground-basedmulticolour photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. we determine t_eff =24 500+-1000 k and log g = 3.45+-0.15 dex from spectroscopy. the derivedchemical abundances are consistent with those for b stars in the solarneighbourhood, except for a mild nitrogen excess. a metallicity z =0.0099+-0.0016 is obtained. three modes are detected in photometry. the degreel is unambiguously identified for two of them: l = 0 and l = 3 for thefrequencies 5.48694 1/d and 0.30818 1/d, respectively. the radial mode isnon-linear and highly dominant with an amplitude in the u-filter about 15 timeslarger than the strongest of the other modes. for the third frequency of7.36673 1/d found in photometry, two possibilities remain: l = 0 or 3. in theradial velocities, the dominant radial mode presents a so-called stillstand butno clear evidence of the existence of shocks is observed. four low-amplitudemodes are found in spectroscopy and one of them, with frequency 8.4079 1/d, isidentified as (l,m)=(3,2). based on this mode identification, we finally deducean equatorial rotational velocity of 38+-15 km/s.

0704.1668	a new search for planet transits in ngc 6791	context. searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study theeffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.  aims. considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster ngc 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique.  methods. a ten-night observational campaign was performed using thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (3.6m), the san pedro m\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the loiano telescope (1.5m). to increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  results. should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in ngc 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by bruntt et al. (2003). theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  conclusions. possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. more extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in ngc 6791.

1001.1116	photometric multi-site campaign on the open cluster ngc 884 i. detection  of the variable stars	context: recent progress in the seismic interpretation of field beta cepstars has resulted in improvements of the physics in the stellar structure andevolution models of massive stars. further asteroseismic constraints can beobtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster, which allhave similar age, distance and chemical composition.  aims: to improve our comprehension of the beta cep stars, we studied theyoung open cluster ngc 884 to discover new b-type pulsators, besides the twoknown beta cep stars, and other variable stars.  methods: an extensive multi-site campaign was set up to gather accurate ccdphotometry time series in four filters (u, b, v, i) of a field of ngc884.fifteen different instruments collected almost 77500 ccd images in 1286 hours.the images were calibrated and reduced to transform the ccd frames intointerpretable differential light curves. various variability indicators andfrequency analyses were applied to detect variable stars in the field. absolutephotometry was taken to deduce some general cluster and stellar properties.  results: we achieved an accuracy for the brightest stars of 5.7 mmag in v,6.9 mmag in b, 5.0 mmag in i and 5.3 mmag in u. the noise level in theamplitude spectra is 50 micromag in the v band. our campaign confirms thepreviously known pulsators, and we report more than one hundred new multi- andmono-periodic b-, a- and f-type stars. their interpretation in terms ofclassical instability domains is not straightforward, pointing to imperfectionsin theoretical instability computations. in addition, we have discovered sixnew eclipsing binaries and four candidates as well as other irregular variablestars in the observed field.

1101.3428	corot high-precision photometry of the b0.5 iv star hd 51756	ob stars are important constituents for the ecology of the universe, andthere are only a few studies on their pulsational properties detailed enough toprovide important feedback on current evolutionary models. our goal is toanalyse and interpret the behaviour present in the corot light curve of theb0.5 iv star hd 51756 observed during the second long run of the space mission,and to determine the fundamental stellar parameters from ground-basedspectroscopy gathered with the coralie and harps instruments after checking forsigns of variability and binarity, thus making a step further in mapping thetop of the beta cep instability strip. we compare the newly obtainedhigh-resolution spectra with synthetic spectra of late o-type and early b-typestars computed on a grid of stellar parameters. we match the results withevolutionary tracks to estimate stellar parameters. we use various time seriesanalysis tools to explore the nature of the variations present in the lightcurve. additional calculations are carried out based on distance and historicalposition measurements of the components to impose constraints on the binaryorbit. we find that hd 51756 is a wide binary with both a slow (v sin i \approx28 km s^-1) and a fast (v sin i \approx 170 km s^-1) early-b rotator whoseatmospheric parameters are similar (t_eff \approx 30000 k and log g \approx3.75). we are unable to detect pulsation in any of the components, and weinterpret the harmonic structure in the frequency spectrum as sign ofrotational modulation, which is compatible with the observed and deducedstellar parameters of both components. the non-detection of pulsation modesprovides a feedback on the theoretical treatment, given that non-adiabaticcomputations applied to appropriate stellar models predict the excitation ofboth pressure and gravity modes for the fundamental parameters of this star.

(withminor transformations from the v to the kp passband) have been used to deriveunderlying physical characteristics for all the stars. this procedure seems tobe validated through comparisons of the kepler variables with galactic and lmcrr lyr stars. the most metal-poor star in the sample is nr lyr, with[fe/h]=-2.3 dex; and the four most metal-rich stars have [fe/h] ranging from-0.6 to +0.1 dex. pulsational luminosities and masses are found to besystematically smaller than l and mass values derived from stellar evolutionmodels, and are favoured over the evolutionary values when periods are computedwith the warsaw linear hydrodynamics code. finally, the fourier parameters arecompared with theoretical values derived using the warsaw non-linear convectivepulsation code.

1209.5696	study of hd 169392a observed by corot and harps	the numerous results obtained with asteroseismology thanks to space missionssuch as corot and kepler are providing a new insight on stellar evolution.after five years of observations, corot is going on providing high-qualitydata. we present here the analysis of the double star hd169392 complemented byground-based spectroscopic observations. this work aims at characterizing thefundamental parameters of the two stars, their chemical composition, theacoustic-mode global parameters including their individual frequencies, andtheir dynamics. we have analysed harps observations of the two stars toretrieve their chemical compositions. several methods have been used andcompared to measure the global properties of acoustic modes and theirindividual frequencies from the photometric data of corot. the newspectroscopic observations and archival astrometric values suggest thathd169392 is a wide binary system weakly bounded. we have obtained thespectroscopic parameters for both components, suggesting the origin from thesame cloud. however, only the mode signature of hd169392 a has been measuredwithin the corot data. the signal-to-noise ratio of the modes in hd169392b istoo low to allow any confident detection. we were able to extract modeparameters of modes for l=0, 1, 2, and 3. the study of the splittings andinclination angle gives two possible solutions with splittings and inclinationangles of 0.4-1.0 muhz and 20-40 degrees for one case and 0.2-0.5 muhz and55-86 degrees for the other case. the modeling of this star with theasteroseismic modeling portal led to a mass of 1.15+/-0.01 ms, a radius of1.88+/-0.02 rs, and an age of 4.33+/-0.12 gyr, where the uncertainties are theinternal ones.

1301.2475	understanding the dynamical structure of pulsating stars: the  baade-wesselink projection factor of the delta scuti stars ai vel and beta  cas	aims. the baade-wesselink method of distance determination is based on theoscillations of pulsating stars. the key parameter of this method is theprojection factor used to convert the radial velocity into the pulsationvelocity. our analysis was aimed at deriving for the first time the projectionfactor of delta scuti stars, using high-resolution spectra of thehigh-amplitude pulsator ai vel and of the fast rotator beta cas. methods. thegeometric component of the projection factor (i.e. p0) was calculated using alimb-darkening model of the intensity distribution for ai vel, and afast-rotator model for beta cas. then, using sophie/ohp data for beta cas andharps/eso data for ai vel, we compared the radial velocity curves of severalspectral lines forming at different levels in the atmosphere and derived thevelocity gradient associated to the spectral-line-forming regions in theatmosphere of the star. this velocity gradient was used to derive a dynamicalprojection factor p. results. we find a flat velocity gradient for both starsand finally p = p0 = 1.44 for ai vel and p = p0 = 1.41 for beta cas. bycomparing cepheids and delta scuti stars, these results bring valuable insightsinto the dynamical structure of pulsating star atmospheres. they suggest thatthe period-projection factor relation derived for cepheids is also applicableto delta scuti stars pulsating in a dominant radial mode.

1311.4370	a search for pulsations in the hgmn star hd 45975 with corot photometry  and ground-based spectroscopy	the existence of pulsations in hgmn stars is still being debated. to providethe first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class ofchemically peculiar objects, the bright star hd 45975 was monitored for nearlytwo months by the corot satellite. independent analyses of the light curveprovides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d anda peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. multisite, ground-based spectroscopicobservations overlapping the corot observations show the star to be along-period, single-lined binary. furthermore, with the notable exception ofmercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line momentsof chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., mn and y). incontrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. as foundin other hgmn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bumpmoving redwards across the line profiles. we argue that the photometric andspectroscopic changes are more consistent with an interpretation in terms ofrotational modulation of spots at the stellar surface. in this framework, theexistence of pulsations producing photometric variations above the ~50 ppmlevel is unlikely in hd 45975. this provides strong constraints on theexcitation/damping of pulsation modes in this hgmn star.
