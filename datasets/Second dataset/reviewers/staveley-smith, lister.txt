0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

0911.0002	the australia telescope 20 ghz survey: the source catalogue	we present the full source catalogue from the australia telescope 20 ghz(at20g) survey. the at20g is a blind radio survey carried out at 20 ghz withthe australia telescope compact array (atca) from 2004 to 2008, and covers thewhole sky south of declination 0 deg. the at20g source catalogue presented hereis an order of magnitude larger than any previous catalogue of high-frequencyradio sources, and includes 5890 sources above a 20 ghz flux-density limit of40 mjy. all at20g sources have total intensity and polarisation measured at 20ghz, and most sources south of declination -15 deg also have near-simultaneousflux-density measurements at 5 and 8 ghz. a total of 1559 sources were detectedin polarised total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies. we detecta small but significant population of non-thermal sources that are eitherundetected or have only weak detections in low-frequency catalogues. weintroduce the term ultra-inverted spectrum (uis) to describe these radiosources, which have a spectral index alpha(5, 20) &gt; +0.7 and which constituteroughly 1.2 per cent of the at20g sample. the 20 ghz flux densities measuredfor the strongest at20g sources are in excellent agreement with the wmap 5-yearsource catalogue of wright et al. (2009), and we find that the wmap sourcecatalogue is close to complete for sources stronger than 1.5 jy at 23 ghz.

0911.4946	first detection of ammonia in the large magellanic cloud: the kinetic  temperature of dense molecular cores in n159w	the first detection of ammonia (nh3) is reported from the magellanic clouds.using the australia telescope compact array, we present a targeted search forthe (j,k) = (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines towards seven prominentstar-forming regions in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). both lines aredetected in the massive star-forming region n159w, which is located in thepeculiar molecular ridge south of 30 doradus, a site of extreme star formationstrongly influenced by an interaction with the milky way halo. using theammonia lines, we derive a kinetic temperature of ~16k, which is 2-3 timesbelow the previously derived dust temperature. the ammonia column density,averaged over ~17" is ~6x10^{12} cm^{-2} &lt;1.5x10^{13} cm^{-2} over 9" in theother six sources) and we derive an ammonia abundance of ~4x10^{-10} withrespect to molecular hydrogen. this fractional abundance is 1.5-5 orders ofmagnitude below those observed in galactic star-forming regions. the nitrogenabundance in the lmc (~10% solar) and the high uv flux, which canphoto-dissociate the particularly fragile nh3 molecule, must both contribute tothe low fractional nh3 abundance, and we likely only see the molecule in anensemble of the densest, best shielded cores of the lmc.

0912.2290	diffuse rrl emission on the galactic plane between l=36 to 44 degrees	radio recombination lines (rrls) can be used to determine the emissionmeasure unambiguously along the galactic plane. we use the deep (2100s perbeam) hi parkes zone of avoidance survey which includes 3 rrls (h$166\alpha$,h$167\alpha$ and h$168\alpha$) within its bandwidth. the region $\ell =36\degr$ to $44\degr$, $b = -4\degr$ to $+4\degr$ is chosen to include emissionfrom the local, sagittarius and scutum arms. an $8\degr \times 8\degr$ datacube centred at $(\ell, b) = (40\degr, 0\degr)$ is constructed of rrl spectrawith velocity and spatial resolution of 27$\kms$ and 15.5 arcmin, respectively.well-known \hii regions are identified as well as the diffuse rrl emission onthe galactic plane. a galactic latitude section of the integrated rrl emissionacross the galactic plane delineates the brightness temperature ($t_{b}$)distribution which has a half-power width in latitude of $\simeq 1\fdg5$.  a value of the electron temperature $t_{e} \simeq 8000$ k is derived from acomparison with the wmap free-free mem model. the $t_{b}$ distribution from thepresent rrl data is combined with the wmap 5-yr data to derive the anomalousdust on the galactic ridge.  in this paper we demonstrate that diffuse ionized emission on the galacticridge can be recovered using rrls from the zoa survey. this method is thereforeable to complement the \ha data at low galactic latitudes, to enable an all-skyfree-free template to be derived.

1004.4365	the slope of the baryonic tully-fisher relation	we present the results of a baryonic tully-fisher relation (btfr) study for alocal sample of relatively isolated disk galaxies. we derive a btfr with aslope near 3 measured over about 4 dex in baryon mass for our combined\textrm{h\,\scriptsize{i}} and bright spiral disk samples. this btfr issignificantly flatter and has less scatter than the tfr (stellar mass only)with its slope near 4 reported for other samples and studies. a btfr slope near3 is in better agreement with the expected slope from simple $\lambda$cdmcosmological simulations that include both stellar and gas baryons. the scatterin the tfr/btfr appears to depend on $w_{20}$: galaxies that rotate slower havemore scatter. the atomic gas--to--stars ratio shows a break near $w_{20} = 250$\kms\, probably associated with a change in star formation efficiency. incontrast the absence of such a break in the btfr suggests that this relationwas probably set at the main epoch of baryon dissipation rather than as aproduct of later galactic evolution.

1010.5942	the australia telescope 20ghz (at20g) survey: analysis of the  extragalactic source sample	the australia telescope 20 ghz (at20g) survey is a blind survey of the wholesouthern sky at 20 ghz with follow-up observations at 4.8, 8.6, and 20 ghzcarried out with the australia telescope compact array (atca). in this paper wepresent an analysis of radio spectral properties in total intensity andpolarisation, sizes, optical identifications, and redshifts of the sample ofthe 5808 extragalactic sources in the survey catalogue of confirmed sourcesover the whole southern sky excluding the strip at galactic latitude|b|&lt;1.5deg. the sample has a flux density limit of 40 mjy. completeness hasbeen measured as a function of scan region and flux density. averaging over thewhole survey area the follow-up survey is 78% complete above 50mjy and 93%complete above 100mjy. 3332 sources with declination &lt;-15deg have good qualityalmost simultaneous observations at 4.8, 8.6, and 20ghz. the spectral analysisshows that the sample is dominated by flat-spectrum sources. the fraction offlat-spectrum sources decreases from 81% for 20ghz flux densities s&gt;500mjy, to60% for s&lt;100mjy. there is also a clear spectral steepening at higherfrequencies with the median spectral index decreasing from -0.16 between 4.8and 8.6ghz to -0.28 between 8.6 and 20ghz. simultaneous observations inpolarisation are available for all the sources at all the frequencies. 768sources have a good quality detection of polarised flux density at 20ghz; 467of them were also detected in polarisation at 4.8 and/or at 8.6ghz so that ithas been possible to compare the spectral behaviour in total intensity andpolarisation. we have found that the polarised fraction increases slightly withfrequency and decreases with flux density. cross matches and comparisons havebeen made with other catalogues at lower radio frequencies, and in the optical,x-ray and gamma-ray bands. redshift estimates are available for 825 sources.

1106.3366	the 6df galaxy survey: baryon acoustic oscillations and the local hubble  constant	we analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6df galaxy survey(6dfgs) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) signal. the 6dfgs baodetection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at z_{\rm eff}= 0.106. we achieve a distance measure of d_v(z_{\rm eff}) = 456\pm27 mpc and ameasurement of the distance ratio, r_s(z_d)/d_v(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.336\pm0.015(4.5% precision), where r_s(z_d) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch z_d.the low effective redshift of 6dfgs makes it a competitive and independentalternative to cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the hubbleconstant. we find a hubble constant of h_0 = 67\pm3.2 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1} (4.8%precision) that depends only on the wmap-7 calibration of the sound horizon andon the galaxy clustering in 6dfgs. compared to earlier bao studies at higherredshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. thesensitivity to h_0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energyequation of state parameter w and h_0 in the cmb data. we determine that w =-0.97\pm0.13, using only wmap-7 and bao data from both 6dfgs and\citet{percival:2009xn}. we also discuss predictions for the large scalecorrelation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the wallaby blind h{\sci} survey (with the australian ska pathfinder, askap), and the proposed taipanall-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the uk schmidt telescope (ukst). wefind that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the bao peak,making wallaby the first radio galaxy survey to do so. we also predict thattaipan has the potential to constrain the hubble constant with 3% precision.

1107.1323	the remnant of sn1987a revealed at (sub-)mm wavelengths	context: supernova 1987a (sn1987a) exploded in the large magellanic cloud(lmc). its proximity and rapid evolution makes it a unique case study of theearly phases in the development of a supernova remnant. one particular aspectof interest is the possible formation of dust in sn1987a, as sne couldcontribute significantly to the dust seen at high redshifts. aims: we explorethe properties of sn1987a and its circumburst medium as seen at mm and sub-mmwavelengths, bridging the gap between extant radio and infrared (ir)observations of respectively the synchrotron and dust emission. methods:sn1987a was observed with the australia telescope compact array (atca) at 3.2mm in july 2005, and with the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex) at 0.87 mmin may 2007. we present the images and brightness measurements of sn1987a atthese wavelengths for the first time. results: sn1987a is detected as anunresolved point source of 11.2 +/- 2.0 mjy at 3.2 mm (5" beam) and 21 +/- 4mjy at 0.87 mm (18" beam). these flux densities are in perfect agreement withextrapolations of the powerlaw radio spectrum and modified-blackbody dustemission, respectively. this places limits on the presence of free-freeemission, which is similar to the expected free-free emission from the ionizedejecta from sn1987a. adjacent, fainter emission is observed at 0.87 mmextending ~0.5' towards the south-west. this could be the impact of thesupernova progenitor's wind when it was still a red supergiant upon a densemedium. conclusions: we have established a continuous spectral energydistribution for the emission from sn1987a and its immediate surroundings,linking the ir and radio data. this places limits on the contribution fromionized plasma. our sub-mm image reveals complexity in the distribution of colddust surrounding sn1987a, but leaves room for freshly synthesized dust in thesn ejecta.

1108.6268	a derivation of the free-free emission on the galactic plane between  l=20 and 44 degrees	we present the derivation of the free-free emission on the galactic planebetween l=20 and 44 degrees and |b| &lt; 4 degrees, using radio recombination line(rrl) data from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass). following an upgrade onthe rrl data reduction technique, which improves significantly the quality ofthe final rrl spectra, we have extended the analysis to three times the areacovered in alves et al. (2010). the final rrl map has an angular resolution of14.8 arcmin and a velocity resolution of 20 km/s.  a map of the electron temperature (te) of the ionised gas is derived for thearea under study using the line and continuum data from the present survey. themean te on the galactic plane is 6000 k. the first direct measure of thefree-free emission is obtained based on the derived te map. subtraction of thisthermal component from the total continuum leaves the first direct measure ofthe synchrotron emission at 1.4 ghz. a narrow component of width 2 degrees isidentified in the latitude distribution of the synchrotron emission. we presenta list of hii regions and snrs extracted from the present free-free andsynchrotron maps, where we confirm the synchrotron nature of three objects:g41.12-0.21, g41.15+0.39 and g35.59-0.44. we also identify a bright (42 jy) newdouble radio galaxy, j1841-0152, previously unrecognised owing to the highoptical extinction in the region.  the latitude distribution for the rrl-derived free-free emission shows thatthe wmap maximum entropy method (mem) is too high by ~ 50 per cent, inagreement with other recent results. the extension of this study to the innergalaxy region l=-50 to 50 degrees will allow a better overall comparison of therrl result with wmap.

1204.4725	the 6df galaxy survey: z \approx 0 measurement of the growth rate and  sigma_8	we present a detailed analysis of redshift-space distortions in the two-pointcorrelation function of the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs). the k-band selectedsub-sample which we employ in this study contains 81971 galaxies distributedover 17000deg^2 with an effective redshift z = 0.067. by modelling the 2dgalaxy correlation function, xi(r_p,pi), we measure the parameter combinationf(z)sigma_8(z) = 0.423 +/- 0.055. alternatively, by assuming standard gravitywe can break the degeneracy between sigma_8 and the galaxy bias parameter, b.combining our data with the hubble constant prior from riess et al (2011), wemeasure sigma_8 = 0.76 +/- 0.11 and omega_m = 0.250 +/- 0.022, consistent withconstraints from other galaxy surveys and the cosmic microwave background datafrom wmap7. combining our measurement of fsigma_8 with wmap7 allows us to testthe relationship between matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constrainingthe growth index of density fluctuations, gamma. using only 6dfgs and wmap7data we find gamma = 0.547 +/- 0.088, consistent with the prediction of generalrelativity. we note that because of the low effective redshift of 6dfgs ourmeasurement of the growth rate is independent of the fiducial cosmologicalmodel (alcock-paczynski effect). we also show that our conclusions are notsensitive to the model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions. usinga fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for constraints on fsigma_8 forthe wallaby survey and the proposed taipan survey. the wallaby survey will beable to measure fsigma_8 with a precision of 4-10%, depending on the modellingof non-linear structure formation. this is comparable to the predictedprecision for the best redshift bins of the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss), demonstrating that low-redshift surveys have a significant roleto play in future tests of dark energy and modified gravity.

1205.6812	the wigglez dark energy survey: the transition to large-scale cosmic  homogeneity	we have made the largest-volume measurement to date of the transition tolarge-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. we use the wigglezsurvey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200,000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volumeof ~1 (gpc/h)^3. a new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented,which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and whichcan be easily compared between different surveys. due to the large cosmic depthof wigglez (up to z=1) we are able to make the first measurement of thetransition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. the mean number ofgalaxies n(&lt;r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r^3 within1%, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1% of d_2=3,at radii larger than 71 \pm 8 mpc/h at z~0.2, 70 \pm 5 mpc/h at z~0.4, 81 \pm 5mpc/h at z~0.6, and 75 \pm 4 mpc/h at z~0.8. we demonstrate the robustness ofour results against selection function effects, using a lcdm n-body simulationand a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. the results are inexcellent agreement with both the lcdm n-body simulation and an analytical lcdmprediction. we can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension belowd_2=2.97 on scales from ~80 mpc/h up to the largest scales probed by ourmeasurement, ~300 mpc/h, at 99.99% confidence.

1208.5592	predictions for askap neutral hydrogen surveys	the australian square kilometer array pathfinder (askap) will revolutioniseour knowledge of gas-rich galaxies in the universe. here we present predictionsfor two proposed extragalactic askap neutral hydrogen (hi) emission-linesurveys, based on semi-analytic models applied to cosmological n-bodysimulations. the askap hi all-sky survey, known as wallaby, is a shallow 3 pisurvey (z = 0 - 0.26) which will probe the mass and dynamics of over 600,000galaxies. a much deeper small-area hi survey, called dingo, aims to trace theevolution of hi from z = 0 - 0.43, a cosmological volume of 40 million mpc^3,detecting potentially 100,000 galaxies. the high-sensitivity 30 antenna askapcore (diameter ~2 km) will provide an angular resolution of 30 arcsec (at z=0).our simulations show that the majority of galaxies detected in wallaby (87.5%)will be resolved. about 5000 galaxies will be well resolved, i.e. more thanfive beams (2.5 arcmin) across the major axis, enabling kinematic studies oftheir gaseous disks. this number would rise to 160,000 galaxies if all 36 askapantennas could be used; the additional six antennas provide baselines up to 6km, resulting in an angular resolution of 10 arcsec. for dingo this increasedresolution is highly desirable to minimise source confusion; reducing confusionrates from a maximum of 10% of sources at the survey edge to 3%. we estimatethat the sources detected by wallaby and dingo will span four orders ofmagnitude in total halo mass (from 10^{11} to 10^{15} msol) and nearly sevenorders of magnitude in stellar mass (from 10^{5} to 10^{12} msol), allowing usto investigate the process of galaxy formation across the last four billionyears.

1212.3610	the 6df galaxy survey: dependence of halo occupation on stellar mass	in this paper we study the stellar-mass dependence of galaxy clustering inthe 6df galaxy survey. the near-infrared selection of 6dfgs allows morereliable stellar mass estimates compared to optical bands used in other galaxysurveys. using the halo occupation distribution (hod) model, we investigate thetrend of dark matter halo mass and satellite fraction with stellar mass bymeasuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(r_p)$. we find that thetypical halo mass ($m_1$) as well as the satellite power law index ($\alpha$)increase with stellar mass. this indicates, (1) that galaxies with higherstellar mass sit in more massive dark matter halos and (2) that these moremassive dark matter halos accumulate satellites faster with growing masscompared to halos occupied by low stellar mass galaxies. furthermore we find arelation between $m_1$ and the minimum dark matter halo mass ($m_{\rm min}$) of$m_1 \approx 22\,m_{\rm min}$, in agreement with similar findings for sdssgalaxies. the satellite fraction of 6dfgs galaxies declines with increasingstellar mass from 21% at $m_{\rm stellar} = 2.6\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,m_{\odot}$to 12% at $m_{\rm stellar} = 5.4\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,m_{\odot}$ indicating thathigh stellar mass galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies. we compareour results to two different semi-analytic models derived from the millenniumsimulation, finding some disagreement. our results can be used for placing newconstraints on semi-analytic models in the future, particularly the behaviourof luminous red satellites. finally we compare our results to studies of halooccupation using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing. we find good overall agreement,representing a valuable crosscheck for these two different tools of studyingthe matter distribution in the universe.

1302.3687	confronting cold dark matter predictions with observed galaxy rotations	the rich statistics of galaxy rotations as captured by the velocity function(vf) provides invaluable constraints on galactic baryon physics and the natureof dark matter (dm). however, the comparison of observed galaxy rotationsagainst cosmological models is prone to subtle caveats that can easily lead tomisinterpretations. our analysis reveals full statistical consistency between~5000 galaxy rotations, observed in line-of-sight projection, and predictionsbased on the standard cosmological model (lcdm) at the mass-resolution of themillennium simulation (hi line-based circular velocities above ~50 km/s).explicitly, the hi linewidths in the hi parkes all sky survey (hipass) arefound consistent with those in s3-sax, a post-processed semi-analytic model forthe millennium simulation. previously found anomalies in the vf can beplausibly attributed to (1) the mass-limit of the millennium simulation, (2)confused sources in hipass, (3) inaccurate inclination measurements foroptically faint sources, and (4) the non-detectability of gas-poor early-typegalaxies. these issues can be bypassed by comparing observations and modelsusing linewidth source counts rather than vfs. we investigate if and how wellsuch source counts can constrain the temperature of dm.

1304.7938	choirs, hi galaxy groups: catalogue and detection of star-forming dwarf  group members	h{\alpha} observations centred on galaxies selected from the hi parkes allsky survey (hipass, barnes et al. 2001) typically show one and sometimes twostar-forming galaxies within the approximately 15-arcminute beam of the parkes64-m hi detections. in our survey of ionization in neutral gas galaxies (singg,meurer et al. 2006) we found fifteen cases of hipass sources containing four ormore emission line galaxies (elgs). we name these fields choir groups. in themost extreme case we found a field with at least nine elgs. in this paper wepresent a catalogue of choir group members in the context of the wider singgsample. the dwarf galaxies in the choir groups would not be individuallydetectable in hipass at the observed distances if they were isolated, but aredetected in singg narrow-band imaging due to their membership of groups withsufficiently large total hi mass. the elgs in these groups are similar to thewider singg sample in terms of size, h{\alpha} equivalent width, and surfacebrightness. eight of these groups have two large spiral galaxies with severaldwarf galaxies and may be thought of as morphological analogues of the localgroup. however, on average our groups are not significantly hi-deficient,suggesting that they are at an early stage of assembly, and more like the m81group. the choir groups are very compact at typically only 190 kpc in projecteddistance between the two brightest members. they are very similar to singgfields in terms of star formation efficiency (the ratio of star formation rateto hi mass; sfe), showing an increasing trend in sfe with stellar mass.

1311.5308	the busy function: a new analytic function for describing the integrated  21-cm spectral profile of galaxies	accurate parametrization of galaxies detected in the 21-cm hi emission is offundamental importance to the measurement of commonly used indicators of galaxyevolution, including the tully-fisher relation and the hi mass function. here,we propose a new analytic function, named the 'busy function', that can be usedto accurately describe the characteristic double-horn hi profile of manygalaxies. the busy function is a continuous, differentiable function thatconsists of only two basic functions, the error function, erf(x), and apolynomial, |x|^n, of degree n &gt;= 2. we present the basic properties of thebusy function and illustrate its great flexibility in fitting a wide range ofhi profiles from the gaussian profiles of dwarf galaxies to the broad,asymmetric double-horn profiles of spiral galaxies.  applications of the busy function include the accurate and efficientparametrization of observed hi spectra of galaxies and the construction ofspectral templates for simulations and matched filtering algorithms. wedemonstrate the busy function's power by automatically fitting it to the hispectra of 1000 galaxies from the hipass bright galaxy catalog, using our ownc/c++ implementation, and comparing the resulting parameters with thecatalogued ones. we also present two methods for determining the uncertaintiesof observational parameters derived from the fit.

1312.1022	are peculiar velocity surveys competitive as a cosmological probe?	peculiar velocity surveys, which measure galaxy peculiar velocities directlyfrom standard candles in addition to redshifts, can provide strong constraintson the linear growth rate of cosmological large-scale structure at lowredshift. the improvement originates from the physical relationship betweengalaxy density and peculiar velocity, which substantially reduces cosmicvariance. we present the results of fisher matrix forecasts of correlatedfields of galaxy density and velocity. peculiar velocity can improve the growthrate constraints by about a factor of two compared to density alone, if we canuse all the information for wavenumber k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc. future peculiar velocitysurveys, taipan, and the all-sky hi surveys, wallaby and wnshs, can measure thegrowth rate, f*sigma8 to 3 per cent at z ~ 0.025. although the velocitysubsample is about an order of magnitude smaller than the redshift sample fromthe same survey, it improves the constraint by 40 per cent compared to the samesurvey without velocity measurements. peculiar velocity surveys can alsomeasure the growth rate as a function of wavenumber with 15-30 per centuncertainties in bins with widths 0.01 h/mpc in the range 0.02 h/mpc &lt; k &lt; 0.1h/mpc, which is a large improvement over galaxy density only. such measurementson very large scales can detect signatures of modified gravity ornon-gaussianity through scale-dependent growth rate or galaxy bias. we usen-body simulations to improve the modelling of auto- and cross-power spectra ofgalaxy density and peculiar velocity by introducing a new redshift-spacedistortion term to the velocity, which has been neglected in previous studies.the velocity power spectrum has a damping in redshift space, which is largerthan that naively expected from the similar effect in the galaxy powerspectrum.

1409.7811	spectral and morphological analysis of the remnant of supernova 1987a  with alma &amp; atca	we present a comprehensive spectral and morphological analysis of the remnantof supernova (sn) 1987a with the australia telescope compact array (atca) andthe atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma). the non-thermal andthermal components of the radio emission are investigated in images from 94 to672 ghz ($\lambda$ 3.2 mm to 450 $\mu$m), with the assistance of ahigh-resolution 44 ghz synchrotron template from the atca, and a dust templatefrom alma observations at 672 ghz. an analysis of the emission distributionover the equatorial ring in images from 44 to 345 ghz highlights a gradualdecrease of the east-to-west asymmetry ratio with frequency. we attribute thisto the shorter synchrotron lifetime at high frequencies. across the transitionfrom radio to far infrared, both the synchrotron/dust-subtracted images and thespectral energy distribution (sed) suggest additional emission beside the mainsynchrotron component ($s_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-0.73}$) and the thermal componentoriginating from dust grains at $t\sim22$ k. this excess could be due tofree-free flux or emission from grains of colder dust. however, a secondflat-spectrum synchrotron component appears to better fit the sed, implyingthat the emission could be attributed to a pulsar wind nebula (pwn). theresidual emission is mainly localised west of the sn site, as the spectralanalysis yields $-0.4\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-0.1$ across the western regions,with $\alpha\sim0$ around the central region. if there is a pwn in the remnantinterior, these data suggest that the pulsar may be offset westward from the snposition.

1411.4497	the hipass survey of the galactic plane in radio recombination lines	we present a radio recombination line (rrl) survey of the galactic plane fromthe hi parkes all-sky survey and associated zone of avoidance survey, whichmapped the region l=196degr -- 0degr --52degr and |b| &lt; 5degr at 1.4 ghz and14.4 arcmin resolution. we combine three rrls, h168$\alpha$, h167$\alpha$, andh166$\alpha$ to derive fully sampled maps of the diffuse ionized emission alongthe inner galactic plane. the velocity information, at a resolution of 20 km/s,allows us to study the spatial distribution of the ionized gas and compare itwith that of the molecular gas, as traced by co. the longitude-velocity diagramshows that the rrl emission is mostly associated with co gas from the molecularring and is concentrated within the inner 30degr of longitude. a map of thefree-free emission in this region of the galaxy is derived from theline-integrated rrl emission, assuming an electron temperature gradient withgalactocentric radius of $496\pm100$ k/kpc. based on the thermal continuum mapwe extracted a catalogue of 317 compact (&lt;15 arcmin) sources, with fluxdensities, sizes and velocities. we report the first rrl observations of thesouthern ionized lobe in the galactic centre. the line profiles and velocitiessuggest that this degree-scale structure is in rotation. we also present newevidence of diffuse ionized gas in the 3-kpc arm. helium and carbon rrls aredetected in this survey. the he line is mostly observed towards hii regions,whereas the c line is also detected further away from the source of ionization.these data represent the first observations of diffuse c rrls in the galacticplane at a frequency of 1.4 ghz.

1411.7381	a stubbornly large mass of cold dust in the ejecta of supernova 1987a	we present new herschel photometric and spectroscopic observations ofsupernova 1987a, carried out in 2012. our dedicated photometric measurementsprovide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 microncompared to previous observations in 2010. our herschel spectra show only weakco line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [o i] line flux,eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previouslyestimated dust mass. the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) iswell fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. the newly measured 70 micronflux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a singletemperature. the far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 msun ofamorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosyntheticmass prediction for carbon. the observation of sio molecules at early and latephases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the sedwith a combination of 0.3 msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 msun of silicates,totalling 0.8 msun of dust. our analysis thus supports the presence of a largedust reservoir in the ejecta of sn 1987a. the inferred dust mass suggests thatsupernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, fromlocal to high-redshift galaxies.

1501.01082	connecting the baryons: multiwavelength data for ska hi surveys	the science achievable with ska hi surveys will be greatly increased throughthe combination of hi data with that at other wavelengths. thesemultiwavelength datasets will enable studies to move beyond an understanding ofhi gas in isolation to instead understand hi as an integral part of the highlycomplex baryonic processes that drive galaxy evolution.  as they evolve, galaxies experience a host of environmental and feedbackinfluences, many of which can radically impact their gas content. importantprocesses include: accretion (hot and cold mode, mergers), depletion (starformation, galactic winds, agn), phase changes (ionised/atomic/molecular), andenvironmental effects (ram pressure stripping, tidal effects, strangulation).governing all of these to various extents is the underlying dark matterdistribution. in turn, the result of these processes can significantly alterthe baryonic states in which material is finally observed (stellar populations,dust, chemistry) and its morphology (galaxy type, bulge/disk ratio, bars,warps, radial profile). to fully understand the evolution of hi and the role itplays in galactic evolution requires the ability to quantify each of theseseparate processes, and hence to coordinate ska hi surveys with extensivemulti-band photometric and spectroscopic campaigns. in addition,multiwavelength data is essential for statistical methods of hi analysis suchas hi stacking and intensity mapping cross-correlations.  in this chapter, we examine some of the principal science motivations foracquiring multiwavelength data to match that from the extragalactic ska hisurveys, and review the currently planned capacity to achieve this (eg. lsst,euclid, w-first, spica, alma, and 4most).

1506.04473	hi science with the square kilometre array	the square kilometre array (ska) will be a formidable instrument for thedetailed study of neutral hydrogen (hi) in external galaxies and in our owngalaxy and local group. the sensitivity of the ska, its wide receiver bands,and the relative freedom from radio frequency interference at the ska siteswill allow the imaging of substantial number of high-redshift galaxies in hifor the first time. it will also allow imaging of galaxies throughout the localvolume at resolutions of &lt;100 pc and detailed investigations of galaxy disksand the transition between disks, halos and the intergalactic medium (igm) inthe milky way and external galaxies. together with deep optical andmillimetre/sub-mm imaging, this will have a profound effect on ourunderstanding of the formation, growth and subsequent evolution of galaxies indifferent environments. this paper provides an introductory text to a series ofnine science papers describing the impact of the ska in the field of hi andgalaxy evolution. we propose a nested set of surveys with phase 1 of the skawhich will help tackle much of the exciting science described. longer commensalsurveys are discussed, including an ultra-deep survey which should permit thedetection of galaxies at z=2, when the universe was a quarter of its currentage. the full ska will allow more detailed imaging of even more distantgalaxies, and allow cosmological and evolutionary parameters to be measuredwith exquisite precision.

1510.07785	extended tully-fisher relations using hi stacking	we present a new technique for the statistical evaluation of the tully-fisherrelation (tfr) using spectral line stacking. this technique has the potentialto extend tfr observations to lower masses and higher redshifts than possiblethrough a galaxy-by-galaxy analysis. it further avoids the need for individualgalaxy inclination measurements.  to quantify the properties of stacked hi emission lines, we consider asimplistic model of galactic disks with analytically expressible line profiles.using this model, we compare the widths of stacked profiles with those ofindividual galaxies. we then follow the same procedure using more realisticmock galaxies drawn from the s3-sax model (a derivative of the millenniumsimulation). remarkably, when stacking the apparent hi lines of galaxies withsimilar absolute magnitude and random inclinations, the width of the stack isvery similar to the width of the deprojected (= corrected for inclination) anddedispersed (= after removal of velocity dispersion) input lines. therefore,the ratio between the widths of the stack and the deprojected/dedispersed inputlines is approximately constant - about 0.93 - with very little dependence onthe gas dispersion, galaxy mass, galaxy morphology, and shape of the rotationcurve.  finally, we apply our technique to construct a stacked tfr using hipass datawhich already has a well defined tfr based on individual detections. we obtaina b-band tfr with a slope of $-8.5\pm0.4$ and a k-band relation with a slope of$-11.7\pm0.6$ for the hipass data set which is consistent with the existingresults.

1511.04849	2mtf v. cosmography, beta, and the residual bulk flow	using the tully-fisher relation, we derive peculiar velocities for the 2masstully-fisher survey and describe the velocity field of the nearby universe. weuse adaptive kernel smoothing to map the velocity field, and compare it toreconstructions based on the redshift space galaxy distributions of the 2massredshift survey (2mrs) and the iras point source catalog redshift survey(pscz). with a standard $\chi^2$ minimization fit to the models, we find thatthe pscz model provides a better fit to the 2mtf velocity field data than doesthe 2mrs model, and provides a value of $\beta$ in greater agreement withliterature values. however, when we subtract away the monopole deviation in thevelocity zeropoint between data and model, the 2mrs model also produces a valueof $\beta$ in agreement with literature values. we also calculate the `residualbulk flow': the component of the bulk flow not accounted for by the models.this is $\sim 250$ km/s when performing the standard fit, but drops to $\sim150$ km/s for both models when the aforementioned monopole offset between dataand models is removed. this smaller number is more in line with theoreticalexpectations, and suggests that the models largely account for the majorstructures in the nearby universe responsible for the bulk velocity.

astro-ph;0406278	where are the high velocity clouds in local group analogs?	high-velocity clouds (hvcs) are clouds of hi seen around the milky way withvelocities inconsistent with galactic rotation, have unknown distances andmasses and controversial origins. one possibility is that hvcs are associatedwith the small dark matter halos seen in models of galaxy formation anddistributed at distances of 150 kpc - 1 mpc. we report on our attempts todetect the analogs to such putative extragalactic clouds in three groups ofgalaxies similar to our own local group using the atnf parkes telescope andcompact array. eleven dwarf galaxies were found, but no hi clouds lacking starswere detected. using the population of compact hvcs around the milky way as atemplate, we find that our non-detection of analogs implies that they must beclustered within 160 kpc of the milky way (and other galaxies) with an averagehi mass &lt;4x10^5 m(sun) at the 95% confidence level. this is in accordance withrecent limits derived by other authors. if our groups are true analogs to thelocal group, then this makes the original blitz et al. and braun &amp; burtonpicture of hvcs residing out to 1 mpc from the milky way extremely unlikely.the total hi mass in hvcs, &lt; 10^8 m(sun), implies that there is not a largereservoir of neutral hydrogen waiting to be accreted onto the milky way. anysubstantial reservoir of baryonic matter must be mostly ionized or condensedenough as to be undetectable.

astro-ph;0412385	what do loose groups tell us about galaxy formation?	we present the results of a parkes multibeam hi survey of six loose groups ofgalaxies analogous to the local group. this survey was sensitive to hi-richobjects in these groups to below 10^7 m(sun) of hi, and was designed to searchfor low mass, gas-rich satellite galaxies and potential analogs to thehigh-velocity clouds seen around the milky way. this survey detected a total of79 hi-rich objects associated with the six groups, half of which were newdetections. while the survey identified a small number of dwarf galaxies, nostar-free hi clouds were discovered. the hi mass function of the six groupsappears to be roughly flat as is that of the local group. the cumulativevelocity distribution function (cvdf) of the hi-rich halos in the six groups isidentical to that of the local group. both of these facts imply that thesegroups are true analogs to the local group and that the local group is notunique in its lack of low-mass dwarf galaxies as compared to the predictions ofcold dark matter models of galaxy formation. this survey also constrains thedistance to and hi masses of the compact high-velocity clouds (chvcs) aroundthe milky way. the lack of chvc analog detections implies that they aredistributed within &lt;160 kpc of the milky way and have average hi masses of&lt;4x10^5 m(sun). the spatial distribution of chvcs is consistent with thepredictions of simulations for dark matter halos. furthermore the cvdf of localgroup galaxies plus chvcs matches the predicted cvdf of cold dark mattersimulations of galaxy formation. this provides circumstantial evidence thatchvcs may be associated with low-mass dark matter halos.

astro-ph;0510555	evolution of damped lyman alpha kinematics and the effect of spatial  resolution on 21-cm measurements	we have investigated the effect of spatial resolution on determiningpencil-beam like velocity widths and column densities in galaxies. three 21-cmdatasets are used, the hipass galaxy catalogue, a subset of hipass galaxieswith atca maps and a high-resolution image of the lmc. velocity widths measuredfrom 21-cm emission in local galaxies are compared with those measured inintermediate redshift damped lyman alpha (dla) absorbers. we conclude thatspatial resolution has a severe effect on measuring pencil-beam like velocitywidths in galaxies. spatial smoothing by a factor of 240 is shown to increasethe median velocity width by a factor of two. thus any difference betweenvelocity widths measured from global profiles or low spatial resolution 21-cmmaps at z=0 and dlas at z&gt;1 cannot unambiguously be attributed to galaxyevolution. the effect on column density measurements is less severe and thevalues of dn/dz from local low-resolution 21-cm measurements are expected to beoverestimated by only ~10 per cent.

astro-ph;0603437	the properties of extragalactic radio sources selected at 20 ghz	we present some first results on the variability, polarization and generalproperties of radio sources selected in a blind survey at 20 ghz, the highestfrequency at which a sensitive radio survey has been carried out over a largearea of sky. sources with flux densities above 100 mjy in the at20g pilotsurvey at declination -60 to -70 were observed at up to three epochs during2002-4, including near-simultaneous measurements at 5, 8 and 18 ghz in 2003. ofthe 173 sources detected, 65% are candidate qsos, bl lac objects or blazars,20% galaxies and 15% faint (b &gt; 22 mag) optical objects or blank fields.  on a 1-2 year timescale, the general level of variability at 20 ghz appearsto be low. for the 108 sources with good-quality measurements in both 2003 and2004, the median variability index at 20 ghz was 6.9% and only five sourcesvaried by more than 30% in flux density.  most sources in our sample show low levels of linear polarization (typically1-5%), with a median fractional polarization of 2.3% at 20 ghz. there is atrend for fainter sources to show higher fractional polarization.  at least 40% of sources selected at 20ghz have strong spectral curvature overthe frequency range 1-20 ghz. we use a radio `two-colour diagram' tocharacterize the radio spectra of our sample, and confirm that the radio-sourcepopulation at 20 ghz (which is also the foreground point-source population forcmb anisotropy experiments like wmap and planck) cannot be reliably predictedby extrapolating the results of surveys at lower frequencies. as a result,direct selection at 20 ghz appears to be a more efficient way of identifying 90ghz phase calibrators for alma than the currently-proposed technique ofextrapolation from all-sky surveys at 1-5 ghz.

astro-ph;0606356	spitzer survey of the large magellanic cloud, surveying the agents of a  galaxy's evolution (sage) i: overview and initial results	we are performing a uniform and unbiased, ~7x7 degrees imaging survey of thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc), using the irac and mips instruments on board thespitzer space telescope in order to survey the agents of a galaxy's evolution(sage), the interstellar medium (ism) and stars in the lmc. the detection ofdiffuse ism with column densities &gt;1.2x10^21 h cm^-2 permits detailed studiesof dust processes in the ism. sage's point source sensitivity enables acomplete census of newly formed stars with masses &gt;3 solar masses that willdetermine the current star formation rate in the lmc. sage's detection ofevolved stars with mass loss rates &gt;1x10^-8 solar masses per year will quantifythe rate at which evolved stars inject mass into the ism of the lmc. theobserving strategy includes two epochs in 2005, separated by three months, thatboth mitigate instrumental artifacts and constrain source variability. the sagedata are non-proprietary. the data processing includes irac and mips pipelinesand a database for mining the point source catalogs, which will be released tothe community in support of spitzer proposal cycles 4 and 5. we present initialresults on the epoch 1 data with a special focus on the n79 and n83 region. thesage epoch 1 point source catalog has ~4 million sources. the point sourcecounts are highest for the irac 3.6 microns band and decrease dramaticallytowards longer wavelengths consistent with the fact that stars dominate thepoint source catalogs and that the dusty objects, e.g. young stellar objectsand dusty evolved stars that detected at the longer wavelengths, are rare incomparison. we outline a strategy for identifying foreground mw stars, that maycomprise as much as 18% of the source list, and background galaxies, that maycomprise ~12% of the source list.

astro-ph;0608561	the spitzer survey of the small magellanic cloud: s3mc imaging and  photometry in the mid- and far-infrared wavebands	we present the initial results from the spitzer survey of the smallmagellanic cloud (s3mc), which imaged the star-forming body of the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) in all seven mips and irac wavebands. we find that thef_8/f_24 ratio (an estimate of pah abundance) has large spatial variations andtakes a wide range of values that are unrelated to metallicity butanticorrelated with 24 um brightness and f_24/f_70 ratio. this suggests thatphotodestruction is primarily responsible for the low abundance of pahsobserved in star-forming low-metallicity galaxies. we use the s3mc images tocompile a photometric catalog of ~400,000 mid- and far-infrared point sourcesin the smc. the sources detected at the longest wavelengths fall into four maincategories: 1) bright 5.8 um sources with very faint optical counterparts andvery red mid-infrared colors ([5.8]-[8.0]&gt;1.2), which we identify as ysos. 2)bright mid-infrared sources with mildly red colors (0.16&lt;[5.8]-[8.0]&lt;0.6),identified as carbon stars. 3) bright mid-infrared sources with neutral colorsand bright optical counterparts, corresponding to oxygen-rich evolved stars.and, 4) unreddened early b stars (b3 to o9) with a large 24 um excess. thisexcess is reminiscent of debris disks, and is detected in only a small fractionof these stars (&lt;5%). the majority of the brightest infrared point sources inthe smc fall into groups one to three. we use this photometric information toproduce a catalog of 282 bright ysos in the smc with a very low level ofcontamination (~7%).

astro-ph;0608633	the weak clustering of gas-rich galaxies	we examine the clustering properties of hi-selected galaxies through ananalysis of the hi parkes all-sky survey catalogue (hicat) two-pointcorrelation function. various sub-samples are extracted from this catalogue tostudy the overall clustering of hi-rich galaxies and its dependence onluminosity, hi gas mass and rotational velocity. these samples cover the entiresouthern sky dec &lt; 0 deg, containing up to 4,174 galaxies over the radialvelocity range 300-12,700 km/s. a scale length of r_0 = 3.45 +/- 0.25 mpc/h andslope of gamma = 1.47 +/- 0.08 is obtained for the hi-rich galaxy real-spacecorrelation function, making gas-rich galaxies among the most weakly clusteredobjects known. hi-selected galaxies also exhibit weaker clustering thanoptically selected galaxies of comparable luminosities. good agreement is foundbetween our results and those of synthetic hi-rich galaxy catalogues generatedfrom the millennium run cdm simulation. bisecting hicat using differentparameter cuts, clustering is found to depend most strongly on rotationalvelocity and luminosity, while the dependency on hi mass is marginal. splittingthe sample around v_rot = 108 km/s, a scale length of r_0 = 2.86 +/- 0.46 mpc/his found for galaxies with low rotational velocities compared to r_0 = 3.96 +/-0.33 mpc/h for the high rotational velocity sample.

astro-ph;9512043	neutral hydrogen in the ringed barred galaxies ngc 1433 and ngc 6300	we have made observations of the \ion{h}{1} in the southern ringed barredspiral galaxies ngc~1433 and ngc~6300 with the australia telescope compactarray (atca), the main goal being to test the resonance theory for the originof these rings. ngc~1433 is the prototypical ringed barred spiral, and displaysdistinct \ion{h}{1}~counterparts to its nuclear ring, inner ring, outerpseudoring, and plume-like features. the $l_{4}$ and $l_{5}$ regions atcorotation, as well as the bar itself, are relatively devoid of neutral atomichydrogen. by associating the inner ring of ngc~1433 with the inner secondharmonic resonance, and its outer pseudoring with the outer lindblad resonance,we are able to infer a bar pattern speed for ngc~1433 of$26\pm5$~km~s$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-1}$. by way of contrast, ngc~6300 possesses a muchmore extended \ion{h}{1}~disk than ngc~1433. there is a gas ring underlying theinner pseudoring, but it is both broader and slightly larger in diameter thanthe optical feature. by again linking this inner ring feature to the innersecond harmonic resonance, we derive a bar pattern speed for ngc~6300 of$27\pm8$~km~s$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-1}$, but in this case, neither the outer pseudoringnor the nuclear ring predicted by the resonance-ring theory can be identifiedin ngc~6300. although it may be the case that the ring in ngc~6300 is notrelated to a resonance with the bar at all, we postulate instead that ngc~6300is merely a less well-developed example of a resonance-ring galaxy than isngc~1433.

astro-ph;9806261	hi and dark matter in the windy starburst dwarf galaxy ngc1705	we present 21cm hi line observations of the blue compact dwarf galaxyngc1705. previous optical observations show a strong outflow powered by anongoing starburst dominating the hii morphology and kinematics. in contrast,most of the hi lies in a rotating disk. an extraplanar hi spur accounts for ~8% of the total hi mass, and is possibly associated with the hii outflow. theinferred mass loss rate out of the galaxy's core is significant ~ 0.2 - 2m_sun/yr, but does not dominate the hi dynamics. mass model fits to therotation curve show that the dark matter (dm) halo is dominant at nearly allradii and has a central density \rho_0 \approx 0.1 m_sun/pc^3: ten times higherthan typically found in dwarf irregular galaxies, but similar to the only othermass-modelled blue compact dwarf, ngc2915. this large difference stronglyindicates that there is little evolution between dwarf irregular and bluecompact dwarf types. instead, dominant dm halos may regulate the morphology ofdwarf galaxies by setting the critical surface density for disk star formation.neither our data nor catalogue searches reveal any likely external trigger tothe starburst in ngc1705.

astro-ph;9808189	the multi-phase medium in the interstellar complex n44	we have obtained high-resolution hi observations of n44, one of the largesthii complexes in the large magellanic cloud. the distribution and internalmotions of the hi gas show dynamic effects of fast stellar winds and supernovablasts. numerous hi holes are detected, with the most prominent twocorresponding to the optically identified superbubbles shell 1 and shell 2. thehi gas associated with shell 1 shows an expansion pattern similar to that ofthe ionized gas shell, but the mass and kinetic energy of the hi shell are 3--7times those of the ionized gas shell. the total kinetic energy of the neutraland ionized gas of shell 1 is still more than a factor of 5 lower than expectedin a pressure-driven superbubble. it is possible that the central obassociation was formed in a molecular cloud and a visible superbubble was notfully developed until the ambient molecular gas had been dissociated andcleared away. this hypothesis is supported by the existence of a molecularcloud toward n44 and the fact that the apparent dynamic age of the superbubbleshell 1 is much shorter than the age of its ob association lh47. accelerated higas is detected at the supernova remnant 0523-679. the mass and kinetic energyin the associated hi gas are also much higher than those in the ionized gas of0523-679. studies of interstellar gas dynamics using ionized gas alone areclearly inadequate; neutral gas components must be included.
