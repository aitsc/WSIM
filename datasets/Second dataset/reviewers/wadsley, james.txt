0909.1321	the nature of hi absorbers in grb afterglows: clues from hydrodynamic  simulations	in recent work, we have shown that it is possible to link quantitatively manyaspects of damped lyman alpha (dla) absorbers in the spectra of quasars to highresolution simulations of galaxy formation. using runs from the same series ofhydrodynamic numerical studies, we consider the expected properties of lymanalpha absorbers seen in the spectra of high redshift (z&gt;2) gamma ray burstafterglows (grb-dlas). if grbs are associated with the death of massive stars,their afterglows provide insights into otherwise unprobed regions ofprotogalactic objects, but detailed physical interpretations are currentlyembryonic.  we find that median impact parameters (measured from the potential minimum)are approximately 1 kpc for grbs compared with 4 kpc for qso-dlas. however, anequally important difference is that grb-dlas are predominantly associated withhalos of mass 10^10&lt;m_vir/m_sol&lt;10^12, an order of magnitude larger than thehosts of qso-dlas. accordingly, there are differences in the stellar propertiesof hosts.  our simulations accurately predict the form of the grb-dla hi column densitydistribution, producing quantitative agreement for n_hi&gt;10^19 cm^-2, but theysomewhat underpredict the incidence of low column densities n_hi&lt;10^19 cm^-2.line-of-sight neutral gas metallicities predicted by our simulations (10^-2 &lt;z/z_sol &lt; 1) are consistent with the modest observational constraints. becauseof large internal dispersions in gas metallicities, this agreement is notsignificantly compromised by imposing a cut-off on the metallicity of starsable to launch grbs (z_star&lt;z_sol/3), confounding claims that the observedmetallicity of grb-dlas poses a challenge to current grb models.

0909.2044	a numerical study of brown dwarf formation via encounters of  protostellar disks	the formation of brown dwarfs (bds) due to the fragmentation of proto-stellardisks undergoing pairwise encounters was investigated. high resolution allowedthe use of realistic initial disk models where both the vertical structure andthe local jeans mass were resolved. the results show that objects with massesranging from giant planets to low mass stars can form during such encountersfrom initially stable disks. the parameter space of initial spin-orbitorientations and the azimuthal angles for each disk was explored. an upperlimit on the initial toomre q value of ~2 was found for fragmentation to occur.depending on the initial configuration, shocks, tidal-tail structures and massinflows were responsible for the condensation of disk gas. retrograde diskswere generally more likely to fragment. when the interaction timescale wassignificantly shorter than the disks' dynamical timescales, the proto-stellardisks tended to be truncated without forming objects.  the newly-formed objects had masses ranging from 0.9 to 127 jupiter masses,with the majority in the bd regime. they often resided in star-bd multiples andin some cases also formed hierarchical orbiting systems. most of them had largeangular momenta and highly flattened, disk-like shapes. the objects had radiiranging from 0.1 to 10 au. the disk gas was assumed to be locally isothermal,appropriate for the short cooling times in extended proto-stellar disks, butnot for condensed objects. an additional case with explicit cooling thatreduced to zero for optically thick gas was simulated to test the extremes ofcooling effectiveness and it was still possible to form objects in this case.detailed radiative transfer is expected to lengthen the internal evolutiontimescale for these objects, but not to alter our basic results.

0910.5956	the enrichment of the intergalactic medium with adiabatic feedback i:  metal cooling and metal diffusion	a study of the igm metal enrichment using a series of sph simulations ispresented, employing metal cooling and turbulent diffusion of metals andthermal energy. an adiabatic feedback mechanism was adopted where gas coolingwas prevented to generate galactic winds without explicit wind particles. thesimulations produced a cosmic star formation history (sfh) that is broadlyconsistent with observations until z $\sim$ 0.5, and a steady evolution of theuniversal neutral hydrogen fraction ($\omega_{\rm h i}$). at z=0, about 40% ofthe baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim), but most metals(80%-90%) are locked in stars. at higher z the proportion of metals in the igmis higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. the igm metals primarilyreside in the whim throughout cosmic history. the metallicity evolution of thegas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuseigm is under enriched at z $\sim$ 2.5. galactic winds most efficiently enrichthe igm for halos in the intermediate mass range $10^{10}$m$_{\sun}$ -$10^{11}$ m$_{\sun}$. at the low mass end gas is prevented from accreting ontohalos and has very low metallicities. at the high mass end, the fraction ofhalo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar massfraction of the galaxies. this is likely because of the decrease in starformation activity and in wind escape efficiency. metals enhance cooling whichallows whim gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. metaldiffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the igm metal contentin favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas. diffusionsignificantly increases the amount of gas with low metallicities and changesthe density-metallicity relation.

0911.2237	at the heart of the matter: the origin of bulgeless dwarf galaxies and  dark matter cores	for almost two decades the properties of "dwarf" galaxies have challenged thecold dark matter (cdm) paradigm of galaxy formation. most observed dwarfgalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive dm halo witha near constant-density core. yet, models based on the cdm scenario invariablyform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar "bulges" and steep central dmprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and dm sink to the center of galaxiesthrough accretion and repeated mergers. processes that decrease the centraldensity of cdm halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theorywith observations of present day dwarfs. this failure is potentiallycatastrophic for the cdm model, possibly requiring a different dm particlecandidate. this letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a lambda$cdmframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallowcentral dm profile, are formed. this is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneousinterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosionswhich remove low angular momentum gas. this inhibits the formation of bulgesand decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the centralkiloparsec. realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome ofgalaxy formation in the cdm scenario.

1002.3555	consequences of cosmic microwave background-regulated star formation	it has been hypothesized that the cosmic microwave background (cmb) providesa temperature floor for collapsing protostars that can regulate the process ofstar formation and result in a top-heavy initial mass function at highmetallicity and high redshift. we examine whether this hypothesis has anytestable observational consequences. first we determine, using a set ofhydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations, that the cmb temperature floor wouldhave influenced the majority of stars formed at redshifts between z=3 and 6,and probably even to higher redshift. five signatures of cmb-regulated starformation are: (1) a higher supernova rate than currently predicted at highredshift; (2) a systematic discrepancy between direct and indirect measurementsof the high redshift star formation rate; (3) a lack of surviving globularclusters that formed at high metallicity and high redshift; (4) a more rapidrise in the metallicity of cosmic gas than is predicted by current simulations;and (5) an enhancement in the abundances of alpha elements such as o and mg atmetallicities -2 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.5. observations are not presently able to eitherconfirm or rule out the presence of these signatures. however, if correct, thetop-heavy imf of high-redshift high-metallicity globular clusters could providean explanation for the observed bimodality of their metallicity distribution.

1004.3789	the dual origin of stellar halos ii: chemical abundances as tracers of  formation history	fully cosmological, high resolution n-body + sph simulations are used toinvestigate the chemical abundance trends of stars in simulated stellar halosas a function of their origin. these simulations employ a physically motivatedsupernova feedback recipe, as well as metal enrichment, metal cooling and metaldiffusion. as presented in an earlier paper, the simulated galaxies in thisstudy are surrounded by stellar halos whose inner regions contain both starsaccreted from satellite galaxies and stars formed in situ in the centralregions of the main galaxies and later displaced by mergers into their innerhalos. the abundance patterns ([fe/h] and [o/fe]) of halo stars located within10 kpc of a solar-like observer are analyzed. we find that for galaxies whichhave not experienced a recent major merger, in situ stars at the high [fe/h]end of the metallicity distribution function are more [alpha/fe]-rich thanaccreted stars at similar [fe/h]. this dichotomy in the [o/fe] of halo stars ata given [fe/h] results from the different potential wells within which in situand accreted halo stars form. these results qualitatively match recentobservations of local milky way halo stars. it may thus be possible forobservers to uncover the relative contribution of different physical processesto the formation of stellar halos by observing such trends in the halopopulations of the milky way, and other local l* galaxies.

1005.1681	star formation and feedback in smoothed particle hydrodynamic  simulations ii: resolution effects	we examine the effect of mass and force resolution on a specific starformation (sf) recipe using a set of n-body/smooth particle hydrodynamicsimulations of isolated galaxies. our simulations span halo masses from 10^9 to10^13 solar masses, more than four orders of magnitude in mass resolution, andtwo orders of magnitude in the gravitational softening length, epsilon,representing the force resolution. we examine the total global star formationrate, the star formation history, and the quantity of stellar feedback andcompare the disk structure of the galaxies. based on our analysis, we recommendusing at least 10^4 particles each for the dark matter and gas component and aforce resolution of epsilon approximately equal to 10^-3 r_vir when studyingglobal sf and feedback. when the spatial distribution of stars is important,the number of gas and dark matter particles must be increased to at least 10^5of each. low mass resolution simulations with fixed softening lengths showparticularly weak stellar disks due to two-body heating. while decreasingspatial resolution in low mass resolution simulations limits two-body effects,density and potential gradients cannot be sustained. regardless of thesoftening, low-mass resolution simulations contain fewer high density regionswhere sf may occur. galaxies of approximately 10^10 solar masses display uniquesensitivity to both mass and force resolution. this mass of galaxy has ashallow potential and is on the verge of forming a disk. the combination ofthese factors give this galaxy the potential for strong gas outflows driven bysupernova feedback and make it particularly sensitive to any changes to thesimulation parameters.

1006.1659	misaligned angular momentum in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations:  warps, outer discs, and thick discs	we present a detailed analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolutionfully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions ofdiscs and their relevance for the disc formation process. specifically, wefocus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outerdisc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and thesurrounding hot gaseous halo. as the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centreof the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. by the time thefresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum iscompletely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. if the spin of the hotgas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misalignedouter disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. the inner and outercomponents are misaligned with each other because they respond differently toinfalling substructure and accretion. the warped disc feeds the main gas discdue to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation inthe warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. we show that observations ofresolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe couldprovide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectlyreveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.

1009.5997	the genesis of the milky way's thick disk via stellar migration	the separation of the milky way disk into a thin and thick component issupported by differences in the spatial, kinematic and metallicitydistributions of their stars. these differences have led to the view that thethick disk formed early via a cataclysmic event and constitutes fossil evidenceof the hierarchical growth of the milky way. we show here, using n-bodysimulations, how a double-exponential vertical structure, with stellarpopulations displaying similar dichotomies can arise purely through internalevolution. in this picture, stars migrate radially, while retaining nearlycircular orbits, as described by sellwood &amp; binney (2002). as stars moveoutwards they populate a thickened component. such stars found at the presenttime in the solar neighborhood formed early in the disk's history at smallerradii where stars are more metal-poor and alpha-enhanced, leading to theproperties observed for thick disk stars. classifying stars as members of thethin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparentseparation in the other property as observed. this scenario is supported by thesdss observation that stars in the transition region do not show anycorrelation between rotational velocity and metallicity. the good qualitativeagreement between our simulation and observations in the milky way hint thatthe thick disk may be a ubiquitous galaxy feature generated by stellarmigration. nonetheless, we cannot exclude that some fraction of the thick diskis a fossil of a past more violent history, nor can this scenario explain thickdisks in all galaxies.

1011.0432	interpreting the evolution of the size - luminosity relation for disk  galaxies from redshift 1 to the present	a sample of very high resolution cosmological disk galaxy simulations is usedto investigate the evolution of galaxy disk sizes back to redshift 1 within thelambda cdm cosmology. artificial images in the rest frame b band are generated,allowing for a measurement of disk scale lengths using surface brightnessprofiles as observations would, and avoiding any assumption that light mustfollow mass as previous models have assumed. we demonstrate that thesesimulated disks are an excellent match to the observed magnitude - sizerelation for both local disks, and for disks at z=1 in the magnitude/mass rangeof overlap. we disentangle the evolution seen in the population as a whole fromthe evolution of individual disk galaxies. in agreement with observations, oursimulated disks undergo roughly 1.5 magnitudes/arcsec^2 of surface brightnessdimming since z=1. we find evidence that evolution in the magnitude - sizeplane varies by mass, such that galaxies with m* &gt; 10^9 m_sun undergo moreevolution in size than luminosity, while dwarf galaxies tend to evolvepotentially more in luminosity. the disks grow in such a way as to stay onroughly the same stellar mass - size relation with time. finally, due to anevolving stellar mass - sfr relation, a galaxy at a given stellar mass (orsize) at z=1 will reside in a more massive halo and have a higher sfr, and thusa higher luminosity, than a counterpart of the same stellar mass at z=0.

1012.2128	observing the end of cold flow accretion using halo absorption systems	we use cosmological sph simulations to study the cool, accreted gas in twomilky way-size galaxies through cosmic time to z=0. we find that gas frommergers and cold flow accretion results in significant amounts of cool gas ingalaxy halos. this cool circum-galactic component drops precipitously once thegalaxies cross the critical mass to form stable shocks, mvir = msh ~ 10^12msun. before reaching msh, the galaxies experience cold mode accretion (t&lt;10^5k) and show moderately high covering fractions in accreted gas: f_c ~ 30-50%for r&lt;50 co-moving kpc and n_hi&gt;10^16 cm^-2. these values are considerablylower than observed covering fractions, suggesting that outflowing gas (notincluded here) is important in simulating galaxies with realistic gaseoushalos. within ~500 myr of crossing the msh threshold, each galaxy transitionsto hot mode gas accretion, and f_c drops to ~5%. the sharp transition incovering fraction is primarily a function of halo mass, not redshift. thissignature should be detectable in absorption system studies that targetgalaxies of varying host mass, and may provide a direct observational tracer ofthe transition from cold flow accretion to hot mode accretion in galaxies.

1103.4388	orbiting circum-galactic gas as a signature of cosmological accretion	we use cosmological sph simulations to study the kinematic signatures of coolgas accretion onto a pair of well-resolved galaxy halos. cold-flow streams andgas-rich mergers produce a circum-galactic component of cool gas that generallyorbits with high angular momentum about the galaxy halo before falling in tobuild the disk. this signature of cosmological accretion should be observableusing background-object absorption line studies as features that are offsetfrom the galaxy's systemic velocity by ~100 km/s. accreted gas typicallyco-rotates with the central disk in the form of a warped, extended cold flowdisk, such that the observed velocity offset is in the same direction as galaxyrotation, appearing in sight lines that avoid the galactic poles. thisprediction provides a means to observationally distinguish accreted gas fromoutflow gas: the accreted gas will show large one-sided velocity offsets inabsorption line studies while radial/bi-conical outflows will not (exceptpossibly in special polar projections). this rotation signature has alreadybeen seen in studies of intermediate redshift galaxy-absorber pairs; we suggestthat these observations may be among the first to provide indirectobservational evidence for cold accretion onto galactic halos. cold mode halogas typically has ~3-5 times more specific angular momentum than the darkmatter. the associated cold mode disk configurations are likely related toextended hi/xuv disks seen around galaxies in the local universe. the fractionof galaxies with extended cold flow disks and associated offset absorption-linegas should decrease around bright galaxies at low redshift, as cold modeaccretion dies out.

1104.3858	the first massive black hole seeds and their hosts	we investigate the formation of the first massive black holes in highredshift galaxies, with the goal of providing insights to which galaxies do ordo not host massive black holes. we adopt a novel approach to forming seedblack holes in galaxy halos in cosmological sph+n-body simulations. theformation of massive black hole seeds is dictated directly by the local gasdensity, temperature, and metallicity, and motivated by physical models ofmassive black hole formation. we explore seed black hole populations as afunction of halo mass and redshift, and examine how varying the efficiency ofmassive black hole seed formation affects the relationship between black holesand their hosts. seed black holes tend to form in halos with mass between 10^7and 10^9 msun, and the formation rate is suppressed around z = 5 due to thediffusion of metals throughout the intergalactic medium. we find that the timeof massive black hole formation and the occupation fraction of black holes area function of the host halo mass. by z = 5, halos with mass m_halo &gt; 3 x 10^9msun host massive black holes regardless of the efficiency of seed formation,while the occupation fraction for smaller halos increases with black holeformation efficiency. our simulations explain why massive black holes are foundin some bulgeless and dwarf galaxies, but we also predict that their occurrencebecomes rarer and rarer in low-mass systems.

1109.3193	probing the shape and history of the milky way halo with orbital  spectral analysis	the phase space coordinates of individual halo stars obtained by galacticsurveys enable the computation of their full 3-dimensional orbits. spectralanalysis of halo orbits can be used to construct "frequency maps" which providea compact representation of the 6-dimensional phase space distributionfunction. frequency maps identify important major orbit families, and theorbital abundances reflect the shape and orientation of the dark matter halorelative to the disk. we apply spectral analysis to halo orbits in a series ofcontrolled simulations of disk galaxies. although the shape of the simulatedhalo varies with radius, frequency maps of local samples of halo orbitsconfined to the inner halo contain most of the information about the globalshape of the halo and its major orbit families. quiescent or adiabatic diskformation results in significant trapping of halo orbits in resonant orbitfamilies (i.e. orbits with commensurable frequencies). if a good estimate ofthe galactic potential in the inner halo (within ~50kpc) is available, theappearance of strong, stable resonances in frequency maps of halo orbits willallow us to determine the degree of resonant trapping induced by the diskpotential. the locations and strengths of these resonant families aredetermined both by the global shape of the halo and its distribution function.identification of such resonances in the milky way's stellar halo wouldtherefore provide evidence of an extended period of adiabatic disk growth. ifthe galactic potential is not known exactly, a measure of the diffusion rate oflarge sample of 10^4 halo orbits can help distinguish between the truepotential and an incorrect potential. the orbital spectral analysis methodsdescribed in this paper provide a strong complementarity to existing methodsfor constraining the potential of the milky way halo and its stellardistribution function (abridged).

1111.5620	halo expansion in cosmological hydro simulations: towards a baryonic  solution of the cusp/core problem in massive spirals	a clear prediction of the cold dark matter model is the existence of cuspydark matter halo density profiles on all mass scales. this is not in agreementwith the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies, challenging on smallscales the otherwise successful cdm paradigm. in this work we employ highresolution cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations to study the effects ofdissipative processes on the inner distribution of dark matter in milky-waylike objects (m~1e12 msun). our simulations include supernova feedback, and theeffects of the radiation pressure of massive stars before they explode assupernovae. the increased stellar feedback results in the expansion of the darkmatter halo instead of contraction with respect to n-body simulations. baryonsare able to erase the dark matter cuspy distribution creating a flat, cored,dark matter density profile in the central several kpc of a massive milky-waylike halo. the profile is well fit by a burkert profile, with fittingparameters consistent with the observations. in addition, we obtain flatrotation curves as well as extended, exponential stellar disk profiles. whilethe stellar disk we obtain is still partially too thick to resemble the mw thindisk, this pilot study shows that there is enough energy available in thebaryonic component to alter the dark matter distribution even in massive discgalaxies, providing a possible solution to the long standing problem of cuspsvs. cores.

1112.1698	magicc haloes: confronting simulations with observations of the  circumgalactic medium at z=0	we explore the circumgalactic medium (cgm) of two simulated star-forminggalaxies with luminosities l ~ 0.1 and 1 l* generated using the smooth particlehydrodynamic code gasoline. these simulations are part of the making galaxiesin a cosmological context (magicc) program in which the stellar feedback istuned to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. for comparison, eachgalaxy was also simulated using a 'lower feedback' (lf) model which hasstrength comparable to other implementations in the literature. the 'magiccfeedback' (mf) model has a higher incidence of massive stars and anapproximately two times higher energy input per supernova. apart from thelow-mass halo using lf, each galaxy exhibits a metal-enriched cgm that extendsto approximately the virial radius. a significant fraction of this gas has beenheated in supernova explosions in the disc and subsequently ejected into thecgm where it is predicted to give rise to substantial o vi absorption. thesimulations do not yet address the question of what happens to the o vi whenthe galaxies stop forming stars. our models also predict a reservoir of cool hi clouds that show strong ly\alpha absorption to several hundred kpc. comparingthese models to recent surveys with the hubble space telescope, we find thatonly the mf models have sufficient o vi and h i gas in the cgm to reproduce theobserved distributions. in separate analyses, these same mf models also showbetter agreement with other galaxy observables (e.g. rotation curves, surfacebrightness profiles and h i gas distribution). we infer that the cgm is thedominant reservoir of baryons for galaxy haloes.

0710.5523	beyond inside-out growth: formation and evolution of disk outskirts	we have performed a high mass and force resolution simulation of an idealizedgalaxy forming from dissipational collapse of gas embedded in a spherical darkmatter halo. the simulation includes star formation and effects of stellarfeedback. in our simulation a stellar disk forms with a surface density profileconsisting of an inner exponential breaking to a steeper outer exponential. thebreak forms early on and persists throughout the evolution, moving outward asmore gas is able to cool and add mass to the disk. the parameters of the breakare in excellent agreement with observations. the break corresponds with arapid drop in the star formation rate associated with a drop in the cooled gassurface density, but the outer exponential is populated by stars that werescattered outward on nearly circular orbits from the inner disk by spiral arms.the resulting profile and its associated break are therefore a consequence ofthe interplay between a radial star formation cutoff and redistribution ofstellar mass by secular processes. a consequence of such evolution is a sharpchange in the radial mean stellar age profile at the break radius.

(2010). only about one third of all the gaswithin r_vir is outflowing. the fraction of sightlines within one virial radiusthat intercept optically thick material is 27%, in agreement with recentobservations by rudie et al. (2012). such optically thick absorption is shownto trace inflowing "cold" streams that penetrate deep inside the virial radius.the streams, enriched to metallicities above 0.01 solar, give origin to strong(log n &gt; 13) cii absorption with a covering factor of 22% within r_vir and 10%within 2 r_vir. galactic outflows do not cause any substantial suppression ofthe cold accretion mode. the central galaxy is surrounded by a large ovi halo,with a typical column density log n&gt;14 and a near unity covering factormaintained all the way out to 150 kpc. this matches the trends recentlyobserved in star-forming galaxies at low redshift by tumlinson et al. (2011).our zoom-in simulations of this single system appear to reproducequantitatively the complex baryonic processes that determine the exchange ofmatter, energy, and metals between galaxies and their surroundings.

1207.0007	baryons matter: why luminous satellite galaxies have reduced central  masses	using high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of milkyway-massed disk galaxies, we demonstrate that supernovae feedback and tidalstripping lower the central masses of bright (-15 &lt; m_v &lt; -8) satellitegalaxies. these simulations resolve high density regions, comparable to giantmolecular clouds, where stars form. this resolution allows us to adopt aprescription for h_2 formation and destruction that ties star formation to thepresence of shielded, molecular gas. before infall, supernova feedback from theclumpy, bursty star formation captured by this physically motivated model leadsto reduced dark matter (dm) densities and shallower inner density profiles inthe massive satellite progenitors (mvir &gt; 10^9 msun, mstar &gt; 10^7 msun)compared to dm-only simulations. the progenitors of the lower mass satellitesare unable to maintain bursty star formation histories, due to both heating atreionization and gas loss from initial star forming events, preserving thesteep inner density profile predicted by dm-only simulations. after infall,tidal stripping acts to further reduce the central densities of the luminoussatellites, particularly those that enter with cored dark matter halos,increasing the discrepancy in the central masses predicted by baryon+dm anddm-only simulations. we show that dm-only simulations, which neglect thebaryonic effects described in this work, produce denser satellites with largercentral velocities. we provide a simple correction to the central dm masspredicted for satellites by dm-only simulations. we conclude that dm-onlysimulations should be used with great caution when interpreting kinematicobservations of the milky way's dwarf satellites.

1207.2421	building the stellar halo through feedback in dwarf galaxies	we present a new model for the formation of stellar halos in dwarf galaxies.we demonstrate that the stars and star clusters that form naturally in theinner regions of dwarfs are expected to migrate from the gas rich, star formingcentre to join the stellar spheroid. for dwarf galaxies, this process could bethe dominant source of halo stars. the effect is caused by stellarfeedback-driven bulk motions of dense gas which, by causing potentialfluctuations in the inner regions of the halo, couple to all collisionlesscomponents. this effect has been demonstrated to generate cores in otherwisecuspy cold dark matter profiles and is particularly effective in dwarf galaxyhaloes. it can build a stellar spheroid with larger ages and lowermetallicities at greater radii without requiring an outside-in formation model.globular cluster-type star clusters can be created in the galactic ism and thenmigrate to the spheroid on 100\thinspace myr timescales. once outside the innerregions they are less susceptible to tidal disruption and are thus long lived;clusters on wider orbits may be easily unbound from the dwarf to join the haloof a larger galaxy during a merger. a simulated dwarf galaxy($\text{m}_{vir}\simeq10^{9}\text{m}_{\odot}$ at $z=5$) is used to examine thisgravitational coupling to dark matter and stars.

1207.5535	connecting the dots: analyzing synthetic observations of star-forming  clumps in molecular clouds	in this paper, we investigate the extent to which observations of molecularclouds can correctly identify and measure star-forming clumps. we produced asynthetic column density map and a synthetic spectral-line data cube from thesimulated collapse of a 5000 m$_{\odot}$ molecular cloud. by correlating theclumps found in the simulation to those found in the synthetic observations,clump masses derived from spectral-line data cubes were found to be quite closeto the true physical properties of the clumps. we also find that the `observed'clump mass function derived from the column density map is shifted by a factorof ~ 3 higher than the true clump mass function, due to projection oflow-density material along the line of sight. alves et al.

1210.3616	a parameter-space study of carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers	the merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs can lead either to a spectaculartransient, stable nuclear burning or a massive, rapidly rotating white dwarf.simulations of mergers have shown that the outcome strongly depends on whetherthe white dwarfs are similar or dissimilar in mass. in the similar-mass case,both white dwarfs merge fully and the remnant is hot throughout, while in thedissimilar case, the more massive, denser white dwarf remains cold andessentially intact, with the disrupted lower mass one wrapped around it in ahot envelope and disk. in order to determine what constitutes "similar in mass"and more generally how the properties of the merger remnant depend on the inputmasses, we simulated unsynchronized carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers for alarge range of masses using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. we find that thestructure of the merger remnant varies smoothly as a function of the ratio ofthe central densities of the two white dwarfs. a density ratio of 0.6approximately separates similar and dissimilar mass mergers. confirmingprevious work, we find that the temperatures of most merger remnants are nothigh enough to immediately ignite carbon fusion. during subsequent viscousevolution, however, the interior will likely be compressed and heated as thedisk accretes and the remnant spins down. we find from simple estimates thatthis evolution can lead to ignition for many remnants. for similar-massmergers, this would likely occur under sufficiently degenerate conditions thata thermonuclear runaway would ensue.

1211.0326	the effect of models of the interstellar media on the central mass  distribution of galaxies	we compare the central mass distribution of galaxies simulated with threedifferent models of the interstellar medium (ism) with increasing complexity:primordial (h+he) cooling down to 10^4k, additional cooling via metal lines andto lower temperatures, and molecular hydrogen (h_2) with shielding of atomicand molecular hydrogen, in addition to metal line cooling. in order to analyzethe effect of these models, we follow the evolution of four field galaxies withv_peak &lt; 120 km/s to a redshift of zero using high-resolution smoothed particlehydrodynamic simulations in a fully cosmological lcdm context. the spiralgalaxies produced in simulations with either primordial cooling or h_2 physicshave realistic, rising rotation curves. in contrast, the simulations with metalline cooling and otherwise similar feedback and star formation producedgalaxies with the peaked rotation curves typical of most previous lcdmsimulations of spiral galaxies. the less-massive bulges and non-peaked rotationcurves in the galaxies simulated with primordial cooling or h_2 are linked tochanges in the angular momentum distribution of the baryons. these galaxies hadsmaller amounts of low-angular momentum baryons because of increased gas lossfrom stellar feedback. when there is only primordial cooling, the star forminggas is hotter and the feedback-heated gas cools more slowly than when metalline cooling is included and so requires less energy to be expelled. when h_2is included, the accompanying shielding produces large amounts of clumpy, coldgas where h_2 forms. star formation in clumpy gas results in more concentratedsupernova feedback and greater efficiency of mass loss. the higher feedbackefficiency causes a decrease of low-angular momentum material.

1301.2670	what's up in the milky way? the orientation of the disc relative to the  triaxial halo	models of the sagittarius stream have consistently found that the milky waydisc is oriented such that its short axis is along the intermediate axis of thetriaxial dark matter halo. we attempt to build models of disc galaxies in suchan `intermediate-axis orientation'. we do this with three models. in the firsttwo cases we simply rigidly grow a disc in a triaxial halo such that the discends up perpendicular to the global intermediate axis. we also attempt to coaxa disc to form in an intermediate-axis orientation by producing a gas+darkmatter triaxial system with gas angular momentum about the intermediate axis.in all cases we fail to produce systems which remain with stellar angularmomentum aligned with the halo's intermediate axis, even when the disc'spotential flattens the inner halo such that the disc is everywhereperpendicular to the halo's local minor axis. for one of these unstablesimulations we show that the potential is even rounder than the models of themilky way potential in the region probed by the sagittarius stream. we concludethat the milky way's disc is very unlikely to be in an intermediate axisorientation. however we find that a disc can persist off one of the principalplanes of the potential. we propose that the disc of the milky way must betilted relative to the principal axes of the dark matter halo. directconfirmation of this prediction would constitute a critical test of modifiednewtonian dynamics.

1301.4517	halo orbits in cosmological disk galaxies: tracers of formation history	we analyze the orbits of stars and dark matter particles in the halo of adisk galaxy formed in a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. the halo isoblate within the inner ~20 kpc and triaxial beyond this radius. about 43% oforbits are short axis tubes - the rest belong to orbit families thatcharacterize triaxial potentials (boxes, long-axis tubes and chaotic orbits),but their shapes are close to axisymmetric. we find no evidence that theself-consistent distribution function of the nearly oblate inner halo iscomprised primarily of axisymmetric short-axis tube orbits. orbits of allfamilies, and both types of particles are highly eccentric with meaneccentricity &gt;0.6. we find that randomly selected samples of halo stars show nosubstructure in "integrals of motion" space. however individual accretionevents can be clearly identified in plots of metallicity versus formation time.dynamically young tidal debris is found primarily on a single type of orbit.however, stars associated with older satellites become chaotically mixed duringthe formation process (possibly due to scattering by the central bulge anddisk, and baryonic processes), and appear on all four types of orbits. we findthat the tidal debris in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations experiencessignificantly more chaotic evolution than in collisionless simulations, makingit much harder to identify individual progenitors using phase space coordinatesalone. however by combining information on stellar ages and chemical abundanceswith the orbital properties of halo stars in the underlying self-consistentpotential, the identification of progenitors is likely to be possible.

1302.2618	the magicc volume: reproducing statistical properties of high redshift  galaxies	we present a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of a representativevolume of the universe, as part of the making galaxies in a cosmologicalcontext (magicc) project. magicc uses a thermal implementation for supernovaand early stellar feedback. this work tests the feedback model at lowerresolution across a range of galaxy masses, morphologies and merger histories.the simulated sample compares well with observations of high redshift galaxies($z \ge 2$) including the stellar mass - halo mass ($m_\star - m_h$ ) relation,the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at low masses ($m_\star \lt 5 \times10^{10} m_\odot$ ) and the number density evolution of low mass galaxies. thepoor match of $m_\star - m_h$ and the gsmf at high masses ($m_\star \ge 5\times 10^{10} m_\odot$ ) indicates supernova feedback is insufficient to limitstar formation in these haloes. at $z = 0$, our model produces too many starsin massive galaxies and slightly underpredicts the stellar mass around$l_\star$ mass galaxy. altogether our results suggest that early stellarfeedback, in conjunction with supernovae feedback, plays a major role inregulating the properties of low mass galaxies at high redshift.

1306.0898	the dependence of dark matter profiles on the stellar to halo mass  ratio: a prediction for cusps vs cores	we use 31 simulated galaxies from the magicc project to investigate theeffects of baryonic feedback on the density profiles of dark matter (dm)haloes. the sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4e9&lt;mhalo/msun&lt;7.8e11, hostinggalaxies with stellar masses: 5.0e5&lt;m*/msun&lt;8.3e10, i.e. from dwarf to l*. thegalaxies are simulated with several baryonic prescriptions, including a rangeof stellar feedbacks. the main result is a clear dependence of the inner slopeof the dm density profile, \alpha\ in \rho r^\alpha, on the ratio betweenstellar-to-halo mass (m*/mhalo). this relation is independent of the stellarfeedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp vs core formation. whenm*/mhalo is low, ~0.01%, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient tosignificantly alter the inner dm density and the galaxy retains a cuspyprofile. at higher m*/mhalo, feedback drives the expansion of the dm andgenerates cored profiles. the flattest profiles form where m*/mhalo~0.5%. abovethis ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitationalpotential enough to oppose this supernova-driven expansion process, resultingin smaller cores and cuspier profiles. combining the dependence of \alpha\ onm*/mhalo with the abundance matching relation between m* and mhalo provides aprediction for how \alpha\ varies with m*. further, using the tully-fisherrelation allows a prediction for the dependence of the dm inner slope on theobserved rotation velocity of galaxies. the most cored galaxies are expected tohave vrot~50km/s, with \alpha\ decreasing for more massive disc galaxies:spirals with vrot~150km/s have central slopes \alpha&lt;-0.8, approaching the nfwprofile. this novel prediction for the dependence of \alpha\ on disc galaxymass can be tested using current observational data sets, and can be applied totheoretical modeling of mass profiles and populations of disc galaxies.

1307.0856	the relative role of galaxy mergers and cosmic flows in feeding black  holes	using a set of zoomed-in cosmological simulations of high-redshiftprogenitors of massive galaxies, we isolate and trace the history of gas thatis accreted by central supermassive black holes. we determine the origins ofthe accreted gas, in terms of whether it entered the galaxy during a mergerevent or was smoothly accreted. furthermore, we designate whether the smoothlyaccreted gas is accreted via a cold flow or is shocked upon entry into thehalo. for moderate-mass (10^6 - 10^7 msun) black holes at z ~ 4, there is apreference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin.however, this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has ahigher fraction of gas from cold flows. in general, each black hole tends toaccrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger-accreted gas as is containedin its host galaxy, suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomeswell-mixed, and its origins are erased. we find that the angular momentum ofthe gas upon halo entry is a more important factor; black holes preferentiallyaccrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy,regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers.

1308.0339	giant molecular cloud formation in disk galaxies: characterizing  simulated versus observed cloud catalogues	we present the results of a study of simulated giant molecular clouds (gmcs)formed in a milky way-type galactic disk with a flat rotation curve. thissimulation, which does not include star formation or feedback, produces cloudswith masses ranging between 10^4 msun and 10^7 msun. we compare our simulatedcloud population to two observational surveys; the boston university- fivecollege radio astronomy observatory galactic ring survey and the bima all-disksurvey of m33. an analysis of the global cloud properties as well as acomparison of larson's scaling relations is carried out. we find that simulatedcloud properties agree well with the observed cloud properties, with theclosest agreement occurring between the clouds at comparable resolution in m33.our clouds are highly filamentary - a property that derives both from theirformation due to gravitational instability in the sheared galactic environment,as well as to cloud- cloud gravitational encounters. we also find that the rateat which potentially star forming gas accumulates within dense regions -wherein n_{thresh} &gt; 10^4 cm^{-3} - is 3% per 10 myr, in clouds of roughly 10^6msun. this suggests that star formation rates in observed clouds are related tothe rates at which gas can be accumulated into dense subregions within gmcs viafilamentary flows. the most internally well-resolved clouds are chosen forlisting in a catalogue of simulated gmcs; the first of its kind. the cataloguedclouds are available as an extracted data set from the global simulation.

1308.1088	magicc-wdm: the effects of warm dark matter in hydrodynamical  simulations of disc galaxy formation	we study the effect of warm dark matter (wdm) on hydrodynamic simulations ofgalaxy formation as part of the making galaxies in a cosmological context(magicc) project. we simulate three different galaxies using three wdmcandidates of 1, 2 and 5 kev and compare results with pure cold dark mattersimulations. wdm slightly reduces star formation and produces less centrallyconcentrated stellar profiles. these effects are most evident for the 1 kevcandidate but almost disappear for $m_{\mathrm{wdm}}&gt;2$ kev. all simulationsform similar stellar discs independent of wdm particle mass. in particular, thedisc scale length does not change when wdm is considered. the reduced amount ofstar formation in the case of 1 kev particles is due to the effects of wdm onmerging satellites which are on average less concentrated and less gas rich.the altered satellites cause a reduced starburst during mergers because theytrigger weaker disc instabilities in the main galaxy. nevertheless we show thatdisc galaxy evolution is much more sensitive to stellar feedback than it is towdm candidate mass. overall we find that wdm, especially when restricted tocurrent observational constraints ($m_{\mathrm{wdm}}&gt;2$ kev), has a minorimpact on disc galaxy formation.

1312.1700	the pressure of the star forming ism in cosmological simulations	we examine the pressure of the star-forming interstellar medium (ism) ofmilky-way sized disk galaxies using fully cosmological sph+n-body, highresolution simulations. these simulations include explicit treatment ofmetal-line cooling in addition to dust and self-shielding, $\mathrm{h_{2}}$based star formation. the 4 simulated halos have masses ranging from a fewtimes $10^{10}$ to nearly $10^{12}$ solar masses. using a kinematicdecomposition of these galaxies into present-day bulge and disk components, wefind that the typical pressure of the star-forming ism in the present-day bulgeis higher than that in the present-day disk by an order of magnitude. we alsofind that pressure of the star-forming ism at high redshift is on average,higher than ism pressures at low redshift. this explains the why the bulgeforms at higher pressures: the disk assembles at lower redshift, when the ismis lower pressure and the bulge forms at high redshift, when the ism is athigher pressure. if ism pressure and imf variation are tied together assuggested in studies like \cite{conroy2012}, these results could indicate atime-dependent imf in milky-way like systems, as well as a different imf in thebulge and the disk.

1401.3338	dark magicc: the effect of dark energy on galaxy formation. cosmology  does matter	we present the dark magicc project, which aims to investigate the effect ofdark energy (de) modeling on galaxy formation via hydrodynamical cosmologicalsimulations. dark magicc includes four dynamical dark energy scenarios withtime varying equations of state, one with a self-interacting ratra-peeblesmodel. in each scenario we simulate three galaxies with high resolution usingsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph). the baryonic physics model is the sameused in the making galaxies in a cosmological context (magicc) project, and wevaried only the background cosmology. we find that the dark energyparameterization has a surprisingly important impact on galaxy evolution and onstructural properties of galaxies at z=0, in striking contrast with predictionsfrom pure nbody simulations. the different background evolutions can (dependingon the behavior of the de equation of state) either enhance or quench starformation with respect to a lcdm model, at a level similar to the variation ofthe stellar feedback parameterization, with strong effects on the final galaxyrotation curves. while overall stellar feedback is still the driving force inshaping galaxies, we show that the effect of the dark energy parameterizationplays a larger role than previously thought, especially at lower redshifts. forthis reason, the influence of dark energy parametrization on galaxy formationmust be taken into account, especially in the era of precision cosmology.

1401.5489	systematic problems with using dark matter simulations to model stellar  halos	the limits of available computing power have forced models for the structureof stellar halos to adopt one or both of the following simplifying assumptions:(1) stellar mass can be "painted" onto dark matter particles in progenitorsatellites; (2) pure dark matter simulations that do not form a luminous galaxycan be used. we estimate the magnitude of the systematic errors introduced bythese assumptions using a controlled set of stellar halo models where weindependently vary whether we look at star particles or painted dark matterparticles, and whether we use a simulation in which a baryonic disk galaxyforms or a matching pure dark matter simulation that does not form a baryonicdisk. we find that the "painting" simplification reduces the halo concentrationand internal structure, predominantly because painted dark matter particleshave different kinematics than star particles even when both are buried deep inthe potential well of the satellite. the simplification of using pure darkmatter simulations reduces the concentration further, but increases theinternal structure, and results in a more prolate stellar halo. thesedifferences can be a factor of 1.5-7 in concentration (as measured by thehalf-mass radius) and 2-7 in internal density structure. given this level ofsystematic uncertainty, one should be wary of overinterpreting differencesbetween observations and the current generation of stellar halo models based ondark matter only simulations when such differences are less than an order ofmagnitude.

1401.7653	the celestial buffet: multiple populations and globular cluster  formation in dwarf galaxies	we present a framework that explains the commonly observed variation in lightelement abundances in globular clusters. if globular clusters form in thecentres of dwarf galaxies, they will be pumped onto larger orbits as starformation progresses. the potential well will only retain the moderate velocityagb ejecta, the expected source of enrichment, but not supernova ejecta. thereis no need to increase the initial cluster mass, a requirement ofself-enrichment scenarios, as all the stars within the dwarf can contribute. asthe clusters move through the dwarf centre they sweep up a mix of agb ejectaand in-falling pristine gas to form a second generation of stars. the specificmix will vary in time and is thus able to explain the spread in secondgeneration abundances observed in different clusters. the globular clusterswill survive to the present day or be stripped as part of the hierarchicalmerging process of larger galaxies. we illustrate how this process may operateusing a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy at high redshift.

1407.0022	faint dwarfs as a test of dm models: wdm vs. cdm	we use high resolution hydro$+$n-body cosmological simulations to compare theassembly and evolution of a small field dwarf (stellar mass ~ 10$^{6-7}$m$\odot$, total mass 10$^{10}$ m$\odot$ in $\lambda$ dominated cdm and 2kev wdmcosmologies. we find that star formation (sf) in the wdm model is reduced anddelayed by 1-2 gyr relative to the cdm model, independently of the details ofsf and feedback. independent of the dm model, but proportionally to the sfefficiency, gas outflows lower the central mass density through `dynamicalheating', such that all realizations have circular velocities $&lt;$ 20kms at500$~$pc, in agreement with local kinematic constraints. as a result ofdynamical heating, older stars are less centrally concentrated than youngerstars, similar to stellar population gradients observed in nearby dwarfgalaxies. introducing an important diagnostic of sf and feedback models, wetranslate our simulations into artificial color-magnitude diagrams and starformation histories in order to directly compare to available observations. thesimulated galaxies formed most of their stars in many $\sim$10 myr long bursts.the cdm galaxy has a global sfh, hi abundance and fe/h and alpha-elementsdistribution well matched to current observations of dwarf galaxies. theseresults highlight the importance of directly including `baryon physics' insimulations when 1) comparing predictions of galaxy formation models with thekinematics and number density of local dwarf galaxies and 2) differentiatingbetween cdm and non-standard models with different dm or power spectra.

1407.5639	the role of cold flows and reservoirs in galaxy formation with strong  feedback	we examine gas accretion and subsequent star formation in representativegalaxies from the mcmaster unbiased galaxy simulations (stinson et al. 2010).accreted gas is bimodal with a natural temperature division at $10^5$ k, nearthe peak of the cooling curve. cold-mode accretion dominates inflows at earlytimes, creating a peak in total accretion at redshift z=2-4 and decliningexponentially below z$\sim$2. hot-mode accretion peaks near z=1-2 and declinesgradually. hot-mode exceeds cold-mode accretion at z$\sim$1.8 for all fourgalaxies rather than when the galaxy reaches a characteristic mass. cold-modeaccretion can fuel immediate star formation, while hot-mode accretionpreferentially builds a large, hot gas reservoir in the halo. late-time starformation relies on reservoir gas accreted 2-8 gyr prior. thus, the reservoirallows the star formation rate to surpass the current overall gas accretionrate. stellar feedback cycles gas from the interstellar medium back into thehot reservoir. stronger feedback results in more gas cycling, gas removal in agalactic outflow and less star formation overall, enabling simulations to matchthe observed star formation history. for lower mass galaxies in particular,strong feedback can delay the star formation peak to z=1-2 from the accretionpeak at z=2-4.

1409.2540	evolving molecular cloud structure and the column density probability  distribution function	the structure of molecular clouds can be characterized with the probabilitydistribution function (pdf) of the mass surface density. in particular, theproperties of the distribution can reveal the nature of the turbulence and starformation present inside the molecular cloud. in this paper, we explore howthese structural characteristics evolve with time and also how they relate tovarious cloud properties as measured from a sample of synthetic column densitymaps of molecular clouds. we find that, as a cloud evolves, the peak of itscolumn density pdf will shift to surface densities below the observationalthreshold for detection, resulting in an underlying lognormal distributionwhich has been effectively lost at late times. our results explain why certainobservations of actively star-forming, dynamically older clouds, such as theorion molecular cloud, do not appear to have any evidence of a lognormaldistribution in their column density pdfs. we also study the evolution of theslope and deviation point of the power-law tails for our sample of simulatedclouds and show that both properties trend towards constant values, thuslinking the column density structure of the molecular cloud to the surfacedensity threshold for star formation.

1411.5683	direct formation of supermassive black holes in metal-enriched gas at  the heart of high-redshift galaxy mergers	we present novel 3d multi-scale sph simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergersbetween the most massive galaxies at $z \sim 8 - 10$, designed to scrutinizethe direct collapse formation scenario for massive black hole seeds proposed in\citet{mayer+10}. the simulations achieve a resolution of 0.1 pc, and includeboth metallicity-dependent optically-thin cooling and a model for thermalbalance at high optical depth. we consider different formulations of the sphhydrodynamical equations, including thermal and metal diffusion. when the twomerging galaxy cores collide, gas infall produces a compact, optically thicknuclear disk with densities exceeding $10^{-10}$ g cm$^3$. the disk rapidlyaccretes higher angular momentum gas from its surroundings reaching $\sim 5$ pcand a mass of $\gtrsim 10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ in only a few $10^4$ yr. outside$\gtrsim 2$ pc it fragments into massive clumps. instead, supersonic turbulenceprevents fragmentation in the inner parsec region, which remains warm ($\sim3000-6000$ k) and develops strong non-axisymmetric modes that cause prominentradial gas inflows ($&gt; 10^4$ $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), forming an ultra-densemassive disky core. angular momentum transport by non-axisymmetric modes shouldcontinue below our spatial resolution limit, quickly turning the disky coreinto a supermassive protostar which can collapse directly into a massive blackhole of mass $10^8-10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ via the relativistic radial instability.such a "cold direct collapse"' explains naturally the early emergence of high-zqsos. its telltale signature would be a burst of gravitational waves in thefrequency range $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ hz, possibly detectable by the plannedelisa interferometer.

1412.3319	a lower fragmentation mass scale in high redshift galaxies and its  implications on giant clumps: a systematic numerical study	we study the effect of sub-grid physics, galaxy mass, structural parametersand resolution on the fragmentation of gas-rich galaxy discs into massive starforming clumps. the initial conditions are set up with the aid of the argocosmological hydrodynamical simulation. blast-wave feedback does not suppressfragmentation, but reduces both the number of clumps and the duration of theunstable phase. once formed, bound clumps cannot be destroyed by our feedbackmodel. widespread fragmentation is promoted by high gas fractions and low haloconcentrations. yet giant clumps $m &gt; 10^8 m_{\odot}$ lasting several hundredmyr are rare and mainly produced by clump-clump mergers. they occur in massivediscs with maximum rotational velocities $v_{max} &gt; 250$ km/s at $z \sim 2$, atthe high mass end of the observed galaxy population at those redshifts. thetypical gaseous and stellar masses of clumps in all runs are in the range $\sim10^7-10^8 m_{\odot}$ for galaxies with disc mass in the range $10^{10}-8\times10^{10} m_{\odot}$. clumps sizes are usually in the range $100-400$ pc, inagreement with recent clump observations in lensed high-z galaxies. \\ we arguethat many of the giant clumps identified in observations are not due to in-situfragmetation, or are the result of blending of smaller structures owing toinsufficient resolution. using an analytical model describing local collapseinside spiral arms, we can predict the characteristic gaseous masses of clumpsat the onset of fragmentation ($\sim 3-5 \times 10^7 m_{\odot}$) quiteaccurately, while the conventional toomre mass overestimates them. due to theirmoderate masses, clumps which migrate to the centre have marginal effect onbulge growth.

1501.00277	star formation in disk galaxies. iii. does stellar feedback result in  cloud death?	stellar feedback, star formation and gravitational interactions are majorcontrolling forces in the evolution of giant molecular clouds (gmcs). toexplore their relative roles, we examine the properties and evolution of gmcsforming in an isolated galactic disk simulation that includes both localisedthermal feedback and photoelectric heating. the results are compared with thethree previous simulations in this series which consists of a model with nostar formation, star formation but no form of feedback and star formation withphotoelectric heating in a set with steadily increasing physical effects. wefind that the addition of localised thermal feedback greatly suppresses starformation but does not destroy the surrounding gmc, giving cloud propertiesclosely resembling the run in which no stellar physics is included. theoutflows from the feedback reduce the mass of the cloud but do not destroy it,allowing the cloud to survive its stellar children. this suggests that weakthermal feedback such as the lower bound expected for supernova may play arelatively minor role in the galactic structure of quiescent milky way-typegalaxies, compared to gravitational interactions and disk shear.

1501.01960	how to bend galaxy disc profiles: the role of halo spin	the radial density profiles of stellar galaxy discs can be well approximatedas an exponential. compared to this canonical form, however, the profiles inthe majority of disc galaxies show downward or upward breaks at large radii.currently, there is no coherent explanation in a galaxy formation context ofthe radial profile per se, along with the two types of profile breaks. using aset of controlled hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxy formation, we find acorrelation between the host halo's initial angular momentum and the resultingradial profile of the stellar disc: galaxies that live in haloes with a lowspin parameter {\lambda} &lt;~ 0.03 show an up-bending break in their disc densityprofiles, while galaxies in haloes of higher angular momentum show adown-bending break. we find that the case of pure exponential profiles({\lambda} ~ 0.035) coincides with the peak of the spin parameter distributionfrom cosmological simulations. our simulations not only imply an explanation ofthe observed behaviours, but also suggest that the physical origin of thiseffect is related to the amount of radial redistribution of stellar mass, whichis anti-correlated with {\lambda}.

0804.4474	damped lyman alpha systems in galaxy formation simulations	we investigate the population of z=3 damped lyman alpha absorbers (dlas) in arecent series of high resolution galaxy formation simulations. the simulationsare of interest because they form at z=0 some of the most realistic diskgalaxies to date. no free parameters are available in our study: these havebeen fixed by physical and z=0 observational constraints, and thus our studyprovides a genuine consistency test. the precise role of dlas in galaxyformation remains in debate, but they provide a number of strong constraints onthe nature of our simulated bound systems at z=3 because of their coupledinformation on neutral h i densities, kinematics, metallicity and estimates ofstar formation activity.  our results, without any parameter-tuning, closely match the observedincidence rate and column density distributions of dlas. our simulations arethe first to reproduce the distribution of metallicities (with a median ofz_{dla} = z_{solar}/20) without invoking observationally unsupported mechanismssuch as dust biasing. this is especially encouraging given that thesesimulations have previously been shown to have a realistic 0&lt;z&lt;2 stellarmass-metallicity relation. additionally, we see a strong positive correlationbetween sightline metallicity and low-ion velocity width, the normalization andslope of which comes close to matching recent observational results. however,we somewhat underestimate the number of observed high velocity width systems;the severity of this disagreement is comparable to other recent dla focusedstudies. by z=0 the majority of the z=3 neutral gas forming the dlas has beenconverted into stars, in agreement with rough physical expectations.

1505.00825	the energetics of cusp destruction	we present a new analytic estimate for the energy required to create aconstant density core within a dark matter halo. our new estimate, based onmore realistic assumptions, leads to a required energy that is orders ofmagnitude lower than is claimed in earlier work. we define a core size based onthe logarithmic slope of the dark matter density profile so that it isinsensitive to the functional form used to fit observed data. the energyrequired to form a core depends sensitively on the radial scale over which darkmatter within the cusp is redistributed within the halo. simulations indicatethat within a region of comparable size to the active star forming regions ofthe central galaxy that inhabits the halo, dark matter particles have theirorbits radially increased by a factor of 2--3 during core formation. thus theinner properties of the dark matter halo, such as halo concentration, and finalcore size, set the energy requirements. as a result, the energy cost increasesslowly with halo mass as m$_{\rm{h}}^{0.3-0.7}$ for core sizes $\lesssim1$ kpc.we use the expected star formation history for a given dark matter halo mass topredict dwarf galaxy core sizes. we find that supernovae alone would createwell over 4 kpc cores in $10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ dwarf galaxies \emph{if} 100% ofthe energy were transferred to dark matter particle orbits. we can directlyconstrain the efficiency factor by studying galaxies with known stellar contentand core size, such as fornax. we find that the efficiency of coupling betweenstellar feedback and dark matter orbital energy need only be at the 1% level orless to explain fornax's 1 kpc core.

1506.00652	the effect of stellar feedback on a milky way-like galaxy and its  gaseous halo	we present the study of a set of n-body+sph simulations of a milky way-likesystem produced by the radiative cooling of hot gas embedded in a dark matterhalo. the galaxy and its gaseous halo evolve for 10 gyr in isolation, whichallows us to study how internal processes affect the evolution of the system.we show how the morphology, the kinematics and the evolution of the galaxy areaffected by the input supernova feedback energy e$_{\rm sn}$, and we compareits properties with those of the milky way. different values of e$_{\rm sn}$ donot significantly affect the star formation history of the system, but the discof cold gas gets thicker and more turbulent as feedback increases. our mainresult is that, for the highest value of e$_{\rm sn}$ considered, the galaxyshows a prominent layer of extra-planar cold (log(t)&lt;4.3) gas extended up to afew kpc above the disc at column densities of $10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. thekinematics of this material is in agreement with that inferred for the hi halosof our galaxy and ngc 891, although its mass is lower. also, the location, thekinematics and the typical column densities of the hot (5.3&lt;log(t)&lt;5.7) gas arein good agreement with those determined from the o$_{\rm vi}$ absorptionsystems in the halo of the milky way and external galaxies. in contrast withthe observations, however, gas at log(t)&lt;5.3 is lacking in the circumgalacticregion of our systems.

(2014) are identified inboth data sets, with around 80% of the clouds retaining their type betweenidentification methods. we also compared our results when using a peakdecomposition method to identify clouds in both ppp and ppv space. the numberof clouds increased with this technique, but the overall cloud propertiesremained similar. however, the more crowded environment lowered the ability tomatch clouds between techniques to 40%. the three cloud types also becameharder to separate, especially in the ppv data set. the method used for cloudidentification therefore plays a critical role in determining cloud properties,but both ppp and ppv can potentially identify the same structures.

1510.08187	the properties of bound and unbound molecular cloud populations formed  in galactic disc simulations	we explore the effect of galactic environment on properties of molecularclouds. using clouds formed in a large-scale galactic disc simulation, wemeasure the observable properties from synthetic column density maps. weconfirm that a significant fraction of unbound clouds forms naturally in agalactic disc environment and that a mixed population of bound and unboundclouds can match observed scaling relations and distributions for extragalacticmolecular clouds. by dividing the clouds into inner and outer disc populations,we compare their distributions of properties and test whether there arestatistically significant differences between them. we find that clouds in theouter disc have lower masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions as compared tothose in the inner disc for reasonable choices of the inner/outer boundary. weattribute the differences to the strong impact of galactic shear on the discstability at large galactocentric radii. in particular, our toomre analysis ofthe disc shows a narrowing envelope of unstable masses as a function of radius,resulting in the formation of smaller, lower mass fragments in the outer disc.we also show that the star formation rate is affected by the environment of theparent cloud, and is particularly influenced by the underlying surface densityprofile of the gas throughout the disc. our work highlights the strengths ofusing galaxy-scale simulations to understand the formation and evolution ofcloud properties - and the star formation within them - in the context of theirenvironment.

astro-ph;0011041	tidal stirring and the origin of dwarf spheroidals in the local group	n-body/sph simulations are used to study the evolution of dwarf irregulargalaxies (dirrs) entering the dark matter halo of the milky way or m31 onplunging orbits. we propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution ofgas rich, rotationally supported dirrs, mostly found at the outskirts of thelocal group (lg), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dsphs)or dwarf ellipticals (des), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals.the initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive darkmatter halos and reproduce nearby dirrs. repeated tidal shocks at thepericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and triggerdynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component.after only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (lsb) dirrs are transformed intodsphs, while high surface brightness (hsb) dirrs evolve into des. thisevolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relationobserved for lg dwarfs. dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, likethe archetypical dirr gr8, are turned into draco or ursa minor, the faintestand most dark matter dominated among lg dsphs. if disks include a gaseouscomponent, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts ofstar formation. the resulting star formation histories are in good qualitativeagreement with those derived using hst color-magnitude diagrams for localdsphs.

astro-ph;0310771	the evolution of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks:  fragmentation and possible giant planet formation	we carry out a large set of very high resolution, three dimensional smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations describing the evolution ofgravitationally unstable gaseous protoplanetary disks. we consider a broadrange of initial disk parameters. disk masses out to 20 au range from 0.075 to0.125 $m_{\odot}$, roughly consistent with the high-end of the massdistribution inferred for disks around t tauri stars. the initial disks spanminimum $q$ parameters between 0.8 and 2, with most models being around $\sim1.4$. the disks are evolved assuming either a locally isothermal equation ofstate or an adiabatic equation of state with varying $\gamma$. whenoverdensities above a specific threshold appear as a result of gravitationalinstability in a locally isothermal calculation, the equation of state isswitched to adiabatic to account for the increased optical depth. we show thatwhen a disk has a minimum $q$ parameter less than 1.4 strong trailing spiralinstabilities, typically three or four armed modes, form and grow untilfragmentation occurs along the arms after about 5 mean disk orbital times. theresulting clumps contract quickly to densities several orders of magnitudehigher than the initial disk density, and the densest of them survive evenunder adiabatic conditions. these clumps are stable to tidal disruption andmerge quickly, leaving 2-3 protoplanets on fairly eccentric orbits (the meaneccentricity being around 0.2) with masses between 0.7 and more than $7m_{jup}$, well in agreement with those of detected extrasolar planets.after$\sim 10^3$ years. fragmentation is not strongly dependent on whether the diskstarts from a marginally unstable state or gradually achieves it, as shown by atest where the disk gradually achieves the critical $q$ by growing in mass.

astro-ph;0509310	the secular evolution of disk structural parameters	we present a comprehensive series of $n$-body as well as $n$-body + sphsimulations to study the secular evolution of the structure of disk galaxies.our simulations are organized in a hierarchy of increasing complexity, rangingfrom rigid-halo collisionless simulations to fully live simulations with gasand star formation. comparisons between the different types of simulationsallow us to isolate the role of various physical mechanisms. we focus on theevolution of systems expected in a lcdm universe.  our goal is to examine which structural properties of disk galaxies mayresult from secular evolution rather than from direct hierarchical assembly. inthe vertical direction, we find that various mechanisms can lead to heating.the strongest heating occurs during the vertical buckling instability of a bar.among the consequences of this instability is the formation of peanut-shapedbulges which produce clear kinematic signatures when observed face-on. we findthat bars are robust structures that are not destroyed by buckling. they can bedestroyed instead by a central mass concentration but we find that this massneeds to be a large fraction of the total mass of the disk. we then study theevolution of stellar surface density profiles showing how angular momentumredistribution leads to increasing central densities and disk scale lengths andto profile breaks at large radii. the breaks in these simulations are inexcellent agreement with observed breaks, even when the evolution is purelycollisionless. disk scale-lengths increase even when the total disk angularmomentum is conserved; thus mapping halo angular momenta to scale-lengths isnon-trivial.

astro-ph;0601115	angular momentum transport and disk morphology in sph simulations of  galaxy formation	we perform controlled n-body/sph simulations of disk galaxy formation bycooling a rotating gaseous mass distribution inside equilibrium cuspy sphericaland triaxial dark matter halos. we systematically study the angular momentumtransport and the disk morphology as we increase the number of dark matter andgas particles from 10^4 to 10^6, and decrease the gravitational softening from2 kpc to 50 parsecs. the angular momentum transport, disk morphology and radialprofiles depend sensitively on force and mass resolution. at low resolution,similar to that used in most current cosmological simulations, the cold gascomponent has lost half of its initial angular momentum via differentmechanisms. the angular momentum is transferred primarily to the hot halocomponent, by resolution-dependent hydrodynamical and gravitational torques,the latter arising from asymmetries in the mass distribution. in addition,disk-particles can lose angular momentum while they are still in the hot phaseby artificial viscosity. in the central disk, particles can transfer away over99% of their initial angular momentum due to spiral structure and/or thepresence of a central bar. the strength of this transport also depends on forceand mass resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability, lowmass resolution enhances the spiral structure. this complex interplay betweenresolution and angular momentum transfer highlights the complexity ofsimulations of galaxy formation even in isolated haloes. with 10^6 gas and darkmatter particles, disk particles lose only 10-20% of their original angularmomentum, yet we are unable to produce pure exponential profiles.

astro-ph;0606361	fragmentation of gravitationally unstable gaseous protoplanetary disks  with radiative transfer	we report on the results of the first 3d sph simulation of massive,gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks with radiative transfer. we adopta flux-limited diffusion scheme justified by the high opacity of most of thedisk. the optically thin surface of the disk cools as a blackbody. the disksgrow slowly in mass starting from a toomre-stable initial condition to thepoint at which they become marginally unstable. we find that gravitationallybound clumps with masses close to a jupiter mass can arise. fragmentationappears to be driven by vertical convective-like motions capable oftransporting the heat from the disk midplane to its surface on a timescale ofonly about 40 years at 10 au. a larger or smaller cooling efficiency of thedisk at the optically thin surface can promote or stifle fragmentation byaffecting the vertical temperature profile, which determines whether convectioncan happen or not, and by regulating the accretion flow from optically thinregions towards overdense regions. we also find that the chances offragmentation increase for a higher mean molecular weight $\mu$ sincecompressional heating is reduced. around a star with mass $1 m_{\odot}$ onlydisks with $\mu \ge 2.4$, as expected for gas with a metallicity comparable tosolar or higher, fragment. this suggests that disk instability, likecore-accretion, should be more effective in forming gas giants at higher gasmetallicities, consistent with the observed correlation between metallicity ofthe planet-hosting stars and frequency of planets

astro-ph;0702495	early gas stripping as the origin of the darkest galaxies in the  universe	the known galaxies most dominated by dark matter (draco, ursa minor andandromeda ix) are satellites of the milky way and the andromeda galaxies. theyare members of a class of faint galaxies, devoid of gas, known as dwarfspheroidals, and have by far the highest ratio of dark to luminous matter. noneof the models proposed to unravel their origin can simultaneously explain theirexceptional dark matter content and their proximity to a much larger galaxy.here we report simulations showing that the progenitors of these galaxies wereprobably gas-dominated dwarf galaxies that became satellites of a larger galaxyearlier than the other dwarf spheroidals. we find that a combination of tidalshocks and ram pressure swept away the entire gas content of such progenitorsabout ten billion years ago because heating by the cosmic ultravioletbackground kept the gas loosely bound: a tiny stellar component embedded in arelatively massive dark halo survived until today. all luminous galaxies shouldbe surrounded by a few extremely dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidalsatellites, and these should have the shortest orbital periods among dwarfspheroidals because they were accreted early.

0811.0615	pairing of supermassive black holes in unequal-mass galaxy mergers	we examine the pairing process of supermassive black holes (smbhs) down toscales of 20-100 pc using a set of n-body/sph simulations of binary mergers ofdisk galaxies with mass ratios of 1:4 and 1:10. our numerical experiments aredesigned to represent merger events occurring at various cosmic epochs. theinitial conditions of the encounters are consistent with the lambdacdm paradigmof structure formation, and the simulations include the effects of radiativecooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback. we find that the pairing ofsmbhs depends sensitively on the amount of baryonic mass preserved in thecenter of the companion galaxies during the last phases of the merger. inparticular, due to the combination of gasdynamics and star formation, we findthat a pair of smbhs can form in 1:10 minor mergers provided that galaxies arerelatively gas-rich (gas fractions of 30% of the disk mass) and that themergers occur at relatively high redshift (z~3), when dynamical frictiontimescales are shorter. since 1:10 mergers are most common events during theassembly of galaxies, and mergers are more frequent at high redshift whengalaxies are also more gas-rich, our results have positive implications forfuture gravitational wave experiments such as the laser interferometer spaceantenna.

0812.2025	redistributing hot gas around galaxies: do cool clouds signal a solution  to the overcooling problem?	we present a pair of high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)simulations that explore the evolution and cooling behavior of hot gas aroundmilky-way size galaxies. the simulations contain the same total baryonic massand are identical other than their initial gas density distributions. the firstis initialised with a low entropy hot gas halo that traces the cuspy profile ofthe dark matter, and the second is initialised with a high-entropy hot halowith a cored density profile as might be expected in models with pre-heatingfeedback. galaxy formation proceeds in dramatically different fashion dependingon the initial setup. while the low-entropy halo cools rapidly, primarily fromthe central region, the high-entropy halo is quasi-stable for ~4 gyr andeventually cools via the fragmentation and infall of clouds from ~100 kpcdistances. the low-entropy halo's x-ray surface brightness is ~100 timesbrighter than current limits and the resultant disc galaxy contains more thanhalf of the system's baryons. the high-entropy halo has an x-ray brightnessthat is in line with observations, an extended distribution ofpressure-confined clouds reminiscent of observed populations, and a final discgalaxy that has half the mass and ~50% more specific angular momentum than thedisc formed in the low-entropy simulation. the final high-entropy systemretains the majority of its baryons in a low-density hot halo. the hot haloharbours a trace population of cool, mostly ionised, pressure-confined cloudsthat contain ~10% of the halo's baryons after 10 gyr of cooling. the coveringfraction for hi and mgii absorption clouds in the high-entropy halo is ~0.4 and~0.6, respectively, although most of the mass that fuels disc growth isionised, and hence would be under counted in hi surveys.
