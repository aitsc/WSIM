0901.4545	2mass/sdss close major-merger galaxy pairs: luminosity functions and  merger mass dependence	we select a close "major-merger candidate" galaxy pair sample in order tocalculate the k_{s} luminosity function (lf) and pair fraction representativeof the merger/interaction component of galaxy evolution in the local universe.the pair sample (projected separation 5 h$^{-1}$ kpc $\leq$ r $\leq$ 20h$^{-1}$ kpc, $k_{s}$-band magnitude difference $\delta$$k_{s}$ $\leq$ 1 mag)is selected by combining the two micron all sky survey (2mass) with the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 (dr5). the resulting data set contains340 galaxies covering 5800 sq. degrees. a stellar mass function is alsotranslated from the lf. a differential pair fraction displays nearly constantfraction of galaxy pairs as a function of galaxy mass from 10$^{9}$ to10$^{11.5}$ m$_{\sun}$ . the differential pair fraction is less subject toabsolute magnitude bias due to survey limitations than the standard total pairfraction. these results suggest that major-merger candidate pairs in the0$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.1 universe are developed from $\sim$1.6% of the galaxy populationwithout dependance on galaxy mass for pair components below 10$^{11}$m$_{\sun}$. the derived lf combined with merger model time scales give localmerger rates per unit volume which decrease with masses greater than 10$^{11}$m$_{\sun}$ .

0903.3403	collisional debris as laboratories to study star formation	in this paper we address the question whether star formation is driven bylocal processes or the large scale environment. to do so, we investigate starformation in collisional debris where the gravitational potential well andvelocity gradients are shallower and compare our results with previous work onstar formation in non-interacting spiral and dwarf galaxies. we have performedmultiwavelength spectroscopic and imaging observations (from thefar-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared) of 6 interacting systems, identifying atotal of 60 star-forming regions in their collision debris.  our analysis indicates that in these regions a) the emission of the dust isat the expected level for their luminosity and metallicity, b) the usualtracers of star formation rate display the typical trend and scatter found inclassical star forming regions, and c) the extinction and metallicity are notthe main parameters governing the scatter in the properties of intergalacticstar forming regions; age effects and variations in the number of stellarpopulations, seem to play an important role. our work suggests that localproperties such as column density and dust content, rather than the large scaleenvironment seem to drive star formation. this means that intergalactic starforming regions can be used as a reliable tool to study star formation.

0912.0282	powerful h$_2$ line-cooling in stephan's quintet : i - mapping the  significant cooling pathways in group-wide shocks	we present results from the mid-infrared spectral mapping of stephan'squintet using the spitzer space telescope. a 1000 km/s collision has produced agroup-wide shock and for the first time the large-scale distribution of warmmolecular hydrogen emission is revealed, as well as its close association withknown shock structures. in the main shock region alone we find 5.0$\times10^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$ of warm h$_2$ spread over $\sim$ 480 kpc$^2$ andadditionally report the discovery of a second major shock-excited h$_2$feature. this brings the total h$_2$ line luminosity of the group in excess of10$^42$ erg/s. in the main shock, the h$_2$ line luminosity exceeds, by afactor of three, the x-ray luminosity from the hot shocked gas, confirming thatthe h$_2$-cooling pathway dominates over the x-ray. [si ii]34.82$\mu$memission, detected at a luminosity of 1/10th of that of the h$_2$, appears totrace the group-wide shock closely and in addition, we detect weak[feii]25.99$\mu$m emission from the most x-ray luminous part of the shock.comparison with shock models reveals that this emission is consistent withregions of fast shocks (100 &lt; $v_{s}$ &lt; 300 km/s) experiencing depletion ofiron and silicon onto dust grains. star formation in the shock (as traced viaionic lines, pah and dust emission) appears in the intruder galaxy, but moststrikingly at either end of the radio shock. the shock ridge itself showslittle star formation, consistent with a model in which the tremendous h$_{2}$power is driven by turbulent energy transfer from motions in a post-shockedlayer. the significance of the molecular hydrogen lines over other measuredsources of cooling in fast galaxy-scale shocks may have crucial implicationsfor the cooling of gas in the assembly of the first galaxies.

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.1227	dust emission and star formation in stephan's quintet	we analyse a comprehensive set of mir/fir observations of stephan's quintet(sq), taken with the spitzer space observatory. our study reveals the presenceof a luminous (l_{ir}\approx 4.6x10^43 erg/s) and extended component ofinfrared dust emission, not connected with the main bodies of the galaxies, butroughly coincident with the x-ray halo of the group. we fitted the inferreddust emission spectral energy distribution of this extended source and theother main infrared emission components of sq, including the intergalacticshock, to elucidate the mechanisms powering the dust and pah emission, takinginto account collisional heating by the plasma and heating through uv andoptical photons. combining the inferred direct and dust-processed uv emissionto estimate the star formation rate (sfr) for each source we obtain a total sfrfor sq of 7.5 m(sun)/yr, similar to that expected for non-interacting galaxieswith stellar mass comparable to the sq galaxies. although star formation in sqis mainly occurring at, or external to the periphery of the galaxies, therelation of sfr per unit physical area to gas column density for the brightestsources is similar to that seen for star-formation regions in galactic disks.we also show that available sources of dust in the group halo can provideenough dust to produce up to l_{ir}\approx 10^42 erg/s powered by collisionalheating. though a minority of the total infrared emission (which we infer totrace distributed star-formation), this is several times higher than the x-rayluminosity of the halo, so could indicate an important cooling mechanism forthe hot igm and account for the overall correspondence between fir and x-rayemission.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

0710.3530	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies i: the  correlation length derived from galex data in the local universe	we present the first measurements of the angular correlation function ofgalaxies selected in the far (1530 a) and near (2310 a) ultraviolet from thegalex survey fields overlapping sdss dr5 in low galactic extinction regions.the area used covers 120 sqdeg (galex - mis) down to magnitude ab = 22,yielding a total of 100,000 galaxies. the mean correlation length is ~ 3.7 \pm0.6 mpc and no significant trend is seen for this value as a function of thelimiting apparent magnitude or between the galex bands. this estimate is closeto that found from samples of blue galaxies in the local universe selected inthe visible, and similar to that derived at z ~ 3 for lbgs with similar restframe selection criteria. this result supports models that predict anti-biasingof star forming galaxies at low redshift, and brings an additional clue to thedownsizing of star formation at z&lt;1.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

0711.0843	clustering of galaxies at 3.6 microns in the spitzer wide-area infrared  extragalactic legacy survey	we investigate the clustering of galaxies selected in the 3.6 micron band ofthe spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) legacy survey. the angulartwo-point correlation function is calculated for eleven samples with fluxlimits of s_3.6 &gt; 4-400 mujy, over an 8 square degree field. the angularclustering strength is measured at &gt;5-sigma significance at all flux limits,with amplitudes of a=(0.49-29)\times10^{-3} at one degree, for a power-lawmodel, a\theta^{-0.8}. we estimate the redshift distributions of the samplesusing phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and soderive the spatial correlation lengths. we compare our results with the galics(galaxies in cosmological simulations) models of galaxy evolution and withparameterized models of clustering evolution. the galics simulations areconsistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match thespatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometricredshifts. we find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of oursamples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatialclustering. at low redshifts (median z&lt;0.5) the comoving correlation length isapproximately constant, r_0=6.1\pm0.5h^{-1} mpc, and then decreases withincreasing redshift to a value of 2.9\pm0.3h^{-1} mpc for the faintest sample,for which the median redshift is z=1. we suggest that this trend can beattributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainterflux-limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers ofearly- and late-type galaxies. however, we cannot rule out strong evolution ofthe correlation length over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1208.3248	investigation of dual active nuclei, outflows, shock-heated gas, and  young star clusters in markarian 266	results of observations with the spitzer, hubble, galex, chandra, andxmm-newton space telescopes are presented for the luminous infrared galaxy(lirg) merger mrk 266. the sw (seyfert 2) and ne (liner) nuclei reside ingalaxies with hubble types sbb (pec) and s0/a (pec), respectively. bothgalaxies have l &gt; l*, and they are inferred to each contain a ~2.5x10^8 m_sunblack hole. mrk 266 sw is likely the primary source of a bright fe k-alpha linedetected from the system, consistent with the reflection-dominated x-rayspectrum of a heavily obscured agn. optical knots embedded in an arc withaligned radio continuum radiation, combined with luminous h_2 line emission,provide evidence for a radiative bow shock in an agn-driven outflow surroundingthe ne nucleus. soft x-ray emission modeled as shock-heated plasma isco-spatial with radio continuum emission between the galaxies. mid-irdiagnostics indicate roughly equal contributions of agn and starburst radiationpowering the bolometric luminosity. approximately 120 star clusters have beendetected, with most having estimated ages &lt; 50 myr. detection of 24 micronemission extending ~34 arcsec (20 kpc) north of the galaxies is interpreted as~2x10^7 m_sun of dust entrained in an outflowing superwind; at opticalwavelengths this region is resolved into a fragmented morphology indicative ofrayleigh-taylor instabilities in an expanding shell of ionized gas. mrk 266demonstrates that the dust "blow-out" phase can begin in a lirg well before thegalaxies fully coalesce during a subsequent ulirg phase, and rapid gasconsumption in luminous dual agns (kpc scale separations) early in the mergerprocess may explain the paucity of detected binary qsos (sub-pc scale orbits)in large surveys. an evolutionary sequence is proposed representing aprogression from dual to binary agns, accompanied by an increase in observedl_x/l_ir ratios by 10^4 or more.

1210.2362	cosmic evolution of star-formation enhancement in close major-merger  galaxy pairs since z = 1	the infrared (ir) emission of m_* galaxies (10^{10.4} &lt; m_{star} &lt; 10^{11.0}m_\sun) in galaxy pairs, derived using data obtained in herschel (pep/hermes)and spitzer (s-cosmos) surveys, is compared to that of single disk galaxies inwell matched control samples to study the cosmic evolution of thestar-formation enhancement induced by galaxy-galaxy interaction. both the meanir sed and mean ir luminosity of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) in sfg+sfg (s+s)pairs in the redshift bin of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 are consistent with no star-formationenhancement. sfgs in s+s pairs in a lower redshift bin of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 showmarginal evidence for a weak star-formation enhancement. together with thesignificant and strong ssfr enhancement shown by sfgs in a local sample of s+spairs (obtained using previously published spitzer observations), our resultsreveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in s+s pairs to decrease withincreasing redshift. between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-inducedstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by afactor of ~10) of the ssfr of single sfgs, both can be explained by the highergas fraction in higher z disks. sfgs in mixed pairs (s+e pairs) do not show anysignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. the difference betweensfgs in s+s pairs and in s+e pairs suggests a modulation of the ssfr by theinter-galactic medium igm in the dark matter halos (dmh) hosting these pairs.

1301.4549	enhanced warm h2 emission in the compact group mid-infrared "green  valley"	we present results from a spitzer, mid-infrared spectroscopy study of asample of 74 galaxies located in 23 hickson compact groups, chosen to be at adynamically-active stage of hi depletion. we find evidence for enhanced warm h2emission (i.e. above that associated with uv excitation in star-formingregions) in 14 galaxies (~20%), with 8 galaxies having extreme values of l(h2s(0)-s(3))/l(7.7micron pah), in excess of 0.07. such emission has been seenpreviously in the compact group hcg 92 (stephan's quintet), and was shown to beassociated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with alarge-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, withtidal debris in the intragroup medium. similarly, shock excitation or turbulentheating is likely responsible for the enhanced h2 emission in the compact groupgalaxies, since other sources of heating (uv or x-ray excitation from starformation or agn) are insufficient to account for the observed emission. thegroup galaxies fall predominantly in a region of mid-infrared color-color spaceidentified by previous studies as being connected to rapid transformations inhcg galaxy evolution. furthermore, the majority of h2-enhanced galaxies lie inthe optical "green valley" between the blue cloud and red-sequence, and areprimarily early-type disk systems. we suggest that h2-enhanced systems mayrepresent a specific phase in the evolution of galaxies in dense environmentsand provide new insight into mechanisms which transform galaxies onto theoptical red sequence.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1306.1217	flux calibration of the herschel-spire photometer	we describe the procedure used to flux calibrate the three-band submillimetrephotometer in the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire) instrumenton the herschel space observatory. this includes the equations describing thecalibration scheme, a justification for using neptune as the primarycalibration source, a description of the observations and data processingprocedures used to derive flux calibration parameters (for converting fromvoltage to flux density) for every bolometer in each array, an analysis of theerror budget in the flux calibration for the individual bolometers, and testsof the flux calibration on observations of primary and secondary calibrators.the procedure for deriving the flux calibration parameters is divided into twoparts. in the first part, we use observations of astronomical sources inconjunction with the operation of the photometer internal calibration source toderive the unscaled derivatives of the flux calibration curves. to scale thecalibration curves in jy/beam/v, we then use observations of neptune in whichthe beam of each bolometer is mapped using neptune observed in a very fine scanpattern. the total instrumental uncertainties in the flux calibration for theindividual bolometers is ~0.5% for most bolometers, although a few bolometershave uncertainties of ~1-5% because of issues with the neptune observations.based on application of the flux calibration parameters to neptune observationsperformed using typical scan map observing modes, we determined thatmeasurements from each array as a whole have instrumental uncertainties of1.5%. this is considerably less than the absolute calibration uncertaintyassociated with the model of neptune, which is estimated at 4%.

1310.3227	hermes: dust attenuation and star formation activity in uv-selected  samples from z~4 to z~1.5	we study the link between observed ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, anddust attenuation within rest-frame uv-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. wemeasure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the herschel/spire images fromthe hermes program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellarmass and uv luminosity. we find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated withstellar mass. there is also a secondary dependence with uv luminosity: at agiven uv luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at agiven stellar mass it decreases with uv luminosity. we provide new empiricalrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed uv luminosity andthe stellar mass. our results also enable us to put new constraints on theaverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and1.5. the star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by powerlaws (sfr~ m^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, anddecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. we furtherinvestigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular atz~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3&lt;z&lt;4. current model predictions(either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with thesevalues, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshiftrange we explore. we use these results to discuss the star formation historiesof galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. ourresults suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5&lt;z&lt;4) stay around 1 gyr onthe main sequence. with decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1main sequence galaxies with 10^8&lt;m_*/msun&lt;10^10 stay on the main sequence untilz=0.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1405.0313	warm molecular gas in luminous infrared galaxies	we present our initial results on the co rotational spectral line energydistribution (sled) of the $j$ to $j$$-$1 transitions from $j=4$ up to $13$from herschel spire spectroscopic observations of 65 luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) in the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the observedsleds change on average from one peaking at $j \le 4$ to a broad distributionpeaking around $j \sim\,$6$-$7 as the iras 60-to-100 um color, $c(60/100)$,increases. however, the ratios of a co line luminosity to the total infraredluminosity, $l_{\rm ir}$, show the smallest variation for $j$ around 6 or 7.this suggests that, for most lirgs, ongoing star formation (sf) is alsoresponsible for a warm gas component that emits co lines primarily in themid-$j$ regime ($5 \lesssim j \lesssim 10$). as a result, the logarithmicratios of the co line luminosity summed over co (5$-$4), (6$-$5), (7$-$6),(8$-$7) and (10$-$9) transitions to $l_{\rm ir}$, $\log r_{\rm midco}$, remainlargely independent of $c(60/100)$, and show a mean value of $-4.13$ ($\equiv\log r^{\rm sf}_{\rm midco}$) and a sample standard deviation of only 0.10 forthe sf-dominated galaxies. including additional galaxies from the literature,we show, albeit with small number of cases, the possibility that galaxies,which bear powerful interstellar shocks unrelated to the current sf, andgalaxies, in which an energetic active galactic nucleus contributessignificantly to the bolometric luminosity, have their $r_{\rm midco}$ higherand lower than $r^{\rm sf}_{\rm midco}$, respectively.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1409.5482	strong far-ir cooling lines, peculiar co kinematics and possible star  formation suppression in hickson compact group 57	we present [c ii] and [o i] observations from herschel and co(1-0) maps fromthe combined array for{\dag} research in millimeter astronomy (carma) of thehickson compact group hcg 57, focusing on the galaxies hcg 57a and hcg 57d. hcg57a has been previously shown to contain enhanced quantities of warm molecularhydrogen consistent with shock and/or turbulent heating. our observations showthat hcg 57d has strong [c ii] emission compared to l$_{\rm fir}$ and weakco(1-0), while in hcg 57a, both the [c ii] and co(1-0) are strong. hcg 57a liesat the upper end of the normal distribution of [c ii]/co and [c ii]/fir ratios,and its far-ir cooling supports a low density warm diffuse gas that falls closeto the boundary of acceptable pdr models. however, the power radiated in the [cii] and warm h$_2$ emission have similar magnitudes, as seen in othershock-dominated systems and predicted by recent models. we suggest thatshock-heating of the [c ii] is a viable alternative to photoelectric heating inviolently disturbed diffuse gas. the existence of shocks is also consistentwith peculiar co kinematics in the galaxy, indicating highly non-circularmotions are present. these kinematically disturbed co regions also showevidence of suppressed star formation, falling a factor of 10-30 below normalgalaxies on the kennicutt-schmidt relation. we suggest that the peculiarproperties of both galaxies are consistent with a highly dissipative off-centercollisional encounter between hcg 57d and 57a, creating ring-like morphologiesin both systems. highly dissipative gas-on-gas collisions may be more common indense groups because of the likelihood of repeated multiple encounters. thepossibility of shock-induced sf suppression may explain why a subset of thesehcg galaxies have been found previously to fall in the mid-infrared greenvalley.

1411.1111	alma observations of warm dense gas in ngc 1614 --- breaking of star  formation law in the central kpc	we present alma cycle-0 observations of the co (6-5) line emission and of the435um dust continuum emission in the central kpc of ngc 1614, a local luminousinfrared galaxy (lirg) at a distance of 67.8 mpc (1 arcsec = 329 pc). the coemission is well resolved by the alma beam (0".26 x 0".20) into acircum-nuclear ring, with an integrated flux of f_{co(6-5)} = 898 (+-153) jykm/s, which is 63(+-12)% of the total co(6-5) flux measured by herschel. themolecular ring, located between 100pc &lt; r &lt; 350pc from the nucleus, looksclumpy and includes seven unresolved (or marginally resolved) knots with medianvelocity dispersion of 40 km/s. these knots are associated with strong starformation regions with \sigma_{sfr} 100 m_\sun/yr/kpc^{2} and \sigma_{gas}1.0e4 m_\sun/pc^{2}. the non-detections of the nucleus in both the co (6-5)line emission and the 435um continuum rule out, with relatively highconfidence, a compton-thick agn in ngc 1614. comparisons with radio continuumemission show a strong deviation from an expected local correlation between\sigma_{gas} and \sigma_{sfr}, indicating a breakdown of the kennicutt-schmidtlaw on the linear scale of 100 pc.

1509.05779	star formation suppression in compact group galaxies: a new path to  quenching?	we present co(1-0) maps of 12 warm h$_2$-selected hickson compact groups(hcgs), covering 14 individually imaged warm h$_2$ bright galaxies, with carma.we found a variety of molecular gas distributions within the hcgs, includingregularly rotating disks, bars, rings, tidal tails, and possibly nuclearoutflows, though the molecular gas morphologies are more consistent withspirals and early-type galaxies than mergers and interacting systems. ourco-imaged hcg galaxies show star formation suppression of$\langle$s$\rangle$=10$\pm$5, distributed bimodally, with five objectsexhibiting suppressions of s$\gtrsim$10 and depletion timescales$\gtrsim$10gyr. this star formation inefficiency is also seen in the efficiencyper freefall time. we investigate the gas-to-dust ratios of these galaxies todetermine if an incorrect conversion caused the apparent suppression and findthat hcgs have normal ratios. it is likely that the cause of the suppression inthese objects is associated with shocks injecting turbulence into the moleculargas. galaxies with high star formation suppression (s$\gtrsim$10) also appearto be those in the most advanced stages of transition across optical andinfrared color space. this supports the idea that some galaxies in hcgs aretransitioning objects, where a disruption of the existing molecular gas in thesystem suppresses star formation by inhibiting the molecular gas fromcollapsing and forming stars efficiently. these observations, combined withrecent work on poststarburst galaxies with molecular reservoirs, indicates thatgalaxies do not need to expel their molecular reservoirs prior to quenchingstar formation and transitioning from blue spirals to red early-type galaxies.this may imply that star formation quenching can occur without the need tostarve a galaxy of cold gas first.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0212344	models for evolution of dusty galaxies and e/s0s seen in multiband  surveys	phenomenological models for evolution of dusty galaxies and e/s0 galaxies,respectively, are developed to address two major questions concenring galaxypopulations in deep infrared (ir) surveys: (1) do normal late-type galaxies orstarburst galaxies (including galaxies with obscured agns) dominate amongsources in deep ir surveys? (2) how much do e/s0 galaxies contribute to thecounts in deep mid-infrared (mir: 3 -- 20$\mu m$) surveys? among three newmodels for evolution of dusty galaxies, it is assumed in model s1 thatstarburst galaxies are the dominant population, and in model s2 that normalgalaxies dominate. model s3 is an intermediate model. comparing the modelpredictions with a wide range of observational data collected from theliterature, we find that none of these models can be ruled out, given theuncertainties of the data. we show that the most direct method to distinguishthese models is to compare the predicted color distributions of ir galaxieswith observations, which will soon be available from the swire survey. themodels for e/s0 galaxies follow a simple passive evolution approach. among thethree e/s0 models (e1, e2 and e3) investigated in this paper, model e2 which isspecified by a peak formation redshift $z_{peak}=2$, and an e-folding formationtime scale $\omega=2$ gyr, fits the data best. this suggests a synchronizationbetween the evolution of e/s0 galaxies and of starburst galaxies, in the sensethat the peak of the formation function of e/s0s ($z_{peak}=2$) is close to thepeak of the evolution functions of starburst galaxies ($z_{peak} = 1.4$). newpredictions for counts and confusion limits in the sirtf bands are presented.

astro-ph;0402174	nir luminosity function of galaxies in close major-merger pairs and mass  dependence of merger rate	a sample of close major-merger pairs (projected separation ${\rm 5 \leq r\leq 20 h^{-1}}$ kpc, ${\rm k_s}$ band magnitude difference $\delta {\rm k_s}\leq 1$ mag) is selected from the matched 2mass-2dfgrs catalog of cole et al.(2001). the pair primaries are brighter than ${\rm k_s} = 12.5$ mag. aftercorrections for various biases, the comparison between counts in the pairedgalaxy sample and counts in the parent sample shows that for the local `m*galaxies' sampled by flux limited surveys, the fraction of galaxies in theclose major-merger pairs is 1.70$\pm 0.32%$. using 38 paired galaxies in thesample, a ${\rm k_s}$ band luminosity function (lf) is calculated. this is thefirst unbiased lf for a sample of objectively defined interacting/merginggalaxies in the local universe, while all previously determined lfs of pairedgalaxies are biased by mistreating paired galaxies as singles. a stellar massfunction (mf) is translated from the lf. compared to the lf/mf of 2massgalaxies, a differential pair fraction function is derived. the results suggesta trend in the sense that less massive galaxies may have lower chance to beinvolved in close major-merger pairs than more massive galaxies. the algorithmpresented in this paper can be easily applied to much larger samples of 2massgalaxies with redshifts in near future.

astro-ph;0411343	dust attenuation in the nearby universe: comparison between galaxies  selected in the ultraviolet or in the infrared	we compare the dust attenuation properties of two samples of galaxies purelyselected in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) band (1750-2750 a, lambda_m = 2310 a)and in the far-infrared (fir) at 60micron. these samples are built using thegalex and iras sky surveys over ~600 square degrees. the nuv selected samplecontains 95 galaxies detected down to nuv=16mag (ab system). 83 galaxies inthis sample are spirals or irregulars and only two of them are not detected at60micron. the fir selected sample is built from the iras pscz catalog completedown to 0.6jy. among the 163 sources, we select 118 star forming galaxies wellmeasured by iras, all but 1 are detected in nuv and 14 galaxies are notdetected in the far-ultraviolet (fuv) band (1350-1750 a, lambda_m = 1530 a).the dust to ultraviolet (nuv and fuv) flux ratio is calibrated to estimate thedust attenuation at both wavelengths. the median value of the attenuation innuv is found to be ~1 mag for the nuv selected sample versus ~2 mag for the firselected one. within both samples, the dust attenuation is found to correlatewith the luminosity of the galaxies. almost all the nuv selected galaxies and2/3 of the fir selected sample exhibit a lower dust attenuation than thatexpected from the tight relation found previously for starburst galaxiesbetween the dust attenuation and the slope of the ultraviolet continuum. thesituation is inverse for one third of the fir selected galaxies: theirextinction is higher than that deduced from their fuv-nuv color and therelation valid for starbursts.

astro-ph;0412476	complete multiwavelength characterization of faint chandra x-ray sources  seen in the spitzer wide-area ir extragalactic (swire) survey	we exploit deep combined observations with spitzer and chandra of the swiresurvey in the elais-n1 region, to investigate the nature of the faint x-ray andir sources in common, to identify agn/starburst diagnostics, and to study thesources of the x-ray and ir cosmic backgrounds. in the 17'x17' area of thechandra acis-i image there are 3400 swire near-ir sources with 4 sigmadetections in at least 2 irac bands and 988 sources detected at 24micron withmips brighter than 0.1 mjy. of these, 102 irac and 59 mips sources have chandracounterparts, out of a total of 122 x-ray sources present in the area withs(0.5-8 kev)&gt;10^(-15) erg/cm^2/s. we have constructed seds for each sourceusing data from the 4 irac wavebands, chandra fluxes, and optical follow-updata in the wavebands u, g', r', i', z, and h. we fit a number of spectraltemplates to the seds at optical and infrared wavelengths to determinephotometric redshifts and spectral categories, and also make use of diagnosticsbased on the x-ray luminosities, hardness ratios, x-ray to infrared spectralslopes and optical morphologies. although we have spectroscopic redshifts foronly a minority of the chandra sources, the available seds constrain theredshifts for most of the sample sources, which turn out to be typically at0.5&lt;z&lt;2. we find that 39% of the chandra sources are dominated by type-1 agnemission, 23% display optical/ir spectra typical of type-2 agns, while theremaining 38% fraction show starburst-like or even normal galaxy spectra. sincewe prove that all these galaxies are dominated by agn emission in x-rays thisbrings the fraction of type-1 agns to be 80% of the type-2: even assuming thatall the chandra sources undetected by spitzer are type-2 agns, the type-1fraction would exceed 1/3 of the total population (abridged).

astro-ph;0508456	morphological studies of the swire galaxy population in the ugc 10214  hst/acs field	we present results of a morphological analysis of a small subset of thespitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic survey (swire) galaxy population. theanalysis is based on public acs data taken inside the swire n1 field, which arethe deepest optical high-resolution imaging available within the swire fieldsas of today. our reference sample includes 156 galaxies detected by both acsand swire. among the various galaxy morphologies, we disentangle two mainclasses, spheroids (or bulge-dominated galaxies) and disk-dominated ones, forwhich we compute the number counts as a function of flux. we then limit oursample to objects with irac fluxes brighter than 10 microjy, estimated ~90%completeness limit of the swire catalogues, and compare the observed counts tomodel predictions. we find that the observed counts of the spheroidalpopulation agree with the expectations of a hierarchical model while amonolithic scenario predicts steeper counts. both scenaria, however,under-predict the number of late-type galaxies. these observations show thatthe large majority (close to 80 per cent) of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxypopulation, even at these moderately faint fluxes, is dominated by spiral andirregular galaxies or mergers.

astro-ph;0609738	the local universe as seen in far-infrared and in far-ultraviolet: a  global point of view on the local recent star formation	we select far-infrared (fir-60 microns) and far-ultraviolet (fuv-1530 a)samples of nearby galaxies in order to discuss the biases encountered bymonochromatic surveys (fir or fuv). very different volumes are sampled by eachselection and much care is taken to apply volume corrections to all theanalyses. the distributions of the bolometric luminosity of young stars arecompared for both samples: they are found to be consistent with each other forgalaxies of intermediate luminosities but some differences are found for high(&gt;5 10^{10} l_sun) luminosities. the shallowness of the iras survey prevents usfrom securing comparison at low luminosities (&lt;2 10^9 l_sun). the ratio of thetotal infrared (tir) luminosity to the fuv luminosity is found to increase withthe bolometric luminosity in a similar way for both samples up to 5 10^{10}l_sun. brighter galaxies are found to have a different behavior according totheir selection: the l_tir/l_fuv ratio of the fuv-selected galaxies brighterthan 5 10^{10} l_sun reaches a plateau whereas l_tir/l_fuv continues toincrease with the luminosity of bright galaxies selected in fir. thevolume-averaged specific star formation rate (sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass,ssfr) is found to decrease toward massive galaxies within each selection. thessfr is found to be larger than that measured for optical and nir-selectedsample over the whole mass range for the fir selection, and for masses largerthan 10^{10} m_sun for the fuv selection. luminous and massive galaxiesselected in fir appear as active as galaxies with similar characteristicsdetected at z ~ 0.7.

astro-ph;0703014	the ultraviolet properties of luminous infrared galaxies at z ~ 0.7: is  there any evolution in their dust attenuation?	the tir and fuv luminosity functions of galaxies and the related luminositydensities rho(tir) and rho(fuv) are known to evolve from z=0 to z~1 but with adifferent rate: the galaxy populations appear brighter in the past at bothwavelengths but the evolution in tir is larger than in fuv. it leads to anincrease of the ratio of tir to fuv luminosity densities rho(tir)/rho(fuv)which can be interpreted as a global increase of the dust attenuation from z=0to z~1. our aim is to understand the origin of this increase. we focus oninfrared galaxies with l(tir&gt;10^{11} lsun at z~0.7 observed by spitzer/mips andwe measure their uv emission at 2310 a from galex. these luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs) represent the bulk of the tir luminosity density atintermediate redshift. some evolution of l(tir)/l(fuv) and therefore of dustattenuation is found for these galaxies: lirgs at z=0.7 span a larger range ofl(tir)/l(fuv) ratios than at z=0 and their mean dust attenuation at fuv isfound ~0.5 mag lower than for their local counterparts. the decrease of dustattenuation is found lower than that reported in other studies for brightgalaxies selected in uv rest-frame at z=1 and 2. from a semi-quantitativeanalysis we find that the slight decrease of dust attenuation for lirgs atz=0.7 remains consistent with the increase of rho(tir)/rho(fuv) with redshift.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
