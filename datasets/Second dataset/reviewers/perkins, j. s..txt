0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1005.0367	veritas 2008 - 2009 monitoring of the variable gamma-ray source m87	m87 is a nearby radio galaxy that is detected at energies ranging from radioto vhe gamma-rays. its proximity and its jet, misaligned from ourline-of-sight, enable detailed morphological studies and extensive modeling atradio, optical, and x-ray energies. flaring activity was observed at allenergies, and multi-wavelength correlations would help clarify the origin ofthe vhe emission. in this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectralanalysis of the veritas vhe gamma-ray observations of m87 in 2008 and 2009. inthe 2008 observing season, veritas detected an excess with a statisticalsignificance of 7.2 sigma from m87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoringcampaign conducted by three major vhe experiments along with the chandra x-rayobservatory. in february 2008, veritas observed a vhe flare from m87 occurringover a 4-day timespan. the peak nightly flux above 250gev was 7.7% of the crabnebula flux. m87 was marginally detected before this 4-day flare period, andwas not detected afterwards. spectral analysis of the veritas observationsshowed no significant change in the photon index between the flare andpre-flare states. shortly after the vhe flare seen by veritas, the chandrax-ray observatory detected the flux from the core of m87 at a historicalmaximum, while the flux from the nearby knot hst-1 remained quiescent. acciariet al. (2009) presented the 2008 contemporaneous vhe gamma-ray, chandra x-ray,and vlba radio observations which suggest the core as the most likely source ofvhe emission, in contrast to the 2005 vhe flare that was simultaneous with anx-ray flare in the hst-1 knot. in 2009, veritas continued its monitoring of m87and marginally detected a 4.2 sigma excess corresponding to a flux of ~1% ofthe crab nebula. no vhe flaring activity was observed in 2009.

1006.5955	veritas search for vhe gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies	indirect dark matter searches with ground-based gamma-ray observatoriesprovide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter thatis complementary to that of direct search or accelerator productionexperiments. we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies draco, ursa minor, bootes 1, and willman 1 conducted by veritas. thesegalaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distanceof several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of thedark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. since theconventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from theseobjects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for thesecondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matterparticles. no significant gamma-ray flux above 200 gev was detected from thesefour dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. the 95% confidenceupper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12photons cm^-2s^-1. we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints onthe thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section andthe relative velocity of the wimps. the limits are obtained under conservativeassumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and areapproximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoreticalprediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as wellas the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions couldfurther lower the limits.

1202.2144	veritas deep observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy segue 1	the veritas array of cherenkov telescopes has carried out a deepobservational program on the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy segue 1. we reporton the results of nearly 48 hours of good quality selected data, taken betweenjanuary 2010 and may 2011. no significant $\gamma$-ray emission is detected atthe nominal position of segue 1, and upper limits on the integrated flux arederived. according to recent studies, segue 1 is the most dark matter-dominateddwarf spheroidal galaxy currently known. we derive stringent bounds on variousannihilating and decaying dark matter particle models. the upper limits on thevelocity-weighted annihilation cross-section are $\mathrm{&lt;\sigma v &gt;^{95% cl}\lesssim 10^{-23} cm^{3} s^{-1}}$, improving our limits from previousobservations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies by at least a factor of two for darkmatter particle masses $\mathrm{m_{\chi}\gtrsim 300 gev}$. the lower limits onthe decay lifetime are at the level of $\mathrm{\tau^{95% cl} \gtrsim 10^{24}s}$. finally, we address the interpretation of the cosmic ray lepton anomaliesmeasured by atic and pamela in terms of dark matter annihilation, and show thatthe veritas observations of segue 1 disfavor such a scenario.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1401.0548	fermi-lat detection of gravitational lens delayed gamma-ray flares from  blazar b0218+357	using data from the fermi large area telescope (lat), we report the firstclear gamma-ray measurement of a delay between flares from the gravitationallylensed images of a blazar. the delay was detected in b0218+357, a knowndouble-image lensed system, during a period of enhanced gamma-ray activity withpeak fluxes consistently observed to reach &gt;20-50 times its previous averageflux. an auto-correlation function analysis identified a delay in the gamma-raydata of 11.46 +/- 0.16 days (1 sigma) that is ~1 day greater than previousradio measurements. considering that it is beyond the capabilities of the latto spatially resolve the two images, we nevertheless decomposed individualsequences of superposing gamma-ray flares/delayed emissions. in three such~8-10 day-long sequences within a ~4-month span, considering confusion due tooverlapping flaring emission and flux measurement uncertainties, we found fluxratios consistent with ~1, thus systematically smaller than those from radioobservations. during the first, best-defined flare, the delayed emission wasdetailed with a fermi pointing, and we observed flux doubling timescales of~3-6 hrs implying as well extremely compact gamma-ray emitting regions.

1401.2828	observations of the unidentified gamma-ray source tev j2032+4130 by  veritas	tev j2032+4130 was the first unidentified source discovered at very highenergies (vhe; e $&gt;$ 100 gev), with no obvious counterpart in any otherwavelength. it is also the first extended source to be observed in vhe gammarays. following its discovery, intensive observational campaigns have beencarried out in all wavelengths in order to understand the nature of the object,which have met with limited success. we report here on a deep observation oftev j2032+4130, based on 48.2 hours of data taken from 2009 to 2012 by theveritas (very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system) experiment.the source is detected at 8.7 standard deviations ($\sigma$) and is found to beextended and asymmetric with a width of 9.5$^{\prime}$$\pm$1.2$^{\prime}$ alongthe major axis and 4.0$^{\prime}$$\pm$0.5$^{\prime}$ along the minor axis. thespectrum is well described by a differential power law with an index of 2.10$\pm$ 0.14$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 0.21$_{sys}$ and a normalization of (9.5 $\pm$1.6$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 2.2$_{sys}$) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev. we interpret these results in the context of multiwavelengthscenarios which particularly favor the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) interpretation.

1410.3696	the spectrum of isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 100 mev and  820 gev	the {\gamma}-ray sky can be decomposed into individually detected sources,diffuse emission attributed to the interactions of galactic cosmic rays withgas and radiation fields, and a residual all-sky emission component commonlycalled the isotropic diffuse {\gamma}-ray background (igrb). the igrb comprisesall extragalactic emissions too faint or too diffuse to be resolved in a givensurvey, as well as any residual galactic foregrounds that are approximatelyisotropic. the first igrb measurement with the large area telescope (lat) onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fermi) used 10 months of sky-surveydata and considered an energy range between 200 mev and 100 gev. improvementsin event selection and characterization of cosmic-ray backgrounds, betterunderstanding of the diffuse galactic emission, and a longer data accumulationof 50 months, allow for a refinement and extension of the igrb measurement withthe lat, now covering the energy range from 100 mev to 820 gev. the igrbspectrum shows a significant high-energy cutoff feature, and can be welldescribed over nearly four decades in energy by a power law with exponentialcutoff having a spectral index of $2.32\pm0.02$ and a break energy of$(279\pm52)$ gev using our baseline diffuse galactic emission model. the totalintensity attributed to the igrb is $(7.2\pm0.6) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ above 100 mev, with an additional $+15$%/$-30$% systematicuncertainty due to the galactic diffuse foregrounds.

1410.5367	constraints on very high energy emission from grb 130427a	prompt emission from the very fluent and nearby (z=0.34) gamma-ray burst grb130427a was detected by several orbiting telescopes and by ground-based,wide-field-of-view optical transient monitors. apart from the intensity andproximity of this grb, it is exceptional due to the extremely long-livedhigh-energy (100 mev to 100 gev) gamma-ray emission, which was detected by thelarge area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope for ~70 ks afterthe initial burst. the persistent, hard-spectrum, high-energy emission suggeststhat the highest-energy gamma rays may have been produced via synchrotronself-compton processes though there is also evidence that the high-energyemission may instead be an extension of the synchrotron spectrum. veritas, aground-based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope array, began follow-upobservations of grb 130427a ~71 ks (~20 hr) after the onset of the burst. thegrb was not detected with veritas; however, the high elevation of theobservations, coupled with the low redshift of the grb, make veritas a verysensitive probe of the emission from grb 130427a for e &gt; 100 gev. thenon-detection and consequent upper limit derived place constraints on thesynchrotron self-compton model of high-energy gamma-ray emission from thisburst.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

astro-ph;0511575	thick pixelated czt detectors with isolated steering grids	we explore the possibility to improve the performance of 0.5 cm thick cadmiumzinc telluride (czt) detectors with the help of steering grids on the anodeside of the detectors. steering grids can improve the energy resolution of cztdetectors by enhancing the small pixel effect; furthermore, they can increasetheir detection efficiency by steering electrons to the anode pixels whichotherwise would drift to the area between pixels. previously, the benefit ofsteering grids had been compromised by additional noise associated withcurrents between the steering grids and the anode pixels. we use thin filmdeposition techniques to isolate the steering grid from the czt substrate by a150 nm thick layer of the isolator aluminiumoxide. while the thin layer doesnot affect the beneficial effect of the steering grid on the weightingpotentials and the electric field inside the detector, it suppresses thecurrents between the steering grid and the anode pixels. in this contribution,we present first results from a 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm czt detector with 8 x 8 pixelsthat we tested before and after deposition of an isolated steering grid. thesteering grid improves the 662 kev energy resolution of the detector by afactor of 1.3 (from about 2% to about 1.5%), while not reducing the detectionefficiency. to gain further insights into the detector response in the regionbetween pixels, we measured energy spectra with a collimated cs137 source. thecollimator measurements can be used to enhance our understanding of energyspectra measured under flood illumination of the detectors.
