0903.4174	first stars xii. abundances in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars,and  comparison with the giants	context:the detailed chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor (emp) starsare key guides to understanding the early chemical evolution of the galaxy.most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experiencedinternal mixing later. aims: we aim to compare the results for giants with new,accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 emp turnoff stars.methods:vlt/uves spectra at r ~45,000 and s/n~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) areanalysed with osmarcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrum code to deriveabundances for c, mg, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, co, ni, zn, sr, and ba. results:for ca, ni, sr, and ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sampleof emp giants, at all metallicities. however, our abundances of c, sc, ti, cr,mn and co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. mg and siabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [mg/fe] values are slightly revised),while zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [fe/h] (6 starsonly). conclusions:for c, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have anastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomingsin the analysis. approximate computations of granulation (3d) effects yieldsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is anunlikely explanation, except perhaps for c, cr, and mn. nlte computations forna and al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike thelte results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements aswell. meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data forgalactic chemical evolution models.

0908.3603	vlt-flames analysis of 8 giants in the bulge metal-poor globular cluster  ngc 6522: oldest cluster in the galaxy?	ngc 6522 has been the first metal-poor globular cluster identified in thebulge by w. baade. despite its importance, very few high resolution abundanceanalyses of stars in this cluster are available in the literature. the bulgemetal-poor clusters may be important tracers of the early chemical enrichmentof the galaxy. the main purpose of this study is the determination ofmetallicity and elemental ratios in individual stars of ngc 6522. highresolution spectra of 8 giants of the bulge globular cluster ngc 6522 wereobtained at the 8m vlt ut2-kueyen telescope with the flames+giraffespectrograph. multiband v,i,j,ks} photometry was used to derive effectivetemperatures as reference values. spectroscopic parameters are derived from feiand feii lines, and adopted for the derivation of abundance ratios. the presentanalysis provides a metallicity [fe/h] = -1.0+-0.2. the alpha-elements oxygen,magnesium and silicon show [o/fe]=+0.4, [mg/fe]=[si/fe]= +0.25, whereas calciumand titanium show shallower ratios of [ca/fe]=[ti/fe]=+0.15. theneutron-capture r-process element europium appears to be overabundant by[eu/fe]=+0.4. the neutron-capture s-elements la and ba are enhanced by[la/fe]=+0.35 and [ba/fe]=+0.5. the large internal errors, indicating the largestar-to-star variationin the ba and eu abundances, are also discussed. themoderate metallicity combined to a blue horizontal branch (bhb), arecharacteristics similar to those of hp~1 and ngc 6558, pointing to a populationof very old globular clusters in the galactic bulge. also, the abundance ratiosin ngc 6522 resemble those in hp 1 and ngc 6558. the ultimate conclusion isthat the bulge is old, and went through an early prompt chemical enrichment.

0910.0448	chemical abundances for 11 bulge stars from high-resolution, near-ir  spectra	it is debated whether the milky way bulge has the characteristics of aclassical bulge sooner than those of a pseudobulge. detailed abundance studiesof bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classificationof the bulge. the aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulgeand to study detailed abundances determined from near-ir spectra for bulgegiants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing thestellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the presentstudy. especially, the important cno elements are better determined in thenear-ir. high-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the h band are recordedusing the crires spectrometer on the very large telescope. the cno abundancescan all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength rangeobserved. abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-irspectra. [o/fe], [si/fe] and [s/fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of atleast [fe/h]=-0.3, after which they decline. this suggests that the milky waybulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of aclassical bulge. however, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend ofthe local thick disk seems present. such a similarity could suggest that thebulge has a pseudobulge origin. our [c/fe] trend does not show any increasewith [fe/h] which could have been expected if w-r stars have contributedsubstantially to the c abundances. no "cosmic scatter" can be traced around ourobserved abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given theobservational uncertainties.

0912.1056	vista variables in the via lactea (vvv): the public eso near-ir  variability survey of the milky way	we describe the public eso near-ir variability survey (vvv) scanning themilky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane where star formationactivity is high. the survey will take 1929 hours of observations with the4-metre vista telescope during five years (2010-2014), covering ~10^9 pointsources across an area of 520 deg^2, including 33 known globular clusters and~350 open clusters. the final product will be a deep near-ir atlas in fivepassbands (0.9-2.5 microns) and a catalogue of more than 10^6 variable pointsources. unlike single-epoch surveys that, in most cases, only produce 2-dmaps, the vvv variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-d map ofthe surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as rr lyraestars, and cepheids. it will yield important information on the ages of thepopulations. the observations will be combined with data from macho, ogle,eros, vst, spitzer, hst, chandra, integral, wise, fermi lat, xmm-newton, gaiaand alma for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the innermilky way. this public survey will provide data available to the wholecommunity and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the milkyway, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the galacticbulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions inthe disk. the combined variable star catalogues will have importantimplications for theoretical investigations of pulsation properties of stars.

1001.1834	beryllium abundances and the formation of the halo and the thick disk	the single stable isotope of beryllium is a pure product of cosmic-rayspallation in the ism. assuming that the cosmic-rays are globally transportedacross the galaxy, the beryllium production should be a widespread process andits abundance should be roughly homogeneous in the early-galaxy at a giventime. thus, it could be useful as a tracer of time. in an investigation of theuse of be as a cosmochronometer and of its evolution in the galaxy, we foundevidence that in a log(be/h) vs. [alpha/fe] diagram the halo stars separateinto two components. one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary modelswhile the other is chemically indistinguishable from the thick-disk stars. thisis interpreted as a difference in the star formation history of the twocomponents and suggests that the local halo is not a single uniform populationwhere a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. we also found evidencethat the star formation rate was lower in the outer regions of the thick disk,pointing towards an inside-out formation.

1002.0805	probing the lmc age gap at intermediate cluster masses	the lmc has a rich star cluster system spanning a wide range of ages andmasses. one striking feature of the lmc cluster system is the existence of anage gap between 3-10 gyrs. but this feature is not as clearly seen among fieldstars. three lmc fields containing relatively poor and sparse clusters whoseintegrated colours are consistent with those of intermediate age simple stellarpopulations have been imaged in bvi with the optical imager (soi) at thesouthern telescope for astrophysical research (soar). a total of 6 clusters, 5of them with estimated initial masses m &lt; 10^4m_sun, were studied in thesefields. photometry was performed and colour-magnitude diagrams (cmd) were builtusing standard point spread function fitting methods. the faintest starsmeasured reach v ~ 23. the cmd was cleaned from field contamination by makinguse of the three-dimensional colour and magnitude space available in order toselect stars in excess relative to the field. a statistical cmd comparisonmethod was developed for this purpose. the subtraction method has proven to besuccessful, yielding cleaned cmds consistent with a simple stellar population.the intermediate age candidates were found to be the oldest in our sample, withages between 1-2 gyrs. the remaining clusters found in the soar/soi have agesranging from 100 to 200 myrs. our analysis has conclusively shown that none ofthe relatively low-mass clusters studied by us belongs to the lmc age-gap.

1005.3919	insights on the milky way bulge formation from the correlations between  kinematics and metallicity	two main scenarios for the formation of the galactic bulge are invoked, thefirst one through gravitational collapse or hierarchical merging of subclumps,the second through secular evolution of the galactic disc. we aim to constrainthe formation of the galactic bulge through studies of the correlation betweenkinematics and metallicities in baade's window (l=1, b=-4) and two other fieldsalong the bulge minor axis (l=0, b=-6 and b=-12). we combine the radialvelocity and the [fe/h] measurements obtained with flames/giraffe at the vltwith a spectral resolution of r=20000, plus for the baade's window field theogle-ii proper motions, and compare these with published n-body simulations ofthe galactic bulge. we confirm the presence of two distinct populations inbaade's window found in hill et al. 2010: the metal-rich population presentsbar-like kinematics while the metal-poor population shows kinematicscorresponding to an old spheroid or a thick disc one. in this context themetallicity gradient along the bulge minor axis observed by zoccali et al.(2008), visible also in the kinematics, can be related to a varying mix ofthese two populations as one moves away from the galactic plane, alleviatingthe apparent contradiction between the kinematic evidence of a bar and theexistence of a metallicity gradient. we show evidences that the two mainscenarios for the bulge formation co-exist within the milky way bulge.

0708.2790	spectral models for solar-scaled and alpha-enhanced stellar populations	we present the first models allowing one to explore in a consistent way theinfluence of changes in the alpha-element-to-iron abundance ratio on thehigh-resolution spectral properties of evolving stellar populations. the modelscover the wavelength range 300-1340nm at a resolution of fwhm=1aa, formetallicities in the range 0.005&lt;=z&lt;=0.048 and stellar population ages 3 to 14gyr. these models are based on a recent library of synthetic stellar spectraand a new library of stellar evolutionary tracks, both computed for threedifferent [fe/h] (-0.5,0.0 and 0.2) and two different [alpha/fe] (0.0 and 0.4).we expect our fully synthetic models to be primarily useful for evaluating thedifferential effect of changes in the alpha/fe ratio on spectral propertiessuch as broad-band colours and narrow spectral features. in addition, we assessthe accuracy of absolute model predictions in two ways: first, by comparing thepredictions of models for scaled-solar metal abundances [alpha/fe]=0.0) tothose of existing models based on libraries of observed stellar spectra; andsecondly, by comparing the predictions of models for alpha-enhanced metalabundances ([alpha/fe]=0.4) to observed spectra of massive early-type galaxiesin the sdss-dr4. we find that our models predict accurate strengths for thosespectral indices that are strongly sensitive to the abundances of fe and alphaelements. the predictions are less reliable for the strengths of other spectralfeatures, such as those dominated by the abundances of c and n, as expectedfrom the fact that the models do not yet allow one to explore the influence ofthese elements in an independent way. we conclude that our models are apowerful tool for extracting new information about the chemical properties ofgalaxies for which high-quality spectra have been gathered by modern surveys.

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

1107.5199	the metallicity distribution of bulge clump giants in baade's window	we seek to constrain the formation of the galactic bulge by means ofanalysing the detailed chemical composition of a large sample of red clumpstars in baade's window. we measure [fe/h] in a sample of 219 bulge red clumpstars from r=20000 resolution spectra obtained with flames/giraffe at the vlt,using an automatic procedure, differentially to the metal-rich local referencestar muleo. for a subsample of 162 stars, we also derive [mg/h] from spectralsynthesis around the mgi triplet at 6319a. the fe and mg metallicitydistributions are both asymmetric, with median values of +0.16 and +0.21respectively. the iron distribution is clearly bimodal, as revealed both by adeconvolution (from observational errors) and a gaussian decomposition. thedecomposition of the observed fe and mg metallicity distributions into gaussiancomponents yields two populations of equal sizes (50% each): a metal-poorcomponent centred around [fe/h]=-0.30 and [mg/h]=-0.06 with a large dispersionand a narrow metal-rich component centred around [fe/h]=+0.32 and [mg/h]=+0.35.the metal poor component shows high [mg/fe] ratios (around 0.3) whereas starsin the metal rich component are found to have near solar ratios. babusiaux etal. (2010) also find kinematical differences between the two components: themetal poor component shows kinematics compatible with an old spheroid whereasthe metal rich component is consistent with a population supporting a bar. inview of their chemical and kinematical properties, we suggest differentformation scenarios for the two populations: a rapid formation timescale as anold spheroid for the metal poor component (old bulge) and for the metal richcomponent, a formation over a longer time scale driven by the evolution of thebar (pseudo-bulge).

1310.4108	manganese abundances in galactic bulge red giants	manganese is mainly produced in type ii sne during explosive silicon burning,in incomplete si-burning regions, and depends on several nucleosynthesisenvironment conditions, such as mass cut beween the matter ejected and fallingback onto the remnant, electron and neutron excesses, mixing fallback, andexplosion energy. manganese is also produced in type ia sne. the aim of thiswork is the study of abundances of the iron-peak element mn in 56 bulge giants,among which 13 are red clump stars. four bulge fields along the minor axis areinspected. the study of abundances of mn-over-fe as a function of metallicityin the galactic bulge may shed light on its production mechanisms.high-resolution spectra were obtained using the flames+uves spectrograph on thevery large telescope. the spectra were obtained within a program to observe 800stars using the giraffe spectrograph, together with the present uves spectra.we aim at identifying the chemical evolution of manganese, as a function ofmetallicity, in the galactic bulge. we find [mn/fe] ~-0.7 at [fe/h]~-1.3,increasing to a solar value at metallicities close to solar, and showing aspread around -0.7&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, in good agreement with other work on mn inbulge stars. there is also good agreement with chemical evolution models. wefind no clear difference in the behaviour of the four bulge fields. whereas[mn/fe] vs. [fe/h] could be identified with the behaviour of the thick discstars, [mn/o] vs. [o/h] has a behaviour running parallel, at highermetallicities, compared to thick disc stars, indicating that the bulgeenrichment might have proceeded differently from that of the thick disk.

0804.4124	chemical similarities between galactic bulge and local thick disk red  giant stars	the evolution of the milky way bulge and its relationship with the othergalactic populations is still poorly understood. the bulge has been suggestedto be either a merger-driven classical bulge or the product of a dynamicalinstability of the inner disk. to probe the star formation history, the initialmass function and stellar nucleosynthesis of the bulge, we performed anelemental abundance analysis of bulge red giant stars. we also completed anidentical study of local thin disk, thick disk and halo giants to establish thechemical differences and similarities between the various populations.high-resolution infrared spectra of 19 bulge giants and 49 comparison giants inthe solar neighborhood were acquired with gemini/phoenix. all stars havesimilar stellar parameters but cover a broad range in metallicity. a standard1d local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis yielded the abundances of c, n, oand fe. a homogeneous and differential analysis of the bulge, halo, thin diskand thick disk stars ensured that systematic errors were minimized. we confirmthe well-established differences for [o/fe] (at a given metallicity) betweenthe local thin and thick disks. for the elements investigated, we find nochemical distinction between the bulge and the local thick disk, which is incontrast to previous studies relying on literature values for disk dwarf starsin the solar neighborhood. our findings suggest that the bulge and local thickdisk experienced similar, but not necessarily shared, chemical evolutionhistories. we argue that their formation timescales, star formation rates andinitial mass functions were similar.

astro-ph;0209168	extinction within 10 degrees of the galactic centre using 2mass	we extract j and k_s magnitudes from the 2mass point source catalog forapproximately 6 million stars with 8 &lt; k_s &lt; 13 in order to build an a_kextinction map within 10 degrees of the galactic centre. the extinction wasdetermined by fitting the upper giant branch of (k_s, j-k_s) colour-magnitudediagrams to a dereddened upper giant branch mean locus built from previouslystudied bulge fields. the extinction values vary from a_k=0.05 in the edges ofthe map up to a_k=3.2 close to the galactic centre. the 2mass extinction mapwas compared to that recently derived from denis data. both maps agree verywell up to a_k=1.0. the 2mass extinction values were also compared to thoseobtained from dust emission in the far infrared using dirbe/iras. severalsystematic effects likely to bias this comparison were addressed, including thepresence of dust on the background of the bulk of 2mass stars used in theextinction determination. for the region with $3^{\circ}&lt;|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$, wherethe dust contribution on the far side of the galaxy is $\approx$ 5%, the twoextinction determinations correlate well, but the dust emission a_k values aresystematically higher than those from 2mass. a calibration correction factor of76% for the dirbe/iras dust emission extinction is needed to eliminate thissystematic effect. similar comparisons were also carried out for the$1^{\circ}&lt;|b|&lt;3^{\circ}$ and $|b| &lt; 0.5^{\circ}$ strips. an asymmetry relativeto the galactic plane is observed in the dust maps, roughly in the sense thata_k values are 60% smaller in the south than in the north for$1^{\circ}&lt;|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$. this asymmetry is due to the presence of foregrounddust clouds mostly in the northern region of the bulge.

astro-ph;0610245	first stars vii. lithium in extremely metal poor dwarfs	aims. this study aims to determine the level and constancy of the spiteplateau as definitively as possible from homogeneous high-quality vlt-uvesspectra of 19 of the most metal-poor dwarf stars known. methods. ourhigh-resolution (r ~ 43000), high s/n spectra are analysed with osmarcs 1d ltemodel atmospheres and turbospectrum synthetic spectra to determine effectivetemperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities, as well as li abundancesfor our stars. results. eliminating a cool subgiant and a spectroscopic binary,we find 8 stars to have -3.5 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -3.0 and 9 stars with -3.0 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-2.5. our best value for the mean level of the plateau is a(li) =2.10 +- 0.09.the scatter around the mean is entirely explained by our estimate of theobservational error and does not allow for any intrinsic scatter in the liabundances. in addition, we conclude that a systematic error of the order of200 k in any of the current temperature scales remains possible. the ironexcitation equilibria in our stars support our adopted temperature scale, whichis based on a fit to wings of the halpha line, and disfavour hotter scales,which would lead to a higher li abundance, but fail to achieve excitationequilibrium for iron. conclusions. we confirm the previously noted discrepancybetween the li abundance measured in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars and theprimordial li abundance predicted by standard big-bang nucleosynthesis modelsadopting the baryonic density inferred from wmap. we discuss recent workexplaining the discrepancy in terms of diffusion and find that uncertaintemperature scales remain a major question.

astro-ph;0610346	oxygen, sodium, magnesium and aluminium as tracers of the galactic bulge  formation	this paper investigates the peculiar behaviour of the light even(alpha-elements) and odd atomic number elements in red giants in the galacticbulge, both in terms of the chemical evolution of the bulge, and in terms ofpossible deep-mixing mechanisms in these evolved stars. using uves on vlt, wemeasure the abundances of the four light elements o, na, mg and al in 13 redclump and 40 red giant branch stars in four fields spanning the bulge from b=-3to -12\deg. we show that the resulting abundance patterns point towards achemical enrichment dominated by massive stars at all metallicities. o, mg andal ratios with respect to iron are overabundant with respect to both galacticdisks (thin and thick) for [fe/h]$&gt;-0.5$. a formation timescale for thegalactic bulge shorter than for both the thin and thick disks is thereforeinferred. using mg as a proxy for metallicity (instead of fe) we further showthat: (i) the bulge stars [o/mg] ratio follows and extend to highermetallicities the decreasing trend of [o/mg] found in the galactic disks. (ii)the [na/mg] ratio trend with increasing [mg/h] is found to increase in threedistinct sequences in the thin disk, the thick disk and the bulge. the bulgetrend is well represented by the predicted metallicity-dependent yields ofmassive stars, whereas the galactic disks have too high na/mg ratios at lowmetallicities, pointing to an additional source of na from agb stars. (iii)contrary to na, there appears to be no systematic difference in the [al/mg]ratio between bulge and disk stars, and the theoretical yields by massive starsagree with the observed ratios, leaving no space for agb contribution to al.

astro-ph;9502009	determination of atmospheric parameters of t tauri stars	the inferred effective temperatures (t$_{\rm eff}$) and surface gravities oft tauri stars (tts) are usually contaminated by the presence of a non stellarcontinuum emission (veiling) and the strong chromospheric activitycharacteristic of these objects. in this work, we develop a method to determinet$_{\rm eff}$'s and surface gravities (log$\,g$) of a group of tts. this methodis based on the comparison between observed and theoretical molecular andatomic line depth ratios being therefore insensitive to the influence ofveiling. we show the strong dependence of our line depth ratios upon gravityand temperature. the resulting gravities, as expected for tts, average betweenthe values of dwarf and giant stars. previously published gravities for each ofour stars vary widely due in part to the differences in the adopted visualextinction, veiling (if ever considered) and methods of assessing the stellarluminosity. our values of t$_{\rm eff}$ and log$\,g$ have the uniqueness ofbeing entirely derived from high resolution data and are not affected bycircumstellar extinction or veiling when line ratios are used. they thereforeserve as more reliable input parameters for future spectral synthesis analysesof t tauri stars requiring model atmospheres. we provide a table relatingtheoretical line depth ratio with t$_{\rm eff}$ and log $\,g$ for easyassessment of tts fundamental parameters.

0810.1701	cnona and 12c/13c in giants of 10 open clusters	evolved low-mass stars of a wide range of metallicity bear signatures of anon-standard mixing event in their surface abundances of li, c, and n, and intheir 12c/13c ratio. a na overabundance has also been reported in some giantsof open clusters but remains controversial. the cause of the extra-mixing hasbeen attributed to thermohaline convection that should take place after the rgbbump for low-mass stars and on the early-agb for more massive objects. to trackthe occurrence of this process over a wide mass range, we derive in ahomogeneous way the abundances of c, n, o, and na, as well as the 12c/13c ratioin a sample of 31 giants of 10 open clusters with turn-off masses from 1.7 to3.1 msun. a group of first ascent red giants with m/msun \leq 2.5 exhibitslower [n/c] ratios than those measured in clump giants of the same mass range,suggesting an additional increase in the [n/c] ratio after the first dredge-up.the sodium abundances corrected from nlte are found to be about solar. [na/fe]shows a slight increase of 0.10 dex as a function of stellar mass in the 1.8 to3.2 msun range covered by our sample, in agreement with standard firstdredge-up predictions. our results do not support previous claims of sodiumoverabundances as high as +0.60 dex. an anti-correlation between 12c/13c andturn-off mass is identified and interpreted as being caused by a post-bumpthermohaline mixing. moreover, we find low 12c/13c ratios in a fewintermediate-mass early-agb stars, confirming that an extra-mixing process alsooperates in stars that do not experienced the rgb bump. in this case, theextra-mixing possibly acts on the early-agb, in agreement with theoreticalexpectations for thermohaline mixing.

0812.0558	abundances in the galactic bulge: results from planetary nebulae and  giant stars	our understanding of the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge requiresthe determination of abundances in large samples of giant stars and planetarynebulae (pne). we discuss pne abundances in the galactic bulge and comparethese results with those presented in the literature for giant stars. wepresent the largest, high-quality data-set available for pne in the directionof the galactic bulge (inner-disk/bulge). for comparison purposes, we alsoconsider a sample of pne in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). we derive theelement abundances in a consistent way for all the pne studied. by comparingthe abundances for the bulge, inner-disk, and lmc, we identify elements thathave not been modified during the evolution of the pn progenitor and can beused to trace the bulge chemical enrichment history. we then compare the pnabundances with abundances of bulge field giant. at the metallicity of thebulge, we find that the abundances of o and ne are close to the values for theinterstellar medium at the time of the pn progenitor formation, and hence theseelements can be used as tracers of the bulge chemical evolution, in the sameway as s and ar, which are not expected to be affected by nucleosyntheticprocesses during the evolution of the pn progenitors. the pn oxygen abundancedistribution is shifted to lower values by 0.3 dex with respect to thedistribution given by giants. a similar shift appears to occur for ne and s. wediscuss possible reasons for this pne-giant discrepancy and conclude that thisis probably due to systematic errors in the abundance derivations in eithergiants or pne (or both). we issue an important warning concerning the use ofabsolute abundances in chemical evolution studies.
