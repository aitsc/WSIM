0907.0608	solar-like oscillations with low amplitude in the corot target hd 181906	context: the f8 star hd 181906 (effective temperature ~6300k) was observedfor 156 days by the corot satellite during the first long run in the centredirection. analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acousticoscillations. however, the faintness of the target (m_v=7.65) means thesignal-to-noise (s/n) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low s/nleads to complications in the analysis. aims: to extract global variables ofthe star as well as key parameters of the p modes observed in the powerspectrum of the lightcurve. methods: the power spectrum of the lightcurve, awavelet transform and spot fitting have been used to obtain the averagerotation rate of the star and its inclination angle. then, the autocorrelationof the power spectrum and the power spectrum of the power spectrum were used toproperly determine the large separation. finally, estimations of the modeparameters have been done by maximizing the likelihood of a global fit, whereseveral modes were fit simultaneously. results: we have been able to infer themean surface rotation rate of the star (~4 microhz) with indications of thepresence of surface differential rotation, the large separation of the p modes(~87 microhz), and therefore also the ridges corresponding to overtones of theacoustic modes.

0907.1139	analysing solar-like oscillations with an automatic pipeline	kepler mission will provide a huge amount of asteroseismic data during thenext few years, among which hundreds of solar-like stars will be targeted. theamount of stars and their observation length represent a step forward in thecomprehension of the stellar evolution that has already been initiated by corotand most missions. up to now, the slow cadence of observed targets allowed anindividual and personalized analysis of each star. during the survey phase ofkepler, this will be impossible. this is the reason why, within the asteroflagteam, we have been developing automatic pipelines for the kepler solar-likeoscillation stars. our code starts by finding the frequency-range where p-modepower is present and, after fitting the background, it looks for the modeamplitudes as well as the central frequency of the p-mode hump. a goodestimation of the large separation can thus be inferred in this region. if thesignal to noise is high enough, the code obtains the characteristics of the pmodes by doing a global fitting on the power spectrum. here, we will firstdescribe a few features of this pipeline and its application to asteroflagsynthetic data to check the validity of the code.

0908.0562	on the solar origin of the signal at 220.7microhz: a possible component  of a g mode?	gravity modes in the sun have been the object of a long and difficult searchin recent decades. thanks to the data accumulated with the last generation ofinstruments (bison, gong and three helioseismic instruments aboard soho),scientists have been able to find signatures of their presence. however, theindividual detection of such modes remains evasive. in this article, we studythe signal at 220.7 microhz which is a peak that is present in most of thehelioseismic data of the last 10 years. this signal has already been identifiedas being one component of a g-mode candidate detected in the golf dopplervelocity signal. the nature of this peak is studied in particular using thevirgo/spm instrument aboard soho. first we analyse all the availableinstrumental data of virgo and soho (housekeeping) to reject any possibleinstrumental origin. no relation was found, implying that the signal has asolar origin. using monte carlo simulations, we find, with more than 99%confidence level, that the signal found in virgo/spm is very unlikely to be dueto pure noise.

0912.3367	determining global parameters of the oscillations of solar-like stars	helioseismology has enabled us to better understand the solar interior, whilealso allowing us to better constrain solar models. but now is a tremendousepoch for asteroseismology as space missions dedicated to studying stellaroscillations have been launched within the last years (most and corot). corothas already proved valuable results for many types of stars, while kepler,which was launched in march 2009, will provide us with a huge number of seismicdata very soon. this is an opportunity to better constrain stellar models andto finally understand stellar structure and evolution. the goal of thisresearch work is to estimate the global parameters of any solar-likeoscillating target in an automatic manner. we want to determine the globalparameters of the acoustic modes (large separation, range of excited pressuremodes, maximum amplitude, and its corresponding frequency), retrieve thesurface rotation period of the star and use these results to estimate theglobal parameters of the star (radius and mass).to prepare the analysis ofhundreds of solar-like oscillating stars, we have developed a robust andautomatic pipeline. the pipeline consists of data analysis techniques, such asfast fourier transform, wavelets, autocorrelation, as well as the applicationof minimisation algorithms for stellar-modelling. we apply our pipeline to somesimulated lightcurves from the asteroflag team and the aarhus-asteroflagsimulator, and obtain results that are consistent with the input data to thesimulations. our strategy gives correct results for stars with magnitudes below11 with only a few 10% of bad determinations among the reliable results. wethen apply the pipeline to the sun and three corot targets.in particular wedetermine the parameters of the sun, hd49933, hd181906, and hd181420.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1001.0747	hybrid gamma doradus - delta scuti pulsators: new insights into the  physics of the oscillations from kepler observations	observations of the pulsations of stars can be used to infer their interiorstructure and test theoretical models. the main sequence $\gamma$ doradus (dor)and $\delta$ scuti (sct) stars with masses 1.2-2.5 $m_{\sun}$ are particularlyuseful for these studies. the $\gamma$ dor stars pulsate in high-order $g$modes with periods of order 1 day, driven by convective blocking at the base oftheir envelope convection zone. the $\delta$ sct stars pulsate in low-order $g$and $p$ modes with periods of order 2 hours, driven by the $\kappa$ mechanismoperating in the heii ionization zone. theory predicts an overlap region in thehertzsprung-russell diagram between instability regions, where 'hybrid' starspulsating in both types of modes should exist. the two types of modes withproperties governed by different portions of the stellar interior providecomplementary model constraints. among the known $\gamma$ dor and $\delta$ sctstars, only four have been confirmed as hybrids. now, analysis of combinedquarter 0 and quarter 1 kepler data for hundreds of variable stars shows thatthe frequency spectra are so rich that there are practically no pure $\delta$sct or $\gamma$ dor pulsators, i.e. essentially all of the stars showfrequencies in both the $\delta$ sct and $\gamma$ dor frequency range. a newobservational classification scheme is proposed that takes into account theamplitude as well as the frequency, and is applied to categorize 234 stars as$\delta$ sct, $\gamma$ dor, $\delta$ sct/$\gamma$ dor or $\gamma$ dor/$\delta$sct hybrids.

1002.2132	sensitivity of the g-mode frequencies to pulsation codes and their  parameters	from the recent work of the evolution and seismic tools activity (esta,lebreton et al. 2006; monteiro et al. 2008), whose task 2 is devoted to comparepulsational frequencies computed using most of the pulsational codes availablein the asteroseismic community, the dependence of the theoretical frequencieswith non-physical choices is now quite well fixed. to ensure that the accuracyof the computed frequencies is of the same order of magnitude or better thanthe observational errors, some requirements in the equilibrium models and thenumerical resolutions of the pulsational equations must be followed. inparticular, we have verified the numerical accuracy obtained with the saclayseismic model, which is used to study the solar g-mode region (60 to140$\mu$hz). we have compared the results coming from the aarhus adiabaticpulsation code (adipls), with the frequencies computed with the granada code(graco) taking into account several possible choices. we have concluded thatthe present equilibrium models and the use of the richardson extrapolationensure an accuracy of the order of $0.01 \mu hz$ in the determination of thefrequencies, which is quite enough for our purposes.

1003.0052	a multi-site campaign to measure solar-like oscillations in procyon. ii.  mode frequencies	we have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations inthe f5 star procyon. the data consist of high-precision velocities that weobtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. a new method foradjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the powerspectrum. stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram revealstwo clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angulardegree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). we interpret a strong, narrowpeak at 446 muhz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixedcharacter. we show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and theirseparations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. in particular,variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in thesound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. we list frequenciesfor 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a rangecomparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints fortheoretical models. a preliminary comparison with published models shows thatthe offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes isvery different for procyon than for the sun and other cool stars. we find themean lifetime of the modes in procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which issignificantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the sun.

1003.5178	inpainting: a powerful interpolation technique for helio- and  asteroseismic data	in helio- and asteroseismology, it is important to have continuous,uninterrupted, data sets. however, seismic observations usually contain gapsand we need to take them into account. in particular, if the gaps are notrandomly distributed, they will produce a peak and a series of harmonics in theperiodogram that will destroy the stellar information. an interpolation of thedata can be good solution for this problem. in this paper we have studied aninterpolation method based on the so-called 'inpainting' algorithms. to checkthe algorithm, we used both virgo and corot satellite data to which we applieda realistic artificial window of a real corot observing run to introduce gaps.next we compared the results with the original, non-windowed data. therefore,we were able to optimize the algorithm by minimizing the difference between thepower spectrum density of the data with gaps and the complete time series. ingeneral, we find that the power spectrum of the inpainted time series is verysimilar to the original, unperturbed one. seismic inferences obtained afterinterpolating the data are the same as in the original case.

1104.5654	about the p-mode frequency shifts in hd 49933	we study the frequency dependence of the frequency shifts of the low-degree pmodes measured in the f5v star hd 49933, by analyzing the second run ofobservations collected by the corot satellite. the 137-day light curve isdivided into two subseries corresponding to periods of low and high stellaractivity. the activity-frequency relationship is obtained independently fromthe analysis of the mode frequencies extracted by both a local and a globalpeak-fitting analyses, and from a cross-correlation technique in the frequencyrange between 1450 microhz and 2500 microhz. the three methods returnconsistent results. we show that the frequency shifts measured in hd 49933present a frequency dependence with a clear increase with frequency, reaching amaximal shift of about 2 microhz around 2100 microhz. similar variations areobtained between the l=0 and l=1 modes. at higher frequencies, the frequencyshifts show indications of a downturn followed by an upturn, consistent betweenthe l=0 and 1 modes. we show that the frequency variation of the p-modefrequency shifts of the solar-like oscillating star hd 49933 has a comparableshape to the one observed in the sun, which is understood to arise from changesin the outer layers due to its magnetic activity.

1107.0335	the kepler characterization of the variability among a- and f-type  stars. i. general overview	the kepler spacecraft is providing time series of photometric data withmicromagnitude precision for hundreds of a-f type stars. we present a firstgeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of a-f type stars asobserved in the kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate a-f typestars. we propose three main groups to describe the observed variety inpulsating a-f type stars: gamma dor, delta sct, and hybrid stars. we assign 63%of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part asrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectraltype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has beenobserved before. we characterize for the first time a large number of a-f typestars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,and typical pulsation amplitudes. the majority of hybrid stars show frequencieswith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma dor and delta sct range, alsobetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. we findindications for the existence of delta sct and gamma dor stars beyond the edgesof the current observational instability strips. the hybrid stars occupy theentire region within the delta sct and gamma dor instability strips, andbeyond. non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. thelocation of gamma dor and delta sct classes in the (teff,logg)-diagram has beenextended. we investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma dor and delta sctstars. our results suggest a revision of the current observational instabilitystrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplementthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.

1107.0490	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: constraints from red giants in  open clusters observed by kepler	scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellarproperties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physicsthat underpins stellar pulsation. the common notion that all stars in an opencluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precisionthan what is usually achievable for single stars. this makes clusters ideal forexploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillationsand the global stellar properties. we have analyzed data obtained with nasa'skepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant starslocated in either of the three open clusters, ngc 6791, ngc 6819, and ngc 6811.by fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relationsthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that thedata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio aspreviously assumed. as a result we provide a new improved empirical relationwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. this relation turns out to alsowork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. in addition, themeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previouslyunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in ngc 6791 and ngc 6819, pointingto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into theformation history of open clusters.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

1109.3460	testing scaling relations for solar-like oscillations from the main  sequence to red giants using kepler data	we have analyzed solar-like oscillations in ~1700 stars observed by thekepler mission, spanning from the main-sequence to the red clump. usingevolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequencyof maximum power (nu_max), the large frequency separation (delta_nu) andoscillation amplitudes. we show that the difference of the delta_nu-nu_maxrelation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by differentdistributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with whatis expected from scaling relations. for oscillation amplitudes, we show thatneither (l/m)^s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by kjeldsen &amp; bedding(2011) are accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scalingrelation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculateamplitudes from the main-sequence to red-giants to a precision of ~25%. theresiduals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that anadditional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observedamplitudes. we investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellaractivity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is mostpronounced for subgiant stars. finally, we test the location of the cool edgeof the instability strip in the hertzsprung-russell diagram using solar-likeoscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with adomain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.

1110.0980	characterization of the power excess of solar-like oscillations in red  giants with kepler	we aim to describe the oscillation power excess observed in kepler redgiants, and to investigate empirical scaling relations governing theseparameters. from these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties ofred giant oscillations. various different methods were compared in order tovalidate the processes and to derive reliable output values. for consistency, asingle method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevantglobal asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of thebackground signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of thepower excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility ofnon-radial modes. a method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillationspectrum. the comparison of the different methods has shown the important roleof the way the background is modelled. the convergence reached by thecollaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning theoscillation power excess. we obtain several scaling relations, and identify theinfluence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. the effect of heliumburning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strongmass-radius relation for clump stars. we find that none of the amplitudescaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observedmode amplitudes of red giant stars. in parallel, the degree-dependent modevisibility exhibits important variations. both effects seem related to thesignificant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. a familyof red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties areanalyzed.

0710.3772	oscillations in procyon a: first results from a multi-site campaign	procyon a is a bright f5iv star in a binary system. although the distance,mass and angular diameter of this star are all known with high precision, theexact evolutionary state is still unclear. evolutionary tracks with differentages and different mass fractions of hydrogen in the core pass, within theerrors, through the observed position of procyon a in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram. for more than 15 years several different groups have studied thesolar-like oscillations in procyon a to determine its evolutionary state.although several studies independently detected power excess in theperiodogram, there is no agreement on the actual oscillation frequencies yet.this is probably due to either insufficient high-quality data (i.e., aliasing)or due to intrinsic properties of the star (i.e., short mode lifetimes). now aspectroscopic multi-site campaign using 10 telescopes world-wide (minimizingaliasing effects) with a total time span of nearly 4 weeks (increase thefrequency resolution) is performed to identify frequencies in this star andfinally determine its properties and evolutionary state.

1112.3295	oscillation mode linewidths of main-sequence and subgiant stars observed  by kepler	solar-like oscillations have been observed by {{\it kepler}} and corot inseveral solar-type stars.  we study the variations of stellar p-mode linewidth as a function ofeffective temperature.  time series of 9 months of kepler data have been used. the power spectra of42 cool main-sequence stars and subgiants have been analysed using both maximumlikelihood estimators and bayesian estimators, providing individual modecharacteristics such as frequencies, linewidths and mode heights.  here we report on the mode linewidth at maximum power and at maximum modeheight for these 42 stars as a function of effective temperature.  we show that the mode linewidth at either maximum mode height or maximumamplitude follows a scaling relation with effective temperature, which is acombination of a power law plus a lower bound. the typical power law index isabout 13 for the linewidth derived from the maximum mode height, and about 16for the linewidth derived from the maximum amplitude while the lower bound isabout 0.3 microhz and 0.7 microhz, respectively. we stress that this scalingrelation is only valid for the cool main-sequence stars and subgiants, and doesnot have predictive power outside the temperature range of these stars.

1206.3312	seismic evidence for a rapidly rotating core in a lower-giant-branch  star observed with kepler	rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and theevolution of stars. however, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport instars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account instellar models. to achieve a better understanding of these processes, wedesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,which until very recently were restricted to the sun. in this paper, we reportthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in thecore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giantkic7341231, which was observed during one year with the kepler spacecraft. byperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show thatits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able todetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. we then find astellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismicproperties of the star. we use this model to perform inversions of the internalrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of thestar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. this will shednew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. inparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angularmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, whichcould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed overthe last decades.

1212.0630	constraining magnetic-activity modulations in 3~solar-like stars  observed by corot and narval	stellar activity cycles are the manifestation of dynamo process running inthe stellar interiors. they have been observed during years to decades thanksto the measurement of stellar magnetic proxies at the surface of the stars suchas the chromospheric and x-ray emissions, and the measurement of the magneticfield with spectropolarimetry. however, all of these measurements rely onexternal features that cannot be visible during for example, a maunder-typeminimum. with the advent of long observations provided by space asteroseismicmissions, it has been possible to pierce inside the stars and study theirproperties. moreover, the acoustic-mode properties are also perturbed by thepresence of these dynamos. we track the temporal variations of the amplitudesand frequencies of acoustic modes allowing us to search for signature ofmagnetic activity cycles, as has already been done in the sun and in the corottarget hd49933. we use asteroseimic tools and more classical spectroscopicmeasurements performed with the narval spectropolarimeter to check if there arehints of any activity cycle in three solar-like stars observed continuously bythe corot satellite: hd49385, hd181420, and hd52265.our analysis gives verysmall variation of the seismic parameters preventing us from detecting anymagnetic modulation. however we are able to provide a lower limit of anymagnetic-activity change in the three stars that should be longer than 120days, which is the length of the time series. moreover we computed the upperlimit for the line-of-sight magnetic field component. more seismic andspectroscopic data would be required to have a firm detection in these stars.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

0802.1510	influence of low-degree high-order p-mode splittings on the solar  rotation profile	the solar rotation profile is well constrained down to about 0.25 r thanks tothe study of acoustic modes. since the radius of the inner turning point of aresonant acoustic mode is inversely proportional to the ratio of its frequencyto its degree, only the low-degree p modes reach the core. the higher the orderof these modes, the deeper they penetrate into the sun and thus they carry morediagnostic information on the inner regions. unfortunately, the estimates offrequency splittings at high frequency from sun-as-a-star measurements havehigher observational errors due to mode blending, resulting in weakerconstraints on the rotation profile in the inner core. therefore inversions forthe solar internal rotation use only modes below 2.4 mhz for l &lt; 4. in the workpresented here, we used an 11.5 year-long time series to compute the rotationalfrequency splittings for modes l &lt; 4 using velocities measured with the golfinstrument. we carried out a theoretical study of the influence of thelow-degree modes in the region 2 to 3.5 mhz on the inferred rotation profile asa function of their error bars.

1406.0003	non-radial oscillations in m-giant semi-regular variables: stellar  models and kepler observations	the success of asteroseismology relies heavily on our ability to identify thefrequency patterns of stellar oscillation modes. for stars like the sun this isrelatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern describedby a well-founded asymptotic relation. when a solar like star evolves off themain sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramaticallyresulting in changes in the frequency pattern of the modes. we follow theevolution of the adiabatic frequency pattern from the main sequence to near thetip of the red giant branch for a series of models. we find a significantdeparture from the asymptotic relation for the non-radial modes near the redgiant branch tip, resulting in a triplet frequency pattern. to support ourinvestigation we analyze almost four years of kepler data of the most luminousstars in the field (late k and early m type) and find that their frequencyspectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for themost luminous stars in our sample. our identification explains previous resultsfrom ground-based observations reporting fine structure in the petersen diagramand sub ridges in the period-luminosity diagram. finally, we find `new ridges'of non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our modelcalculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.

1504.04029	testing the recovery of stellar rotation signals from kepler light  curves using a blind hare-and-hounds exercise	we present the results of a blind exercise to test the recoverability ofstellar rotation and differential rotation in kepler light curves. thesimulated light curves lasted 1000 days and included activity cycles, sun-likebutterfly patterns, differential rotation and spot evolution. the range ofrotation periods, activity levels and spot lifetime were chosen to berepresentative of the kepler data of solar like stars. of the 1000 simulatedlight curves, 770 were injected into actual quiescent kepler light curves tosimulate kepler noise. the test also included five 1000-day segments of thesun's total irradiance variations at different points in the sun's activitycycle.  five teams took part in the blind exercise, plus two teams who participatedafter the content of the light curves had been released. the methods usedincluded lomb-scargle periodograms and variants thereof, auto-correlationfunction, and wavelet-based analyses, plus spot modelling to search fordifferential rotation. the results show that the `overall' period is wellrecovered for stars exhibiting low and moderate activity levels. most teamsreported values within 10% of the true value in 70% of the cases. there was,however, little correlation between the reported and simulated values of thedifferential rotation shear, suggesting that differential rotation studiesbased on full-disk light curves alone need to be treated with caution, at leastfor solar-type stars.  the simulated light curves and associated parameters are available online forthe community to test their own methods.

0805.3293	low-degree modes	the quest of the knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the solarinterior has been possible thanks to the study of the resonant acoustic (p)modes that are trapped in the solar interior.  since the solar rotation lifts the azimuthal degeneracy of the resonantmodes, their eigenfrequencies are split into their m-components; where l is theangular degree, n the radial order, and, m the azimuthal order. this separation--usually called rotational splitting (or just splitting)-- depends on therotation rate in the region sampled by the mode. in the same way, the precisefrequency of a mode depends on the physical properties of the cavity where themode propagates. using inversion techniques the rotation rate, the sound speedor the density profile at different locations inside the sun can be inferredfrom a suitable lineal combination of the measured modes. but, during the lastyear, a particular effort has been done in the extraction of physicalinformation directly from the combination of frequencies: the large and thesmall frequency separations.

1508.03126	characterizing the propagation of gravity waves in 3d nonlinear  simulations of solar-like stars	the revolution of helio- and asteroseismology provides access to the detailedproperties of stellar interiors by studying the star's oscillation modes. amongthem, gravity (g) modes are formed by constructive interferences betweenprogressive internal gravity waves (igws), propagating in stellar radiativezones. our new 3d nonlinear simulations of the interior of a solar-like starallows us to study the excitation, propagation, and dissipation of these waves.the aim of this article is to clarify our understanding of the behavior of igwsin a 3d radiative zone and to provide a clear overview of their properties. weuse a method of frequency filtering that reveals the path of {individual}gravity waves of different frequencies in the radiative zone. we are able toidentify the region of propagation of different waves in 2d and 3d, to comparethem to the linear raytracing theory and to distinguish between propagative andstanding waves (g modes). we also show that the energy carried by waves isdistributed in different planes in the sphere, depending on their azimuthalwave number. we are able to isolate individual igws from a complex spectrum andto study their propagation in space and time. in particular, we highlight inthis paper the necessity of studying the propagation of waves in 3d sphericalgeometry, since the distribution of their energy is not equipartitioned in thesphere.

1508.04910	analysis of the acoustic cut-off frequency and hips in six kepler stars  with stochastically excited pulsations	gravito-acoustic modes in the sun and other stars propagate in resonantcavities with a frequency below a given limit known as the cut-off frequency.at higher frequencies, waves are no longer trapped in the stellar interior andbecome traveller waves. in this article we study six pulsating solar-like starsat different evolutionary stages observed by the nasa kepler mission. thesehigh signal-to-noise targets show a peak structure that extends at very highfrequencies and are good candidates for studying the transition region betweenthe modes and the interference peaks or pseudo-modes. following the samemethodology successfully applied on sun-as-a-star measurements, we uncover theexistence of pseudo-modes in these stars with one or two dominant interferencepatterns depending on the evolutionary stage of the star. we also infer theircut-off frequency as the midpoint between the last eigenmode and the first peakof the interference patterns. by using ray theory we show that, while theperiod of one of the interference pattern is very close to half the largeseparation the other, one depends on the time phase of mixed waves, thuscarrying additional information on the stellar structure and evolution.

1510.09023	rotation periods and seismic ages of kois - comparison with stars  without detected planets from kepler observations	one of the most difficult properties to derive for stars is their age. forcool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellarages from measured rotation pe- riods and hr diagram positions. these relationshave few calibrators with known ages for old, long rotation period stars. thereis a significant sample of old kepler objects of inter- est, or kois, whichhave both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismicmeasurements from which ages can be accurately derived. in this work wedetermine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating kois to bothcompare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets andenlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars. we use keplerphotometric light curves to derive the stellar surface rotation peri- ods whileages are obtained with asteroseismology using the asteroseismic modeling portalin which individual mode frequencies are combined with high-resolutionspectroscopic pa- rameters. we thus determine surface rotation periods and agesfor 11 planet-hosting stars, all over 2 gyr old. we find that theplanet-hosting stars exhibit a rotational behaviour that is consistent with thelatest age-rotation models and similar to the rotational behaviour of starswithout detected planets. we conclude that these old kois can be used to testand calibrate gyrochronology along with stars not known to host planets.

1511.06160	internal rotation of the red-giant star kic 4448777 by means of  asteroseismic inversion	in this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the earlyred-giant star kic 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of thedipole mixed modes obtained from {\it kepler} observations. in order toovercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods toextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. we find not onlythat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversionresults generated for other red giants (deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but wealso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core witha spatial resolution of $\delta r=0.001r$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharpdiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (deheuvels et al. 2014). theresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity ofabout $\langle\omega_c/2\pi\rangle=748\pm18$~nhz and provide evidence for anangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part ofthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize therotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. theangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burningshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reachingan average value in the convective envelope of$\langle\omega_s/2\pi\rangle=68\pm22$~nhz. hence, the core in kic~4448777 isrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.we conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficientto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the densecore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiativeregion and in the convective envelope.

0808.0422	variations of the solar granulation motions with height using the  golf/soho experiment	below 1 mhz, the power spectrum of helioseismic velocity measurements isdominated by the spectrum of convective motions (granulation andsupergranulation) making it difficult to detect the low-order acoustic modesand the gravity modes. we want to better understand the behavior of solargranulation as a function of the observing height in the solar atmosphere andwith magnetic activity during solar cycle 23. we analyze the power spectraldensity (psd) of eleven years of golf/soho velocity-time series using aharvey-type model to characterize the properties of the convective motions inthe solar oscillation power spectrum. we study then the evolution of thegranulation with the altitude in the solar atmosphere and with the solaractivity. first, we show that the traditional use of a lorentzian profile tofit the envelope of the p modes is not well suitable for golf data. indeed, toproperly model the solar spectrum, we need a second lorentzian profile. second,we show that the granulation clearly evolves with the height in the photospherebut does not present any significant variation with the activity cycle.

astro-ph;0603671	rotation speed and stellar axis inclination from p modes: how corot  would see other suns	in the context of future space-based asteroseismic missions, we have studiedthe problem of extracting the rotation speed and the rotation-axis inclinationof solar-like stars from the expected data. we have focused on slow rotators(at most twice solar rotation speed), firstly because they constitute the mostdifficult case and secondly because some of the corot main targets are expectedto have slow rotation rates. our study of the likelihood function has shown acorrelation between the estimates of inclination of the rotation axis i and therotational splitting deltanu of the star. by using the parameters, i anddeltanu*=deltanu sin(i), we propose and discuss new fitting strategies. montecarlo simulations have shown that we can extract a mean splitting and therotation-axis inclination down to solar rotation rates. however, at the solarrotation rate we are not able to correctly recover the angle i although we arestill able to measure a correct deltanu* with a dispersion less than 40 nhz.

astro-ph;0608109	solar mean magnetic field near the surface and its variation during a  cycle	the unsigned mean magnetic field characterizes the magnetic energy settled inthe region near the solar surface. it is one of the determinant ingredientsthat govern the turbulence in the photosphere, and the magnetic heating ofupper layers. the acoustic eigenmodes are directly sensitive to this meanmagnetic energy, via the magnetic pressure, and thanks to their trajectoriessweeping entirely this region. we use the local-wave formalism to calculate thep-mode frequencies of the saclay seismic solar model. then, by comparing themto the lowl observed frequencies, the l-independent differences (up to 40microhz) can be attributed to the existence of a magnetic pressure thatmodifies the pressure, the density and the sound speed, taking also intoaccount the additional alfven speed. a profile of unsigned mean magnetic fieldis deduced, increasing from zero at the surface to 2.5e4 g, 5600 km deeper.next, by applying the same method, the l-independent variations in frequencydue the solar cycle (up to 0.4 microhz) is used to deduce the change of themagnetic profile. this change presents two distinctive parts: a plateau of only2-3 g from the surface down to 2100 km, and a very narrow peak of 55 g, 220 kmthick, right at the surface. due to the non-linear effect of the magneticfield, comparing only the frequencies between minimum and maximum activity isnot sufficient to deduce the magnetic variation. the additional knowledge ofthe magnetic field at minimum activity is necessary. if the latter is ignored,an extra variation of up to 130 g would be found. finally, our results arecompared to magnetic field estimates by other helioseismic and spectroscopicmethods.

astro-ph;0611806	detection of periodic signatures in the solar power spectrum. on the  track of l=1 gravity modes	in the present work we show robust indications of the existence of g modes inthe sun using 10 years of golf data. the present analysis is based on theexploitation of the collective properties of the predicted low-frequency (25 to140 microhz) g modes: their asymptotic nature, which implies a quasiequidistant separation of their periods for a given angular degree (l). thepower spectrum (ps) of the power spectrum density (psd), reveals a significantstructure indicating the presence of features (peaks) in the psd with nearequidistant periods corresponding to l=1 modes in the range n=-4 to n=-26. thestudy of its statistical significance of this feature was fully undertaken andcomplemented with monte carlo simulations. this structure has a confidencelevel better than 99.86% not to be due to pure noise. furthermore, a detailedstudy of this structure suggests that the gravity modes have a much morecomplex structure than the one initially expected (line-widths, magneticsplittings...). compared to the latest solar models, the obtained results tendto favor a solar core rotating significantly faster than the rest of theradiative zone. in the framework of the phoebus group, we have also applied thesame methodology to other helioseismology instruments on board soho and groundbased networks.

0810.1696	low-frequency solar p modes as seen by golf and gong instruments	in the case of spatially-revolved helioseismic data (such as mdi, gong, hmi),the usual mode-fitting analysis consists of fitting the 2l+1 individualm-spectra of a given multiplet (n, l) either individually or simultaneously.such fitting methods fail to obtain reliable estimates of the mode parameters(frequency, splitting, ...) when the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) is low, whichmakes those methods not suitable when one wants to look at the low-amplitude,long-lived solar p modes in the low-frequency range. instead, salabert et al.(2007) developed a new method to extract the mode parameters by adjusting therotation- and structure-induced frequency shift for each m-spectrum to minimizethe mode width in the m-averaged spectrum (a "collapsogram"). the m-averagedspectrum technique, applied to the spatially-resolved gong and mdi data,appeared to be a powerful tool for low snr modes in the low-frequency range.another possibility to increase the snr is to combine data from differentinstruments (garcia et al. 2004a). we present here an adaptation of bothtechniques: the "collapsograms" applied to a combination of observations from asun-as-a-star instrument, golf, and a disk-imaged one, gong.
