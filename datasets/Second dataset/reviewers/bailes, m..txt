0906.3897	precision southern hemisphere vlbi pulsar astrometry ii: measurement of  seven parallaxes	accurate measurement of pulsar distances via astrometry using very longbaseline interferometry enables the improvement of galactic electron densitydistribution models, improving distance estimates for the vast majority ofpulsars for which parallax measurements are unavailable. however, pulsars atsouthern declinations have been under-represented in previous interferometricastrometry campaigns. in order to redress this imbalance, we have conducted atwo-year astrometric campaign targeting eight southern pulsars with theaustralian long baseline array. the program summarized in this paper hasresulted in the measurement of seven new pulsar parallaxes, with success onobjects down to a mean flux density of 0.8 mjy at 1600 mhz. our resultshighlight the substantial uncertainties that remain when utilizing freeelectron density models for individual pulsar distances. until this study, psrj0630-2834 was believed to convert 16% of its spin-down energy into x-rays, butour measured parallax distance of 332 (+52 -40) pc has revised this value to&lt;1%. in contrast, psr j0108-1431 was found to be almost a factor of two moredistant than previously thought, making its conversion of spin-down energy tox-rays the most efficient known (&gt;1%). the 8.5 second radio pulsar j2144-3933was found to be closer than previously predicted, making its apparent 1400 mhzradio luminosity the lowest of any known pulsar (20 microjy kpc^2). we haveexamined the growing population of neutron stars with accurate parallaxes todetermine the effect of distance errors on the underlying neutron star velocitydistribution, and find that typical distance errors may be biasing theestimated mean pulsar velocity upwards by 5%, and are likely to exaggerate thedistribution's high-velocity tail.

0907.2873	spin-down rate and inferred dipole magnetic field of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 1627-41	using chandra data taken on 2008 june, we detected pulsations at 2.59439(4) sin the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41. this is the second measurement ofthe source spin period and allows us to derive for the first time a long-termspin-down rate of (1.9 +/- 0.4)e-11 s/s. from this value we infer for sgr1627-41 a characteristic age of 2.2 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4e+34 erg/s(one of the highest among sources of the same class), and a surface dipolemagnetic field strength of 2e+14 g. these properties confirm the magnetarnature of sgr 1627-41; however, they should be considered with caution sincethey were derived on the basis of a period derivative measurement made usingtwo epochs only and magnetar spin-down rates are generally highly variable. thepulse profile, double-peaked and with a pulsed fraction of (13 +/- 2)% in the2-10 kev range, closely resembles that observed by xmm-newton in 2008september. having for the first time a timing model for this sgr, we alsosearched for a pulsed signal in archival radio data collected with the parkesradio telescope nine months after the previous x-ray outburst. no evidence forradio pulsations was found, down to a luminosity level 10-20 times fainter (fora 10% duty cycle and a distance of 11 kpc) than the peak luminosity shown bythe known radio magnetars.

0908.0244	timing stability of millisecond pulsars and prospects for  gravitational-wave detection	analysis of high-precision timing observations of an array of approx. 20millisecond pulsars (a so-called "timing array") may ultimately result in thedetection of a stochastic gravitational-wave background. the feasibility ofsuch a detection and the required duration of this type of experiment aredetermined by the achievable rms of the timing residuals and the timingstability of the pulsars involved. we present results of the first long-term,high-precision timing campaign on a large sample of millisecond pulsars used ingravitational-wave detection projects. we show that the timing residuals ofmost pulsars in our sample do not contain significant low-frequency noise thatcould limit the use of these pulsars for decade-long gravitational-wavedetection efforts. for our most precisely timed pulsars, intrinsicinstabilities of the pulsars or the observing system are shown to contribute totiming irregularities on a five-year timescale below the 100 ns level. based onthose results, realistic sensitivity curves for planned and ongoing timingarray efforts are determined. we conclude that prospects for detection of agravitational-wave background through pulsar timing array efforts within fiveyears to a decade are good.

0911.1790	the millisecond radio sky: transients from a blind single pulse search	we present the results of a search for transient radio bursts of between0.125 and 32 millisecond duration in two archival pulsar surveys ofintermediate galactic latitudes with the parkes multibeam receiver. fourteennew neutron stars have been discovered, seven of which belong to the recentlyidentified "rotating radio transients" (rrats) class. here we describe oursearch methodology, and discuss the new detections in terms of how the rratpopulation relates to the general population of pulsars. the new detectionsindicate (1) that the galactic z-distribution of rrats in the surveys closelyresembles the distribution of pulsars, with objects up to 0.86 kpc from thegalactic plane; (2) where measurable, the rrat pulse widths are similar to thatof individual pulses from pulsars of similar period, implying a similar beamingfraction; and (3) our new detections span a variety of nulling fractions, andthus we postulate that the rrats may simply be nulling pulsars that are only"on" for less than a pulse period. finally, the newly discovered object psrj0941-39 may represent a link between pulsars and rrats. this bizarre objectwas discovered as an rrat, but in follow-up observations often appeared as abright (~10 mjy) pulsar with a low nulling fraction. it is obvious thereforethat a neutron star can oscillate between being an rrat and a pulsar.crucially, the sites of the rrat pulses are coincident with the pulsar'semission, implying that the two emission mechanisms are linked, and that rratsare not just pulsars observed from different orientations.

1006.5744	the high time resolution universe pulsar survey i: system configuration  and initial discoveries	we have embarked on a survey for pulsars and fast transients using the13-beam multibeam receiver on the parkes radio telescope. installation of adigital backend allows us to record 400 mhz of bandwidth for each beam, splitinto 1024 channels and sampled every 64 us. limits of the receiver packagerestrict us to a 340 mhz observing band centred at 1352 mhz. the factor ofeight improvement in frequency resolution over previous multibeam surveysallows us to probe deeper into the galactic plane for short duration signalssuch as the pulses from millisecond pulsars. we plan to survey the entiresouthern sky in 42641 pointings, split into low, mid and high galactic latituderegions, with integration times of 4200, 540 and 270 s respectively.simulations suggest that we will discover 400 pulsars, of which 75 will bemillisecond pulsars. with ~30% of the mid-latitude survey complete, we havere-detected 223 previously known pulsars and discovered 27 pulsars, 5 of whichare millisecond pulsars. the newly discovered millisecond pulsars tend to havelarger dispersion measures than those discovered in previous surveys, asexpected from the improved time and frequency resolution of our instrument.

1008.3607	measuring the mass of solar system planets using pulsar timing	high-precision pulsar timing relies on a solar-system ephemeris in order toconvert times of arrival (toas) of pulses measured at an observatory to thesolar system barycenter. any error in the conversion to the barycentric toasleads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically,an incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variationhaving a period and phase associated with the planet's orbital motion about thesun. by using an array of pulsars (psrs j0437-4715, j1744-1134, j1857+0943,j1909-3744), the masses of the planetary systems from mercury to saturn havebeen determined. these masses are consistent with the best-known massesdetermined by spacecraft observations, with the mass of the jovian system,9.547921(2)e-4 msun, being significantly more accurate than the mass determinedfrom the pioneer and voyager spacecraft, and consistent with but less accuratethan the value from the galileo spacecraft. while spacecraft are likely toproduce the most accurate measurements for individual solar system bodies, thepulsar technique is sensitive to planetary system masses and has the potentialto provide the most accurate values of these masses for some planets.

1009.5873	a 6.5-ghz multibeam pulsar survey	a survey of the galactic plane in the region $-60\degree \leq l \leq30\degree$, $|b| \leq 0.25\degree$ was carried out using the seven-beam parkesmethanol multibeam (mmb) receiver, which operates at a frequency of 6.5 ghz.three pulsars were discovered, and 16 previously known pulsars detected. inthis paper we present two previously-unpublished discoveries, both withextremely high dispersion measures, one of which is very close, in angulardistance, to the galactic centre. the survey data also contain the first knowndetection, at radio frequencies, of the radio magnetar psr j1550-5418. oursurvey observation was made 46 days prior to that previously published andplaces constraints on the beginning of pulsed radio emission from the source.  the detection of only three previously undiscovered pulsars argues that thereare few pulsars in the direction of the inner galaxy whose flux densityspectrum is governed by a flat power law. however, these pulsars would belikely to remain undetected at lower frequencies due to the large amount ofscatter broadening which affects pulsars with high values of dispersionmeasure. surveys with future telescopes at high observing frequencies will,therefore, play an important role in the discovery of pulsars at the galacticcentre. by simulating pulsar surveys of the galaxy with phase 1 ska atfrequencies of 1.4 ghz and 10 ghz, we find that high-frequency observations arethe only way to discover and observe the galactic-centre pulsar population.

1101.4778	the high time resolution universe survey ii: discovery of 5 millisecond  pulsars	we present the discovery of 5 millisecond pulsars found in the mid-galacticlatitude portion of the high time resolution universe (htru) survey. thepulsars have rotational periods from ~2.3 to ~7.5 ms, and all are in binarysystems with orbital periods ranging from ~0.3 to ~150 d. in four of thesesystems, the most likely companion is a white dwarf, with minimum masses of~0.2 solar masses. the other pulsar, j1731-1847, has a very low mass companionand exhibits eclipses, and is thus a member of the "black widow" class ofpulsar binaries. these eclipses have been observed in bands centred nearfrequencies of 700, 1400 and 3000 mhz, from which measurements have been madeof the electron density in the eclipse region. these measurements have beenused to examine some possible eclipse mechanisms. the eclipse and otherproperties of this source are used to perform a comparison with the other knowneclipsing and "black widow" pulsars.  these new discoveries occupy a short-period and high-dispersion measure (dm)region of parameter space, which we demonstrate is a direct consequence of thehigh time and frequency resolution of the htru survey. the large implieddistances to our new discoveries makes observation of their companions unlikelywith both current optical telescopes and the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.the extremely circular orbits make any advance of periastron measurementshighly unlikely. no relativistic shapiro delays are obvious in any of thesystems, although the low flux densities would make their detection difficultunless the orbits were fortuitously edge-on.

1102.4111	the high time resolution universe survey - iii. single-pulse searches  and preliminary analysis	we present the search methods and initial results for transient radio signalsin the high time resolution universe (htru) survey. the htru survey'ssingle-pulse search, the software designed to perform the search, and adetermination of the htru survey's sensitivity to single pulses are described.initial processing of a small fraction of the survey has produced 11discoveries, all of which are sparsely-emitting neutron stars, as well asprovided confirmation of two previously unconfirmed neutron stars. most of thenewly discovered objects lie in regions surveyed previously, indicating boththe improved sensitivity of the htru survey observing system and the dynamicnature of the radio sky. the cycles of active and null states in nullingpulsars, rotating radio transients (rrats), and long-term intermittent pulsarsare explored in the context of determining the relationship between thesepopulations, and of the sensitivity of a search to the variousradio-intermittent neutron star populations. this analysis supports the casethat many rrats are in fact high-null-fraction pulsars (i. e. with nullfraction &gt;~0.95), and indicates that intermittent pulsars appear distinct fromnulling pulsars in their activity cycle timescales. we find that in themeasured population, there is a deficit of pulsars with typical emissiontimescales greater than ~300 s that is not readily explained by selectioneffects. the htru low-latitude survey will be capable of addressing whetherthis deficit is physical. we predict that the htru survey will explore pulsarswith a broad range of nulling fractions (up to and beyond 0.999), and at itscompletion is likely to increase the currently known rrats by a factor of morethan two.

1109.4193	the high time resolution universe pulsar survey iv: discovery and  polarimetry of millisecond pulsars	we present the discovery of six millisecond pulsars (msps) in the high timeresolution universe (htru) survey for pulsars and fast transients carried outwith the parkes radio telescope. all six are in binary systems withapproximately circular orbits and are likely to have white dwarf companions.psr j1017-7156 has a high flux density and a narrow pulse width, making itideal for precision timing experiments. psrs j1446-4701 and j1125-5825 arecoincident with gamma-ray sources, and folding the high-energy photons with theradio timing ephemeris shows evidence of pulsed gamma-ray emission. psrj1502-6752 has a spin period of 26.7 ms, and its low period derivative impliesthat it is a recycled pulsar. the orbital parameters indicate it has a very lowmass function, and therefore a companion mass much lower than usually expectedfor such a mildly recycled pulsar. in addition we present polarisation profilesfor all 12 msps discovered in the htru survey to date. similar to previousobservations of msps, we find that many have large widths and a wide range oflinear and circular polarisation fractions. their polarisation profiles can behighly complex, and although the observed position angles often do not obey therotating vector model, we present several examples of those that do. wespeculate that the emission heights of msps are a substantial fraction of thelight cylinder radius in order to explain broad emission profiles, which thennaturally leads to a large number of cases where emission from both poles isobserved.

1203.6068	the high time resolution universe survey - v: single-pulse energetics  and modulation properties of 315 pulsars	we report on the pulse-to-pulse energy distributions and phase-resolvedmodulation properties for catalogued pulsars in the southern high timeresolution universe intermediate-latitude survey. we selected the 315 pulsarsdetected in a single-pulse search of this survey, allowing a large sampleunbiased regarding any rotational parameters of neutron stars. we found thatthe energy distribution of many pulsars is well-described by a log-normaldistribution, with few deviating from a small range in log-normal scale andlocation parameters. some pulsars exhibited multiple energy statescorresponding to mode changes, and implying that some observed "nulling" mayactually be a mode-change effect. psrj1900-2600 was found to emit weakly in itspreviously-identified "null" state. we found evidence for another state-changeeffect in two pulsars, which show bimodality in their nulling time scales; thatis, they switch between a continuous-emission state and a single-pulse-emittingstate. large modulation occurs in many pulsars across the full integratedprofile, with increased sporadic bursts at leading and trailing sub-beam edges.some of these high-energy outbursts may indicate the presence of "giant pulse"phenomena. we found no correlation with modulation and pulsar period, age, orother parameters. finally, the deviation of integrated pulse energy from itsaverage value was generally quite small, despite the significant phase-resolvedmodulation in some pulsars; we interpret this as tenuous evidence of energyregulation between distinct pulsar sub-beams.

1211.5887	measurement and correction of variations in interstellar dispersion in  high-precision pulsar timing	signals from radio pulsars show a wavelength-dependent delay due todispersion in the interstellar plasma. at a typical observing wavelength, thisdelay can vary by tens of microseconds on five-year time scales, far in excessof signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays, such as that induced by agravitational-wave background. measurement of these delay variations is notonly crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides anunparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. inthis paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independentred-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion canattenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. we present a robustmethod for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply itto observations from the parkes pulsar timing array. correction for dispersionvariations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. we discussscheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such asscintillation, that can exacerbate the problem. comparison with scintillationmeasurements confirms previous results that the spectral exponent of electrondensity variations in the interstellar medium often appears steeper thanexpected. we also find a discrete change in dispersion measure of psrj1603-7202 of ~2x10^{-3} cm^{-3}pc for about 250 days. we speculate that thishas a similar origin to the 'extreme scattering events' seen in other sources.in addition, we find that four pulsars show a wavelength-dependent annualvariation, indicating a persistent gradient of electron density on an auspatial scale, which has not been reported previously.

(2013) has revealed a populationof frbs in the high time resolution universe (htru) survey at high galacticlatitudes. a variety of progenitors have been proposed including cataclysmicevents at cosmological distances, galactic flare stars, and terrestrial radiofrequency interference. here we report on a search for frbs at intermediategalactic latitudes ($-15^{\circ}$ $&lt; b &lt;$ 15$^{\circ}$) in data taken as partof the htru survey. no frbs were discovered in this region. several effectssuch as dispersion, scattering, sky temperature and scintillation decrease thesensitivity by more than 3$\sigma$ in $\sim$20\% of survey pointings. includingall of these effects, we exclude the hypothesis that frbs are uniformlydistributed on the sky with 99\% confidence. this low probability implies thatadditional factors -- not accounted for by standard galactic models -- must beincluded to ease the discrepancy between the detection rates at high and lowgalactic latitudes. a revised rate estimate or another strong and heretoforeunknown selection effect in galactic latitude would provide closer agreementbetween the surveys' detection rates. the dearth of detections at low galacticlatitude disfavors a galactic origin for these bursts.

1406.3627	spinn: a straightforward machine learning solution to the pulsar  candidate selection problem	we describe spinn (straightforward pulsar identification using neuralnetworks), a high-performance machine learning solution developed to processincreasingly large data outputs from pulsar surveys. spinn has beencross-validated on candidates from the southern high time resolution universe(htru) survey and shown to identify every known pulsar found in the survey datawhile maintaining a false positive rate of 0.64%. furthermore, it ranks 99% ofpulsars among the top 0.11% of candidates, and 95% among the top 0.01%. inconjunction with the peasoup pipeline (barr et al., in prep.), it has alreadydiscovered four new pulsars in a re-processing of the intermediate galacticlatitude area of htru, three of which have spin periods shorter than 5milliseconds. spinn's ability to reduce the amount of candidates to visuallyinspect by up to four orders of magnitude makes it a very promising tool forfuture large-scale pulsar surveys. in an effort to provide a common testingground for pulsar candidate selection tools and stimulate interest in theirdevelopment, we also make publicly available the set of candidates on whichspinn was cross-validated.

1406.4716	limitations in timing precision due to single-pulse shape variability in  millisecond pulsars	high-sensitivity radio-frequency observations of millisecond pulsars usuallyshow stochastic, broadband, pulse-shape variations intrinsic to the pulsaremission process. these variations induce jitter noise in pulsar timingobservations; understanding the properties of this noise is of particularimportance for the effort to detect gravitational waves with pulsar timingarrays. we assess the short-term profile and timing stability of 22 millisecondpulsars that are part of the parkes pulsar timing array sample by examiningintra-observation arrival time variability and single-pulse phenomenology. in 7of the 22 pulsars, in the band centred at approximately 1400mhz, we find thatthe brightest observations are limited by intrinsic jitter. we find consistentresults, either detections or upper limits, for jitter noise in other frequencybands. psr j1909-3744 shows the lowest levels of jitter noise, which weestimate to contribute $\sim$10 ns root mean square error to the arrival timesfor hour-duration observations. larger levels of jitter noise are found inpulsars with wider pulses and distributions of pulse intensities. the jitternoise in psr j0437-4715 decorrelates over a bandwidth of $\sim$2 ghz. we showthat the uncertainties associated with timing pulsar models can be improved byincluding physically motivated jitter uncertainties. pulse-shape variationswill limit the timing precision at future, more sensitive, telescopes; it isimperative to account for this noise when designing instrumentation and timingcampaigns for these facilities.

1408.5129	an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in the parkes  pulsar timing array data set	we present results of an all-sky search in the parkes pulsar timing array(ppta) data release 1 data set for continuous gravitational waves (gws) in thefrequency range from $5\times 10^{-9}$ to $2\times 10^{-7}$ hz. such signalscould be produced by individual supermassive binary black hole systems in theearly stage of coalescence. we phase up the pulsar timing array data set toform, for each position on the sky, two data streams that correspond to the twogw polarizations and then carry out an optimal search for gw signals on thesedata streams. since no statistically significant gws were detected, we placeupper limits on the intrinsic gw strain amplitude $h_0$ for a range of gwfrequencies. for example, at $10^{-8}$ hz our analysis has excluded with $95\%$confidence the presence of signals with $h_0\geqslant 1.7\times 10^{-14}$. ournew limits are about a factor of four more stringent than those of yardley etal. (2010) based on an earlier ppta data set and a factor of two better thanthose reported in the recent arzoumanian et al. (2014) paper. we also presentppta directional sensitivity curves and find that for the most sensitive regionon the sky, the current data set is sensitive to gws from circular supermassivebinary black holes with chirp masses of $10^{9} m_{\odot}$ out to a luminositydistance of about 100 mpc. finally, we set an upper limit of $4 \times 10^{-3}{\rm{mpc}}^{-3} {\rm{gyr}}^{-1}$ at $95\%$ confidence on the coalescence rateof nearby ($z \lesssim 0.1$) supermassive binary black holes in circular orbitswith chirp masses of $10^{10}m_{\odot}$.

1412.0342	a real-time fast radio burst: polarization detection and multiwavelength  follow-up	fast radio bursts (frbs) are one of the most tantalizing mysteries of theradio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapidmultiwavelength follow-up of an frb has been possible. new instrumentation hasdecreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, andenables polarimetry to be performed on frbs for the first time. we havediscovered an frb (frb 140514) in real-time on 14 may, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 utcat the parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengthswithin hours of the event. frb 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (dm)of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z\lesssim 0.5$. frb 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularlypolarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linearpolarization $&lt;10%$. we conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to thefrb. if there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected fromcoherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by faraday rotation causedby passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. frb140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known frb fields, andlies close to a previous discovery, frb 110220; based on the difference in dmsof these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity tosampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. follow-up conductedby 12 telescopes observing from x-ray to radio wavelengths was unable toidentify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out modelsin which frbs originate from nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) supernovae and long durationgamma-ray bursts.

1501.00086	pulsars in globular clusters with the ska	globular clusters are highly efficient radio pulsar factories. these pulsarscan be used as precision probes of the clusters' structure, gas content,magnetic field, and formation history; some of them are also highly interestingin their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios aswell as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity. deep searches withska1-mid and ska1-low will plausibly double to triple the known population.such searches will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be doneduring early commissioning of the telescope - before an all-sky pulsar surveyusing hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. with ska2 it willbe possible to observe most of the active radio pulsars within a large fractionof the galactic globular clusters, an estimated population of 600 - 3700observable pulsars (those beamed towards us). this rivals the total populationof millisecond pulsars that can be found in the galactic field; fullycharacterizing it will provide the best-possible physical laboratories as wellas a rich dynamical history of the galactic globular cluster system.

1503.01841	a study of multi-frequency polarization pulse profiles of millisecond  pulsars	we present high signal-to-noise ratio, multi-frequency polarization pulseprofiles for 24 millisecond pulsars that are being observed as part of theparkes pulsar timing array (ppta) project. the pulsars are observed in threebands, centred close to 730, 1400 and 3100 mhz, using a dual-band 10 cm/50 cmreceiver and the central beam of the 20 cm multibeam receiver. observationsspanning approximately six years have been carefully calibrated and summed toproduce high s/n profiles. this allows us to study the individual profilecomponents and in particular how they evolve with frequency. we also identifypreviously undetected profile features. for many pulsars we show that pulsedemission extends across almost the entire pulse profile. the pulse componentwidths and component separations follow a complex evolution with frequency; insome cases these parameters increase and in other cases they decrease withincreasing frequency. the evolution with frequency of the polarizationproperties of the profile is also non-trivial. we provide evidence that thepre- and post-cursors generally have higher fractional linear polarization thanthe main pulse. we have obtained the spectral index and rotation measure foreach pulsar by fitting across all three observing bands. for the majority ofpulsars, the spectra follow a single power-law and the position angles follow a$\lambda^2$ relation, as expected. however, clear deviations are seen for somepulsars. we also present phase-resolved measurements of the spectral index,fractional linear polarization and rotation measure. all these properties areshown to vary systematically over the pulse profile.

1504.08000	the high time resolution universe pulsar survey xii : galactic plane  acceleration search and the discovery of 60 pulsars	we present initial results from the low-latitude galactic plane region of thehigh time resolution universe pulsar survey conducted at the parkes 64-m radiotelescope. we discuss the computational challenges arising from the processingof the terabyte-sized survey data. two new radio interference mitigationtechniques are introduced, as well as a partially-coherent segmentedacceleration search algorithm which aims to increase our chances of discoveringhighly-relativistic short-orbit binary systems, covering a parameter spaceincluding potential pulsar-black hole binaries. we show that under a constantacceleration approximation, a ratio of data length over orbital period of ~0.1results in the highest effectiveness for this search algorithm. from the 50 percent of data processed thus far, we have re-detected 435 previously knownpulsars and discovered a further 60 pulsars, two of which are fast-spinningpulsars with periods less than 30ms. psr j1101-6424 is a millisecond pulsarwhose heavy white dwarf (wd) companion and short spin period of 5.1ms indicatea rare example of full-recycling via case a roche lobe overflow. psr j1757-27appears to be an isolated recycled pulsar with a relatively long spin period of17ms. in addition, psr j1244-6359 is a mildly-recycled binary system with aheavy wd companion, psr j1755-25 has a significant orbital eccentricity of0.09, and psr j1759-24 is likely to be a long-orbit eclipsing binary withorbital period of the order of tens of years. comparison of ournewly-discovered pulsar sample to the known population suggests that theybelong to an older population. furthermore, we demonstrate that our currentpulsar detection yield is as expected from population synthesis.

1506.07948	pulsar observations of extreme scattering events	extreme scattering events (eses) in the interstellar medium (ism) were firstobserved in regular flux measurements of compact extragalactic sources. theyare characterized by a flux variation over a period of weeks, suggesting thepassage of a "diverging plasma lens" across the line of sight. modeling therefraction of such a lens indicates that the structure size must be of order auand the electron density of order 10s of cm^{-3}. similar structures have beenobserved in measurements of pulsar intensity scintillation and group delay.here we report observations of two eses showing increases in both intensityscintillation and dispersion made with the parkes pulsar timing array (ppta).these allow us to make more complete models of the ese, including an estimateof the "outer-scale" of the turbulence in the plasma lens. these observationsshow clearly that the ese structure is fully turbulent on an au scale. theyprovide some support for the idea that the structures are extended along theline of sight, such as would be the case for a scattering shell. the dispersionmeasurements also show a variety of au scale structures which would not becalled eses, yet involve electron density variations typical of eses and likelyhave the same origin.

1510.08068	versatile directional searches for gravitational waves with pulsar  timing arrays	by regularly monitoring the most stable millisecond pulsars over many years,pulsar timing arrays (ptas) are positioned to detect and study correlations inthe timing behaviour of those pulsars. gravitational waves (gws) fromsupermassive black hole binaries (smbhbs) are an exciting potentiallydetectable source of such correlations. we describe a straight-forwardtechnique by which a pta can be "phased-up" to form time series of the twopolarisation modes of gws coming from a particular direction of the sky. ourtechnique requires no assumptions regarding the time-domain behaviour of a gwsignal. this method has already been used to place stringent bounds on gws fromindividual smbhbs in circular orbits. here, we describe the methodology anddemonstrate the versatility of the technique in searches for a wide variety ofgw signals including bursts with unmodeled waveforms. using the first six yearsof data from the parkes pulsar timing array, we conduct an all-sky search for adetectable excess of gw power from any direction. for the lines of sight toseveral nearby massive galaxy clusters, we carry out a more detailed search forgw bursts with memory, which are distinct signatures of smbhb mergers. in allcases, we find that the data are consistent with noise.

astro-ph;0005561	glitches in southern pulsars	timing observations of 40 mostly young pulsars using the atnf parkes radiotelescope between 1990 january and 1998 december are reported. in total, 20previously unreported glitches and ten other glitches were detected in 11pulsars. these included 12 glitches in psr j1341$- $6220, corresponding to aglitch rate of 1.5 glitches per year. we also detected the largest knownglitch, in psr j1614$-$5047, with $\delta\nu_g/\nu \approx 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$where $\nu = 1/p$ is the pulse frequency. glitch parameters were determinedboth by extrapolating timing solutions to inter-glitch intervals and byphase-coherent timing fits across the glitch(es). analysis of glitchparameters, both from this work and from previously published results, showsthat most glitches have a fractional amplitude $\delta\nu_g/\nu$ of between$10^{-8}$ and $10^{-6}$. there is no consistent relationship between glitchamplitude and the time since the previous glitch or the time to the followingglitch, either for the ensemble or for individual pulsars. as previouslyrecognised, the largest glitch activity is seen in pulsars with ages of order10$^4$ years, but for about 30 per cent of such pulsars, no glitches weredetected in the 8-year data span. there is some evidence for a new type oftiming irregularity in which there is a significant increase in pulse frequencyover a few days, accompanied by a decrease in the magnitude of the slowdownrate. fits of an exponential recovery to post-glitch data show that for mostolder pulsars, only a small fraction of the glitch decays. in some youngerpulsars, a large fraction of the glitch decays, but in others, there is verylittle decay.

astro-ph;0108254	a test of general relativity from the three-dimensional orbital geometry  of a binary pulsar	binary pulsars provide an excellent system for testing general relativitybecause of their intrinsic rotational stability and the precision with whichradio observations can be used to determine their orbital dynamics.measurements of the rate of orbital decay of two pulsars have been shown to beconsistent with the emission of gravitational waves as predicted by generalrelativity, providing the most convincing evidence for the self-consistency ofthe theory to date. however, independent verification of the orbital geometryin these systems was not possible. such verification may be obtained bydetermining the orientation of a binary pulsar system using only classicalgeometric constraints, permitting an independent prediction of generalrelativistic effects. here we report high-precision timing of the nearby binarymillisecond pulsar psr j0437-4715, which establish the three-dimensionalstructure of its orbit. we see the expected retardation of the pulse signalarising from the curvature of space-time in the vicinity of the companionobject (the `shapiro delay'), and we determine the mass of the pulsar and itswhite dwarf companion. such mass determinations contribute to our understandingof the origin and evolution of neutron stars.

astro-ph;0412151	psr j1022+1001: profile stability &amp; precision timing	we present an investigation of the morphology and arrival times of integratedradio pulses from the binary millisecond pulsar psr j1022+1001. this pulsar isrenowned for its poor timing properties, which have been postulated tooriginate from variability in its average pulse profile. although a sub-classof long-period pulsars are known to exhibit mode changes that give rise to verylarge deviations in their integrated profiles, this was the first millisecondpulsar thought to have an unstable mean profile. as part of a precision timingprogram at the parkes radio telescope we observed this pulsar between january2003 and march 2004 using a coherent de-dispersion system (cpsr2). a study ofmorphological variability during our brightest observations suggests that thepulse profile varies by at most a few percent, similar to the uncertainty inour calibration. unlike previous authors, we find that this pulsar timesextremely well. in five minute integrations of 64 mhz bands we obtain aweighted rms residual of just 2.27 microseconds. the reduced chi-squared of ourbest fit is 1.43, which suggests that this pulsar can be timed to high accuracywith standard cross-correlation techniques. combining relativistic constraintswith the pulsar mass function and consideration of the chandrasekhar mass limiton the white dwarf companion, we can constrain the inclination angle of thesystem to lie within the range 37 &lt; i &lt; 56 degrees. for reasonable pulsarmasses, this suggests that the white dwarf is at least 0.9 solar masses. wealso find evidence for secular evolution of the projected semi-major axis.

astro-ph;0504021	on the eccentricities and merger rates of double neutron star binaries  and the creation of "double supernovae"	we demonstrate that a natural consequence of an asymmetric kick imparted toneutron stars at birth is that the majority of double neutron star binariesshould possess highly eccentric orbits. this leads to greatly acceleratedorbital decay, due to the enormous increase in the emission of gravitationalradiation at periastron as originally demonstrated by peters (1964). a uniformdistribution of kick velocities constrained to the orbital plane would resultin ~24% of surviving binaries coalescing at least 10,000 times faster than anunperturbed circular system. even if the planar kick constraint is lifted, ~6%of bound systems still coalesce this rapidly. in a non-negligible fraction ofcases it may even be possible that the system could coalesce within 10 years ofthe final supernova, resulting in what we might term a "double supernova''. forsystems resembling the progenitor of psr j0737-3039a, this number is as high as\~9% (in the planar kick model). whether the kick velocity distribution extendsto the range required to achieve this is still unclear. we do know that theobserved population of binary pulsars has a deficit of highly eccentric systemsat small orbital periods. in contrast, the long-period systems favour largeeccentricities, as expected. we argue that this is because the short-periodhighly eccentric systems have already coalesced and are thus selected againstby pulsar surveys. this effect needs to be taken into account when using thescale-factor method to estimate the coalescence rate of double neutron starbinaries. we therefore assert that the coalesence rate of such binaries isunderestimated by a factor of several.

astro-ph;0512341	green bank telescope studies of giant pulses from millisecond pulsars	we have conducted a search for giant pulses from four millisecond pulsarsusing the 100m green bank telescope. coherently dedispersed time-series frompsr j0218+4232 were found to contain giant pulses of very short intrinsicduration whose energies follow power-law statistics. the giant pulses are inphase with the two minima of the radio integrated pulse profile but are phasealigned with the peaks of the x-ray profile. historically, individual pulsesmore than 10-20 times the mean pulse energy have been deemed to be ``giantpulses''. as only 4 of the 155 pulses had energies greater than 10 times themean pulse-energy, we argue the emission mechanism responsible for giant pulsesshould instead be defined through: (a) intrinsic timescales of microsecond ornanosecond duration; (b) power-law energy statistics; and (c) emissionoccurring in narrow phase-windows coincident with the phase windows ofnon-thermal x-ray emission. four short-duration pulses with giant-pulsecharacteristics were also observed from psr b1957+20. as the inferred magneticfields at the light cylinders of the millisecond pulsars that emit giant pulsesare all very high, this parameter has previously been considered to be anindicator of giant pulse emissivity. however, the frequency of giant pulseemission from psr~b1957+20 is significantly lower than for other millisecondpulsars that have similar magnetic fields at their light cylinders. thissuggests that the inferred magnetic field at the light cylinder is a poorindicator of the rate of emission of giant pulses.

astro-ph;0608155	a study of giant pulses from psr j1824-2452a	we have searched for microsecond bursts of emission from millisecond pulsarsin the globular cluster m28 using the parkes radio telescope. we detected atotal of 27 giant pulses from the known emitter psr j1824-2452a. at wavelengthsaround 20 cm the giant pulses are scatter-broadened to widths of around 2microseconds and follow power-law statistics. the pulses occur in two narrowphase-windows which correlate in phase with x-ray emission and trail the peaksof the integrated radio pulse-components. notably, the integrated radioemission at these phase windows has a steeper spectral index than otheremission. the giant pulses exhibit a high degree of polarization, with manybeing 100% elliptically polarized. their position angles appear random.although the integrated emission of psr j1824-2452a is relatively stable forthe frequencies and bandwidths observed, the intensities of individual giantpulses vary considerably across our bands. two pulses were detected at both2700 and 3500 mhz. the narrower of the two pulses is 20 ns wide at 3500 mhz. at2700 mhz this pulse has an inferred brightness temperature at maximum of 5 x10^37 k. our observations suggest the giant pulses of psr j1824-2452a aregenerated in the same part of the magnetosphere as x-ray emission through adifferent emission process to that of ordinary pulses.

astro-ph;0609013	upper bounds on the low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave  background from pulsar timing observations: current limits and future  prospects	using a statistically rigorous analysis method, we place limits on theexistence of an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background using pulsartiming observations. we consider backgrounds whose characteristic strainspectra may be described as a power-law dependence with frequency. suchbackgrounds include an astrophysical background produced by coalescingsupermassive black-hole binary systems and cosmological backgrounds due torelic gravitational waves and cosmic strings. using the best available data, weobtain an upper limit on the energy density per unit logarithmic frequencyinterval of \omega^{\rm smbh}_g(1/8yr) h^2 &lt;= 1.9 x 10^{-8} for anastrophysical background which is five times more stringent than the earlierkaspi et al. (1994) limit of 1.1 x 10^{-7}. we also provide limits on abackground due to relic gravitational waves and cosmic strings of \omega^{\rmrelic}_g(1/8yr) h^2 &lt;= 2.0 x 10^{-8} and \omega^{\rm cs}_g(1/8yr) h^2 &lt;= 1.9 x10^{-8} respectively. all of the quoted upper limits correspond to a 0.1% falsealarm rate together with a 95% detection rate. we discuss the physicalimplications of these results and highlight the future possibilities of theparkes pulsar timing array project. we find that our current results can 1)constrain the merger rate of supermassive binary black hole systems at high redshift, 2) rule out some relationships between the black hole mass and thegalactic halo mass, 3) constrain the rate of expansion in the inflationary eraand 4) provide an upper bound on the dimensionless tension of a cosmic stringbackground.

astro-ph;0609448	discovery of five recycled pulsars in a high galactic latitude survey	we present five recycled pulsars discovered during a 21-cm survey ofapproximately 4,150 deg^2 between 15 deg and 30 deg from the galactic planeusing the parkes radio telescope. one new pulsar, psr j1528-3146, has a 61 msspin period and a massive white dwarf companion. like many recycled pulsarswith heavy companions, the orbital eccentricity is relatively high (~0.0002),consistent with evolutionary models that predict less time for circularization.the four remaining pulsars have short spin periods (3 ms &lt; p &lt; 6 ms); three ofthese have probable white dwarf binary companions and one (psr j2010-1323) isisolated. psr j1600-3053 is relatively bright for its dispersion measure of52.3 pc cm^-3 and promises good timing precision thanks to an intrinsicallynarrow feature in its pulse profile, resolvable through coherent dedispersion.in this survey, the recycled pulsar discovery rate was one per four days oftelescope time or one per 600 deg^2 of sky. the variability of these sourcesimplies that there are more millisecond pulsars that might be found byrepeating this survey.

astro-ph;0702141	difx: a software correlator for very long baseline interferometry using  multi-processor computing environments	we describe the development of an fx style correlator for very long baselineinterferometry (vlbi), implemented in software and intended to run inmulti-processor computing environments, such as large clusters of commoditymachines (beowulf clusters) or computers specifically designed for highperformance computing, such as multi-processor shared-memory machines. weoutline the scientific and practical benefits for vlbi correlation, thesechiefly being due to the inherent flexibility of software and the fact that thehighly parallel and scalable nature of the correlation task is well suited to amulti-processor computing environment. we suggest scientific applications wheresuch an approach to vlbi correlation is most suited and will give the bestreturns. we report detailed results from the distributed fx (difx) softwarecorrelator, running on the swinburne supercomputer (a beowulf cluster ofapproximately 300 commodity processors), including measures of the performanceof the system. for example, to correlate all stokes products for a 10 antennaarray, with an aggregate bandwidth of 64 mhz per station and using typical timeand frequency resolution presently requires of order 100 desktop-class computenodes. due to the effect of moore's law on commodity computing performance, thetotal number and cost of compute nodes required to meet a given correlationtask continues to decrease rapidly with time. we show detailed comparisonsbetween difx and two existing hardware-based correlators: the australian longbaseline array (lba) s2 correlator, and the nrao very long baseline array(vlba) correlator. in both cases, excellent agreement was found between thecorrelators. finally, we describe plans for the future operation of difx on theswinburne supercomputer, for both astrophysical and geodetic science.

astro-ph;0702366	dispersion measure variations and their effect on precision pulsar  timing	we present an analysis of the variations seen in the dispersion measures(dms) of 20 millisecond pulsars observed as part of the parkes pulsar timingarray project. we carry out a statistically rigorous structure functionanalysis for each pulsar and show that the variations seen for most pulsars areconsistent with those expected for an interstellar medium characterised by akolmogorov turbulence spectrum. the structure functions for psrs j1045-4509 andj1909-3744 provide the first clear evidence for a large inner scale, possiblydue to ion-neutral damping. we also show the effect of the solar wind on thedms and show that the simple models presently implemented into pulsar timingpackages cannot reliably correct for this effect. for the first time we clearlyshow how dm variations affect pulsar timing residuals and how they can becorrected in order to obtain the highest possible timing precision. even withour presently limited data span, the residuals (and all parameters derived fromthe timing) for six of our pulsars have been significantly improved bycorrecting for the dm variations.

astro-ph;9505044	psr j0045-7319: a dual-line binary radio pulsar	binary radio pulsars are superb tools for mapping binary orbits, because ofthe precision of the pulse timing method (taylor and weisberg 1989). to date,all orbital parameters for binary pulsars have been derived from observationsof the pulsar alone. we present the first observations of the radial velocityvariations due to the binary motion of a companion to a radio pulsar. ourresults demonstrate that the companion to the small magellanic cloud pulsar psrj0045-7319 is the b1v star identified by kaspi et al. (1994). the mass ratio ofthe system is 6.3 +/- 1.2, which, for a neutron star mass of 1.4 mo, implies amass of 8.8 +/- 1.8 mo for the companion, consistent with the mass expected fora b1v star. the inclination angle for the binary system is therefore 44 +/- 5degrees, and the projected rotational velocity of the companion is 113 +/- 10km/s. the heliocentric radial velocity of the binary system is consistent withthat of other stars and gas in the same region of the small magellanic cloud.

astro-ph;9803182	timing models for the long-orbital period binary pulsar psr b1259-63	the pulsar psr b1259-63 is in a highly eccentric 3.4-yr orbit with the bestar ss 2883. timing observations of this pulsar, made over a 7-yr period usingthe parkes 64-m radio telescope, cover two periastron passages, in 1990 augustand 1994 january. the timing data cannot be fitted by the normal pulsar andkeplerian binary parameters. a timing solution including a (non-precessing)keplerian orbit and timing noise (represented as a polynomial of fifth order intime) provide a satisfactory fit to the data. however, because the be starprobably has a significant quadrupole moment, we prefer to interpret the databy a combination of timing noise, dominated by a cubic phase term, and$\dot\omega$ and $\dot x$ terms. we show that the $\dot\omega$ and $\dot x$ arelikely to be a result of a precessing orbit caused by the quadrupole moment ofthe tilted companion star. we further rule out a number of possible physicaleffects which could contribute to the timing data of psr b1259-63 on ameasurable level.

astro-ph;9811398	millisecond pulsar velocities	we present improved timing parameters for 13 millisecond pulsars (msps)including 9 new proper motion measurements. these new proper motions bring to23 the number of msps with measured transverse velocities. in light of thesenew results we present and compare the kinematic properties of msps with thoseof ordinary pulsars. the mean transverse velocity of msps was found to be85+/-13 km/s; a value consistent with most models for the origin and evolutionof msps and approximately a factor of four lower than that of ordinary pulsars.we also find that, in contrast to young ordinary pulsars, the vast majority ofwhich are moving away from the galactic plane, almost half of the msps aremoving towards the plane. this near isotropy would be expected of a populationthat has reached dynamic equilibrium. accurate measurements of msp velocitieshave allowed us to correct their measured spin-down rates for doppleracceleration effects, and thereby derive their intrinsic magnetic fieldstrengths and characteristic ages. we find that close to half of our sample ofmsps have a characteristic age comparable to or greater than the age of thegalaxy.

astro-ph;9903474	comptel detection of pulsed gamma-ray emission from b1509-58 up to at  least 10 mev	we report on the first firm detection of pulsed gamma-ray emission from psrb1509-58 in the 0.75-30 mev energy range in cgro comptel data collected overmore than 6 years. the modulation significance in the 0.75-30 mev pulse-phasedistribution is 5.4 sigma and the lightcurve is similar to the lightcurvesfound earlier between 0.7 and 700 kev: a single broad asymmetric pulse reachingits maximum 0.38 +/- 0.03 in phase after the radio peak, compared to the offsetof 0.30 found in the cgro batse soft gamma-ray data, and 0.27 +/- 0.01 for rxte(2-16 kev), compatible with asca (0.7-2.2 kev). spectral analysis based on theexcess counts in the broad pulse of the lightcurve shows that extrapolation ofthe osse power-law spectral fit with index -1.68 describes our data well up to10 mev. above 10 mev the spectrum breaks abruptly. the precise location of thebreak/bend between 10 and 30 mev depends on the interpretation of the structurein the lightcurve measured by comptel and egret above 10 mev.

astro-ph;9906372	parallax of psr j1744-1134 and the local interstellar medium	we present the annual trigonometric parallax of psr j1744-1134 derived froman analysis of pulse times of arrival. the measured parallax, pi = 2.8+/-0.3mas ranks among the most precisely determined distances to any pulsar. theparallax distance of 357+/-39 pc is over twice that derived from the dispersionmeasure using the taylor &amp; cordes model for the galactic electron distribution.the mean electron density in the path to the pulsar, n_e = (0.0088 +/- 0.0009)cm^{-3}, is the lowest for any disk pulsar. we have compared the n_e for psrj1744-1134 with those for another 11 nearby pulsars with independent distanceestimates. we conclude that there is a striking asymmetry in the distributionof electrons in the local interstellar medium. the electron column densitiesfor pulsars in the third galactic quadrant are found to be systematicallyhigher than for those in the first. the former correlate with the position ofthe well known local hi cavity in quadrant three. the excess electrons withinthe cavity may be in the form of hii clouds marking a region of interactionbetween the local hot bubble and a nearby superbubble.

astro-ph;9906373	high-energy gamma-ray observations of two young, energetic radio pulsars	we present results of compton gamma-ray observatory egret observations of theunidentified high-energy gamma-ray sources 2eg j1049-5847 (gev j1047-5840, 3egj1048-5840) and 2eg j1103-6106 (3eg j1102-6103). these sources are spatiallycoincident with the young, energetic radio pulsars psrs b1046-58 andj1105-6107, respectively. we find evidence for an association between psrb1046-58 and 2eg j1049-5847. the gamma-ray pulse profile, obtained by foldingtime-tagged photons having energies above 400 mev using contemporaneous radioephemerides, has probability of arising by chance of 1.2e-4 according to thebinning-independent h-test. a spatial analysis of the on-pulse photons revealsa point source of equivalent significance 10.2 sigma. off-pulse, thesignificance drops to 5.8 sigma. archival asca data show that the only hardx-ray point source in the 95% confidence error box of the gamma-ray source isspatially coincident with the pulsar within the 1' uncertainty (pivovaroff,kaspi &amp; gotthelf 1999). the double peaked gamma-ray pulse morphology andleading radio pulse are similar to those seen for other gamma-ray pulsars andare well-explained in models in which the gamma-ray emission is produced incharge-depleted gaps in the outer magnetosphere. the inferred pulsed gamma-rayflux above 400 mev, (2.5 +/- 0.6) x 10e-10 erg/cm^2/s, represents 0.011 +/-0.003 of the pulsar's spin-down luminosity, for a distance of 3 kpc and 1 srbeaming. for psr j1105-6107, light curves obtained by folding egret photonsusing contemporaneous radio ephemerides show no significant features. weconclude that this pulsar converts less than 0.014 of its spin-down luminosityinto e &gt; 100 mev gamma-rays beaming in our direction (99% confidence), assuminga distance of 7 kpc, 1 sr beaming and a duty cycle of 0.5.
