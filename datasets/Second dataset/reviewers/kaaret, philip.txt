0902.2607	spectral states and evolution of ultraluminous x-ray sources	we examined spectral evolution in ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) withapparent luminosities of about 10^40 ergs/s. based on new results in this paperand those reported in the literature, two common spectral behaviors were found.some ulxs in starburst galaxies have varying luminosity (l) but remain in thehard state with power-law spectra and a constant, hard photon index (gamma).other ulxs, such as ngc 5204 x-1, show a correlation between l and gamma. weinterpret this l-gamma correlated phase as an intermediate state with hybridproperties from the thermal dominant and steep power-law states. when thespectra of ngc 5204 x-1 are fitted with a multicolor disk blackbody pluspower-law model, the x-ray luminosity increases with the effective temperatureof the accretion disk in a manner similar to that found in stellar-mass blackhole x-ray binaries, suggesting that the emission arises from an accretiondisk. the luminosity, disk size, and temperature suggest that ngc 5204 x-1harbors a compact object more massive than stellar-mass black holes. incontrast, the disk model in ic 342 x-1 is ruled out because the luminositydecreases as the temperature increases; sources with such behaviors mayrepresent a class of objects with super-eddington accretion. also, we report apeculiar soft spectral feature from ic 342 x-2 and variability on a time scaleof 20 ks from holmberg ii x-1. more observations are needed to test theseresults.

0902.4238	x-ray timing of stellar mass black holes	x-ray timing observations of accreting stellar mass black holes have shownthat they can produce signals with such short time scales that we must beprobing very close to the innermost stable circular orbit that is predicted bythe theory of general relativity (gr). these signals are quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos), and both the high-frequency variety (hfqpos, which havefrequencies in the 40-450 hz range) as well as the 0.1-10 hz low-frequency typehave the potential to provide tests of gr in the strong field limit. animportant step on the path to gr tests is to constrain the physical black holeproperties, and the straightforward frequency measurements that are possiblewith x-ray timing may provide one of the cleanest measurements of black holespins. while current x-ray satellites have uncovered these phenomenona, thehfqpos are weak signals, and future x-ray timing missions with larger effectivearea are required for testing the candidate theoretical qpo mechanisms. anothermain goal in the study of accreting black holes is to understand the productionof relativistic jets. here, we have also made progress during the past decadeby finding clear connections between the radio emission that traces thestrength of the jet and the properties of the x-ray emission. with new radiocapabilities just coming on-line, continuing detailed x-ray studies ofaccreting black holes is crucial for continuing to make progress.

0903.5329	a photoionized nebula surrounding and variable optical continuum  emission from the ultraluminous x-ray source in ngc 5408	we obtained optical spectra of the counterpart of the ultraluminous x-raysource ngc 5408 x-1 using the fors spectrograph on the vlt. the spectra showstrong high excitation emission lines, he{\sc ii} $\lambda$4686 and [ne{\sc v}]$\lambda$3426, indicative of x-ray photoionization. using the measured x-rayspectrum as input to a photoionization model, we calculated the relationbetween the he{\sc ii} and x-ray luminosities and found that the he{\sc ii}flux implies a lower bound on the x-ray luminosity of $3 \times 10^{39} \rm ergs^{-1}$. the [ne{\sc v}] flux requires a similar x-ray luminosity. aftersubtraction of the nebular emission, the continuum appears to have a power-lawform with a spectral slope of $-2.0^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. this is similar to low-massx-ray binaries where the optical spectra are dominated by reprocessing ofx-rays in the outer accretion disk. in one observation, the continuum, he{\scii} $\lambda$4686, and [ne{\sc v}] $\lambda$3426 fluxes are about 30% lowerthan in the other five observations. this implies that part of the lineemission originates within one light-day of the compact object. fitting theoptical continuum emission and archival x-ray data to an irradiated disk model,we find that $(6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{-3}$ of the total bolometric luminosityis thermalized in the outer accretion disk. this is consistent with valuesfound for stellar-mass x-ray binaries and larger than expected in models ofsuper-eddington accretion flows. we find no evidence for absorption lines thatwould permit measurement of the radial velocity of the companion star.

0911.2240	truncation of the inner accretion disk around a black hole at low  luminosity	most black hole binaries show large changes in x-ray luminosity causedprimarily by variations in mass accretion rate. an important question forunderstanding black hole accretion and jet production is whether the inner edgeof the accretion disk recedes at low accretion rate. measurements of thelocation of the inner edge (rin) can be made using iron emission lines thatarise due to fluorescence of iron in the disk, and these indicate that rin isvery close to the black hole at high and moderate luminosities (near 1% of theeddington luminosity, ledd). here, we report on x-ray observations of the blackhole gx 339-4 in the hard state by suzaku and the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte) that extend iron line studies to 0.14% ledd and show that rin increasesby a factor of &gt;27 over the value found when gx 339-4 was bright. the exactvalue of rin depends on the inclination of the inner disk (i), and we derive90% confidence limits of rin &gt; 35 rg at i = 0 degrees and rin &gt; 175 rg at i =30 degrees. this provides direct evidence that the inner portion of the disk isnot present at low luminosity, allowing for the possibility that the inner diskis replaced by advection- or magnetically-dominated accretion flows.

1001.3456	discovery of mhz x-ray oscillations in a transient ultraluminous x-ray  source in m82	we report the discovery of x-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) atfrequencies of 3-4 mhz from a transient ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx)x42.3+59 in m82. the qpos are strong and broad and appear with weak or absentred noise, and are detected only in chandra observations when the source isbrighter than 10^40 ergs/s. the qpo behavior is similar to the type a-i qposfound in xte j1550-564, which is a subclass of low frequency qpos withproperties in between type a and b. therefore, we identify the qpos in x42.3+59as of type a or b, and rule out the possibility of type c. with thisidentification, the mass of the black hole in x42.3+59 can be inferred as inthe range of 12,000-43,000 solar masses by scaling the qpo frequency to that ofthe type a/b qpos in stellar mass black holes. cool disk emission is detectedin one chandra observation, and the disk inner radius suggests a similar blackhole mass range. black holes of such a high mass are able to produce an energyoutput in a manner similar to x42.3+59 by accreting from the interstellarmedium directly.

1003.0283	identification of the x-ray thermal dominant state in an ultraluminous  x-ray source in m82	the thermal dominant state in black hole binaries (bhbs) is well understoodbut rarely seen in ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs). using simultaneousobservations of m82 with chandra and xmm-newton, we report the first likelyidentification of the thermal dominant state in a ulx based on thedisappearance of x-ray oscillations, low timing noise, and a spectrum dominatedby multicolor disk emission with luminosity varying to the 4th power of thedisk temperature. this indicates that ulxs are similar to galactic bhbs. thebrightest x-ray spectrum can be fitted with a relativistic disk model witheither a highly super-eddington (l_disk/l_edd = 160) non-rotating black hole ora close to eddington (l_disk/l_edd ~ 2) rapidly rotating black hole. the latterinterpretation is preferred, due to the absence of such highly super-eddingtonstates in galactic black holes and active galactic nuclei, and suggests thatthe ulx in m82 contains a black hole of 200-800 solar masses with nearlymaximal spin. on long timescales, the source normally stays at a relatively lowflux level with a regular 62-day orbital modulation and occasionally exhibitsirregular flaring activity. the thermal dominant states are all found duringoutbursts.

0711.4131	optical counterpart of the ultraluminous x-ray source ic 342 x-1	we present chandra and hst observations of the ultraluminous x-ray source(ulx) ic 342 x-1. the chandra and hst images are aligned using two x-rayemitting foreground stars. the astrometry corrected position for x-1 is r.a. =03h45m55.61s, decl. = +68d04m55.3s (j2000) with an error circle of 0.2". oneextended optical source is found in the error circle, which could be theoptical counterpart of x-1. the source shows an extended feature in hst imagesat long wavelengths, which is likely to be a superposition of two pointsources, although it is possible that the dimmer one could be a jet. bothsources are much redder than typical for ulx optical counterparts. the brighterone has an absolute magnitude m_v = -5.2 +/- 0.2 and (b-v)_0 = 0.66 +/- 0.13and the dimmer star is not detected in b and has (b-v)_0 &gt; 2.1. their colorsare consistent with an f8 to g0 ib supergiant or a carbon star, respectively.however, it is likely that part or most of the optical emission may be due tox-rays reprocessed by the companion star or the accretion disk. the stellarneighborhood of ic 342 x-1 lacks o stars and has a minimum age of ~10 myr. thisexcludes the possibility that the surrounding nebula is powered by an energeticexplosion of a single massive star that formed a black hole. we suggest thatthe nebula is most likely powered by an outflow from the x-ray source.

1309.6995	xipe: the x-ray imaging polarimetry explorer	x-ray polarimetry, sometimes alone, and sometimes coupled to spectral andtemporal variability measurements and to imaging, allows a wealth of physicalphenomena in astrophysics to be studied. x-ray polarimetry investigates theacceleration process, for example, including those typical of magneticreconnection in solar flares, but also emission in the strong magnetic fieldsof neutron stars and white dwarfs. it detects scattering in asymmetricstructures such as accretion disks and columns, and in the so-called moleculartorus and ionization cones. in addition, it allows fundamental physics inregimes of gravity and of magnetic field intensity not accessible toexperiments on the earth to be probed. finally, models that describefundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity and the extension of thestandard model) can be tested. we describe in this paper the x-ray imagingpolarimetry explorer (xipe), proposed in june 2012 to the first esa call for asmall mission with a launch in 2017 but not selected. xipe is composed of twoout of the three existing jet-x telescopes with two gas pixel detectors (gpd)filled with a he-dme mixture at their focus and two additional gpds filled withpressurized ar-dme facing the sun. the minimum detectable polarization is 14 %at 1 mcrab in 10e5 s (2-10 kev) and 0.6 % for an x10 class flare. the halfenergy width, measured at panter x-ray test facility (mpe, germany) with jet-xoptics is 24 arcsec. xipe takes advantage of a low-earth equatorial orbit withmalindi as down-link station and of a mission operation center (moc) at inpe(brazil).

0802.3357	broadband x-ray spectra of gx 339-4 and the geometry of accreting black  holes in the hard state	a major question in the study of black hole binaries involves ourunderstanding of the accretion geometry when the sources are in the hard state.in this state, the x-ray energy spectrum is dominated by a hard power-lawcomponent and radio observations indicate the presence of a steady and powerfulcompact jet. although the common hard state picture is that the accretion diskis truncated, perhaps at hundreds of gravitational radii from the black hole,recent results for the recurrent transient gx 339-4 by miller and co-workersshow evidence for optically thick material very close to the black hole'sinnermost stable circular orbit. that work focused on an observation of gx339-4 at a luminosity of about 5% of the eddington limit and used parametersfrom a relativistic reflection model and the presence of a soft, thermalcomponent as diagnostics. in this work, we use similar diagnostics, but extendthe study to lower luminosities (2.3% and 0.8% ledd) using swift and rxteobservations of gx 339-4. we detect a thermal component with an inner disktemperature of ~0.2 kev at 2.3% ledd. we detect broad features due to ironkalpha that are likely related to reflection of hard x-rays off the opticallythick material. if these features are broadened by relativistic effects, theyindicate that optically thick material resides within 10 rg down to 0.8% ledd,and the measurements are consistent with the inner radius of the disk remainingat ~4 rg down to this level. however, we also discuss an alternative model forthe broadening, and we note that the evolution of the thermal component is notentirely consistent with the constant inner radius interpretation. finally, wediscuss the results in terms of recent theoretical work on the possibility thatmaterial may condense to maintain an inner optically thick disk.

1404.3132	x-ray binary formation in low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies	x-rays from binaries in small, metal-deficient galaxies may have contributedsignificantly to the heating and reionization of the early universe. weinvestigate this claim by studying blue compact dwarfs (bcds) as localanalogues to these early galaxies. we constrain the relation of the x-rayluminosity function (xlf) to the star-formation rate (sfr) using a bayesianapproach applied to a sample of 25 bcds. the functional form of the xlf isfixed to that found for near-solar metallicity galaxies and is used to find theprobability distribution of the normalisation that relates x-ray luminosity tosfr. our results suggest that the xlf normalisation for low metallicity bcds(12+log(o/h) &lt; 7.7) is not consistent with the xlf normalisation for galaxieswith near solar metallicities, at a confidence level of 1-5e-6. the xlfnormalisation for the bcds is found to be 14.5 +/- 4.8 (m_solar^-1 yr), afactor of 9.7 +/- 3.2 higher than for near solar metallicity galaxies.simultaneous determination of the xlf normalisation and power law index resultin estimates of q = 21.2^+12.2_-8.8) (m_solar^-1 yr) and alpha =1.89^{+0.41}_{-0.30}, respectively. our results suggest a significantenhancement in the population of high-mass x-ray binaries in bcds compared tothe near-solar metallicity galaxies. this suggests that x-ray binaries couldhave been a significant source of heating in the early universe.

1502.03443	transition of an x-ray binary to the hard ultraluminous state in the  blue compact dwarf galaxy vii zw 403	we examine the x-ray spectra of vii zw 403, a nearby low-metallicity bluecompact dwarf (bcd) galaxy. the galaxy has been observed to contain an x-raysource, likely a high mass x-ray binary (hmxb), with a luminosity of1.3-23x10^38 erg s^-1 in the 0.3-8 kev energy range. a new suzaku observationshows a transition to a luminosity of 1.7x10^40 erg s^-1 [0.3-8 kev], higher bya factor of 7-130. the spectra from the high flux state are hard, bestdescribed by a disk plus comptonization model, and exhibit curvature atenergies above 5 kev. this is consistent with many high-quality ultraluminousx-ray source spectra which have been interpreted as stellar mass black holes(stmbh) accreting at super-eddington rates. however, this lies in contrast toanother hmxb in a low-metallicity bcd, i zw 18, that exhibits a soft spectrumat high flux, similar to galactic black hole binaries and has been interpretedas a possible intermediate mass black hole. determining the spectral propertiesof hmxbs in bcds has important implications for models of the epoch ofreionization. it is thought that the main component of x-ray heating in theearly universe was dominated by hmxbs within the first galaxies. early galaxieswere small, metal-deficient, star forming galaxies with large h i massfractions --- properties shared by local bcds we see today. understanding thespectral evolution of hmxbs in early universe analogue galaxies, such as bcds,is an important step in estimating their contribution to the heating of theintergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization. the strong contrastbetween the properties of the only two spectroscopically studied hmxbs withinbcds motivates further study on larger samples of hmxbs in low metallicityenvironments in order to properly estimate the x-ray heating in the earlyuniverse.

(2003) for a sample ofstar-forming galaxies. combining our results with a sample of galaxies withsfrs above 1 solar mass/year, we find that the number of x-ray point sourcesabove a luminosity of 2e38 erg/s is n = (1.8 +/- 0.4) sfr/(solar mass/year).this number is lower than previously inferred by grimm et al. based on a sampleof galaxies with lower sfrs. we find that the ratio of x-ray luminosity in the2-10 kev band to sfr is l_x/(10e40 erg/s) = (0.37 +/- 0.08) sfr/(solarmass/year). this value may serve as a calibration in attempts to use x-rayluminosity to measure the sfr of galaxies at cosmological distances. the ratioof mass accreted onto compact objects versus mass used to form stars is near1e-6. this ratio may be useful in constraining population synthesis models ofx-ray binary formation in actively star forming systems.

1506.00790	a luminous x-ray flare from the nucleus of the dormant bulgeless spiral  galaxy ngc 247	ngc 247 is a nearby late-type bulgeless spiral galaxy that contains aninactive nucleus. we report a serendipitous discovery of an x-ray flare fromthe galaxy center with a luminosity up to 2*10^39 erg/s in the 0.3-10 kev bandwith xmm-newton. a chandra observation confirms that the new x-ray source isspatially coincident with the galaxy nucleus. the xmm-newton data revealed ahard power-law spectrum with a spectral break near 3-4 kev, no pulsations ontimescales longer than 150 ms, and a flat power spectrum consistent withpoisson noise from 1 mhz to nearly 10 hz. follow-up observations with swiftdetected a second flux peak followed by a luminosity drop by factor of almost20. the spectral and temporal behaviors of the nuclear source are wellconsistent with the scenario that the flare was due to an outburst of alow-mass x-ray binary that contains a stellar-mass black hole emitting near itseddington limit at the peak. however, it cannot be ruled out that the suddenbrightening in the nucleus was due to accretion onto a possible low-massnuclear black hole, fed by a tidally disrupted star or a gas cloud; the maxiobservations limit the peak luminosity of the flare to less than ~10^43 erg/s,suggesting that it is either a low mass black hole or an inefficient tidaldisruption event (tde).

1506.06780	the accreting black hole swift j1753.5-0127 from radio to hard x-ray	(abridged) we report on multi-wavelength measurements of swift j1753.5-0127in the hard state at l=2.7e36 erg/s (assuming d=3 kpc) in 2014. the radioemission is optically thick synchrotron, presumably from a compact jet. we takeadvantage of the low extinction and model the near-ir to uv emission with amulti-temperature disk model. assuming a bh mass of m_bh=5 msun and a systeminclination of 40 deg, the fits imply an inner radius for the disk ofrin/rg&gt;212 d_3 (5msun/m_bh). the outer radius is r_out/r_g=90,000 d_3(5msun/m_bh), which corresponds to 6.6e10 d_3 cm, consistent with the expectedsize of the disk. the 0.5-240 kev spectrum measured by swift/xrt, suzaku, andnustar is relatively well characterized by a power-law with a photon index ofgamma=1.722+/-0.003, but a significant improvement is seen when a secondcontinuum component is added. reflection is a possibility, but no iron line isdetected, implying a low iron abundance. we are able to fit the entire sed witha multi-temperature disk component, a comptonization component, and a brokenpower-law, representing the emission from the compact jet. the broken power-lawcannot significantly contribute to the soft x-ray emission, and this may berelated to why swift j1753.5-0127 is an outlier in the radio/x-ray correlation.the broken power-law might dominate above 20 kev, which would constrain thebreak frequency to be between 2.4e10 hz and 3.6e12 hz. although the fits to thefull sed do not include significant thermal emission in the x-ray band,previous observations have consistently seen such a component, and we find thatthere is evidence at the 3.1-sigma level for a disk-blackbody component with atemperature of 150(+30)(-20) ev and an inner radius of 5-14 r_g. if thiscomponent is real, it might imply the presence of an inner accretion disk inaddition to the strongly truncated (r_in&gt;212 r_g) disk.

(science, 298, 196 and astro-ph/0210224), and here, we present an analysisof the three chandra observations made between 2000 june and 2000 september.for these observations, a source is present that moves in an eastward directionaway from the point source associated with the compact object. the separationbetween the new source and the compact object changes from 21.3 arcseconds injune to 23.4 arcseconds in september, implying a proper motion of 21.2 +/- 7.2mas/day, a projected separation of 0.31-0.85 pc and an apparent jet velocitybetween 0.34 +/- 0.12 and 0.93 +/- 0.32 times the speed of light for a sourcedistance range of d = 2.8-7.6 kpc. these observations represent the first timethat an x-ray jet proper motion measurement has been obtained for any accretionpowered galactic or extra-galactic source. while this work deals with the jetto the east of the compact object, the western jet has also been detected inthe x-ray and radio bands. the most likely scenario is that the eastern jet isthe approaching jet and that the jet material was ejected from the black holein 1998. along with a 1998 vlbi proper motion measurement, the chandra propermotion indicates that the eastern jet decelerated between 1998 and 2000. wepresent results on the morphology and energy spectrum of the jet. we cannotdefinitively determine the x-ray emission mechanism, but a synchrotron originis viable and may provide the simplest explanation for the observations.

astro-ph;0304219	x-ray flares and oscillations from the black hole candidate x-ray  transient xte j1650-500 at low luminosity	we report on x-ray observations made with the rossi x-ray timing explorer ofthe black hole candidate (bhc) transient xte j1650-500 at the end of its first,and currently only, outburst. by monitoring the source at low luminosities overseveral months, we found 6 bright ~100 second x-ray flares and long time scaleoscillations of the x-ray flux. the oscillations are aperiodic with acharacteristic time scale of 14.2 days and an order of magnitude variation inthe 2.8-20 kev flux. the oscillations may be related to optical"mini-outbursts" that have been observed at the ends of outbursts for othershort orbital period bhc transients. the x-ray flares have durations between 62and 215 seconds and peak fluxes that are 5-24 times higher than the persistentflux. the flares have non-thermal energy spectra and occur when the persistentluminosity is near 3e34 (d/4 kpc)^2 erg/s (2.8-20 kev). the rise time for thebrightest flare demonstrates that physical models for bhc systems must be ableto account for the situation where the x-ray flux increases by a factor of upto 24 on a time scale of seconds. we discuss the flares in the context ofobservations and theory of galactic bhcs and compare the flares to thosedetected from sgr a*, the super-massive black hole at the galactic center. wealso compare the flares to x-ray bursts that are seen in neutron star systems.while some of the flare light curves are similar to those of neutron starbursts, the flares have non-thermal energy spectra in contrast to the blackbodyspectra exhibited in bursts. this indicates that x-ray bursts should not betaken as evidence that a given system contains a neutron star unless thepresence of a blackbody component in the burst spectrum can be demonstrated.

astro-ph;0307458	detection of low-hard state spectral and timing signatures from the  black hole x-ray transient xte j1650-500 at low x-ray luminosities	using the chandra x-ray observatory and the rossi x-ray timing explorer, wehave studied the black hole candidate (bhc) x-ray transient xte j1650-500 nearthe end of its 2001-2002 outburst after its transition to the low-hard state atx-ray luminosities down to l = 1.5e34 erg/s (1-9 kev, assuming a sourcedistance of 4 kpc). our results include a characterization of the spectral andtiming properties. at the lowest sampled luminosity, we used an 18 ks chandraobservation to measure the power spectrum at low frequencies. for the 3 epochsat which we obtained chandra/rxte observations, the 0.5-20 kev energy spectrumis consistent with a spectral model consisting of a power-law with interstellarabsorption. we detect evolution in the power-law photon index from 1.66 +/-0.05 to 1.93 +/- 0.13 (90% confidence errors), indicating that the sourcesoftens at low luminosities. the power spectra are characterized by strong(20-35% fractional rms) band-limited noise, which we model as a zero-centeredlorentzian. including results from an rxte study of xte j1650-500 near thetransition to the low-hard state by kalemci et al. (2003), the half-width ofthe zero-centered lorentzian (roughly where the band-limited noise cuts off)drops from 4 hz at l = 7e36 erg/s (1-9 kev, absorbed) to 0.067 +/- 0.007 hz atl = 9e34 erg/s to 0.0035 +/- 0.0010 hz at the lowest luminosity. while thespectral and timing parameters evolve with luminosity, it is notable that thegeneral shapes of the energy and power spectra remain the same, indicating thatthe source stays in the low-hard state. this implies that the x-ray emittingregion of the system likely keeps the same overall structure, while theluminosity changes by a factor of 470. we discuss how these results mayconstrain theoretical black hole accretion models.

astro-ph;0404287	the low quiescent x-ray luminosity of the neutron star transient xte  j2123-058	we report on the first x-ray observations of the neutron star soft x-raytransient (sxt) xte j2123-058 in quiescence, made by chandra and bepposax, aswell as contemporaneous optical observations. in 2002, the chandra spectrum ofxte j2123-058 is consistent with a power-law model, or the combination of ablackbody plus a power-law, but it is not well-described by a pure blackbody.using the interstellar column density, the power-law fit gives photon index of3.1 (+0.7,-0.6) and indicates a 0.3-8 kev unabsorbed luminosity of 9(+4,-3)e31(d/8.5 kpc)^2 ergs/s (90% confidence errors). fits with models consisting ofthermal plus power-law components indicate that the upper limit on thetemperature of a 1.4 solar mass, 10 km radius neutron star with a hydrogenatmosphere is kt_eff &lt; 66 ev, and the upper limit on the bolometric luminosityis l_infinity &lt; 1.4e32 ergs/s, assuming d = 8.5 kpc. of the neutron star sxtsthat exhibit short (&lt; 1 year) outbursts, including aql x-1, 4u 1608-522, cenx-4, and sax j1810.8-2609, the lowest temperatures and luminosities are foundfor xte j2123-058 and sax j1810.8-2609. from the bepposax observation of xtej2123-058 in 2000, we obtained an upper limit on the 1-10 kev unabsorbedluminosity of 9e32 ergs/s. although this upper limit allows that the x-rayluminosity may have decreased between 2000 and 2002, that possibility is notsupported by our contemporaneous r-band observations, which indicate that theoptical flux increased significantly. motivated by the theory of deep crustalheating by brown and co-workers, we characterize the outburst histories of thefive sxts. the low quiescent luminosity for xte j2123-058 is consistent withthe theory of deep crustal heating without requiring enhanced neutron starcooling if the outburst recurrence time is &gt;~ 70 years.

astro-ph;9809098	broad-band x-ray spectra of the black hole candidate gro j1655-40	we present broad-band (2 kev to 2 mev) x-ray spectra of gro j1655-40, aluminous x-ray transient and occasional source of relativistic radio jets,obtained with rxte and osse. in one observation, the luminosity is found to be18% of the eddington limit, which is one of the highest luminosities everobserved from gro j1655-40. for this observation, we find that an adequate fitis obtained when a broad iron line and a reflection component are added to amodel consisting of a power-law plus a soft excess component. the 95%confidence lower limit on the rms line width is 0.86 kev. the power-lawcomponent has a photon index of 2.72 and extends to at least 800 kev without acutoff. after this observation, a significant drop in the (5-12 kev)/(1.5-5kev) hardness ratio occurred on a timescale less than 2 hours. from an rxteobservation of gro j1655-40 made after the hardness transition, we find thatthe power-law index is harder (2.415 +/- 0.011), the flux of the power-lawcomponent is lower, and the total luminosity is 10% of the eddington limit. thechange in the power-law component is consistent with the correlation betweenthe spectral index and power-law flux previously reported for gro j1655-40.

astro-ph;9812208	measurement of hard lags and coherences in the x-ray flux of accreting  neutron stars and comparison with accreting black holes	using the rossi x-ray timing explorer we have measured lags of the 9 to 33kev photons relative to the 2 to 9 kev photons in the timing noise between 0.01and 100 hz in the accreting neutron stars 4u 0614+091 and 4u 1705-44. weperformed similar measurements on the accreting black hole candidates cyg x-1and gx 339-4 as a comparison. during the observations these sources were all inlow (hard) states. we find phase lags of between 0.03 and 0.2 radians in allthese sources, with a variation in frequency much less than expected for a lagconstant in time. we also measure a coherence consistent with unity in allsources. as already noted for the black hole candidates, these data areinconsistent with simple comptonization models invoking a constant time delay.comptonization in a non-uniform medium can perhaps explain the lags. however,the magnitudes of the lags imply that the hot electron gas extends to more than1000 schwarzschild radii. this may constitute an energy problem. we argue thatwhile a large hot cloud is possible for black holes which may hide some oftheir accretion energy in advection, such a distribution may not be possibleneutron stars where all the accretion energy is eventually released at theneutron star surface. this casts doubt on the comptonization model, though theenergy problem may be resolved for example by a wind from the inner disk.

astro-ph;9903360	xte j2123-058: a new neutron star x-ray transient	we report on optical and rxte observations of a new high-latitude burstingx-ray transient, xte j2123-058. we identified the optical counterpart, measuredthe 5.9573 hr orbital period and constrained the binary inclination and thesource distance. the distance lower limit indicates that the source is at least2.6 kpc from the galactic plane, which is unusual for an lmxb. rxteobservations were made between june and august 1998 during the first detectedoutburst from this source. we describe correlations between x-ray timing andspectral properties and discuss the possibility that the propeller mechanismturned on during the decay of the outburst. during one of the rxteobservations, we detect a pair of high frequency qpos at 847.1 +/- 5.5 hz and1102 +/- 13 hz simultaneously. according to the beat frequency model, the qposeparation implies a neutron star spin period near 3.9 ms. as the x-ray fluxdecreases at the end of the outburst, the amplitude of the optical modulationincreases significantly. this behavior can be explained if the size of theaccretion disk decreases during the decay of the outburst.

0810.5134	a major x-ray outburst from an ultraluminous x-ray source in m82	we detected a major x-ray outburst from m82 with a duration of 79 days, anaverage flux of 5e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 2-10 kev band, and strongvariability. the x-ray spectrum remained hard throughout the outburst. weobtained a chandra observation during the outburst that shows that the emissionarises from the ultraluminous x-ray source x41.4+60. this source has anunabsorbed flux of (5.4 +/- 0.2)e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.3-8 kev band,equivalent to an isotropic luminosity of 8.5e40 erg/s. the spectrum isadequately fitted with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.55 +/-0.05. this photon index is very similar to the value of 1.61 +/- 0.06 measuredpreviously while the flux was (2.64 +/- 0.14)e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1. thus, thesource appears to remain in the hard state even at the highest flux levelsobserved. the x-ray spectral and timing data available for x41.4+60 areconsistent with the source being in a luminous hard state and a black hole massin the range of one to a few thousand solar masses.

0812.2975	an xmm-newton spectral and timing study of igr j16207-5129: an obscured  and non-pulsating hmxb	we report on a 12 hr xmm-newton observation of the supergiant high-mass x-raybinary igr j16207-5129. this is only the second soft x-ray (0.4-15 kev, in thiscase) study of the source since it was discovered by the integral satellite.the average energy spectrum is very similar to those of neutron star hmxbs,being dominated by a highly absorbed power-law component with a photon index of1.15. the spectrum also exhibits a soft excess below 2 kev and an iron kalphaemission line at 6.39+/-0.03 kev. for the primary power-law component, thecolumn density is 1.19e23 cm^-2, indicating local absorption, likely from thestellar wind, and placing igr j16207-5129 in the category of obscured igrhmxbs. the source exhibits a very high level of variability with an rms noiselevel of 64%+/-21% in the 0.0001 to 0.05 hz frequency range. although theenergy spectrum suggests that the system may harbor a neutron star, nopulsations are detected with a 90% confidence upper limit of 2% in a frequencyrange from 0.0001 to 88 hz. we discuss similarities between igr j16207-5129 andother apparently non-pulsating hmxbs, including other igr hmxbs as well as 4u2206+54 (but see arxiv:0812.2365) and 4u 1700-377.
