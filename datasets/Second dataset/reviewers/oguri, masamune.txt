0901.4372	subaru weak lensing measurements of four strong lensing clusters: are  lensing clusters over-concentrated?	we derive radial mass profiles of four strong lensing selected clusters whichshow prominent giant arcs (abell 1703, sdss j1446+3032, sdss j1531+3414, andsdss j2111-0115), by combining detailed strong lens modeling with weak lensingshear measured from deep subaru suprime-cam images. weak lensing signals aredetected at high significance for all four clusters, whose redshifts range fromz=0.28 to 0.64. we demonstrate that adding strong lensing information withknown arc redshifts significantly improves constraints on the mass densityprofile, compared to those obtained from weak lensing alone. while the massprofiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in n-body simulationsof the lcdm model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrallyconcentrated (the concentration parameters c_vir \sim 8) than theoreticalpredictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrationsinherent in lensing selected samples. our results are consistent with previousstudies which similarly detected a concentration excess, and increases thetotal number of clusters studied with the combined strong and weak lensingtechnique to ten. combining our sample with previous work, we find thatclusters with larger einstein radii are more anomalously concentrated. we alsopresent a detailed model of the lensing cluster a1703 with constraints frommultiple image families, and find the dark matter inner density profile to becuspy with the slope consistent with -1, in agreement with expectations.

0906.4791	detailed cluster mass and light profiles of a1703, a370 and rxj1347-11  from deep subaru imaging	weak lensing work can be badly compromised by unlensed foreground and clustermembers which dilute the true lensing signal. we show how the lensing amplitudein multi-colour space can be harnessed to securely separate cluster membersfrom the foreground and background populations for three massive clusters,a1703 (z=0.258), a370 (z=0.375) and rxj1347-11 (z=0.451) imaged with subaru.the luminosity functions of these clusters when corrected for dilution, showsimilar faint-end slopes, \alpha ~= -1.0, with no marked faint-end upturn toour limit of m_r ~= -15.0, and only a mild radial gradient. in each case, theradial profile of the m/l ratio peaks at intermediate radius, ~=0.2r_{vir}, ata level of 300-500(m/l_r)_\odot, and then falls steadily towards~100(m/l_r)_{\odot} at the virial radius, similar to the mean field level. thisbehaviour is likely due to the relative paucity of central late-type galaxies,whereas for the e/s0-sequence only a mild radial decline in m/l is found foreach cluster. we discuss this behaviour in the context of detailed simulationswhere predictions for tidal stripping may now be tested accurately withobservations.

1001.2037	gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae in future wide-field  optical imaging surveys	cadenced optical imaging surveys in the next decade will be capable ofdetecting time-varying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in largenumbers, increasing the size of the statistically well-defined samples ofmultiply-imaged quasars by two orders of magnitude, and discovering the firststrongly-lensed supernovae. we carry out a detailed calculation of the likelyyields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lensand source properties and taking magnification bias and image configurationdetectability into account. we find that upcoming wide-field synoptic surveysshould detect several thousand lensed quasars. in particular, the lsst shouldfind 8000 lensed quasars, 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays,and also ~130 lensed supernovae, which is compared with ~15 lensed supernovaepredicted to be found by the jdem. we predict the quad fraction to be ~15% forthe lensed quasars and ~30% for the lensed supernovae. generating a mockcatalogue of around 1500 well-observed double-image lenses, we compute theavailable precision on the hubble constant and the dark energy equationparameters for the time delay distance experiment (assuming priors fromplanck): the predicted marginalised 68% confidence intervals are\sigma(w_0)=0.15, \sigma(w_a)=0.41, and \sigma(h)=0.017. while this isencouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50% larger thanthose predicted for a space-based type-ia supernova sample, we show how thedark energy figure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the the lensmass distribution.

1004.4214	direct measurement of dark matter halo ellipticity from two-dimensional  lensing shear maps of 25 massive clusters	we present new measurements of dark matter distributions in 25 x-ray luminousclusters by making a full use of the two-dimensional (2d) weak lensing signalsobtained from high-quality subaru/suprime-cam imaging data. our approach todirectly compare the measured lensing shear pattern with elliptical modelpredictions allows us to extract new information on the mass distributions ofindividual clusters, such as the halo ellipticity and mass centroid. we findthat these parameters on the cluster shape are little degenerate with clustermass and concentration parameters. by combining the 2d fitting results for asubsample of 18 clusters, the elliptical shape of dark matter haloes isdetected at 7\sigma significance level. the mean ellipticity is found to be e =0.46 \pm 0.04 (1\sigma), which is in excellent agreement with the standardcollisionless cdm model prediction. the mass centroid can be constrained with atypical accuracy of ~20" (~50 kpc/h) in radius for each cluster with somesignificant outliers, enabling to assess one of the most important systematicerrors inherent in the stacked cluster weak lensing technique, the masscentroid uncertainty. in addition, the shape of the dark mass distribution isfound to be only weakly correlated with that of the member galaxy distribution.we carefully examine possible sources of systematic errors in our measurements,finding none of them to be significant. our results demonstrate the power ofhigh-quality imaging data for exploring the detailed spatial distribution ofdark matter (abridged).

1005.3103	the mass distribution of sdss j1004+4112 revisited	we present a strong lens analysis of sdss j1004+4112, a unique quasar lensproduced by a massive cluster of galaxies at z=0.68, using a newly developedsoftware for gravitational lensing. we find that our parametric mass model wellreproduces all observations including the positions of quasar images as well asthose of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, timedelays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. thepredicted large total magnification of \mu ~ 70 suggests that the lens systemis indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar andits host galaxy. the dark halo component is found to be unimodal centered onthe brightest cluster galaxy and the chandra x-ray surface brightness profile.in addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent withthose of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implyingthat the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. the radial profile of thebest-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from thex-ray observation. while the inner radial slope of the dark halo component isconsistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted a-d time delay onthe slope indicates that an additional time delay measurement will improveconstraints on the mass model.

1010.0744	combining cluster observables and stacked weak lensing to probe dark  energy: self-calibration of systematic uncertainties	we develop a new method of combining cluster observables (number counts andcluster-cluster correlation functions) and stacked weak lensing signals ofbackground galaxy shapes, both of which are available in a wide-field opticalimaging survey. assuming that the clusters have secure redshift estimates, weshow that the joint experiment enables a self-calibration of importantsystematic errors including the source redshift uncertainty and the clustermass-observable relation, by adopting a single population of background sourcegalaxies for the lensing analysis. it allows us to use the relative strengthsof stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating thesource redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements ofthe mean cluster mass in each bin. in addition, our formulation of stackedlensing signals in fourier space simplifies the fisher matrix calculations, aswell as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the mostsignificant uncertainty in stacked lensing. we show that upcoming wide-fieldsurveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including darkenergy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that modelsystematic uncertainties. specifically, the stacked lensing informationimproves the dark energy fom by a factor of 4, compared to that from thecluster observables alone. the primordial non-gaussianity parameter can also beconstrained with a level of f_nl~10. in this method, the mean source redshiftis well calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1 in redshift, and the mean cluster massin each bin to 5-10% accuracies, which demonstrates the success of theself-calibration of systematic uncertainties from the joint experiment.(abridged)

1010.2714	gemini/gmos spectroscopy of 26 strong lensing selected galaxy cluster  cores	we present results from a spectroscopic program targeting 26 strong lensingcluster cores that were visually identified in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and the second red-sequence cluster survey (rcs-2). the 26 galaxycluster lenses span a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.65, and our spectroscopyreveals 69 unique background sources with redshifts as high as z=5.200. we alsoidentify redshifts for 262 cluster member galaxies and measure the velocitydispersions and dynamical masses for 18 clusters where we have redshifts for n\geq 10 cluster member galaxies. we include an accounting for the expectedbiases in dynamical masses of strong lensing selected clusters as predicted byresults from numerical simulations and discuss possible sources of bias in ourobservations. the median dynamical mass of the 18 clusters with n \geq 10spectroscopic cluster members is m_{vir} = 7.84 x 10^14 m_sun h_{0.7}^{-1},which is somewhat higher than predictions for strong lensing selected clustersin simulations. the disagreement is not significant considering the largeuncertainty in our dynamical data, systematic uncertainties in the velocitydispersion calibration, and limitations of the theoretical modeling.nevertheless our study represents an important first step toward characterizinglarge samples of clusters that are identified in a systematic way as systemsexhibiting dramatic strong lensing features.

1010.6060	the redshift distribution of giant arcs in the sloan giant arcs survey	we measure the redshift distribution of a sample of 28 giant arcs discoveredas a part of the sloan giant arcs survey (sgas). gemini/gmos-north spectroscopyprovides precise redshifts for 24 arcs, and "redshift desert" constraints forthe remaining four. this is a direct measurement of the redshift distributionof a uniformly selected sample of bright giant arcs, which is an observablethat can be used to inform efforts to predict giant arc statistics. our primarygiant arc sample has a median redshift z=1.821 and nearly two thirds of thearcs - 64% - are sources at z \gtrsim 1.4, indicating that the population ofbackground sources that are strongly lensed into bright giant arcs residesprimarily at high redshift. we also analyze the distribution of redshifts for19 secondary strongly lensed background sources that are not visually apparentin sdss imaging, but were identified in deeper follow-up imaging of the lensingcluster fields. our redshift sample for the secondary sources is notspectroscopically complete, but combining it with our primary giant arc samplesuggests that a large fraction of all background galaxies which are stronglylensed by foreground clusters reside at z \gtrsim 1.4. kolmogorov-smirnov (ks)tests indicate that our well-selected, spectroscopically complete primary giantarc redshift sample can be reproduced with a model distribution that isconstructed from a combination of results from studies of strong lensingclusters in numerical simulations, and observational constraints on the galaxyluminosity function.

1011.6341	sunyaev zel'dovich effect observations of strong lensing galaxy  clusters: probing the over-concentration problem	we have measured the sunyaev zel'dovich (sz) effect for a sample of tenstrong lensing selected galaxy clusters using the sunyaev zel'dovich array(sza). the sza is sensitive to structures on spatial scales of a fewarcminutes, while the strong lensing mass modeling constrains the mass at smallscales (typically &lt; 30"). combining the two provides information about theprojected concentrations of the strong lensing clusters. the einstein radii wemeasure are twice as large as expected given the masses inferred from szscaling relations. a monte carlo simulation indicates that a sample randomlydrawn from the expected distribution would have a larger median einstein radiusthan the observed clusters about 3% of the time. the implied overconcentrationhas been noted in previous studies with smaller samples of lensing clusters. itpersists for this sample, with the caveat that this could result from asystematic effect such as if the gas fractions of the strong lensing clustersare substantially below what is expected.

1101.0650	detailed cluster lensing profiles at large radii and the impact on  cluster weak lensing studies	using a large set of ray-tracing in n-body simulations, we examine lensingprofiles around massive dark haloes in detail, with a particular emphasis onthe profile at around the virial radii. we compare radial convergence profiles,which are measured accurately in the ray-tracing simulations by stacking manydark haloes, with our simple analytic model predictions. our analytic modelsconsist of a main halo, which is modelled by the navarro-frenk-white (nfw)density profile with three different forms of the truncation, plus thecorrelated matter (2-halo term) around the main halo. we find that the smoothlytruncated nfw profile best reproduces the simulated lensing profiles, out tomore than 10 times the virial radius. we then use this analytic model toinvestigate potential biases in cluster weak lensing studies in which a single,untruncated nfw component is usually assumed in interpreting observed signals.we find that cluster masses, inferred by fitting reduced tangential shearprofiles with the nfw profile, tend to be underestimated by ~5-10% if fittingis performed out to ~10'-30'. in contrast, the concentration parameter isoverestimated typically by ~20% for the same fitting range. we also investigatebiases in computing the signal-to-noise ratio of weak lensing mass peaks,finding them to be &lt;4% for significant mass peaks. in the appendices, weprovide useful formulae for the smoothly truncated nfw profile.

1105.2295	the universal einstein radius distribution from 10,000 sdss clusters	we present results from strong-lens modelling of 10,000 sdss clusters, toestablish the universal distribution of einstein radii. detailed lensinganalyses have shown that the inner mass distribution of clusters can beaccurately modelled by assuming light traces mass, successfully uncoveringlarge numbers of multiple-images. approximate critical curves and the effectiveeinstein radius of each cluster can therefore be readily calculated, from thedistribution of member galaxies and scaled by their luminosities. we use asubsample of 10 well-studied clusters covered by both sdss and hst to calibrateand test this method, and show that an accurate determination of the einsteinradius and mass can be achieved by this approach "blindly", in an automatedway, and without requiring multiple images as input. we present the results ofthe first 10,000 clusters analysed in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.55$, and compare themto theoretical expectations. we find that for this all-sky representativesample the einstein radius distribution is log-normal in shape, with $&lt;log(\theta_{e}\arcsec)&gt;=0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$,$\sigma=0.316^{+0.004}_{-0.002}$, and with higher abundance of large$\theta_{e}$ clusters than predicted by $\lambda$cdm. we visually inspect eachof the clusters with $\theta_{e}&gt;40 \arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) and find that$\sim20%$ are boosted by various projection effects detailed here, remainingwith $\sim40$ real giant-lens candidates, with a maximum of $\theta_{e}=69\pm12\arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) for the most massive candidate, in agreement withsemi-analytic calculations. the results of this work should be verified furtherwhen an extended calibration sample is available.

1109.2594	combined strong and weak lensing analysis of 28 clusters from the sloan  giant arcs survey	we study the mass distribution of a sample of 28 galaxy clusters using strongand weak lensing observations. the clusters are selected via their stronglensing properties as part of the sloan giant arcs survey (sgas) from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). mass modelling of the strong lensing informationfrom the giant arcs is combined with weak lensing measurements from deepsubaru/suprime-cam images to primarily obtain robust constraints on theconcentration parameter and the shape of the mass distribution. we find thatthe concentration c_vir is a steep function of the mass, c_vir \proptom_vir^-0.59\pm0.12, with the value roughly consistent with thelensing-bias-corrected theoretical expectation for high mass (10^15 h^-1 m_sun)clusters. however, the observationally inferred concentration parameters appearto be much higher at lower masses (10^14 h^-1 m_sun), possibly a consequence ofthe modification to the inner density profiles provided by baryon cooling. thesteep mass-concentration relation is also supported from direct stackinganalysis of the tangential shear profiles. in addition, we explore thetwo-dimensional shape of the projected mass distribution by stacking weaklensing shear maps of individual clusters with prior information on theposition angle from strong lens modelling, and find significant evidence for alarge mean ellipticity with the best-fit value of e = 0.47 \pm 0.06 for themass distribution of the stacked sample. we find that the luminous clustermember galaxy distribution traces the overall mass distribution very well,although the distribution of fainter cluster galaxies appears to be moreextended than the total mass.

1109.4325	new lensed quasars from the muscles survey	gravitational lens systems containing lensed quasars are important ascosmological probes, as diagnostics of structural properties of the lensinggalaxies and as tools to study the quasars themselves. the largest lensedquasar sample is the sdss quasar lens search, drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). we are attempting to extend this survey using observations oflens candidates selected from a combination of the quasar sample from the sdssand the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). this adds somewhat higherimage quality together with a wider range of wavelength for the selectionprocess. in previous pilot surveys we observed 5 objects, finding 2 lenses;here we present further observations of 20 objects in which we find 4 lenses,of which 2 are independently discovered in sqls (in preparation). followingearlier work on the combination of these two surveys, we have refined ourmethod and find that use of a colour-separation diagnostic, where we select forseparations between components which appear to decrease in wavelength, is anefficient method to find lensed quasars and may be useful in ongoing and futurelarge-scale strong lensing surveys with instruments such as pan-starrs andlsst. the new lenses have mostly high flux ratios, with faint secondariesburied in the lensing galaxy and typically 6-10 times less bright than theprimary. our survey brings the total number of lenses discovered in the sdssquasar sample to 46, plus 13 lenses already known. this is likely to be up to60-70% of the total number of lensed quasars; we briefly discuss strategies bywhich the rest might be found.

1202.1645	the chandra view of the largest quasar lens sdss j1029+2623	we present results from chandra observations of the cluster lens sdssj1029+2623 at z_l=0.58, which is a gravitationally lensed quasar with thelargest known image separation. we clearly detect x-ray emission both from thelensing cluster and the three lensed quasar images. the cluster has an x-raytemperature of kt = 8.1 (+2.0, -1.2) kev and bolometric luminosity of l_x =9.6e44 erg s^-1. its surface brightness is centered near one of the brightestcluster galaxies, and it is elongated east-west. we identify a subpeaknorth-west of the main peak, which is suggestive of an ongoing merger. even so,the x-ray mass inferred from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption appears tobe consistent with the lensing mass from the einstein radius of the system. wefind significant absorption in the soft x-ray spectrum of the faintest quasarimage, which can be caused by an intervening material at either the lens orsource redshift. the x-ray flux ratios between the quasar images (aftercorrecting for absorption) are in reasonable agreement with those at opticaland radio wavelengths, and all the flux ratios are inconsistent with thosepredicted by simple mass models. this implies that microlensing effect is notsignificant for this system and dark matter substructure is mainly responsiblefor the anomalous flux ratios.

1203.1088	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. vi. constraints on dark  energy and the evolution of massive galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the final lens sample from the sloandigital sky survey quasar lens search (sqls). the number distribution of acomplete subsample of 19 lensed quasars selected from 50,836 source quasars iscompared with theoretical expectations, with particular attention to theselection function. assuming that the velocity function of galaxies does notevolve with redshift, the sqls sample constrains the cosmological constant to\omega_\lambda=0.79^{+0.06}_{-0.07}(stat.)^{+0.06}_{-0.06}(syst.) for a flatuniverse. the dark energy equation of state is found to be consistent with w=-1when the sqls is combined with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) measurements or results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap). we also obtain simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters andredshift evolution of the galaxy velocity function, finding no evidence forredshift evolution at z&lt;1 in any combinations of constraints. for instance,number density evolution quantified as \nu_n=d\ln\phi_*/d\ln(1+z) and thevelocity dispersion evolution \nu_\sigma=d\ln\sigma_*/d\ln(1+z) are constrainedto \nu_n=1.06^{+1.36}_{-1.39}(stat.)^{+0.33}_{-0.64}(syst.) and\nu_\sigma=-0.05^{+0.19}_{-0.16}(stat.)^{+0.03}_{-0.03}(syst.) respectivelywhen the sqls result is combined with bao and wmap for flat models with acosmological constant. we find that a significant amount of dark energy ispreferred even after fully marginalizing over the galaxy evolution parameters.thus the statistics of lensed quasars robustly confirm the accelerated cosmicexpansion.

1204.6117	scatter and bias in weak lensing selected clusters	we examine scatter and bias in weak lensing selected clusters, employing bothan analytic model of dark matter haloes and numerical mock data of weak lensingcluster surveys. we pay special attention to effects of the diversity of darkmatter distributions within clusters. we find that peak heights of the lensingconvergence map correlates rather poorly with the virial mass of haloes. thecorrelation is tighter for the spherical overdensity mass with a higher meaninterior density. we examine the dependence of the halo shape on the peakheights, and find that the rms scatter caused by the halo diversity scaleslinearly with the peak heights with the proportionality factor of 0.1-0.2. thenoise originated from the halo shape is found to be comparable to the sourcegalaxy shape noise and the cosmic shear noise. we find the significant haloorientation bias, i.e., weak lensing selected clusters on average have theirmajor axes aligned with the line-of-sight direction. we compute the orientationbias using an analytic triaxial halo model and obtain results quite consistentwith the ray-tracing results. we develop a prescription to analytically computethe number count of weak lensing peaks taking into account all the main sourcesof scatters in peak heights. we find that the improved analytic predictionsagree well with the simulation results for high s/n peaks. we also compare theexpected number count with our weak lensing analysis results for 4 sq deg ofsubaru/suprime-cam observations and find a good agreement.

1206.2011	the quasar-galaxy cross sdss j1320+1644: a probable large-separation  lensed quasar	we report the discovery of a pair of quasars at $z=1.487$, with a separationof $8\farcs585\pm0\farcs002$. subaru telescope infrared imaging reveals thepresence of an elliptical and a disk-like galaxy located almost symmetricallybetween the quasars, creating a cross-like configuration. based on absorptionlines in the quasar spectra and the colors of the galaxies, we estimate thatboth galaxies are located at redshift $z=0.899$. this, as well as thesimilarity of the quasar spectra, suggests that the system is a single quasarmultiply imaged by a galaxy group or cluster acting as a gravitational lens,although the possibility of a binary quasar cannot be fully excluded. we showthat the gravitational lensing hypothesis implies these galaxies are notisolated, but must be embedded in a dark matter halo of virial mass $\sim 4\times 10^{14}\ h_{70}^{-1}\ {m}_\odot$ assuming an nfw model with aconcentration parameter of $c_{vir}=6$, or a singular isothermal sphere profilewith a velocity dispersion of $\sim 670$ km s$^{-1}$. we place constraints onthe location of the dark matter halo, as well as the velocity dispersions ofthe galaxies. in addition, we discuss the influence of differential reddening,microlensing and intrinsic variability on the quasar spectra and broadbandphotometry.

1207.5776	a two-year time delay for the lensed quasar sdss j1029+2623	we present 279 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 5.4 years from 2007january to 2012 june for the largest image separation (22.6 arcsec)gravitationally lensed quasar, sdss j1029+2623. we find that image a leads theimages b and c by dt_ab = (744+-10) days (90% confidence); the uncertaintyincludes both statistical uncertainties and systematic differences due to thechoice of models. with only a ~1% fractional error, the interpretation of thedelay is limited primarily by cosmic variance due to fluctuations in the meanline-of-sight density. we cannot separate the fainter image c from image b, butsince image c trails image b by only 2-3 days in all models, the estimate ofthe time delay between image a and b is little affected by combining the fluxesof images b and c. there is weak evidence for a low level of microlensing,perhaps created by the small galaxy responsible for the flux ratio anomaly inthis system. interpreting the delay depends on better constraining the shape ofthe gravitational potential using the lensed host galaxy, other lensed arcs andthe structure of the x-ray emission.

1208.1766	miscentring in galaxy clusters: dark matter to brightest cluster galaxy  offsets in 10,000 sdss clusters	we characterise the typical offset between the dark matter (dm) projectedcentre and the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in 10,000 sdss clusters. to placeconstraints on the centre of dm, we use an automated strong-lensing analysis,mass-modelling technique which is based on the well-tested assumption thatlight traces mass. the cluster galaxies are modelled with a steep power-law,and the dm component is obtained by smoothing the galaxy distribution fitting alow-order 2d polynomial (via spline interpolation), while probing a whole rangeof polynomial degrees and galaxy power laws. we find that the offsets betweenthe bcg and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the dm, \delta, aredistributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are welldescribed by a log-normal distribution with &lt;log_{10}(\delta [h^{-1}mpc])&gt;=-1.895^{+0.003}_{-0.004}, and \sigma=0.501\pm0.004 (95% confidencelevels), or &lt;log_{10}(\delta [\arcsec])&gt;=0.564\pm0.005, and\sigma=0.475\pm0.007. some of the offsets originate in prior misidentificationsof the bcg or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm,whose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that ~10% of theclusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributingto higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. our resultsconstitute the first statistically-significant high-resolution distributions ofdm-to-bcg offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly showthat there exists such a typical non-zero offset in the probed catalogue. theoffsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higherseparations are generally found for higher-z clusters in agreement with thehierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could help characterise themerger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters, in future studies.[abridged]

1208.2701	revising the halofit model for the nonlinear matter power spectrum	based on a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution $n$-body simulations, werevisit the so-called halofit model (smith et al. 2003) as an accurate fittingformula for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. while the halofit model hasbeen frequently used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinearmatter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, itsprecision has been limited by the low-resolution of $n$-body simulations usedto determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of improvedfitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. we runhigh-resolution $n$-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around thewilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) best-fit cosmological parameters(1, 3, 5, and 7 year results), including dark energy models with a constantequation of state. the simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fittingparameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra ofthe $n$-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. therevised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matterpower spectrum in a wide range of wavenumber ($k \leq 30h$\,mpc$^{-1}$) atredshifts $0 \leq z \leq 10$, with 5% precision for $k\leq1 h$ mpc$^{-1}$ at $0\leq z \leq 10$ and 10% for $1 \leq k\leq 10 h$ mpc$^{-1} $ at $0 \leq z \leq3$. we discuss the impact of the improved halofit model on weak lensing powerspectra and correlation functions, and show that the improved model betterreproduces ray-tracing simulation results.

1209.4643	subaru weak-lensing measurement of a z = 0.81 cluster discovered by the  atacama cosmology telescope survey	we present a subaru weak lensing measurement of act-cl j0022.2-0036, one ofthe most luminous, high-redshift (z=0.81) sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) clustersdiscovered in the 268 deg^2 equatorial region survey of the atacama cosmologytelescope. for the weak lensing analysis using i'-band images, we use amodel-fitting (gauss-laguerre shapelet) method to measure shapes of galaxyimages, where we fit galaxy images in different exposures simultaneously toobtain best-fit ellipticities taking into account the different psfs in eachexposure. we also take into account the astrometric distortion effect on galaxyimages by performing the model fitting in the world coordinate system. toselect background galaxies behind the cluster at z=0.81, we use photometricredshift (photo-z) estimates for every galaxy derived from the co-added imagesof multi-passband br'i'z'y, with psf matching/homogenization. after a photo-zcut for background galaxy selection, we detect the tangential weak lensingdistortion signal with a total signal-to-noise ratio of about 3.7. by fitting anavarro-frenk-white model to the measured shear profile, we find the clustermass to be m_200\bar{\rho}_m = [7.5^+3.2_-2.8(stat.)^+1.3_-0.6(sys.)] x 10^14m_\odot/h. the weak lensing-derived mass is consistent with previous massestimates based on the sz observation, with assumptions of hydrostaticequilibrium and virial theorem, as well as with scaling relations between szsignal and mass derived from weak lensing, x-ray, and velocity dispersion,within the measurement errors. we also show that the existence of act-clj0022.2-0036 at z=0.81 is consistent with the cluster abundance prediction ofthe \lambda-dominated cold dark matter structure formation model. we thusdemonstrate the capability of subaru-type ground-based images for studying weaklensing of high-redshift clusters.

1212.6689	spectroscopy along multiple, lensed sightlines through outflowing winds  in the quasar sdss j1029+2623	we study the origin of absorption features on the blue side of the c iv broademission line of the large-separation lensed quasar sdss j1029+2623 at z_em ~2.197. the quasar images, produced by a foreground cluster of galaxies, have amaximum separation angle of ~ 22".5. the large angular separation suggests thatthe sight-lines to the quasar central source can go through different regionsof outflowing winds from the accretion disk of the quasar, providing a uniqueopportunity to study the structure of outflows from the accretion disk, a keyingredient for the evolution of quasars as well as for galaxy formation andevolution. based on medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy of the twobrightest images conducted at the subaru telescope, we find that each image hasdifferent intrinsic levels of absorptions, which can be attributed either tovariability of absorption features over the time delay between the lensedimages, ~ 774 days, or to the fine structure of quasar outflows probed by themultiple sight-lines toward the quasar. while both these scenarios areconsistent with the current data, we argue that they can be distinguished withadditional spectroscopic monitoring observations.

1302.6015	baryon acoustic oscillations with the cross-correlation of spectroscopic  and photometric samples	the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) experiment requires a sufficientlydense sampling of large-scale structure tracers with spectroscopic redshift,which is observationally expensive especially at high redshifts $z\simgt 1$.here we present an alternative route of the bao analysis that uses thecross-correlation of sparse spectroscopic tracers with a much denserphotometric sample, where the spectroscopic tracers can be quasars or bright,rare galaxies that are easier to access spectroscopically. we show thatmeasurements of the cross-correlation as a function of the transverse comovingseparation rather than the angular separation avoid a smearing of the baofeature without mixing the different scales at different redshifts in theprojection, even for a wide redshift slice $\delta z\simeq 1$. the bias,scatter, and catastrophic redshift errors of the photometric sample affect onlythe overall normalization of the cross-correlation which can be marginalizedover when constraining the angular diameter distance. as a specific example, weforecast an expected accuracy of the bao geometrical test via thecross-correlation of the sdss and boss spectroscopic quasar sample with a densephotometric galaxy sample that is assumed to have a full overlap with thesdss/boss survey region. we show that this cross-correlation bao analysisallows us to measure the angular diameter distances to a fractional accuracy ofabout 10% at each redshift bin over $1\simlt z\simlt 3$, if the photometricredshift errors of the galaxies, $\sigma_z/(1+z)$, are better than 10-20%level.

1304.4656	reducing systematic error in cluster scale weak lensing	weak lensing provides an important route toward collecting samples ofclusters of galaxies selected by mass. subtle systematic errors in imagereduction can compromise the power of this technique. we use the b-mode signalto quantify this systematic error and to test methods for reducing this error.we show that two procedures are efficient in suppressing systematic error inthe b-mode: (1) refinement of the mosaic ccd warping procedure to conform toabsolute celestial coordinates and (2) truncation of the smoothing procedure ona scale of 10$^{\prime}$. application of these procedures reduces thesystematic error to 20% of its original amplitude. we provide an analyticexpression for the distribution of the highest peaks in noise maps that can beused to estimate the fraction of false peaks in the weak lensing $\kappa$-s/nmaps as a function of the detection threshold. based on this analysis we selecta threshold s/n = 4.56 for identifying an uncontaminated set of weak lensingpeaks in two test fields covering a total area of $\sim 3$deg$^2$. takentogether these fields contain seven peaks above the threshold. among these, sixare probable systems of galaxies and one is a superposition. we confirm thereliability of these peaks with dense redshift surveys, x-ray and imagingobservations. the systematic error reduction procedures we apply are generaland can be applied to future large-area weak lensing surveys. our high peakanalysis suggests that with a s/n threshold of 4.5, there should be only 2.7spurious weak lensing peaks even in an area of 1000 deg$^2$ where we expect$\sim$ 2000 peaks based on our subaru fields.

0801.3432	difference imaging of lensed quasar candidates in the sdss supernova  survey region	difference imaging provides a new way to discover gravitationally lensedquasars because few non-lensed sources will show spatially extended, timevariable flux. we test the method on lens candidates in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) supernova survey region from the sdss quasar lens search (sqls)and their surrounding fields. starting from 20768 sources, including 49 sdssquasars and 36 candidate lenses/lensed images, we find that 21 sourcesincluding 15 sdss qsos and 7 candidate lenses/lensed images are non-periodicvariable sources. we can measure the spatial structure of the variable flux for18 of these sources and identify only one as a non-point source. this sourcedoes not display the compelling spatial structure of the variable flux of knownlensed quasars, so we reject it as a lens candidate. none of the lenscandidates from the sqls survive our cuts. given our effective survey area oforder 0.71 square degrees, this indicates a false positive rate of order oneper square degree for themethod. the fraction of quasars not found to bevariable and the false positive rate should both fall if we analyze the full,later data releases for the sdss fields. while application of the method to thesdss is limited by the resolution, depth, and sampling of the survey, severalfuture surveys such as pan-starrs, lsst, and snap will avoid these limitations.

0705.0682	analytic models of plausible gravitational lens potentials	gravitational lenses on galaxy scales are plausibly modelled as havingellipsoidal symmetry and a universal dark matter density profile, with a sersicprofile to describe the distribution of baryonic matter. predicting all lensingeffects requires knowledge of the total lens potential: in this work we giveanalytic forms for that of the above hybrid model. emphasising that complexlens potentials can be constructed from simpler components in linearcombination, we provide a recipe for attaining elliptical symmetry in eitherprojected mass or lens potential. we also provide analytic formulae for thelens potentials of sersic profiles for integer and half-integer index. we thenpresent formulae describing the gravitational lensing effects due tosmoothly-truncated universal density profiles in cold dark matter model. forour isolated haloes the density profile falls off as radius to the minus fifthor seventh power beyond the tidal radius, functional forms that allow allorders of lens potential derivatives to be calculated analytically, whileensuring a non-divergent total mass. we show how the observables predicted bythis profile differ from that of the original infinite-mass nfw profile.expressions for the gravitational flexion are highlighted. we show howdecreasing the tidal radius allows stripped haloes to be modelled, providing aframework for a fuller investigation of dark matter substructure in galaxiesand clusters. finally we remark on the need for finite mass halo profiles whendoing cosmological ray-tracing simulations, and the need for readily-calculablehigher order derivatives of the lens potential when studying catastrophes instrong lenses.

(1998) with $j_\mathrm{d}\simm_\mathrm{d}$, where $j_\mathrm{d}$ and $m_\mathrm{d}$ are the fractions of theangular momentum and mass within halos confined in the disks. a comparison withvarious types of local galaxies indicates that our galaxies are most similar tocircumnuclear star-forming regions of barred galaxies in the sense that asizable amount of stars are forming in a very small area.

1504.06974	properties of weak lensing clusters detected on hyper suprime-cam 2.3  square degree field	we present properties of moderately massive clusters of galaxies detected bythe newly developed hyper suprime-cam on the subaru telescope using weakgravitational lensing. eight peaks exceeding a s/n ratio of 4.5 are identifiedon the convergence s/n map of a 2.3 square degree field observed during theearly commissioning phase of the camera. multi-color photometric data is usedto generate optically selected clusters using the camira algorithm. the opticalcluster positions were correlated with the peak positions from the convergencemap. all eight significant peaks have optical counterparts. the velocitydispersion of clusters are evaluated by adopting the singular isothemal sphere(sis) fit to the tangential shear profiles, yielding virial mass estimates,m500c, of the clusters which range from 2.7x10^13 to 4.4x10^14 solar mass. thenumber of peaks is considerably larger than the average number expected fromlambdacdm cosmology but this is not extremely unlikely if one takes the largesample variance in the small field into account. we could, however, safelyargue that the peak count strongly favours the recent planck result suggestinghigh sigma8$value of 0.83. the ratio of stellar mass to the dark matter halomass shows a clear decline as the halo mass increases. if the gas massfraction, fg, in halos is universal, as has been suggested in the literature,the observed baryon mass in stars and gas shows a possible deficit comparedwith the total baryon density estimated from the baryon oscillation peaks inanisotropy of the cosmic microwave background.

1511.00013	star formation in quasar hosts and the origin of radio emission in  radio-quiet quasars	radio emission from radio-quiet quasars may be due to star formation in thequasar host galaxy, to a jet launched by the supermassive black hole, or torelativistic particles accelerated in a wide-angle radiatively-driven outflow.in this paper we examine whether radio emission from radio-quiet quasars is abyproduct of star formation in their hosts. to this end we use infraredspectroscopy and photometry from spitzer and herschel to estimate or placeupper limits on star formation rates in hosts of ~300 obscured and unobscuredquasars at z&lt;1. we find that low-ionization forbidden emission lines such as[neii] and [neiii] are likely dominated by quasar ionization and do not providereliable star formation diagnostics in quasar hosts, while pah emissionfeatures may be suppressed due to the destruction of pah molecules by thequasar radiation field. while the bolometric luminosities of our sources aredominated by the quasars, the 160 micron fluxes are likely dominated by starformation, but they too should be used with caution. we estimate median starformation rates to be 6-29 msun/year, with obscured quasars at the high end ofthis range. this star formation rate is insufficient to explain the observedradio emission from quasars by an order of magnitude, with log(l_radio,observed/l_radio, sf)=0.6-1.3 depending on quasar type and star formationestimator. although radio-quiet quasars in our sample lie close to the 8-1000micron infrared / radio correlation characteristic of the star-forminggalaxies, both their infrared emission and their radio emission are dominatedby the quasar activity, not by the host galaxy.

0808.0192	what is the largest einstein radius in the universe?	the einstein radius plays a central role in lens studies as it characterisesthe strength of gravitational lensing. the distribution of einstein radii nearthe upper cutoff should probe the largest mass concentrations in the universe.adopting a triaxial halo model, we compute expected distributions of largeeinstein radii. to assess the cosmic variance, we generate a number of all-skymonte-carlo realisations. we find that the expected largest einstein radius inthe universe is sensitive to the cosmological model: for a source redshift z=1,they are 42^{+9}_{-7}, 35^{+8}_{-6}, and 54^{+12}_{-7} arcseconds, assumingbest-fit parameters of the wmap5, wmap3 and wmap1 data, respectively. thesevalues are broadly consistent with current observations given theirincompleteness. for the same source redshift, we expect in all-sky 35 (wmap5),15 (wmap3), and 150 (wmap1) clusters that have einstein radii larger than 20".whilst the values of the largest einstein radii are almost unaffected by theprimordial non-gaussianity currently of interest, the abundance of large lensclusters should probe non-gaussianity competitively with cmb, but only if othercosmological parameters are well-measured. we also find that these "superlens"clusters constitute a highly biased population. for instance, a substantialfraction of these superlens clusters have major axes preferentially alignedwith the line-of-sight. as a consequence, the projected mass distributions ofthe clusters are rounder by an ellipticity of 0.2 and have 40%-60% largerconcentrations compared with typical clusters with similar redshifts andmasses. we argue that the large concentration measured in a1689 is consistentwith our model prediction at the 1.2\sigma level.

astro-ph;0105248	probing the core structure of dark halos with tangential and radial arc  statistics	we study the arc statistics of gravitational lensing generated by dark matterhalos in order to probe their density profile. we characterize the halo profileby two parameters, the inner slope of the central cusp $\alpha$, and the medianamplitude of the concentration parameter, $c_{\rm norm}$, for a halo of mass$10^{14}h^{-1}m_\odot$ at $z=0$, and compute the numbers of tangential andradial arcs produced by gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters. we find thatthe number of arcs divided by the number of halos is a good statistic which issensitive to both $c_{\rm norm}$ and $\alpha$ with very weak dependence on thecosmological parameters. if the arc samples with well-defined selectioncriteria for the clusters become available, one can strongly constrain both$c_{\rm norm}$ and $\alpha$. while our tentative comparison with the existingobservational data indicates that the inner density profile of dark halos isindeed as steep as predicted by recent simulations ($\alpha \sim 1.5$), thehomogeneous samples of tangential and radial arcs are required for morequantitative discussions.

astro-ph;0112119	strong gravitational lensing time delay statistics and the density  profile of dark halos	the distribution of differential time delays \delta t between images producedby strong gravitational lensing contains information on the mass distributionsin the lensing objects as well as on cosmological parameters such as h_0. wederive an explicit expression for the conditional probability distributionfunction of time delays p(\delta t|\theta), given an image separation betweenmultiple images \theta, and related statistics. we consider lensing halosdescribed by the singular isothermal sphere (sis) approximation and by itsgeneralization as proposed by navarro, frenk, &amp; white (nfw) which has a densityprofile \rho \propto r^{-\alpha} in the innermost region. the time delaydistribution is very sensitive to these profiles; steeper inner slopes tend toproduce larger time delays. for example, if h_0=70 km/s/mpc, a\lambda-dominated cosmology and a source redshift z_s=1.27 are assumed, lenseswith \theta=5'' produce a time delay of \delta t[yr]=1.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9},0.39^{+0.37}_{-0.22}, 0.15^{+0.11}_{-0.09}, and 0.071^{+0.054}_{-0.038} (50%confidence interval), for sis, generalized nfw with \alpha=1.5, \alpha=1.0, and\alpha=0.5, respectively. at a fixed image separation, the time delay isdetermined by the difference in the lensing potential between the position ofthe two images, which typically occur at different impact parameters. althoughthe values of \delta t are proportional to the inverse of h_0, p(\deltat|\theta) is rather insensitive to all other cosmological model parameters,source redshifts, magnification biases and so on. a knowledge of p(\deltat|\theta) will also be useful in designing the observing program of futurelarge scale synoptic variability surveys and for evaluating possible selectionbiases operating against large splitting lens systems.

astro-ph;0203142	systematic effects on tangential and radial arc statistics: the finite  source size and ellipticities of the lens and source	it has been recognized that the arc statistics of gravitational lensing is auseful probe of the density profile of clusters of galaxies. we examine severalsystematic effects which are important in predicting the number of arcs, withparticular attention to the difference between tangential and radial arcs.first we derive an analytic expression of the cross section for radial arcstaking account of the source size and find that the moderate source sizeenhances the cross section for radial arcs while larger source size (\gtrsim1'' in our example) suppresses the number of radial arcs. on the other hand,tangential arcs are much less sensitive to the source size. next we numericallycalculate the cross section for arcs considering the lens and sourceellipticities. we find that the numbers of both tangential and radial arcs arehighly enhanced by both ellipticities, by one or two orders of magnitude. thenumber ratio of radial to tangential arcs is, however, not so affected if thethreshold axis ratio of arcs is large (\gtrsim 7). the number ratio thereforestill remains good statistics which probe the density profile of the lensobjects, if the source size effect is correctly taken into account.

astro-ph;0207520	constraints on the baryonic compression and implications for the  fraction of dark halo lenses	we predict the fraction of dark halo lenses, that is, the fraction of lenssystems produced by the gravitational potential of dark halos, on the basis ofa simple parametric model of baryonic compression. the fraction of dark halolenses primarily contains information on the effect of baryonic compression andthe density profile of dark halos, and is expected to be insensitive tocosmological parameters and source population. the model we adopt comprises thegalaxy formation probability p_g(m) which describes the global efficiency ofbaryonic compression and the ratio of circular velocities of galaxies to virialvelocities of dark halos gamma_v=v_c/v_{vir} which means how the innerstructure of dark halos is modified due to baryonic compression. the modelparameters are constrained from the velocity function of galaxies and thedistribution of image separations in gravitational lensing, although thedegeneracy between model parameters still remains. we show that the fraction ofdark halo lenses depends strongly on gamma_v and the density profile of darkhalos such as inner slope alpha. this means that the observation of thefraction of dark halos can break the degeneracy between model parameters if thedensity profile of dark halo lenses is fully settled. on the other hand, byrestricting gamma_v to physically plausible range we can predict the lowerlimit of the fraction of dark halo lenses on the basis of our model. our resultindicates that steeper inner cusps of dark halos (alpha &gt;~ 1.5) or toocentrally concentrated dark halos are inconsistent with the lack of dark halolenses in observations.

astro-ph;0210107	gravitational lensing magnification and time delay statistics for  distant supernovae	strong gravitational lensing of distant supernovae (sne), particularly typeia's, has some exploitable properties not available when other sorts ofcosmologically distant sources are lensed. one such property is that the``standard candle'' nature of the sn at peak brightness allows a directdetermination of the lensing magnification factor for each well observed image.another is that the duration of an sn event is of the same order as thedifferential time delays between the various lens images. the comparable timescales of the photometric event and the time delay invite a variety ofapplications, including high precision measurements of the delay and thetargeting of especially interesting phases of the explosion for intensiveobservation when they appear in trailing images. as an initial exploration ofthese possibilities we present calculations of sn lensing statistics in a``concordance cosmology''. we emphasize magnification and time delay effects.plausible sn surveys, such as the proposed snap space mission, would discoverseveral to some tens of strongly lensed sne ia per year, and at least a few ofthese will be at redshifts well beyond those that would be accessible viaunlensed events. the total number of such anomalously high redshift sne ia willbe a useful test of high redshift star formation models. sn surveys of finiteduration will, of course, miss the appearance of some images; we quantify thisselection bias. finally, we investigate how well the appearance of trailingimages can be predicted based on various amounts of available information onthe lensing event. knowledge of the magnification factor for the leading imagemakes it possible to predict the appearance of a trailing image relativelyaccurately if the lens redshift is also known.

astro-ph;0211196	how many arcminute-separation lenses are expected in the 2df qso survey?	wide separation lensing statistics offer information about the densityprofile and abundance of dark halos. recently a possible discovery of sixquasar pairs, which may be lensed multiple images, was reported by miller etal. (2003, astro-ph/0210644). these pairs are selected from a catalog of the2df quasar (qso) survey comprising 22163 quasars. we calculate expected numbersof lensed quasars taking account of the redshift and magnitude distributions ofthe quasar catalog. given some of the six pairs are genuine lensed systems, weput interesting constraints on the inner slope of dark halos, \omega_0, and\sigma_8. we show that the detection of even one lens with separation &gt;30'' ismarginally consistent with models that have cuspy inner density profile, \rho\propto r^{-1.5}, and very large \sigma_8, \sigma_8&gt;~1.2 for \omega_0=0.3. toreconcile with constraints from x-ray clusters or cosmic shear, much lower\omega_0 and much higher \sigma_8 are needed, although such high \sigma_8 seemstoo extreme. the shallower inner density profile \rho \propto r^{-1} is hardlyacceptable. in particular, the expected number of lenses with separation &gt;200''is too small to explain the discovery of such anomalously wide separation lenssystems. these results imply that we miss some important systematic effects,there is a problem in the cold dark matter scenario, or none of these sixquasar pairs is likely to be lensed images.

astro-ph;0306102	arc statistics in triaxial dark matter halos: testing the collisionless  cold dark matter paradigm	statistics of lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies serve as a powerful probeof both the non-sphericity and the inner slope of dark matter halos. we developa semi-analytic method to compute the number of arcs in triaxial dark matterhalos. this combines the lensing cross section from the monte carlo ray-tracingsimulations, and the probability distribution function (pdf) of the axis ratiosevaluated from cosmological n-body simulations. this approach enables one toincorporate both asymmetries in the projected mass density and elongationsalong the line-of-sight analytically, for the first time in cosmological lensedarc statistics. as expected, triaxial dark matter halos significantly increasethe number of arcs relative to spherical models; the difference amounts to morethan one order of magnitude while the value of enhancement depends on thespecific properties of density profiles. then we compare our theoreticalpredictions with the observed number of arcs from 38 x-ray selected clusters.in contrast to the previous claims, our triaxial dark matter halos with innerdensity profile \rho \propto r^{-1.5} in a lambda-dominated cold dark matter(cdm) universe reproduces well the observation. since both the central massconcentration and triaxial axis ratios (minor to major axis ratio ~0.5)required to account for the observed data are consistent with cosmologicaln-body simulations, our result may be interpreted to lend strong support forthe collisionless cdm paradigm at the mass scale of clusters.

astro-ph;0505452	can the steep mass profile of a1689 be explained by a triaxial dark  halo?	the steep mass profile of a1689 derived from recent detailed lensingobservations is not readily reconciled with the low concentration halospredicted by the standard cdm model. however, halo triaxiality may act to biasthe profile constraints derived assuming a spherically symmetric massdistribution, since lensing relates only to the projected mass distribution. adegree of halo triaxiality is inherent to the cdm structure formation, arisingfrom the collision-less nature of the dark matter. here we compare thecdm-based model predictions of triaxial halo with the precise lensingmeasurements of a1689 based on the acs/hst and subaru data, over a wide rangeof 10kpc&lt;r&lt;2mpc. the model lensing profiles cover the intrinsic spread of halomass and shape, and are projected over all inclinations when comparing with thedata. we show that the model parameters are only weakly constrained andstrongly degenerate mainly because of the lack of information along the line ofsight. in particular, the limits on the concentration parameter become lessrestrictive with increasing triaxiality. yet, by comparing the obtainedconstraints with expected probability distributions for the axis ratio andconcentration parameters computed from numerical simulations, we find that ~6%of cluster-size halos in the cdm model can match the a1689 lensing observationsat the 2-sigma level, corresponding to cases where the major-axis of the halois aligned with the line of sight. thus halo triaxiality could reduce theapparent discrepancy between theory and observation. this hypothesis needs tobe further explored by a statistical lensing study for other clusters as wellas by complementary three-dimensional information derived using x-ray,kinematics, and sz effect observations.

astro-ph;0506631	sdss j0246-0825: a new gravitationally lensed quasar from the sloan  digital sky survey	we report the discovery of a new two-image gravitationally lensed quasar,sdss j024634.11-082536.2 (sdss j0246-0825). this object was selected as alensed quasar candidate from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) by the samealgorithm that was used to discover other sdss lensed quasars (e.g., sdssj0924+0219). multicolor imaging with the magellan consortium's walter baade6.5-m telescope and the spectroscopic observations using the w. m. keckobservatory's keck ii telescope confirm that sdss j0246-0825 consists of twolensed images ($\delta{\theta}=$1\farcs04) of a source quasar at z=1.68.imaging observations with the keck telescope and the hubble space telescopereveal an extended object between the two quasar components, which is likely tobe a lensing galaxy of this system. from the absorption lines in the spectra ofquasar components and the apparent magnitude of the galaxy, combined with theexpected absolute magnitude from the faber-jackson relation, we estimate theredshift of the lensing galaxy to be z=0.724. a highly distorted ring isvisible in the hubble space telescope images, which is likely to be the lensedhost galaxy of the source quasar. simple mass modeling predicts the possibilitythat there is a small (faint) lensing object near the primary lensing galaxy.

astro-ph;0507360	discovery of multiply imaged galaxies behind the cluster and lensed  quasar sdss j1004+4112	we have identified three multiply imaged galaxies in hubble space telescopeimages of the redshift z=0.68 cluster responsible for the large-separationquadruply lensed quasar, sdss j1004+4112. spectroscopic redshifts have beensecured for two of these systems using the keck i 10m telescope. the mostdistant lensed galaxy, at z=3.332, forms at least four images, and an einsteinring encompassing 3.1 times more area than the einstein ring of the lensed qsoimages at z=1.74, due to the greater source distance. for a second multiplyimaged galaxy, we identify ly_alpha emission at a redshift of z=2.74. thecluster mass profile can be constrained from near the center of the brightestcluster galaxy, where we observe both a radial arc and the fifth image of thelensed quasar, to the einstein radius of the highest redshift galaxy, ~110 kpc.our preliminary modeling indicates that the mass approximates an ellipticalbody, with an average projected logarithmic gradient of ~-0.5. the system ispotentially useful for a direct measurement of world models in a previouslyuntested redshift range.

astro-ph;0508528	the image separation distribution of strong lenses: halo versus subhalo  populations	we present a halo model prediction of the image separation distribution ofstrong lenses. our model takes account of the subhalo population, which hasbeen ignored in previous studies, as well as the conventional halo population.halos and subhalos are linked to central and satellite galaxies by adopting anuniversal scaling relation between masses of (sub-)halos and luminosities ofgalaxies. our model predicts that 10%-20% of lenses should be caused by thesubhalo population. the fraction of lensing by satellite galaxies (subhalos)peaks at ~1'' and decreases rapidly with increasing image separations. wecompute fractions of lenses which lie in groups and clusters, and find them tobe ~14% and ~4%, respectively: nearly half of such lenses are expected to beproduced by satellite galaxies, rather than central parts of halos. we alsostudy mass distributions of lensing halos and find that even at imageseparations of ~3'' the deviation of lens mass distributions from isothermalprofiles is large: at or beyond ~3'' image separations are enhancedsignificantly by surrounding halos. our model prediction agrees reasonably wellwith observed image separation distributions from galaxy to cluster scales.

astro-ph;0601149	time delays for the giant quadruple lensed quasar sdss j1004+4112:  prospects for determining the density profile of the lensing cluster	we investigate the dependence of the time delays for the large-separationgravitationally lensed quasar sdss j1004+4112 on the inner mass profile of thelensing cluster. adopting the mass model whose innermost density profile isparameterized as \rho \propto r^{-\alpha}, we derive a series of mass modelswhich can fit observational data and then compute the probability distributionfunctions of time delays. we find that larger \alpha has longer time delays,longer tails at the higher end of the probability distribution, and largermodel uncertainties. the ratios of time delays slightly depend on the slope\alpha. among others, time delays between images c and a (or b) have littledependence on the inner slope, particularly when the time delays are short. thedependence of time delays on \alpha is well fitted by a linear form, whichreflects well-known degeneracy between the mass profile and time delays. weperform a monte-carlo simulation to illustrate how well the inner slope can beconstrained from measurements of time delays. we find that measurements of morethan one time delays result in reasonably tight constraints on the inner slope(\sigma_{\alpha} \lesssim 0.25), while only one time delay cannot determine theinner slope very well. our result indicates that time delays indeed serve as apowerful tool to determine the mass profile, despite the complexity of thelensing cluster.

astro-ph;0603742	quasars probing quasars i: optically thick absorbers near luminous  quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we search 149 moderate resolution background quasar spectra, from gemini, keck,the mmt, and the sdss to survey lyman limit systems (llss) and damped ly-alphasystems (dlas) in the vicinity of 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 4.0 luminous foreground quasars. asample of 27 new quasar-absorber pairs is uncovered with column densities, 17.2&lt; log (n_hi/cm^2) &lt; 20.9, and transverse (proper) distances of 22 kpc/h &lt; r &lt;1.7 mpc/h, from the foreground quasars. if they emit isotropically, the impliedionizing photon fluxes are a factor of ~ 5-8000 times larger than the ambientextragalactic uv background over this range of distances. the observedprobability of intercepting an absorber is very high for small separations: sixout of eight projected sightlines with transverse separations r &lt; 150 kpc/hhave an absorber coincident with the foreground quasar, of which four have logn_hi &gt; 10^19. the covering factor of log n_hi &gt; 10^19 absorbers is thus ~ 50 %(4/8) on these small scales, whereas &lt; 2% would have been expected at random.there are many cosmological applications of these new sightlines: they providelaboratories for studying fluorescent ly-alpha recombination radiation fromllss, constrain the environments, emission geometry, and radiative histories ofquasars, and shed light on the physical nature of llss and dlas.

astro-ph;0604476	gravitational lensing effects on the gamma-ray burst hubble diagram	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) offer a potential way to extend the hubble diagram tovery high redshifts and to constrain the nature of dark energy in a waycomplementary to distant type ia supernovae. however, gravitational lensingsystematically brightens distant grbs through the magnification bias, inaddition to increasing the dispersions of distance measurements. we investigatehow the magnification bias limits the cosmological usage of grbs. we performmonte-carlo simulations of swift grbs assuming a cosmological constantdominated universe and then constrain the dark energy equation of stateneglecting gravitational lens effects. the originally assumed model isrecovered with 68% confidence limit even when the dispersion of inferredluminosities is comparable to that of type ia supernovae. this implies that thebias is not so drastic for swift grbs as to change constraints on dark energyand its evolution. however, the precise degree of the bias in cosmologicalparameter determinations depends strongly on the shape of the luminosityfunction of grbs. therefore, an accurate determination of the shape of theluminosity function is required to remove the effect of gravitational lensingand to obtain an unbiased hubble diagram.

astro-ph;0605571	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. i. candidate selection  algorithm	we present an algorithm for selecting an uniform sample of gravitationallylensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2) quasars brighter thani=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the sdss. our algorithmuses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small-and large-separation lenses, respectively. our selection algorithm only relieson parameters that the sdss standard image processing pipeline generates,allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. the algorithm has beentested against simulated sdss images, which adopt distributions of field andquasar parameters taken from the real sdss data as input. furthermore, we takedifferential reddening into account. we find that our selection algorithm isalmost complete down to separations of 1'' and flux ratios of 10^-0.5. thealgorithm selects both double and quadruple lenses. at a separation of 2'',doubles and quads are selected with similar completeness, and above (below) 2''the selection of quads is better (worse) than for doubles. our morphologicalselection identifies a non-negligible fraction of single quasars: to removethese we fit images of candidates with a model of two point sources and rejectthose with unusually small image separations and/or large magnitude differencesbetween the two point sources. we estimate the efficiency of our selectionalgorithm to be at least 8% at image separations smaller than 2'', comparableto that of radio surveys. the efficiency declines as the image separationincreases, because of larger contamination from stars. we also present themagnification factor of lensed images as a function of the image separation,which is needed for accurate computation of magnification bias.

astro-ph;0605730	qso absorption lines from qsos	we present the results of a search for metal absorption lines in the spectraof background qsos whose sightlines pass close to foreground qsos. we detectmgii(2796,2803) absorption in sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectra of fourz&gt;1.5 qsos whose lines of sight pass within 26-98 kpc of lower redshift(z~0.5-1.5) qsos. the 100% [4/4 pairs] detection of mgii in the background qsosis clearly at odds with the incidence of associated (z_abs ~ z_em) systems --absorbers which exist towards only a few percent of qsos. although the qualityof our foreground qso spectra is not as high as the sdss data, absorption seentowards one of the background qsos clearly does not show up at the samestrength in the spectrum of the corresponding foreground qso. this implies thatthe absorbing gas is distributed inhomogeneously around the qso, presumably asa direct consequence of the anisotropic emission from the central agn. wediscuss possible origins for the mgii lines, including: absorption by gas fromthe foreground qso host galaxy; companion galaxies fuelling the qso throughgravitational interactions; and tidal debris left by galaxy mergers orinteractions which initiated the qso activity. no single explanation isentirely satisfactory, and we may well be seeing a mixture of phenomena.

astro-ph;0606006	arc sensitivity to cluster ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures	we investigate how ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures separatelyaffect the ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events, i.e.gravitational arcs, and how they influence the arc morphologies and fluxes.this is important for those studies aiming, for example, at constrainingcosmological parameters from statistical lensing, or at determining the innerstructure of galaxy clusters through gravitational arcs. we do so by creatingtwo-dimensional gradually smoothed, differently elliptical and asymmetricversions of some numerical models. on average, we find that the contributionsof ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures amount to ~40%, ~10% and ~30% ofthe total strong lensing cross section, respectively. however, our analysisshows that substructures play a more important role in less elliptical andasymmetric clusters, even if located at large distances from the clustercenters (~1mpc/h). conversely, their effect is less important in highlyasymmetric lenses. the morphology, position and flux of individual arcs arestrongly affected by the presence of substructures in the clusters. removingsubstructures on spatial scales &lt;~50kpc/h, roughly corresponding to mass scales&lt;~5 10^{10}m_\odot/h, alters the image multiplicity of ~35% of the sources usedin the simulations and causes position shifts larger than 5'' for ~40% of thearcs longer than 5''. we conclude that any model for cluster lens cannotneglect the effects of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures. on the otherhand, the high sensitivity of gravitational arcs to deviations from regular,smooth and symmetric mass distributions suggests that strong gravitationallensing is potentially a powerfull tool to measure the level of substructuresand asymmetries in clusters.

astro-ph;0609694	gravitational lens time delays: a statistical assessment of lens model  dependences and implications for the global hubble constant	time delays between lensed multiple images have been known to provide aninteresting probe of the hubble constant, but such application is often limitedby degeneracies with the shape of lens potentials. we propose a new statisticalapproach to examine the dependence of time delays on the complexity of lenspotentials, such as higher-order perturbations, non-isothermality, andsubstructures. specifically, we introduce a reduced time delay and explore itsbehavior as a function of the image configuration that is characterized by theasymmetry and opening angle of the image pair. in particular we derive arealistic conditional probability distribution. we find that the probabilitydistribution is sensitive to the image configuration such that more asymmetricand/or smaller opening angle image pairs are more easily affected byperturbations on the primary lens potential. on average time delays of doublelenses are less scattered than those of quadruple lenses. furthermore, therealistic conditional distribution allows a new statistical method to constrainthe hubble constant. we find that 16 published time delay quasars constrain thehubble constant to be h_0=70+/-6 km/s/mpc, where the value and its error areestimated using jackknife resampling. after including rough estimates of thesizes of important systematic errors, we find h_0=68+/-6(stat.)+/-8(syst.)km/s/mpc. the reasonable agreement with other estimates indicates theusefulness of our new approach as a cosmological and astrophysical probe,particularly in the era of large-scale synoptic surveys.

astro-ph;0702214	clustering of high redshift ($z\ge 2.9$) quasars from the sloan digital  sky survey	(abridged) we study the two-point correlation function of a uniformlyselected sample of 4,426 luminous optical quasars with redshift $2.9 \le z\le5.4$ selected over 4041 deg$^2$ from the fifth data release of the sloandigital sky survey. for a real-space correlation function of the form$\xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, the fitted parameters in comoving coordinates are$r_0 = 15.2 \pm 2.7 h^{-1}$ mpc and $\gamma = 2.0 \pm 0.3$, over a scale range$4\le r_p\le 150 h^{-1}$ mpc. thus high-redshift quasars are appreciably morestrongly clustered than their $z \approx 1.5$ counterparts, which have acomoving clustering length $r_0 \approx 6.5 h^{-1}$ mpc. dividing our sampleinto two redshift bins: $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $z\ge 3.5$, and assuming apower-law index $\gamma=2.0$, we find a correlation length of $r_0 = 16.9 \pm1.7 h^{-1}$ mpc for the former, and $r_0 = 24.3 \pm 2.4 h^{-1}$ mpc for thelatter. following martini &amp; weinberg, we relate the clustering strength andquasar number density to the quasar lifetimes and duty cycle. using the sheth &amp;tormen halo mass function, the quasar lifetime is estimated to lie in the range$4\sim 50$ myr for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$; and $30\sim 600$ myr forquasars with $z\ge 3.5$. the corresponding duty cycles are $0.004\sim 0.05$ forthe lower redshift bin and $0.03\sim 0.6$ for the higher redshift bin. theminimum mass of halos in which these quasars reside is $2-3\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $4-6\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $z\ge 3.5$.
