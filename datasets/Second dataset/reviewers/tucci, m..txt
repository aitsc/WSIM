1002.4029	cmb polarization as a probe of the anomalous nature of the cold spot	one of the most interesting explanations for the non-gaussian cold spot (cs)detected in the wmap data by vielva et al. 2004, is that it arises from theinteraction of the cmb radiation with a cosmic texture (cruz et al. 2007b). inthis case, a lack of polarization is expected in the region of the spot, ascompared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a girf. inaddition, other physical processes related to a non-linear evolution of thegravitational field could lead to a similar scenario. however, some of thesealternative scenarios (e.g., a large void in the large scale structure) havebeen shown to be very unlikely. in this work we characterise the polarizationproperties of the cold spot under both hypotheses: a large gaussian spot and ananomalous feature generated, for instance, by a cosmic texture. we propose amethodology to distinguish between them, and we discuss its discriminationpower as a function of the instrumental noise level. in particular, we addressthe cases of current experiments, like wmap and planck, and others indevelopment as quijote. we find that for an ideal experiment the gaussianhypothesis could be rejected at a significance level better than 0.8%. whilewmap is far from providing useful information in this respect, we find thatplanck will be able to reach a significance of around 7%; in addition, we showthat the ground-based experiment quijote could provide a significance of around1%. if these results are combined with the significance level found for the csin temperature, the capability of quijote and planck to reject the alternativehypothesis becomes 0.025% and 0.124%, respectively.

1103.5707	high--frequency predictions for number counts and spectral properties of  extragalactic radio sources. new evidences of a break at mm wavelengths in  spectra of bright blazar sources	we present models to predict high frequency counts of extragalactic radiosources using physically grounded recipes to describe the complex spectralbehaviour of blazars, that dominate the mm-wave counts at bright fluxdensities. we show that simple power-law spectra are ruled out byhigh-frequency (nu&gt;100 ghz) data. these data also strongly constrain modelsfeaturing the spectral breaks predicted by classical physical models for thesynchrotron emission produced in jets of blazars (blandford &amp; konigl 1979;konigl 1981). a model dealing with blazars as a single population is, at best,only marginally consistent with data coming from current surveys at high radiofrequencies. our most successful model assumes different distributions of breakfrequencies, nu_m, for bl lacs and flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs). theformer objects have substantially higher values of nu_m, implying that thesynchrotron emission comes from more compact regions; therefore, a substantialincrease of the bl lac fraction at high radio frequencies and at bright fluxdensities is predicted. remarkably, our best model is able to give a very goodfit to all the observed data on number counts and on distributions of spectralindices of extragalactic radio sources at frequencies above 5 and up to 220ghz. predictions for the forthcoming sub-mm blazar counts from planck, at thehighest hfi frequencies, and from herschel surveys are also presented.

1204.0427	the impact of polarized extragalactic radio sources on the detection of  cmb anisotropies in polarization	recent polarimetric surveys of extragalactic radio sources (ers) atfrequencies \nu&gt;1ghz are reviewed. by exploiting all the most relevant data onthe polarized emission of ers we study the frequency dependence of polarizationproperties of ers between 1.4 and 86ghz. for flat-spectrum sources the median(mean) fractional polarization increases from 1.5% (2-2.5%) at 1.4ghz to 2.5-3%(3-3.5%) at \nu&gt;10ghz. steep-spectrum sources are typically more polarized,especially at high frequencies where faraday depolarization is less relevant.as a general result, we do not find that the fractional polarization of ersdepends on the total flux density at high radio frequencies, i.e &gt;20ghz.moreover, in this frequency range, current data suggest a moderate increase ofthe fractional polarization of ers with frequency. a formalism to estimate ersnumber counts in polarization and the contribution of unresolved polarized ersto angular power spectra at cosmic microwave background (cmb) frequencies isalso developed and discussed. as a first application, we present originalpredictions for the planck satellite mission. our current results show thatonly a dozen polarized ers will be detected by the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi), and a few tens by the high frequency instrument (hfi). as forcmb power spectra, ers should not be a strong contaminant to the cmb e-modepolarization at frequencies \nu&gt;70ghz. on the contrary, they can become arelevant constraint for the detection of the cosmological b--mode polarizationif the tensor-to-scalar ratio is &lt;0.01.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1301.1544	forecasts on the contamination induced by unresolved point sources in  primordial non-gaussianity beyond planck	in this paper we present forecasts of the contamination on different shapesof the primordial non-gaussianity fnl parameter -- detectable on future cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) high--resolution anisotropy maps -- produced byunresolved extragalactic point sources at frequencies of cosmological interest(45--375 ghz). we consider two scenarios: an ideal (noiseless) mission and apossible future space-borne satellite, with instrumental characteristicssimilar to the ones proposed for the cosmic origins explorer (core). the local,equilateral, orthogonal and flat shapes are considered in both temperature(intensity) and polarized emission data. the angular power spectrum andbispectrum of extragalactic point sources are estimated by state-of-the-artmodels of source number counts. the impact of all the most relevant (far--irand radio selected) source populations on these shapes at core frequencies isstudied. the results of this analysis show that unresolved extragalactic pointsources should not induce a very relevant non-gaussian signal in the frequencyrange 100--200 ghz, thus not preventing a correct estimate of the cmbprimordial fnl parameter. polarization information allows one to significantlyreduce the error--bars in the fnl parameter and the bias induced by unresolvedsources and, hence, to widen the range of frequencies for fnl studies. on thecontrary, at nu &lt; 100 ghz or nu &gt; 225 ghz, important non-gaussian deviations incmb anisotropy maps are expected due to unresolved extragalactic sources.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5063	planck 2013 results. ii. low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the data processing pipeline of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi) data processing centre (dpc) to create and characterizefull-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44 and 70ghz. in particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,starting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. data are continuouslycalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. skysignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based onsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. noise propertiesare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. a destriping code(madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information intosky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. noise covariancematrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on lfi and planckproducts, are also produced. main beams are estimated down to the -20 db levelusing jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration ofthe focal plane.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

(i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma.

(iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1303.5090	planck intermediate results. xiii. constraints on peculiar velocities	using \planck\ data combined with the meta catalogue of x-ray detectedclusters of galaxies (mcxc), we address the study of peculiar motions bysearching for evidence of the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz). byimplementing various filters designed to extract the ksz generated at thepositions of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radialpeculiar velocity average, root mean square (rms), and local bulk flowamplitude at different depths. for the whole cluster sample of average redshift0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the ksz monopole,amounts to $72 \pm 60$ km s$^{-1}$. this constitutes less than 1% of therelative hubble velocity of the cluster sample with respect to our local cmbframe. while the linear $\lambda$cdm prediction for the typical cluster radialvelocity rms at $z=0.15$ is close to 230km s$^{-1}$, the upper limit imposed by\planck\ data on the cluster subsample corresponds to 800 km s$^{-1}$ at 95%confidence level, i.e., about three times higher. \planck\ data also set strongconstraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on the local group. thereis no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending tothe maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. a blind search for bulkflows in this sample has an upper limit of 254 km s$^{-1}$ (95% confidencelevel) dominated by cmb confusion and instrumental noise, indicating that theuniverse is largely homogeneous on gpc scales. in this context, in conjunctionwith supernova observations, \planck\ is able to rule out a large class ofinhomogeneous void models as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity.the \planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities and bulk flows are thusconsistent with the $\lambda$cdm scenario.

1305.5527	using cmb polarization to constrain the anomalous nature of the cold  spot with an incomplete sky-coverage	recent results of the esa planck satellite have confirmed the existence ofsome anomalies in the statistical distribution of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropies. one of the most intriguing anomalies is the coldspot, firstly detected in the wmap data by vielva et al. (2004). in a laterpaper, vielva et al. (2011) developed a method to probe the anomalous nature ofthe cold spot by using the cross-correlation of temperature and polarization ofthe cmb fluctuations. whereas this work was built under the assumption ofanalysing full-sky data, in the present paper we extend such approach to dealwith realistic data sets with a partial sky-coverage. in particular, we exploitthe radial and tangential polarization patterns around temperature spots. weexplore the capacity of the method to distinguish between a standard gaussiancmb scenario and an alternative one, in which the cold spot arises from aphysical process that does not present correlated polarization features (e.g.,topological defects), as a function of the instrumental-noise level. moreover,we consider more in detail the case of an ideal noise-free experiment and thoseones with the expected instrumental-noise levels in quijote and planckexperiments. we also present an application to the 9-year wmap data, withoutbeing able to obtain firm conclusions, with a significance level of 32%. in theideal case, the alternative scenario could be rejected at a significance levelof around 1%, whereas for expected noise levels of quijote and planckexperiments the corresponding significance levels are 1.5% and 7.4%,respectively.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

0802.4397	multi-frequency spectral analysis of extragalactic radio sources in the  33-ghz vsa catalogue: sources with flattening and upturn spectrum	we present an analysis of the spectral properties of the extragalactic radiosources in the nearly-complete vsa sample at 33ghz. data from different surveysare used to study source spectra between 1.4 and 33ghz. we find that, ingeneral, spectra can not be well described by a single power law in the rangeof frequencies considered. in particular, most of the vsa sources that aresteep between 1.4 and 5ghz, show a spectral flattening at \nu&gt;5ghz. we identify20 objects (19% of the sample) clearly characterized by an upturn spectrum,i.e., a spectrum falling at low frequencies (\nu&lt;5ghz) and inverted at higherfrequencies. spectra with high-frequency flattening or upturn shape aresupposed to occur when the emission from the agn compact core begins todominate over the component from extended lobes. this picture fits well withthe agn unified scheme, for objects observed at intermediate viewing angles ofthe agn jet. finally, we discuss implications that this class of sources canhave on future cmb observations at high resolution.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1405.7029	the cib-lensing bispectrum: impact on primordial non-gaussianity and  detectability for the planck mission	we characterize the cosmic infrared background (cib)-lensing bispectrum whichis one of the contributions to the three-point functions of cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) maps in harmonic space. we show that the cib-lensingbispectrum has a considerable strength and that it can be detected with highsignificance in the planck high-frequency maps. we also present forecasts ofthe contamination on different shapes of the primordial non-gaussianity$f_{nl}$ parameter produced by the cib-lensing bispectrum and by theextragalactic point sources bispectrum in the planck high-resolution cmbanisotropy maps. the local, equilateral and orthogonal shapes are consideredfor 'raw' single-frequency (i.e., without applying any component separationtechnique) and foreground-reduced planck temperature maps. the cib-lensingcorrelation seems to mainly affect orthogonal shapes of the bispectrum - with{\delta}$f_{nl}$ = -21 and -88 for the 143 and 217 ghz bands respectively -while point sources mostly impact equilateral shapes, with {\delta}$f_{nl}$ =160, 54 and 60 at 100, 143 and 217 ghz. however, the results indicate thatthese contaminants do not induce any relevant bias on planck $f_{nl}$ estimateswhen foreground-reduced maps are considered: using sevem for the componentseparation we obtain {\delta}$f_{nl}$ = 10.5 due to the cib-lensing and{\delta}$f_{nl}$ = 30.4 due to point sources, corresponding to 0.30{\sigma} and0.45{\sigma} in terms of the planck 2013 $f_{nl}$ uncertainty. the componentseparation technique is, in fact, able to partially clean the extragalacticsource contamination and the bias is reduced for all the shapes. we havefurther developed single- and multiple-frequency estimators based on thekomatsu, spergel &amp; wandelt (2005) formalism that can be implemented toefficiently detect this signal.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

1406.7482	planck intermediate results. xxiv. constraints on variation of  fundamental constants	any variation of the fundamental physical constants, and more particularly ofthe fine structure constant, $\alpha$, or of the mass of the electron, $m_e$,would affect the recombination history of the universe and cause an imprint onthe cosmic microwave background angular power spectra. we show that the planckdata allow one to improve the constraint on the time variation of the finestructure constant at redshift $z\sim 10^3$ by about a factor of 5 compared towmap data, as well as to break the degeneracy with the hubble constant, $h_0$.in addition to $\alpha$, we can set a constraint on the variation of the massof the electron, $m_{\rm e}$, and on the simultaneous variation of the twoconstants. we examine in detail the degeneracies between fundamental constantsand the cosmological parameters, in order to compare the limits obtained fromplanck and wmap and to determine the constraining power gained by includingother cosmological probes. we conclude that independent time variations of thefine structure constant and of the mass of the electron are constrained byplanck to ${\delta\alpha}/{\alpha}= (3.6\pm 3.7)\times10^{-3}$ and ${\deltam_{\rm e}}/{m_{\rm e}}= (4 \pm 11)\times10^{-3}$ at the 68% confidence level.we also investigate the possibility of a spatial variation of the finestructure constant. the relative amplitude of a dipolar spatial variation of$\alpha$ (corresponding to a gradient across our hubble volume) is constrainedto be $\delta\alpha/\alpha=(-2.4\pm 3.7)\times 10^{-2}$.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1501.02170	extragalactic sources in cosmic microwave background maps	we discuss the potential of a next generation space-borne cmb experiment forstudies of extragalactic sources with reference to core+, a project submittedto esa in response to the m4 call. we consider three possible options for thetelescope size: 1m, 1.5m and 2m (although the last option is probablyimpractical, given the m4 boundary conditions). the proposed instrument will befar more sensitive than planck and will have a diffraction-limited angularresolution. these properties imply that even the 1m telescope option willperform substantially better than planck for studies of extragalactic sources.the source detection limits as a function of frequency have been estimated bymeans of realistic simulations. the most significant improvements over planckresults are presented for each option. core+ will provide much larger samplesof truly local star-forming galaxies, making possible analyses of theproperties of galaxies (luminosity functions, dust mass functions, starformation rate functions, dust temperature distributions, etc.) across thehubble sequence. even more interestingly, core+ will detect, at |b|&gt; 30 deg,thousands of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies. such large samples areof extraordinary astrophysical and cosmological value in many fields. moreover,core+ high frequency maps will be optimally suited to pick up proto-clusters ofdusty galaxies, i.e. to investigate the evolution of large scale structure atlarger redshifts than can be reached by other means. thanks to its highsensitivity core+ will also yield a spectacular advance in the blind detectionof extragalactic sources in polarization. this will open a new window forstudies of radio source polarization and of the global properties of magneticfields in star forming galaxies and of their relationships with sfrs.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.01599	planck 2015 results. xxviii. the planck catalogue of galactic cold  clumps	we present the planck catalogue of galactic cold clumps (pgcc), an all-skycatalogue of galactic cold clump candidates detected by planck. this catalogueis the full version of the early cold core (ecc) catalogue, which was madeavailable in 2011 with the early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) andcontained 915 high s/n sources. it is based on the planck 48 months missiondata that are currently being released to the astronomical community. the pgcccatalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of galactic coldsources. the three highest planck bands (857, 545, 353 ghz) have been combinedwith iras data at 3 thz to perform a multi-frequency detection of sourcescolder than their local environment. after rejection of possible extragalacticcontaminants, the pgcc catalogue contains 13188 galactic sources spread acrossthe whole sky, i.e., from the galactic plane to high latitudes, following thespatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. the mediantemperature of pgcc sources lies between 13 and 14.5 k, depending on thequality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8to 20 k after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. usingseven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as theirmass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. the pgcc sources are locatedmainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards thegalactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.because of this diversity and because the pgcc catalogue contains sources invery different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate theevolution from molecular clouds to cores. finally, the catalogue also includes54 additional sources located in the smc and lmc.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

1504.03339	planck intermediate results. xxxvii. evidence of unbound gas from the  kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect	by looking at the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz) in planck nominalmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating inlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (cgs) at redshift $z\approx0.1$. we estimate the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations atthe positions of the cgc (central galaxy catalogue) samples extracted fromsloan digital sky survey (dr7) data. for the foreground-cleaned maps, we find$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the ksz signal, which are consistent with theksz evidence found in individual planck raw frequency maps, although lower thanfound in the wmap-9yr w band ($3.3\sigma$). we further reconstruct the peculiarvelocity field from the cg density field, and compute for the first time thecross-correlation function between ksz temperature fluctuations and estimatesof cg radial peculiar velocities. this correlation function yields a$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on mpcscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ mpc. both thepairwise momentum estimates and ksz temperature-velocity field correlation findevidence for ksz signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,corresponding to a physical radius of $&gt; 1$ mpc, more than twice the meanvirial radius of halos. this is consistent with the predictions from hydrosimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. we fit asimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation isproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon n-bodysimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective"optical depth to thomson scattering. we find $\tau_t=(1.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of thegas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to x-ray or thermalsz observations.

1505.08022	planck 2015 results. v. lfi calibration	we present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the planck lowfrequency instrument (lfi) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for theplanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. asin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronousmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use theorbital component, rather than adopting the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) solar dipole. this allows our 2015 lfi analysis to provide anindependent solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that ofhfi and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the wmap value. this 0.3% shiftin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from wmap and a global overhaul of theiterative calibration code increases the overall level of the lfi maps by 0.45%(30 ghz), 0.64% (44 ghz), and 0.82% (70 ghz) in temperature with respect to the2013 planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrummeasured by wmap. we estimate that the lfi calibration uncertainty is now atthe level of 0.20% for the 70 ghz map, 0.26% for the 44 ghz map, and 0.35% forthe 30 ghz map. we provide a detailed description of the impact of all thechanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.

1508.03375	planck 2013 results. xxxi. consistency of the planck data	the planck design and scanning strategy provide many levels of redundancythat can be exploited to provide tests of internal consistency. one of the mostimportant is the comparison of the 70ghz and 100ghz channels. based ondifferent instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focalplane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, andnear the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effecttwo different experiments. the 143ghz channel has the lowest noise level onplanck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. in thispaper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 planck data. weconcentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143ghz channel maps and powerspectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acousticpeaks, on maps masked for diffuse galactic emission and for strong unresolvedsources. difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin areconsistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave backgroundstructure. including small but important corrections for unresolved-sourceresiduals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100ghz power spectraaveraged over 70&lt;l&lt;390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100ghzpower spectra of 0.4% over the same l range. these values are within andconsistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the planck2013 results. we also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysisshowing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100/143/217ghz power spectra. weanalyse calibration procedures and beams to determine what fraction of thesedifferences can be accounted for by known approximations or systematic errorsthat could be controlled even better in the future, reducing uncertaintiesstill further. several possible small improvements are described...(abridged)

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

1511.05156	planck intermediate results. xl. the sunyaev-zeldovich signal from the  virgo cluster	the virgo cluster is the largest sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) source in the sky,both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. planck's wide angularscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow adetailed study of this large object through the sz effect. virgo is wellresolved by planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well withthe morphology observed from x-rays, but extends beyond the observed x-raysignal. we find a good agreement between the sz signal (or compton paranmeter,y_c) observed by planck and the expected signal inferred from x-rayobservations and simple analytical models. due to its proximity to us, the gasbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity byintegrating the sz signal over tens of square degrees. we study the signal inthe outskirts of virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrainedsimulation of the environment of virgo. planck data suggest that significantamounts of low-density plasma surround virgo out to twice the virial radius. wefind the sz signal in the outskirts of virgo to be consistent with a simplemodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assumingthat the temperature stays in the kev range beyond the virial radius. theobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallowpressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. this reservoir of gas atlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hotintergalactic medium. taking the lack of symmetry of virgo into account, wefind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of sz and x-ray data,in agreement with predictions.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

astro-ph;0202389	the power-law behaviours of angular spectra of polarized galactic  synchrotron	we study the angular power spectra of polarized galactic synchrotron in therange 10&lt;l&lt;800, at several frequencies between 0.4 and 2.7 ghz and at severalgalactic latitudes up to near the north galactic pole. electric- andmagnetic-parity polarization spectra are found to have slopes around alpha_{e,b} = 1.4 - 1.5 in the parkes and effelsberg galactic-plane surveys, butstrong local fluctuations of alpha_{e,b} are found at | b | ~ 10 degree fromthe 1.4 ghz effelsberg survey. the c_{pil} spectrum, which is insensitive tothe polarization direction, is somewhat steeper, being alpha_{pi} = 1.6 - 1.8for the same surveys. the low-resolution multifrequency survey of brouw andspoelstra (1976) shows some flattening of the spectra below 1 ghz, more intensefor c_{e,bl} than for c_{pil}. in no case we find evidence for really steepspectra. the extrapolation to the cosmological window shows that at 90 ghz thedetection of e-mode harmonics in the cosmic background radiation should not bedisturbed by synchrotron, even around l~10 for a reionization optical depth tau_{ri}&gt;~0.05.

astro-ph;0301020	the bar-sport experiment	bar-sport (balloon-borne radiometers for sky polarisation observations) is anexperiment to measure the linearly polarized emission of sky patches at 32 and90 ghz with sub-degree angular resolution. it is equipped with high sensitivitycorrelation polarimeters for simultaneous detection of both the u and q stokesparameters of the incident radiation. on-axis telescope is used to observeangular scales where the expected polarization of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmbp) peaks. this project shares most of the know-how andsophisticated technology developed for the sport experiment onboard theinternational space station. the payload is designed to flight onboard longduration stratospheric balloons both in the northern and southern hemisphereswhere low foreground emission sky patches are accessible. due to the weaknessof the expected cmbp signal (in the range of microk), much care has been spentto optimize the instrument design with respect to the systematics generation,observing time efficiency and long term stability. in this contribution wepresent the instrument design, and first tests on some components of the 32 ghzradiometer.

astro-ph;0307073	predictions on high frequency polarization properties of extragalactic  radio sources and implications for cmb polarization measurements	we present a method to simulate the polarization properties of extragalacticradio sources at microwave frequencies. polarization measurements of nearly2x10^6 sources at 1.4 ghz are provided by the nvss survey. using this catalogueand the gb6 survey, we study the distribution of the polarization degree ofboth steep- and flat-spectrum sources. we find that the polarization degree isanti-correlated with the flux density for the former population, while nocorrelation is detected for the latter. the available high-frequency data areexploited to determine the frequency dependence of the distribution ofpolarization degrees. using such information and the evolutionary model bytoffolatti et al. (1998), we estimate the polarization power spectrum ofextragalactic radio sources at \geq 30 ghz and their contamination of cmbpolarization maps. two distinct methods to compute point-source polarizationspectra are presented, extending and improving the one generally used inprevious analyses. while extragalactic radio sources can significantlycontaminate the cmb e-mode power spectrum only at low frequencies (&lt;30 ghz),they can severely constrain the detectability of the cmb b-mode up to ~100 ghz.

astro-ph;0408252	cross-correlation of the cmb and radio galaxies in real, harmonic and  wavelet spaces: detection of the integrated sachs-wolfe effect and dark  energy constraints	we report the first detection of the isw effect in wavelet space, at scalesin the sky around 7 degrees with a significance of around 3.3 sigma, bycross-correlating the wmap first-year data and the nrao vla sky survey (nvss).in addition, we present a detailed comparison among the capabilities of threedifferent techniques for two different objectives: to detect the isw and to putconstraints in the nature of the dark energy. the three studied techniques are:the cross-angular power spectrum (caps, harmonic space), the correlationfunction (ccf, real space) and the covariance of the spherical mexican hatwavelet (smhw) coefficients (csmhw, wavelet space). we prove that the csmhw isexpected to provide a higher detection of the isw effect for a certain scale.this prediction has been corroborated by the analysis of the data. the smhwanalysis shows that the cross-correlation signal is caused neither bysystematic effects nor foreground contamination. however, by taking intoaccount the information encoded in all the multipoles/scales/angles, the capsprovides slightly better constraints than the smhw in the cosmologicalparameters that define the nature of the dark energy. the limits provided bythe ccf are wider than for the other two methods. two different cases have beenstudied: 1) a flat lambda-cdm universe and 2) a flat universe with an equationof state parameter different from -1. in the first case, the caps provides (fora bias value of b = 1.6) 0.59 &lt; lambda density &lt; 0.84 (at 1 sigma cl).moreover, the caps rejects the range lambda density &lt; 0.1 at 3.5 sigma, whichis the highest detection of the dark energy reported up to date. in the secondcase, the caps gives 0.50 &lt; dark energy density &lt; 0.82 and -1.16 &lt; w &lt; 0.43 (at1 sigma cl).

astro-ph;0411567	limits on the detectability of the cmb b-mode polarization imposed by  foregrounds	we investigate which practical constraints are imposed by foregrounds to thedetection of the b-mode polarization generated by gravitational waves in thecase of experiments of the type currently being planned. because the b-modesignal is probably dominated by foregrounds at all frequencies, the detectionof the cosmological component depends drastically on our ability for removingforegrounds. we provide an analytical expression to estimate the level of theresidual polarization for galactic foregrounds, according to the methodemployed for their subtraction. we interpret this result in terms of the lowerlimit of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r that allows to disentangle thecosmological b-mode polarization from the foregrounds contribution. polarizedemission from extragalactic radio sources and gravitational lensing is alsotaken into account. as a first approach, we consider the ideal limit of aninstrumental noise--free experiment: for a full--sky coverage and a degreeresolution, we obtain a limit of r~10^(-4). this value can be improved byhigh--resolution experiments and, in principle, no clear fundamental limit onthe detectability of gravitational waves polarization is found. our analysis isalso applied to planned or hypothetical future polarization experiments, takinginto account expected noise levels.

astro-ph;0601427	the non-gaussian cold spot in wmap: significance, morphology and  foreground contribution	the non--gaussian cold spot in the 1-year wmap data, described in vielva etal. and cruz et al., is analysed in detail in the present paper. first of all,we perform a more rigorous calculation of the significance of the non-zerokurtosis detected in wmap maps by vielva et al. in wavelet space, mainlygenerated by the spot. we confirm the robustness of that detection, since theprobability of obtaining this deviation by chance is 0.69%. afterwards, themorphology of the spot is studied by applying spherical mexican hat waveletswith different ellipticities. the shape of the spot is found to be almostcircular. finally, we discuss if the observed non-gaussianity in wavelet spacecan arise from bad subtracted foreground residues in the wmap maps. we showthat the flat frequency dependence of the spot cannot be explained by a thermalsunyaev-zeldovich effect. based on our present knowledge of galactic foregroundemissions, we conclude that the significance of our detection is not affectedby galactic residues in the region of the spot. considering different galacticforeground estimates, the probability of finding such a big cold spot ingaussian simulations is always below 1%.

astro-ph;9611103	statistical tests for chdm and \lambdacdm cosmologies	we apply several statistical estimators to high-resolution n-body simulationsof two currently viable cosmological models: a mixed dark matter model, having$\omega_\nu=0.2$ contributed by two massive neutrinos (c+2\nudm), and a colddark matter model with cosmological constant (\lambdacdm) with $\omega_0=0.3$and h=0.7. our aim is to compare simulated galaxy samples with theperseus-pisces redshift survey (pps). we consider the n-point correlationfunctions (n=2-4), the n-count probability functions p_n, including the voidprobability function p_0, and the underdensity probability function u_\epsilon(where \epsilon fixes the underdensity threshold in percentage of the average).we find that p_0 (for which pps and cfa2 data agree) and p_1 distinguishefficiently between the models, while u_\epsilon is only marginallydiscriminatory. on the contrary, the reduced skewness and kurtosis are,respectively, s_3\simeq 2.2 and s_4\simeq 6-7 in all cases, quite independentof the scale, in agreement with hierarchical scaling predictions and estimatesbased on redshift surveys. among our results, we emphasize the remarkableagreement between pps data and c+2\nudm in all the tests performed. incontrast, the above \lambdacdm model has serious difficulties in reproducingobservational data if galaxies and matter overdensities are related in a simpleway.
