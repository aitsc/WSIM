0901.0257	evidence for an anticorrelation between the duration of the shallow  decay phase of grb x-ray afterglows and redshift	one of the most intriguing features discovered by swift is a plateau phase inthe x-ray flux decay of about 70% of the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs).the physical origin of this feature is still being debated. we constrain theproposed interpretations, based on the intrinsic temporal properties of theplateau phase. we selected and analyzed all the swift/xrt grb afterglows atknown redshift observed between march 2005 and june 2008 featuring a shallowdecay phase in their x-ray lightcurves. for our sample of 21 grbs we find ananticorrelation of the logarithm of the duration of the shallow phase with redshift, with a spearman rank-order correlation coefficient of r=-0.4 and a nullhypothesis probability of 5%. when we correct the durations for cosmologicaldilation, the anticorrelation strenghtens, with r=-0.6 and a null hypothesisprobability of 0.4%. considering only those grbs in our sample that have awell-measured burst peak energy (8 out of 21), we find an anticorrelationbetween the energy of the burst and the shallow phase duration, with r=-0.80and a null hypothesis probability of 1.8%. if the burst energy anticorrelationwith the shallow phase duration is real, then the dependence of the shallowphase on redshift could be the result of a selection effect, since on averagehigh-redshift bursts with lower energies and longer plateaus would be missed. aburst energy anticorrelation with the shallow phase duration would be expectedif the end of the plateau arises from a collimated outflow. alternativescenarios are briefly discussed involving a possible cosmological evolution ofthe mechanism responsible for the x-ray shallow decay.

0901.4038	the optical afterglows and host galaxies of three short/hard gamma-ray  bursts	short grbs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of doublecompact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.optical observations of short grbs allow us to measure redshifts, firmlyidentify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localizegrbs within them. multiwavelength observations of grb afterglows provide usefulinformation on the emission mechanisms at work. these are all key issues thatallow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. wecarried out photometric observations of the short/hard grb 051227, grb 061006,and grb 071227 with the eso-vlt starting from several hours after the explosiondown to the host galaxy level several days later. for grb 061006 and grb 071227we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. we compared theresults obtained from our optical observations with the available x-ray data ofthese bursts. for all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglowsand firmly identified their host galaxies. about half a day after the burst,the optical afterglows of grb 051227 and grb 061006 present a decaysignificatly steeper than in the x-rays. in the case of grb 051227, the opticaldecay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in thetwo wavelengths ranges. the three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies atmoderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the solar one. theprojected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centersspan a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts andpresent evidence for local absorption in their x-ray spectra. we discuss ourfindings in light of the current models of short grb progenitors.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0906.3187	uves/vlt high resolution absorption spectroscopy of the grb080330  afterglow: a study of the grb host galaxy and intervening absorbers	we study the gamma ray burst (grb) environment and intervening absorbers byanalyzing the optical absorption features produced by gas surrounding the grbor along its line of sight. we analyzed high resolution spectroscopicobservations (r=40000, s/n=3 - 6) of the optical afterglow of grb080330, takenwith uves at the vlt ~ 1.5 hours after the grb trigger. the spectrumillustrates the complexity of the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 1.51 whichhas at least four components in the main absorption system. we detect strongfeii, siii, and niii excited absorption lines associated with the bluemostcomponent only. in addition to the host galaxy, at least two more absorberslying along the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in theredshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, each exhibiting mgii absorption. for the bluemostcomponent in the host galaxy, we derive information about its distance from thesite of the grb explosion. we do so by assuming that the excited absorptionlines are produced by indirect uv pumping, and compare the data with a timedependent photo-excitation code. the distance of this component is found to be280+40-50 pc, which is lower than found for other grbs (1 - 6 kpc). we identifytwo additional mgii absorbers, one of them with a rest frame equivalent widthlarger than 1a. the distance between the grb and the absorber measured in thispaper confirms that the power of the grb radiation can influence the conditionsof the interstellar medium up to a distance of at least several hundred pc. forthe intervening absorbers, we confirm the trend that on average one strongintervening system is found per afterglow, as has been noted in studiesexhibiting an excess of strong mgii absorbers along grb sightlines compared toquasars.

0906.3191	non variability of intervening absorbers observed in the uves spectra of  the "naked-eye" grb080319	the aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of the interveningabsorbers lying along the line of sight of gamma-ray burst (grb) 080319bthrough the analysis of its optical absorption features. to this purpose, weanalyze a multi-epoch, high resolution spectroscopic observations (r=40000,corresponding to 7.5 km/s) of the optical afterglow of grb080319b (z=0.937),taken with uves at the vlt. thanks to the rapid response mode (rrm), weobserved the afterglow just 8m:30s after the grb onset when the magnitude was r~ 12. this allowed us to obtain the best signal-to-noise, high resolutionspectrum of a grb afterglow ever (s/n per resolution element ~ 50). two furtherrrm and target of opportunity observations were obtained starting 1.0 and 2.4hours after the event, respectively. four mgii absorption systems lying alongthe line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in the redshift range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 0.8, most of them showing a complex structure featuring severalcomponents. absorptions due to feii, mgi and mnii are also present; they appearin four, two and one intervening absorbers, respectively. one out of foursystems show a mgii2796 rest frame equivalent width larger than 1a. thisconfirms the excess of strong mgii absorbers compared to quasars, with dn/dz =0.9, ~ 4 times larger than the one observed along quasar lines of sight. inaddition, the analysis of multi-epoch, high-resolution spectra allowed us toexclude a significant variability in the column density of the singlecomponents of each absorber. combining this result with estimates of the sizeof the emitting region, we can reject the hypothesis that the differencebetween grb and qso mgii absorbers is due to a different size of the emittingregions.

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

1004.2919	discovery of the nearby long, soft grb 100316d with an associated  supernova	we report the swift discovery of nearby long, soft gamma-ray burst grb100316d, and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy andassociated supernova. we derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb-sn. we study the extremelyunusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to x-ray spectroscopy, andfind that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition toa synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. the x-ray light curvehas a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. the host is a bright,blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south, vlt andhst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. wecompare and contrast the x-ray emission and host galaxy of grb 100316d to asubsample of grb-sne. grb 100316d is unlike the majority of grb-sne in itsx-ray evolution, but resembles rather grb 060218, and we find that these twoevents have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.comparison of the host galaxies of grb-sne demonstrates, however, that there isa great diversity in the environments in which grb-sne can be found. grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample ofspectroscopically confirmed grb-sne, from which a better understanding of longgrb progenitors and the grb--sn connection can be gleaned.

1006.0800	the afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205: evidence for a ly-alpha  emitter at z=4.65	gamma-ray bursts have been proved to be detectable up to distances muchlarger than any other astrophysical object, providing the most effective way,complementary to ordinary surveys, to study the high redshift universe. to thisend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to thestudy of the high-z grb 090205. we carried out optical/nir spectroscopy andimaging of grb 090205 with the eso-vlt starting from hours after the event upto several days later to detect the host galaxy. we compared the resultsobtained from our optical/nir observations with the available swift high-energydata of this burst. our observational campaign led to the detection of theoptical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205 and to the first measure of itsredshift, z=4.65. similar to other, recent high-z grbs, grb 090205 has a shortduration in the rest-frame with t_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibilitythat it might belong to the short grbs class. the x-ray afterglow of grb 090205shows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. photometricobservations of the grb 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxywith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 myr. moreover, the metallicity ofz &gt; 0.27 z_sun derived from the grb afterglow spectrum is among the highestderived from grb afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burstoccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. finally, a detailed analysis of theafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to lyman-alphaemission at the redshift of the burst. grb 090205 is thus hosted in a typicallyman-alpha emitter (lae) at z=4.65. this makes the grb 090205 host thefarthest grb host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

0704.2189	selection effects shaping the gamma ray burst redshift distributions	long gamma ray bursts hold the promise of probing star-formation and metalenrichment up to very high redshifts. the present grb samples with redshiftdetermination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis ofselection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from theobserved grb redshift distribution. we study and compare three well definedsamples of long grbs detected by swift, hete2 and bepposax. we find that swiftgrbs are slighly fainter and harder than bepposax and hete2 grbs, as expecteddue to the higher energy range in which swift grbs are detected and localized,compared to bepposax and hete2. gas and dust obscuration plays a role inshaping the grb samples and the present samples of grbs with redshift. we arguethat the majority of the bright swift grbs without redshift might actually bez&lt;~2 events therefore the present swift grb sample with redshift is biasedagainst low-z grbs. on the other hand, the detection of bright uv rest-frameafterglows from high-z grbs, and even from those with large x-ray obscuration,implies a dust amount lower than in nearby grbs,and/or a different dustcomposition. if this is the case, the swift sample of grbs with redshifts isprobably a fair sample of the real high-z grb population. the absence of high-zgrbs in the bepposax and hete2 samples of grbs with redshifts is probably dueto the fact at the time of bepposax and hete2 follow-up faint afterglows ofhigh redshift grbs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities ofeven 10m class telescopes. the redshift distribution of a subsample of swiftgrbs with distributions of peak-fluxes, x-ray obscuration and optical magnitudeat a fixed observing time similar to those of the bepposax and hete2 samples,is roughly consistent with bepposax+hete2 redshift distribution.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1108.1084	vlt/uves and fors2 spectroscopy of the grb 081008 afterglow	we study the gamma-ray burst grb 081008 environment by analysing the spectraof its optical afterglow. uves high resolution spectroscopy of grb 081008 wassecured ~5 hr after the swift trigger. our dataset comprises also three fors2nearly simultaneous spectra of the same source. the availability of nearlysimultaneous high and low resolution spectra for a grb afterglow is anextremely rare event. the grb-damped lyman alpha system at z = 1.9683 showsthat the interstellar medium (ism) of the host galaxy is constituted by atleast three components which contribute to the line profiles. component i isthe redmost one, and is 20 km/s and 78 km/s redward component ii and iii,respectively. we detect several ground state and excited absorption features incomponents i and ii. these features have been used to compute the distancesbetween the grb and the absorbers. component i is found to be 52 +/- 6 pc awayfrom the grb, while component ii presents few excited transitions and itsdistance is 200+60-80} pc. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 081008is log nh/cm^-2 = 21.11 +/- 0.10, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is inthe range [x/h] = -1.29 to -0.52. in particular, we found [fe/h]=-1.19 +/- 0.11and [zn/h]=-0.52 +/- 0.11 with respect to solar values. this discrepancy can beexplained by the presence of dust in the grb ism, given the opposite refractoryproperties of iron and zinc. by deriving the depletion pattern for grb 081008,we find the optical extinction in the visual band to be av ~ 0.19 mag. thecurve of growth analysis applied to the fors2 spectra brings column densitiesconsistent at the 3 sigma level to that evaluated from the uves data using theline fitting procedure. this reflects the low saturation of the detectedgrb\,081008 absorption features.

1110.4706	a simplified view of blazars: clearing the fog around long-standing  selection effects	we propose a scenario where blazars are classified as flat-spectrum radioquasars (fsrqs), bl lacs, low synchrotron, or high synchrotron peaked objectsaccording to a varying mix of the doppler boosted radiation from the jet, theemission from the accretion disk, the broad line region, and the light from thehost galaxy. in this framework the peak energy of the synchrotron power(nu_peak) in blazars is independent of source type and of radio luminosity. wetest this new approach, which builds upon unified schemes, using extensivemonte carlo simulations and show that it can provide simple answers to a numberof long-standing issues including, amongst others, the different cosmologicalevolution of bl lacs selected in the radio and x-ray bands, the larger nu_peakvalues observed in bl lacs, the fact that high synchrotron peaked blazars arealways of the bl lac type, and the existence of fsrq/bl lac transition objects.objects so far classified as bl lacs on the basis of their observed weak, orundetectable, emission lines are of two physically different classes:intrinsically weak lined objects, more common in x-ray selected samples, andheavily diluted broad lined sources, more frequent in radio selected samples,which explains some of the confusion in the literature. we also show thatstrong selection effects are the main cause of the diversity observed in radioand x-ray samples, and that the correlation between luminosity and nu_peak,that led to the proposal of the "blazar sequence", is also a selection effectarising from the comparison of shallow radio and x-ray surveys, and to the factthat high nu_peak-high radio power objects have never been considered becausetheir redshift is not measurable.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1112.4470	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma ray bursts: testing the  spectral-energy correlations	we use a nearly complete sample of gamma ray bursts (grbs) detected by theswift satellite to study the correlations between the spectral peak energy epof the prompt emission, the isotropic energetics eiso and the isotropicluminosity liso. this grb sample is characterized by a high level ofcompleteness in redshift (90%). this allows us to probe in an unbiased way theissue related to the physical origin of these correlations against selectioneffects. we find that one burst, grb 061021, is an outlier to the ep-eisocorrelation. despite this case, we find strong ep-eiso and ep-liso correlationsfor the bursts of the complete sample. their slopes, normalisations anddispersions are consistent with those found with the whole sample of burstswith measured redshift and ep. this means that the biases present in the totalsample commonly used to study these correlations do not affect theirproperties. finally, we also find no evolution with redshift of the ep-eiso andep-liso correlations.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1205.0647	a simplified view of blazars: why bl lacertae is actually a quasar in  disguise	we put forward a scenario where blazars are classified as flat-spectrum radioquasars, bl lacs, low synchrotron, or high synchrotron peaked objects accordingto a varying combination of doppler boosted radiation from the jet, emissionfrom the accretion disk, the broad line region, and light from the host galaxy.we thoroughly test this new approach, which builds upon unified schemes, usingmonte carlo simulations and show that it can provide simple answers to a numberof long-standing open issues. we also demonstrate that selection effects play avery important role in the diversity observed in radio and x-ray samples and inthe correlation between luminosity and peak frequency of the synchrotron power(the so-called "blazar sequence"). it turns out that sources so far classifiedas bl lacs on the basis of their observed weak, or undetectable, emission linesare of two physically different classes: intrinsically weak-lined objects, morecommon in x-ray selected samples, and heavily diluted broad-lined sources, morefrequent in radio selected samples, which explains some of the confusion in theliterature.

1211.6528	an independent measurement of the incidence of mgii absorbers along  gamma-ray burst sightlines: the end of the mystery?	in 2006, prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement ofvery strong mg ii absorption systems intervening the sightlines to gamma-raybursts (grbs) relative to the in- cidence of such absorption along quasarsightlines. this counterintuitive result, has inspired a diverse set ofastrophysical explanations (e.g. dust, gravitational lensing) but none of thesehas obviously resolved the puzzle. using the largest set of grb afterglowspectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. in an independentsample of grb spectra with a survey path 3 times larger than prochter et al.,we measure the incidence per unit redshift of $\geq 1$\aa rest-frame equivalentwidth mg ii absorbers at $z \approx 1$ to be l(z)= 0.18 $\pm$ 0.06. this isfully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbersalong quasar sightlines. therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancementand suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. signatures of theoriginal result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an $\approx 1.5$enhancement over l(z)qso), but the statistical significance now lies at$\approx 90%$ c.l. restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolutionspectra of grb afterglows (which overlaps substantially with prochter et al.),we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of mg ii absorption.the reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is noconnection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (orechellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong mg ii doublets. onlya larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on thismatter.

1303.4743	dust extinction for an unbiased sample of grb afterglows	in this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of asample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. the selection criteria of thesample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emissionand therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. it istherefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population ofgamma-ray bursts. our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinctionof gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a singledistribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% sufferfrom less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. the remaining 13% of the afterglows arehighly absorbed. the true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing highabsorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events withoutreliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. these events maybe due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated withthe gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or tomassive dusty host galaxies. no clear evolution in the dust extinctionproperties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although thelargest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the starformation rate. those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. a correlation betweenoptical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density basedon x-ray studies is shown although the observed nh appears to be well in excesscompared to those observed in the local group. dust extinction does not seem tocorrelate with grb energetics or luminosity.

1306.0013	how to switch on and off a gamma-ray burst through a magnetar	one of the most elusive features of gamma ray bursts (grbs) is the sporadicemission prior to the main prompt event observed in at least $\sim 15\%$ ofcases. these precursors have spectral and temporal properties similar to themain prompt emission, and smaller, but comparable, energetics. they areseparated from the main event by a quiescent time that may be extremely longand, in some cases, more than one precursor has been observed in the sameburst. precursors are still a puzzle: despite many attempts none of theproposed models can account for all the observed features. based on thecomplete sample of bright long grbs observed by swift (bat6), we propose a newscenario for which precursors are explained by assuming that the central grbengine is a newly born magnetar. in this model the precursor and the promptemission arise from accretion of matter onto the surface of the magnetar. theaccretion process can be halted by the centrifugal drag exerted by the rotatingmagnetosphere onto the in-falling matter, allowing for multiple precursors andvery long quiescent times.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1308.5563	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects iii. photospheric and  chromospheric properties of class iii objects	we analyzed x-shooter/vlt spectra of 24 classiii sources from three nearbystar-forming regions (sigmaorionis, lupusiii, and twhya). we determined theeffective temperature, surface gravity, rotational velocity, and radialvelocity by comparing the observed spectra with synthetic bt-settl modelspectra. we investigated in detail the emission lines emerging from the stellarchromospheres and combined these data with archival x-ray data to allow for acomparison between chromospheric and coronal emissions. both x-ray and halphaluminosity as measured in terms of the bolometric luminosity are independent ofthe effective temperature for early-m stars but decline toward the end of thespectral m sequence. for the saturated early-m stars the average emission levelis almost one dex higher for x-rays than for halpha: log(l_x/l_bol) = -2.85 +-0.36 vs. log(l_halpha/l_bol) = -3.72 +- 0.21. when all chromospheric emissionlines (including the balmer series up to h11, caii hk, the caii infraredtriplet, and several hei lines) are summed up the coronal flux still dominatesthat of the chromosphere, typically by a factor 2-5. flux-flux relationsbetween activity diagnostics that probe different atmospheric layers (from thelower chromosphere to the corona) separate our sample of active pre-mainsequence stars from the bulk of field m dwarfs studied in the literature. fluxratios between individual optical emission lines show a smooth dependence onthe effective temperature. the balmer decrements can roughly be reproduced byan nlte radiative transfer model devised for another young star of similar age.future, more complete chromospheric model grids can be tested against this dataset.

1310.2069	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: iv -- accretion in  low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects in lupus	we present x-shooter/vlt observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-massstellar and sub-stellar objects (ysos) in the lupus star forming region,spanning a range in mass from ~0.03 to ~1.2msun, but mostly with 0.1msun &lt;mstar &lt; 0.5msun. our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship betweenexcess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, toinvestigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of thecentral object. the accretion luminosity (lacc), and from it the accretion rate(macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the uv to thenear-ir, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. the flux andluminosity (ll) of a large number of emission lines of h, he, caii, etc.,observed simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. theluminosity of all the lines is well correlated with lacc. we provide empiricalrelationships between lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which havea lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. ourmeasurements extend the pab and brg relationships to lacc values about twoorders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. we confirmthat different methodologies to measure lacc and macc yield significantlydifferent results: ha line profile modelling may underestimate macc by 0.6 to0.8dex with respect to macc derived from continuum-excess measures. suchdifferences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between maccand other ysos properties reported in the literature. we derive macc in therange 2e-12 -- 4e-8 msun/yr and conclude that macc is proportional tomstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than inprevious studies. a number of properties indicate that the physical conditionsof the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in macc.

1311.4340	new constraints on grb jet geometry and relativistic shock physics	we use high--quality, multi-band observations of swift grb120404a, fromgamma-ray to radio frequencies, together with the new hydrodynamics code of vaneerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1401.1972	a magnetar powering the ordinary monster grb 130427a?	we present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (grb)130427a under the hypothesis that the grb central engine is anaccretion-powered magnetar. in this framework, initially proposed to explaingrbs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion ofmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to theaccretion rate. the emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces areable to pause accretion. we show that the x-ray and optical afterglow is wellexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contributionfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. our modelling does not require anycontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglowlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. wederive the magnetic field ($b\sim 10^{16}$ g) and the spin period ($p\sim 20$ms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimumluminosity for accretion. this minimum luminosity results well below the promptemission luminosity of grb 130427a, providing a strong consistency check forthe scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuousaccretion onto the magnetar. this is in agreement with the relatively long spinperiod of the magnetar. grb 130427a was a well monitored grb showing a verystandard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that anaccretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long grbs.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

1402.4026	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 120327a afterglow	we present a study of the environment of the swift long gamma-ray burst grb120327a at z ~2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. we analyzedmedium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (~7000 - 12000,corresponding to ~ 15 - 23 km/s, s/n = 15- 30 and wavelength range3000-25000aa) of the optical afterglow of grb 120327a, taken with x-shooter atthe vlt 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the grb trigger. the first epoch spectrum showsthat the ism in the grb host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich inabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.the hydrogen column density associated with grb 120327a has log nh / cm^(-2) =22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [x/h] =-1.3 to -1.1. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorptionfeatures associated with excited states of cii, oi, siii, feii, and niii, whichwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gasand the site of the grb explosion. the variability of the fei\lambda2396excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited bythe grb uv flux. moreover, the distance of component i is found to bedi=200+100-60 pc, while component ii is located closer to the grb, atdii=100+40-30 pc. these values are among the lowest found in grbs. componentiii does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther awayfrom the grb. the presence of h2 molecules is firmly established, with amolecular fraction in the range f=4 x 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). this particularly lowvalue can be attributed to the small dust content. this represents the thirdpositive detection of molecules in a grb environment.

1402.6338	grb orphan afterglows in present and future radio transient surveys	orphan afterglows (oa) are slow transients produced by gamma ray bursts seenoff-axis that become visible on timescales of days/years at optical/nir andradio frequencies, when the prompt emission at high energies (x and gamma rays)has already ceased. given the typically estimated jet opening angle of grbstheta_jet ~ 3 deg, for each burst pointing to the earth there should be afactor ~ 700 more grbs pointing in other directions. despite this, no secureoas have been detected so far. through a population synthesis code we study theemission properties of the population of oa at radio frequencies. oas reachtheir emission peak on year-timescales and they last for a comparable amount oftime. the typical peak fluxes (which depend on the observing frequency) are offew micro jy in the radio band with only a few oa reaching the mjy level. thesevalues are consistent with the upper limits on the radio flux of sn ib/cobserved at late times. we find that the oa radio number count distribution hasa typical slope -1.7 at high fluxes and a flatter (-0.4) slope at low fluxeswith a break at a frequency-dependent flux. our predictions of the oa rates areconsistent with the (upper) limits of recent radio surveys and archive searchesfor radio transients. future radio surveys like vast/askap at 1.4 ghz shoulddetect ~ 3x10^-3 oa deg^-2 yr-1, meerkat and evla at 8.4 ghz should see ~3x10^-1 oa deg-2 yr-1. the ska, reaching the micro jy flux limit, could see upto ~ 0.2-1.5 oa deg^-2 yr^-1. these rates also depend on the duration of the oaabove a certain flux limit and we discuss this effect with respect to thesurvey cadence.

1406.5630	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: v - slow winds in t  tauri stars	disks around t tauri stars are known to lose mass, as best shown by theprofiles of forbidden emission lines of low ionization species. at least twoseparate kinematic components have been identified, one characterised byvelocity shifts of tens to hundreds km/s (hvc) and one with much lower velocityof few km/s (lvc). the hvc are convincingly associated to the emission of jets,but the origin of the lvc is still unknown. in this paper we analyze theforbidden line spectrum of a sample of 44 mostly low mass young stars in lupusand $\sigma$-ori observed with the x-shooter eso spectrometer. we detectforbidden line emission of [oi], [oii], [sii], [ni], and [nii], andcharacterize the line profiles as lvc, blue-shifted hvc and red-shifted hvc. wefocus our study on the lvc. we show that there is a good correlation betweenline luminosity and both l$_{star}$ and the accretion luminosity (or themass-accretion rate) over a large interval of values (l$_{star}$ $\sim 10^{-2}- 1$ l$_\odot$; l$_{acc}$ $\sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-1}$ l$_\odot$; $\dot m_{acc}$$\sim 10^{-11} - 10^{-7}$ m$_\odot$/yr). the lines show the presence of a slowwind ($v_{peak}&lt;20$ km/s), dense ($n_h&gt;10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), warm (t$\sim5000-10000$ k), mostly neutral. we estimate the mass of the emitting gas andprovide a value for the maximum volume it occupies. both quantities increasesteeply with the stellar mass, from $\sim 10^{-12}$ m$_\odot$ and $\sim 0.01$au$^3$ for m$_{star}$$\sim 0.1$ m$_\odot$, to $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}$m$_\odot$ and $\sim 1$ au$^3$ for m$_{star}$$\sim 1$ m$_\odot$, respectively.these results provide quite stringent constraints to wind models in low massyoung stars, that need to be explored further.

1409.4804	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the afterglow of the swift grb 130606a:  chemical abundances and reionisation at $z\sim6$	the reionisation of the universe is thought to have ended around z~6, asinferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such asquasars (qso) and gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows. furthermore, spectroscopyof a grb afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dimand distant to study otherwise. we present the high s/n vlt/x-shooter spectrumof grb130606a at z=5.913. we aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the igmbetween 5.02&lt;z&lt;5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dustcontent of its host galaxy. we measured the flux decrement due to absorption atly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. the hydrogen and metalabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with voigt profiles toobtain column densities. our measurements of the ly$\alpha$-forest opticaldepth are consistent with previous measurements of qsos, but have a muchsmaller uncertainty. the analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutralfraction $x_{hi}&lt;0.05$ (3$\sigma$). we obtain column density measurements ofseveral elements. the ionisation corrections due to the grb is estimated to benegligible (&lt;0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to thepre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-dla studies). ourmeasurements confirm that the universe is already predominantly ionised overthe redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z&gt;5.6.grbs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the igm in the earlyuniverse, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sampleto draw robust conclusions. the high [si/fe] in the host can be due to dustdepletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. the very highvalue of [al/fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.we estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).(trunc.)

1502.07121	are many radio-selected bl lacs radio quasars in disguise?	we show that a blazar classification in bl lacs and flat spectrum radioquasars may not be adequate when it relies solely on the equivalent widths(ews) of optical lines. in fact, depending on redshift, some strong emissionlines can fall in the infrared window and be missed. we selected a sample of bllacs with firm redshift identification and good visibility from paranal. wetargeted with the x-shooter spectrograph the five bl lacs with z &gt; 0.7, i.e.,those for which the halpha line, one of the strongest among blazars, fallsoutside the optical window and determined the ew of emission lines in both theinfrared and optical bands. two out of five sources show an observed halpha ew&gt; 5a (one has rest frame ew &gt; 5a) and could be classified as fsrqs by one ofthe classification schemes used in the literature. a third object isborder-line with an observed ew of 4.4 +/- 0.5a. in all these cases halpha isthe strongest emission line detected. the halpha line of the other two blazarsis not detected, but in one case it falls in a region strongly contaminated bysky lines and in the other one the spectrum is featureless. we conclude that ablazar classification based on ew width only can be inaccurate and may lead toan erroneous determination of blazar evolution. this effect is more severe forthe bl lac class, since fsrqs can be misclassified as bl lacs especially athigh redshifts (z &gt; 0.7), where the latter are extremely rare.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

astro-ph;0106512	the blazar main sequence	we propose a sequence (the blazar main sequence, bms) that links the two maincomponents of the blazar class, namely, the flat spectrum radio quasars and thebl lacertae objects, and yields all their distinctive features in a correlatedway. in this view, both type of sources are centered on a supermassive kerrhole close to maximal spin that produces a relativistic jet observed close tothe axis, and on the associated accretion disk that emits more isotropically.but the fsrqs are energized by accretion at rates dm/dt ~ 1, and are dominatedby the disk components (thermal and electrodynamic jet-like component) whichprovide outputs in excess of l ~ 10^46 erg/s. on the other hand, accretionlevels dm/dt &lt;&lt; 1 are enough to energize the bl lacs; here the radiation ishighly non-thermal and the power partly contributed by the rotational energy ofthe central kerr hole, with the latter and the disk together sustaining l ~10^44 erg/s in the jet frame for several gyrs. if so, we expect the bl lacs toshow quite different evolutionary signatures from the fsrqs, and in particular,number counts close to the euclidean shape, or flatter if the sources make atransition to the bl lac from a fsrq mode. in addition, for lower dm/dt alongthe bms, we expect the large scale electric fields to be less screened out, andto accelerate fewer particles to higher energies with non-thermal radiations athigher frequencies; so in moving from fsrqs to bl lacs these non-thermalradiations will peak at frequencies inversely correlated with the disk output.for the bl lacs such dependence implies increased scatter when one tries acorrelation with the total ouput. at its endpoint, the bms suggests widespreadobjects that are radiatively silent, but still efficient in accelerating cosmicrays to ultra high energies.

astro-ph;0211147	the disc-jet relation in strong-lined blazars	the relation between accretion disc (thermal emission) and jet (non-thermalemission) in blazars is still a mystery as, typically, the beamed jet emissionswamps the disc even in the ultraviolet band where disc emission peaks. in thispaper we estimate the accretion disc component for 136 flat-spectrum radioquasars selected from the deep x-ray radio blazar survey. we do this byderiving the accretion disc spectrum from the mass and accretion rate onto thecentral black hole for each object, estimated using the emission line widthsand the power emitted from the broad line region. we find that non-thermalemission dominates the optical/uv band of our sources. the thermal component,in fact, is, on average, ~ 15 per cent of the total and &gt; 90 per cent of theobjects in the sample have a thermal component &lt; 0.5 of the total luminosity.we then estimate the integrated disc and kinetic jet powers and find that, onaverage, the disc luminosity is ~ 1 to 20 times the jet power (depending on theuncertainties in the estimation of the latter quantity). a comparison withprevious, independent results favours a scenario in which jet and disk powersare of the same order of magnitude. extraction of energy from a rotating blackhole via the ``blandford-znajek'' mechanism fails to explain the estimated jetpower in the majority of our sources. finally, we find that the typical massesfor our sources are ~ 5 10^8 solar masses and that, contrary to previousclaims, about one quarter of our radio quasars have relatively small (&lt; 3 10^8solar masses) black hole mass.

astro-ph;0409434	x-ray source overdensities in chandra distant cluster fields: a new  probe to map the cosmic tapestry?	the first systematic study of the serendipitous x-ray source density around10 high z (0.24&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters has been performed with chandra. a factor ~2overdensity has been found in 4 cluster fields, increasing to 11 the number ofknown source overdensities around high z clusters. the result is statisticallyhighly significant (at &gt;2 sigma per field, and &gt;5 sigma overall) only on scales8'x8' and peculiar to cluster fields. the blank field fluctuations, i.e. themost sensitive measurements to date of the x-ray cosmic variance on this scale,indicate variations within ~15-25% around the average value. the first marginalevidence that these overdensities increase with cluster redshift is alsopresented. we speculate that the most likely explanation for what has beenobserved is that the x-ray sources are agns which trace filaments connected tothe clusters. nevertheless other possible explanations such as an ``x-raybutcher-oemler'' effect are not ruled out by present results. if theassociation of the overdensities with large-scale structures and their positiverelation with cluster redshift is confirmed, these studies could represent anew, direct, way of mapping the cosmic web and its parameters at high z.

astro-ph;0503258	the redshift-space two point correlation function of elais-s1 galaxies	we investigate the clustering properties of galaxies in the recentlycompleted elais-s1 redshift survey through their spatial two pointautocorrelation function. we used a sub-sample of the elais-s1 catalog coveringapproximately 4 deg^2 and consisting of 148 objects selected at 15 micron witha flux &gt;0.5 mjy and redshift z&lt;0.5. we detected a positive signal in thecorrelation function that, in the range of separations 1-10 h mpc is wellapproximated by a power law with a slope gamma = 1.4 and a correlation length s=5.4 h mpc. this result is in good agreement with the redshift-spacecorrelation function measured in more local samples of mid infrared selectedgalaxies like the iras psc$z$ redshift survey. this suggests a lack ofsignificant clustering evolution of infrared selected objects out to $z=0.5$that is further confirmed by the consistency found between the correlationfunctions measured in a local (z&lt;0.2) and a distant (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5) subsample ofelais-s1 galaxies. we also confirm that optically selected galaxies in thelocal redshift surveys, especially those of the sdss sample, are significantlymore clustered than infrared objects.

astro-ph;0509144	optical emission from grb 050709: a short/hard grb in a star forming  galaxy	we present optical observations of the short/hard gamma-ray burst grb 050709,the first such event with an identified optical counterpart. the object iscoincident with a weak x-ray source and is located inside a galaxy at redshiftz = 0.1606 +- 0.0002. multiband photometry allowed us to study the broad-bandspectral energy distribution. late-time monitoring places strong limits on anysupernova simultaneous with the grb. the host galaxy is not of early type.spectra show that the dominant stellar population is relatively young (~ 1gyr), and that ongoing star formation is present at a level of 2-3 (l/l*)msun/yr. this is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than that observed inthe elliptical hosts of the short grb 050509b and grb 050724. this shows thatat least some short grbs originate in a young population. short/hard grb modelsbased on the merger of a binary degenerate system are compatible with the hostgalaxy characteristics, although there is still the possibility of a connectionbetween young stars and at least a fraction of such events.

astro-ph;0607107	the xmm-newton survey of the elais-s1 field. i: number counts, angular  correlation function and x-ray spectral properties	we have surveyed with xmm-newton the central ~0.6 deg2 region of the elais-s1field down to flux limits of ~5.5x10-16 cgs (0.5-2 kev, s band), ~2x10-15 cgs(2-10 kev, h band), and ~4x10-15 cgs (5-10 kev, hh band). we detect a total of478 sources, 395 and 205 of which detected in the s and h bands respectively.we identified 7 clearly extended sources and estimated their redshift throughx-ray spectral fits with thermal models. in four cases the redshift isconsistent with z=0.4. we have computed the angular correlation function of thesources in the s and h bands, finding best fit correlation anglestheta_0=5.2+/-3.8 arcsec and theta_0=12.8+/-7.8 arcsec respectively. a roughestimate of the present-day correlation length r_0 can be obtained invertingthe limber equation and assuming an appropriate redshift distribution dn/dz.the results range between 12.8 and 9.8 h-1 mpc in the s band and between 17.9and 13.4 h-1 mpc in the h band, with 30-40% statistical errors, assuming eithersmooth redshift distributions or redshift distributions with spikes accountingfor the presence of a structure at z=0.4. the relative density of the s bandsources is higher near the clusters and groups at z~0.4 and extends toward eastand toward south/west. this suggests that the structure is complex, with a sizecomparable to the full xmm-newton field. conversely, the highest relativesource densities of the h band sources are located in the central-west regionof the field.

astro-ph;0609825	uves/vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb 050730 afterglow: probing  the features of the grb environment	we analyze high resolution spectroscopic observations of the opticalafterglow of grb050730, obtained with uves@vlt about hours after the grbtrigger. the spectrum shows that the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 3.967 iscomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorptionsystem. we detect strong cii*, siii*, oi* and feii* fine structure absorptionlines associated to the second and third component. for the first threecomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of thegrb explosion. component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not presentany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionizationfeatures, such as civ and ovi, suggesting that this component is very close tothe grb site. from the analysis of low and high ionization lines and finestructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from thesite of the grb explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. weevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. however, this should not be taken asrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to thehydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while thatof the other elements presumably comes from the ism closer to the grb site.furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modifysignificantly these values. the mean [c/fe] ratio agrees well with thatexpected by single star-formation event models. interestingly the [c/fe] ofcomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with grb dustdestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the grbsite.

astro-ph;0612023	the hellas2xmm survey.viii. optical identifications of the extended  sample	(abridged) we present the results of the photometric and spectroscopicidentification of 110 hard x-ray selected sources (6e-15&lt;f(2-10 kev)&lt;4e-14 cgs)from 5 additional xmm-newton fields, nearly doubling the original hellas2xmmsample. we spectroscopically identified 59 new sources, bringing thecompleteness of the full hellas2xmm sample to ~70%. we found opticalcounterparts for 214 out of the 232 x-ray sources of the full sample down tor~25. we measure the flux and luminosity of the [oiii](5007) emission line for59 such sources. results. we use the full hellas2xmm and the cdf samples toestimate the logn-logs and the obscured qso surface densities down to f(2-10kev)~1e-14 and 1e-15 cgs. at these flux limits the fraction of x-ray selectedobscured and unobscured qso turns out to be similar. since x-ray selectionmisses most compton thick agn, the number of obscured qso may well outnumberthat of unobscured qsos. we find that hard x-ray selected agns with detected[oiii] emission span a wide range of l(2-10 kev)/l[oiii] with a median higherthan that of optically selected agns, suggesting that optically selectedsamples are at least partly incomplete, and/or [oiii] emission is not a perfectisotropic indicator of the nuclear power. differently from narrow-line agns inthe same z interval, the 7 xbongs candidates in the sample have l(2-10kev)/l[oiii]&gt; 1000, while their lx, l(r) and nh are similar. this suggests thatwhile the central engine of narrow-line agns and xbongs looks similar, thenarrow-line region in xbongs could be strongly inhibited or obscured.

astro-ph;0701558	uves - vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb afterglows	we present early time, high resolution spectroscopy of three grb afterglows:grb050730, grb050922c and grb060418. these data give us precious information onthe kinematics, ionization and metallicity of the interstellar matter of grbhost galaxies up to a redshift z = 4, and of intervening absorbers along theline of sight. the absorption spectra show that elements are present both withhigh and low ionization states, and even forbidden, fine structure levels arecommonly observed. these features allow us to evaluate the physical parametersof the absorbing gas. in details, the density of the gas regions lie in therange n = 10 - 10^6 cm-3, and the temperatures are of the order of t = 10^3 -10^4 k. the metallicity of the grb host galaxies is computed using the hydrogenabsorption features. we find undersolar abundances for our grbs, namely, z =0.001 - 0.01. however, depletion has not been considered. it can be taken intoaccount using as metallicity indicators zn and cr, which tend to remain in thegas phase. we find metallicities higher than the previous values and inagreement with other measurements for grb host galaxies. finally, the observed[c/fe] ratio for grb050730 (z = 3.967) agrees with values expected for a galaxyyounger than a gyr undergoing bursts of star-formation. in addition, the [c/fe]ratio evaluated component by component can give informations on the relativedistances of the components from the grb explosion site, since fe dust is moreefficiently destroyed than graphite.

0811.0989	probing the complex environments of grb host galaxies and intervening  systems: high resolution spectroscopy of grb050922c	the aim of this paper is to investigate the environment of gamma ray bursts(grbs) and the interstellar matter of their host galaxies. we use to thispurpose high resolution spectroscopic observations of the afterglow ofgrb050922c, obtained with uves/vlt 3.5 hours after the grb event. we foundthat, as for most high resolution spectra of grbs, the spectrum of theafterglow of grb050922c is complex. at least seven components contribute to themain absorption system at z=2.1992. the detection of lines of neutral elementslike mgi and the detection of fine-structure levels of the ions feii, siii andcii allows us to separate components in the grb ism along the line of sight.moreover, in addition to the main system, we have analyzed the five interveningsystems between z = 2.077 and z = 1.5664 identified along the grb line ofsight. grb afterglow spectra are very complex, but full of information. thiscan be used to disentangle the contribution of the different parts of the grbhost galaxy and to study their properties. our metallicity estimates agree withthe scenario of grbs exploding in low metallicity galaxies

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.
