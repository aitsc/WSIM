0901.1775	cosmic rays vi - starburst galaxies at multiwavelengths	we propose an explanation for the far-infrared/radio correlation of galaxiesin terms of the energy balance of the interstellar medium and determine theflux from high-energy photons and neutrinos from starburst galaxies. we presenta catalog of the 127 brightest starburst galaxies with redshifts of z&lt;0.03. inorder to investigate the correlation between radio- and far-infrared emission,we apply the leaky box approximation. further, we derive photon- and neutrinospectra from proton-proton interactions in supernova remnants (snrs). here, weassume that a fraction of the snr's energy is transferred to the accelerationof cosmic rays. we also investigate the possibility of detecting gamma raybursts from nearby starburst galaxies, using the catalog defined here. we showthat the radio emission is only weakly dependent on the magnetic field. itturns out that the intensity of the radio signal is directly proportional tothe number of supernova explosions, which scales with the far-infraredluminosity. in addition, we find that high-energy photons from proton-protoninteractions in snrs in starbursts can make up several percent of the diffusegamma-ray background. the neutrino flux from the same sources has a maximumenergy of ~1e5 gev. neutrinos can, on the other hand, can be observed if agamma ray burst happens in a nearby starburst. about 0.03 grbs per year areexpected to occur in the entire catalog. the true number is expected to be evenhigher, since we only include the brightest sources. the number of events perburst in icecube varies between about one event and more than 1000 events. thisprovides good prospects for icecube to detect a significant event, since thebackground for a grb search is close to zero.

0910.1197	the wmap haze from the galactic center region due to massive star  explosions and a reduced cosmic ray scale height	one important prediction of acceleration of particles in the supernova causedshock in the magnetic wind of exploding wolf rayet and red super giant stars isthe production of an energetic particle component with an e^-2 spectrum, at alevel of a few percent in flux at injection. after allowing for transporteffects, so steepening the spectrum to e^-7/3, this component of electronsproduces electromagnetic radiation and readily explains the wmap haze from thegalactic center region in spectrum, intensity and radial profile. this requiresthe diffusion time scale for cosmic rays in the galactic center region to bemuch shorter than in the solar neighborhood: the energy for cosmic rayelectrons at the transition between diffusion dominance and loss dominance isshifted to considerably higher particle energy. we predict that more preciseobservations will find a radio spectrum of \nu^-2/3, at higher frequencies\nu^-1, and at yet higher frequencies finally \nu^-3/2.

1005.2287	supermassive black hole spin-flip during the inspiral	during post-newtonian evolution of a compact binary, a mass ratio differentfrom 1 provides a second small parameter, which can lead to unexpected results.we present a statistics of supermassive black hole candidates, which enables usfirst to derive their mass distribution, then to establish a logarithmicallyeven probability of the mass ratios at their encounter. in the mass ratio range(1/30,1/3) of supermassive black hole mergers representing 40% of all possiblecases, the combined effect of spin-orbit precession and gravitational radiationleads to a spin-flip of the dominant spin during the inspiral phase of themerger. this provides a mechanism for explaining a large set of observations onx-shaped radio galaxies. in another 40%, with mass ratios (1/30,1/1000) aspin-flip never occurs, while in the remaining 20% of mergers with mass ratios(1/3,1) it may occur during the plunge. we analyze the magnitude of thespin-flip angle occurring during the inspiral as function of the mass ratio andoriginal relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum. we alsoderive a formula for the final spin at the end of the inspiral in this massratio range.

0704.1968	the spin-flip phenomenon in supermassive black hole binary mergers	massive merging black holes will be the primary sources of powerfulgravitational waves at low frequency, and will permit to test generalrelativity with candidate galaxies close to a binary black hole merger. in thispaper we identify the typical mass ratio of the two black holes but then showthat the distance when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipativeeffect (over dynamical friction) does not depend on the mass ratio. however thedynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. for thetypical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by arapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. thisalready occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analyticallyby post-newtonian techniques. we then identify the radio galaxies with asuper-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively apowerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of athick disk. these specific galaxies are thus candidates for a merger of twoblack holes to happen in the astronomically near future.

1006.5022	ultra-high energy cosmic rays from centaurus a: jet interaction with  gaseous shells	ultra high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs), with energies above ~6 x 10^19 ev,seem to show a weak correlation with the distribution of matter relatively nearto us in the universe. it has earlier been proposed that uhecrs could beaccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxycen a. we show that uhecr production at a spatially intermediate location about15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus isobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausiblealternative. a relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavyseed cosmic rays (crs) to uhecrs on timescales comparable to the time it takesthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. in this model many crs arising froma starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee regionaround pev, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of anewly oriented jet. this model matches the overall spectrum shown by the augerdata and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function ofparticle energy. we thus predict an observable anisotropy in the composition athigh energy in the sense that lighter nuclei should preferentially be seentoward the general direction of cen a. taking into consideration the magneticfield models for the galactic disk and a galactic magnetic wind, this scenariomay resolve the discrepancy between hires and auger results concerning thechemical composition of uhecrs.

1008.0789	on the origin of x-shaped radio galaxies	after a brief, critical review of the leading explanations proposed for thesmall but important subset of radio galaxies showing an x-shaped morphology(xrgs) we propose a generalized model, based on the jet-shell interaction andspin-flip hypotheses. the most popular scenarios for this intriguing phenomenoninvoke either hydrodynamical backflows and over-pressured cocoons or rapid jetreorientations, presumably from the spin-flips of central engines following themergers of pairs of galaxies, each of which contains a supermassive black hole(smbh). we confront these models with a number of key observations and thusargue that none of the models is capable of explaining the entire range ofsalient observational properties of xrgs, although some of the arguments raisedin the literature against the spin-flip scenario are probably not tenable. wethen propose here a new scenario which also involves galactic mergers but wouldallow the spin of the central engine to maintain its direction. motivated bythe detailed multi-band observations of the nearest radio galaxy, centaurus a,this new model emphasizes the role of interactions between the jets and theshells of stars and gas that form and rotate around the merged galaxy and cancause temporary deflections of the jets, occasionally giving rise to anx-shaped radio structure. although each of the models is likely to be relevantto a subset of xrgs, the bulk of the evidence indicates that most of them arebest explained by the jet-shell interaction or spin-flip hypotheses.

1009.5592	the origin of cosmic rays: explosions of massive stars with magnetic  winds and their supernova mechanism	one prediction of particle acceleration in the supernova remnants in themagnetic wind of exploding wolf rayet and red super giant stars is that thefinal spectrum is a composition of a spectrum $e^{-7/3}$ and a polar capcomponent of $e^{-2}$ at the source. this polar cap component contributes tothe total energy content with only a few percent, but dominates the spectrum athigher energy. the sum of both components gives spectra which curve upwards.the upturn was predicted to occur always at the same rigidity. an additionalcomponent of cosmic rays from acceleration by supernovae exploding into theinter-stellar medium (ism) adds another component for hydrogen and for helium.after transport the predicted spectra $j(e)$ for the wind-sn cosmic rays are$e^{-8/3}$ and $e^{-7/3}$; the sum leads to an upturn from the steeperspectrum. an upturn has now been seen. here, we test the observations againstthe predictions, and show that the observed properties are consistent with thepredictions. hydrogen can be shown to also have a noticeable wind-sn-component.the observation of the upturn in the heavy element spectra being compatiblewith the same rigidity for all heavy elements supports the magneto-rotationalmechanism for these supernovae. this interpretation predicts the observedupturn to continue to curve upwards and approach the $e^{-7/3}$ spectrum. ifconfirmed, this would strengthen the case that supernovae of very massive starswith magnetic winds are important sources of galactic cosmic rays.

1204.4239	spectrum and ionization rate of low energy galactic cosmic rays	we consider the rate of ionization of diffuse and molecular clouds in theinterstellar medium by galactic cosmic rays (gcr) in order to constrain its lowenergy spectrum. we extrapolate the gcr spectrum obtained from pamela at highenergies ($\ge 200$ gev/ nucleon) and a recently derived gcr proton flux at$1\hbox{--}200$ gev from observations of gamma rays from molecular clouds, andfind that the observed average galactic ionization rate can be reconciled withthis gcr spectrum if there is a low energy cutoff for protons at$10\hbox{--}100$ mev. we also identify the flattening below a few gev as beingdue to (a) decrease of the diffusion coefficient and dominance of convectiveloss at low energy and (b) the expected break in energy spectrum for a constantspectral index in momentum. we show that the inferred cr proton spectrum of$\phi \propto e_{kin}^{-1.7\pm0.2}$ for $e_{kin} \le$ few gev, is consistentwith a power-law spectrum in momentum $p^{-2.45\pm0.4}$, which we identify asthe spectrum at source. diffusion loss at higher energies then introduces asteepening by $e^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \sim 1/3$, making it consistent withhigh energy measurements.

1205.4016	a graviton statistics approach to dark energy, inflation and black holes	we derive two new equations of quantum gravity and combine them withreinterpretations of previously proposed concepts of dark energy, inflation andblack holes into a theory which may be a first step toward a comprehensivedescription of all three phenomena. the resulting theory also predicts newtests which can be experimentally checked within just a few years. the two newequations are : a) a creation equation to give stimulated emission for anysurface filled with gravitons, pulling energy from a background, and b) theassociation of an outgoing soliton wave of gravitons, a "shell front" with alarge lorentz factor derived from the uncertainties in both space and time.these new equations are combined with the common notions of an all-pervasivebackground of gravitons at the planck limit, the "planck sea"; theidentification of the thermodynamic limit with the emission of gravitons in a"shell front", i.e. what is usually called the entropy of black holes isidentified with the outgoing gravitons; the concept of black holes as amembrane full of gravitons at a large lorentz factor, the "planck shell"; theemission of gravitons created in a "horizon shell" during inflation. theseequations result in stimulated emission of gravitons by the interaction withthe background, the "planck sea", to describe dark energy, black holes, theinflationary period of the universe, and the arrow of time. these proposalslead to gravitational waves constituting dark energy. these waves should bedetectable within a few years with pulsar timing arrays. these gravitationalwaves can be characterized as uncorrelated solitons, and should also bedetectable with ultra-high precision lunar laser ranging, as well as withcorrespondingly precise clocks. the extremely high, but finite lorentz factorfor signal propagation may be expected to have further consequences in particleinteractions.

1207.4397	active galactic nuclei jets and multiple oblique shock acceleration:  starved spectra	shocks in jets and hot spots of active galactic nuclei (agn) are oneprominent class of possible sources of very high energy cosmic ray particles(above 10^18ev). extrapolating their spectrum to their plausible injectionenergy from some shock, implies an enormous hidden energy for a spectrum ofindex ~-2. some analyzes suggest the particles' injection spectrum at source tobe as steep as -2.4 to -2.7, making the problem much worse, by a factor oforder 10^6. nevertheless, it seems implausible that more than at the very best1/3 of the jet energy, goes into the required flux of energetic particles thus,one would need to allow for the possibility that there is an energy problem,which we would like to address in this work. sequences of consecutive obliqueshock features, or conical shocks, have been theorized and eventually observedin many agn jets. based on that, we use by analogy the 'comptonisation' effectand we propose a scenario of a single injection of particles which areaccelerated consecutively by several oblique shocks along the axis of an agnjet. we use detailed test-particle approximation monte carlo simulations inorder to calculate particle spectra by acceleration at such a shock patternwhile monitoring the efficiency of acceleration, calculating differentialspectra. we find that the first shock of a sequence of oblique shocks,establishes a low energy power-law spectrum with ~e^-2.7. the consecutiveshocks push the spectrum up in energy, rendering flatter distributions withsteep cut-offs and characteristic depletion at low energies, an effect whichcould explain the puzzling apparent extra source power as well as the flat orinverted spectra from distant flaring sources.

1208.5251	the typical mass ratio and typical final spin in supermassive black hole  mergers	we prove that merging supermassive black holes (smbhs) typically have neitherequal masses, nor is their mass ratio too extreme. the majority of such mergersfall into the mass ratio range of 1:30 to 1:3, implying a spin flip during theinspiral. we also present a simple expression for the final spin $\chi_{f}$ ofthe emerging smbh, as function of the mass ratio, initial spin magnitudes, andorientation of the spins with respect to the orbital plane and each other. thisformula approximates well more cumbersome expressions obtained from the fitwith numerical simulations. by integrating over all equally likely orientationsfor precessing mergers we determine a lower approximant to the final spindistribution as function of the mass ratio alone. by folding this with thederived mass ratio dependent merger rate we derive a lower bound to the typicalfinal spin value after mergers. we repeat the procedure deriving an upper boundfor the typical spin in the case when the spins are aligned to the orbitalangular momentum, such that there is no precession in the system. both slopesof $\chi_{f}$ as function of the initial spins being smaller than one lead totwo attractors at $\chi_{f}^{prec}=0.2$ and $\chi_{f}^{align}=0.45$,respectively. real mergers, biased toward partial alignment by interactionswith the environment (accretion, host galaxy, etc.) would generate a typicalfinal spin lying between these two limiting values. these are the typicalvalues of the spin after the merger, starting from which the spin can built upby further gaseous accretion.

1403.3804	cosmic backgrounds due to the formation of the first generation of  supermassive black holes	the statistics of black holes and their masses strongly suggests that theirmass distribution has a cutoff towards lower masses near $3 \times 10^{6}$m$_{\odot}$. this is consistent with a classical formation mechanism from theagglomeration of the first massive stars in the universe. however, when themasses of the stars approach $10^{6}$ m$_{\odot}$, the stars become unstableand collapse, possibly forming the first generation of cosmological blackholes. here we speculate that the claimed detection of an isotropic radiobackground may constitute evidence of the formation of these first supermassiveblack holes, since their data are compatible in spectrum and intensity withsynchrotron emission from the remnants. the model proposed fulfills allobservational conditions for the background, in terms of single-sourcestrength, number of sources, far-infrared and gamma-ray emission. the observedhigh energy neutrino flux is consistent with our calculations in flux andspectrum. the proposal described in this paper may also explain the earlyformation and growth of massive bulge-less disk galaxies as derived from themassive, gaseous shell formed during the explosion prior to the formation of asupermassive black hole.

0805.4582	supermassive binary black hole mergers	when galaxies collide, dynamical friction drives their central supermassiveblack holes close enought to each other such that gravitational radiationbecomes the leading dissipative effect. gravitational radiation takes awayenergy, momentum and angular momentum from the compact binary, such that theblack holes finally merge. in the process, the spin of the dominant black holeis reoriented. on observational level, the spins are directly related to thejets, which can be seen at radio frequencies. images of the x-shaped radiogalaxies together with evidence on the age of the jets illustrate that the jetsare reoriented, a phenomenon known as spin-flip. based on the galaxy luminositystatistics we argue here that the typical galaxy encounters involve mass ratiosbetween 1:3 to 1:30 for the central black holes. based on the spin-orbitprecession and gravitational radiation we also argue that for this typical massratio in the inspiral phase of the merger the initially dominant orbitalangular momentum will become smaller than the spin, which will be reoriented.we prove here that the spin-flip phenomenon typically occurs already in theinspiral phase, and as such is describable by post-newtonian techniques.

astro-ph;0106419	binary black holes and tori in agn i. ejection of stars and merging of  the binary	most galaxies have central massive black holes (bh), and merge with othersduring their evolution, as strongly suggested by recent observations.consequently a black hole binary (bhb) emerges. considering the evolution ofthe binary when it has become hard, at a separation of the bhs of about 1 pc,we propose to solve two basic questions in our understanding of the centralactivity of galaxies: (1) do the bhs actually merge? (2) and does the effect ofthe torque of the bhb on the surrounding stellar distribution help to explainthe presence of the ubiquitous torus of molecular material surroundingapparently all active galactic nuclei? while the second question is the topicof a subsequent paper we try to solve the first in this article. simulating theevolution of a stellar cluster in the potential of such a binary by solving theequations of the restricted three body problem, we obtained the followingresults: if the cluster is about as massive as the bhb, the two bhs coalesceafter about 10^7 yr due to ejection of stars with low angular momentum andfinally via emission of gravitational radiation. in a sequence of models wherethe mass of the secondary bh increases while m_1 is fixed, a bigger fraction ofstars is ejected. for a more massive cluster the merger then proceeds onsmaller time scales. the cluster is depleted in the central region and thefinal distribution of stars assumes a torus-like structure, peaking at threetimes the initial distance of the two black holes.

astro-ph;0203359	binary black holes and tori in agn ii. can stellar winds constitute a  dusty torus?	we determine the properties of the stellar torus that we showed in a previouspaper to result as a product of two merging black holes. if the surroundingstellar cluster is as massive as the binary black hole, the torque acting onthe stars ejects a fraction which extracts all the binary's angular momentum onscales of ~10^7 yr, and a geometrically thick torus remains. in the presentarticle we show that a certain fraction of the stars has winds, shaped intoelongated tails by the central radiation pressure, which are optically thickfor line of sights aligned with them. these stars are sufficiently numerous toachieve a covering factor of 1, so that the complete torus is optically thick.we find the parameters of such a patchy torus to be in the right range toexplain the observed large column densities in agn and their temporalvariations on time scales of about a decade. within this model the bal quasarscan be interpreted as quasars seen at intermediate inclination angles, with theline of sight grazing the edge of the torus. the opening angle of the torus iswider for major mergers and thus correlates with the central luminosity. inthis picture the spin of the merged black hole is possibly dominated by theorbital angular momentum of the binary. thus the spin of the merged black holepoints into a new direction, and consequently the jet experiences a spin-flipaccording to the spin-paradigm. this re-orientation could be an explanation forthe x-shaped radio galaxies, and the advancing of a new jet through the ambientmedium for compact symmetric objects.

astro-ph;0205531	ngc4258: a jet-dominated low-luminosity agn?	low-luminosity agns (llagns) are a very important class of sources since theyoccupy a significant fraction of local galaxies. their spectra differsignificantly from the canonical luminous agns, most notably by the absence ofthe ``big blue bump''. in the present paper, taking a typicalllagn--ngc4258--as an example, we investigate the origin of their spectralemission. the observational data of ngc4258 is extremely abundant, includingwater maser emission, putting very strict constraints to its theoreticalmodels. the infrared (ir) spectrum is well described by a steep power-law form$f_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-1.4}$, and may extend to the optical/uv band. up untilnow there is no model which can explain such a steep spectrum, and we herepropose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model for ngc4258. the accretion diskis composed of an inner adaf (or radiatively inefficient accretion flow) and anouter standard thin disk. a shock occurs when the accretion flow is ejected outof the adaf to form the jet near the black hole, accelerating the electronsinto a power-law energy distribution. the synchrotron and self-comptonizedemission from these electrons greatly dominates over the underlying accretiondisk and can well explain the spectrum ranging from ir to x-ray bands. thefurther propagation of the shocked gas in the jet can explain the flat radiospectrum of ngc4258. several predictions of our model are presented for testingagainst future observations, and we briefly discuss the application of themodel to other llagns.

astro-ph;0211216	cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies	we argue that clusters of galaxies have an intergalactic medium, which ispermeated by strong magnetic fields and also has a contribution of pressurefrom cosmic rays. these two components of total pressure are probably highlytime dependent, and range probably between 1/10 of the gas pressure up toequipartition between gas pressure and the sum of the two other components.radio galaxies are likely to provide the main source for both magnetic fieldsand cosmic rays. in this concept it becomes easy to understand the occasionalmismatch between the total mass inferred from the assumption of hydrostaticequilibrium derived purely from gas, and the total mass derived from lensingdata. we also suggest that the structure and topology of the magnetic field maybe highly inhomogeneous - at least over a certain range of scales, and maycontain long twisted filaments of strong magnetic fields, as on the sun. theanalogy with the interstellar medium may be fruitful to explore further, wherewe do not know where magnetic fields come from, but suspect that the cosmicrays derive from supernova explosions. in such an analogy it becomes useful torefer to "radio galaxy explosions" in clusters of galaxies. a full scaleexploration of all the implications, especially of the notion that occasionallycomplete equipartition may be reached, is a task for the future.

astro-ph;0211503	single and binary black holes and their active environment	in this short review we describe some of the latest endeavours to understandthe activity around black holes. first, it has been possible to demonstratethat a large part of the electromagnetic emission observed can be interpretedas arising from the jet; this explains at once all spectral features and theirvariability. second we dwell on the concept that merging galaxies naturallylead to merging black holes. here we emphasize two aspects: a) the torqueexerted by the binary black holes carves a torus like distribution out of thestellar population near to the black hole binary; b) we consider the laststages of the black hole binary merger, taking into account the angle betweenthe spin of the primary black hole, and the orbital spin of the second blackhole. we show that the loss of orbital angular momentum is very stronglyspin-dependent; for large angles between the two spins the angular momentumloss is strongly inhibited, allowing spin flip of the primary black hole whichpreserves a high angular momentum relative to the maximum allowed. this ensuresthat both before and after the merger the accretion disk may reach to verysmall distances from the central black hole, with very high local temperaturesright near the base of the jet: this is especially interesting in the case thatforming the jet requires the formation of an adaf like ring near the inner edgeof the disk, as suggested by some earlier work. it also may have consequencesfor the initial hadronic interactions right near the base of the jet. finally,this may also have important implications for the discovery of gravitationalradiation bursts from the merger of black holes; the spin dependence needs tobe taken into account.

astro-ph;0308059	the origin of x-shaped radio galaxies: clues from the z-symmetric  secondary lobes	existing radio images of a few x-shaped radio galaxies reveal z-symmetricmorphologies in their weaker secondary lobes which cannot be naturallyexplained by either the galactic merger or radio-lobe backflow scenarios, thetwo dominant models for these x-shaped radio sources. we show that the mergerpicture can explain these morphologies provided one takes into account that,prior to the coalescence of their supermassive black holes, the smaller galaxyreleases significant amounts of gas into the ism of the dominant active galaxy.this rotating gas, whose angular momentum axis will typically not be alignedwith the original jets, is likely to provide sufficient ram pressure at adistance ~10 kpc from the nucleus to bend the extant jets emerging from thecentral engine, thus producing a z-symmetry in the pair of radio lobes. oncethe two black holes have coalesced some 10^7 yr later, a rapid reorientation ofthe jets along a direction close to that of the orbital angular momentum of theswallowed galaxy relative to the primary galaxy would create the youngerprimary lobes of the x-shaped radio galaxy. this picture naturally explains whysuch sources typically have powers close to the fr i/ii break. we suggest thatpurely z-symmetric radio sources are often en route to coalescence and theconcomitant emission of substantial gravitational radiation, while x-shapedones have already merged and radiated.

astro-ph;0309810	cosmic rays, stellar evolution, and supernova physics	most cosmic rays are thought to be accelerated by the shocks of supernovaexplosions of very massive stars. here we review one quantitative proposal,which predicted the spectral slopes, bend and cutoff about the cosmic rayspectrum across the spectral bend or "knee" near 3x10^15 ev in 1993. many ofthe specific predictions have now been verified, and so it may be appropiate toinvestigate the consequences of that proposal. the successful fit to the cosmicray data across the knee suggests: 1) very massive stars, above about 20 to 25solar masses all converge to a common final state; 2) the supernova explosionof these very massive stars is caused by a combination of rotation, magneticfields and the gravitational potential, just as proposed by g. bisnovatyi-koganin 1970, based on an earlier suggestion by n.s. kardashev in 1964; 3) theirstellar winds as well as the explosion provide the main injection of magneticfields into the interstellar medium; 4) the explosive energy of thesesupernovae is about 10^52 erg; 5) the explosion is extremely anisotropic, whichmay unify several classes of observed supernova types; 6) gamma ray bursts maybe the ultimate version of such an explosion in the case the collapse leads toa black hole; 7)it is plausible that the luminosity of the supernova integratedover all aspect angles is also the same for all these massive star explosions,leading to 8) a possibly very bright standard candle, if we could just find acorrection for the extreme asphericity. this may solve the problem of what themechanism of supernova explosions is for very massive stars, where most cosmicrays and magnetic fields come from, and may also point the way to a unifyingscheme for supernova explosions and gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0401463	brightness suppression of relativistic radio jets of quasars: the role  of the lower electron energy cut-off	although the possibility of a low energy cut-off (lec) of the relativisticelectron population (e_{min} ~ 0.1 gev) in the different components of radiogalaxies has been discussed in the literature, from both theoretical andobservational viewpoints, its possible role in causing a distinct spectralflattening, and thus reducing the apparent brightness temperature of the radionucleus, has thus far not been explicitly discussed. here we point out thatsuch an effect may in fact be quite significant for the parsec-scale,superluminal emission regions associated with the inner radio jets. this isbecause the observed frequency of the spectral turnover arising from the lecincreases linearly with the bulk doppler factor (\delta) of the jet flow,whereas the frequency of synchrotron self-absorption (the well known cause ofspectral flattening and turnover at low frequencies) shows a mild decrease as\delta rises. for an observationally relevant range of source parameters, weinvestigate here the role of the lec. we argue that some statistical trendsrevealed by the recent vlbi surveys can in fact be understood in terms ofeffects arising from lec, including the faster superluminal motion found in thevlbi surveys at higher frequencies, and the apparent inability of most radiocores to even attain the brightness temperatures consistent with theequipartition condition. we also point out some possible implications of thelec for x-ray observations of the kiloparsec scale relativistic jets ofquasars.

astro-ph;0403511	fast growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies	we report on a calculation of the growth of the mass of supermassive blackholes at galactic centers from dark matter and eddington - limited baryonicaccretion. assuming that dark matter halos are made of fermions and harborcompact degenerate fermi balls of masses from $10^{3}m_{\odot}$ to$10^{6}m_{\odot}$, we find that dark matter accretion can boost the mass ofseed black holes from about $\sim 5m_{\odot}$ to $10^{3-4}m_{\odot}$ blackholes, which then grow by eddington - limited baryonic accretion tosupermassive black holes of $10^{6 - 9}m_{\odot}$. we then show that theformation of the recently detected supermassive black hole of $3\times10^{9}m_{\odot}$ at a redshift of $z = 6.41$ in the quasar sdssj114816.64+525150.3 could be understood if the black hole completely consumesthe degenerate fermi ball and then grows by eddington - limited baryonicaccretion. in the context of this model we constrain the dark matter particlemasses to be within the range from 12 ${\rm kev/c}^{2}$ to about 450 ${\rmkev/c}^{2}$. finally we investigate the black hole growth dependence on theformation time of the seed bh and on the mass of the seed bh. we find that inorder to fit the observed data point of $m_{bh} \sim 3 \times 10^{9}m_{\odot}$and $z \sim 6.41$, dark matter accretion cannot start later than about $2\times 10^{8}$ years and the seed bh cannot be greater than about$10^{4}m_{\odot}$. our results are in full agreement with the wmap observationsthat indicate that the first onset of star formation might have occurred at aredshift of $z \sim 15 - 20$. for other models of dark matter particle masses,corresponding constraints may be derived from the growth of black holes in thecenter of galaxies.

astro-ph;9303013	cosmic rays, iii. the cr spectrum between 1 gev and 10^4 gev and the  radio emission from supernova remnants	we develop a theory to account for the cosmic ray spectrum between 1 gev and10^4 gev following the earlier papers of this series. we use the basic conceptthat the cosmic ray particles are accelerated in a supernova shock that travelsthrough the interstellar medium. physically important ingredients besides thepresence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabaticcooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, hereassumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. the resultis a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yieldsa spectrum of e^-2.42. interstellar turbulence with a kolmogorov spectrum thenleads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is e^-2.75, asobserved. we argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons isdetermined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation ofelectron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities. sincethe highest particle energy reached derives from geometrical arguments, itdepends on the charge of the nucleus and so higher z elements are predicted toreach higher energies.

astro-ph;9308009	our galactic center: a laboratory for the feeding of agns?	we demonstrate that our galactic center, despite little evidence for thepresence of a currently active nucleus, provides insight into the feeding ofagn: the observed velocity field of molecular clouds can be interpreted astracing out the spiralling inwards of gas in a large accretion flow towards thegalactic center (linden et al. 1993, biermann et al. 1993) in the radialdistance range from a few parsec to a few hundred pc. the required effectiveviscosity corresponds well to the observed turbulent velocities andcharacteristic length scales. the implied mass influx provides indeed all thematerial needed to maintain the presently observed star formation rate atdistances closer than about $100$ pc. we argue that the energy input fromsupernova explosions due to the high rate of star formation can feed theturbulence of the interstellar medium. this then keeps the effective viscosityhigh as required to feed the star formation. we suggest that this process leadsto limit cycles in star formation, and as a consequence also to limit cycles inthe feeding of any activity at the very center.

astro-ph;9411100	the jet-disk symbiosis. ii. interpreting the radio/uv correlations in  quasars	we investigate the correlation between the accretion disk (uv) luminosity andthe radio core emission of a quasar sample. in a radio/$l_{\rm disk}$ plot wefind the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars(cdq), lobe dominated quasars (ldq), radio-intermediate quasars (riq) and radioweak quasars. in general the radio core emission scales with the diskluminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. this shows that radio and uvemission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loudand radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. we investigate thepossibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission inradio loud and radio weak quasars. comparing our data with a simple jetemission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation ina coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry atotal power $q_{\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity$l_{\rm disk}$. for the electron population one is forced to postulate anefficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electronswith a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 mev -- secondary pairproduction in hadronic cascades could be such a process. the bulk lorentzfactor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\la\gamma_{\rm j}\la10$)).the radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the sameparameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, assuggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. there is evidence that riq are therelativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. we can estimatethe hidden disk luminosity of fr ii galaxies and find that this is consistentwith frii being misdirected quasars.

astro-ph;9411106	unified schemes for active galaxies: a clue from the missing  fanaroff-riley type i quasar population	we link the lack of fr i type structure among quasars to the void of radioloud quasars below a critical disk luminosity of ~10^46 erg/sec in the pgsample. we argue that the opening angle of the obscuring torus in radio loudquasars depends on the power of the central engine, approaching the jet'sbeaming angle near the fr i/fr ii break. consequently, low power radio quasarswould either be classified as radio galaxies (fr i) or strongly core-boosted(bl lac) object, depending on the aspect angle, and no conspicuous transitionalpopulation would be expected for fr i sources. a closing torus with decreasingpower would not only obscure the optical nucleus for most aspect angles butwould also enhance the entrainment of the cool torus material into the jetstream, causing obscuration along the jet's periphery, as well as the jet'sdeceleration to form a fr i source. above a critical luminosity, the widertorus allows for fr ii type jets and visibility of the nuclear opticalemission, characteristic of radio loud quasars. apparently, at the same enginepower the torus opening in radio weak quasars and seyferts is substantiallywider than in radio loud quasars, probably because of different dynamics orfeeding mechanisms in disk and elliptical galaxies. this provides a clue forthe radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy of quasars if the the jet/torusinteraction leads to injection of relativistic e^+/- pairs via p-p collisions.strong jet/torus interaction may lead to a substantial injection of secondarypairs and collimation in radio loud quasars, while weak interaction in radioweak quasars leads neither to pair injection nor to good collimation.

astro-ph;9506138	galactic jet sources and the agn connection	in order to further test our hypothesis that jets and disk around compactaccreting objects are symbiotic features we investigate the newly discoveredsuperluminal galactic radio jets grs 1915+105 and gro j1655-40 and the twofamous galactic radio jets 1e1740-2942 and ss 433 within the framework of ourcouple jet/disk model developed initially for active galactic nuclei (agn) andthe galactic center source sgr a*. by comparing the ``disk'' and radio coreluminosity of those galactic jet sources with our model prediction we can showthat they can easily be understood as agn-like jets where the accretion poweronto a central compact object is scaled down by several orders of magnitude.the total power of the jets must be comparable to the disk luminosity - atleast for the superluminal sources. to broaden our view we also shortly discussthe situation in other galactic flat spectrum radio source associated withcompact objects -- the x-ray binaries cyg x-1, cyg x-2, cyg x-3 and sco x-1 --where a jet origin has been proposed earlier on theoretical grounds. in andisk/radio luminosity their radio cores also fall within our model predictionfor scaled down radio loud and radio weak agn-jets. taking all sources togetherand comparing their l_disk/radio ratio we find an indication for a similarradio loud/radio weak dichotomy as found earlier for quasar radio cores,however, a larger number of galactic jet sources is needed to confirm thistrend.

astro-ph;9512048	rosat pspc observations of six pg quasars and phl 1657	we report results from the spectral analysis of pointed rosat pspcobservations of six pg quasars and the weak-bump quasar phl 1657. disregardingother frequency bands, the pspc data are represented best by simple power-lawsource spectra ($dn/de \propto e^\gamma$) with a slope $\gamma = -2.5\pm 0.4$and do not show evidence for a more complex structure. however, within thelimits given by statistics and systematical errors, a superposition of twopower-law spectra, which allows a connection to the observed uv fluxes and tothe generally flatter hard-x-ray spectra observed by exosat and ginga, is foundto be indistinguishable from a simple power-law in the pspc energy band. forthe pg quasars, a direct connection to the observed uv flux is obtained with asteep soft-x-ray slope $\gamma_{sx}= -3.1\pm 0.3$, fixing the hard-x-ray slope.for phl 1657, the soft-x-ray spectrum seen by rosat is much steeper than theginga spectrum, rising towards the euv in $\nu f_\nu$, and it can not beextrapolated down to meet the exceptionally weak uv flux. a wien-shaped thermaluv/soft-x-ray bump with a temperature of $\sim $50\,ev connects the uv andsoft-x-ray spectra in all cases, but gives only a poor representation of thehigh signal-to-noise pspc spectra. we discuss implications of our results formodels of the x-ray emission in quasars.

astro-ph;9512092	the missing x-rays in sgr a*: evidence for - not against - a  supermassive black hole	we present a simple argument that the missing x-ray flux from the galacticcenter source sgr~a* ist not evidence {\it against} -- as claimed by goldwurmet al. 1994 -- but rather indirect evidence {\it for} the presence of asupermassive black hole. the radio spectrum provides a strict {\it lower} limitfor the size of sgr~a* ($r&gt;3\cdot 10^{11}$cm). a more compact source would becompletely synchrotron self-absorbed. this size is $10^6$ times larger than astellar-mass black hole, yet the bolometric radio luminosity is comparable toor even larger than the x-ray luminosity where matter accreting onto a {\itstellar-mass} black hole would inevitably radiate the {\it bulk} of itsluminosity. hence, either the bulk of the accretion power is radiated in the uv(where the limits are higher), or the accretion has to stop at the radio-scaleto avoid producing x-rays brighter than the radio emission. both would be anatural consequence of a supermasive black hole with $\sim10^6m_{\sun}$.

astro-ph;9608071	contributions to the cosmic ray flux above the ankle: clusters of  galaxies	motivated by the suggestion of kang, ryu \&amp; jones (1996) that particles canbe accelerated to high energies via diffusive shock acceleration process at theaccretion shocks formed by the infalling flow toward the clusters of galaxies,we have calculated the expected particle flux from a cosmological ensemble ofclusters. we use the observed temperature distribution of local clusters andassume a simple power-law evolutionary model for the comoving density of theclusters. the shock parameters such as the shock radius and velocity arededuced from the icm temperature using the self-similar solutions for secondaryinfall onto the clusters. the magnetic field strength is assume to be inequipartition with the postshock thermal energy behind the accretion shock. wealso assume that the injected energy spectrum is a power-law with theexponential cutoff at the maximum energy which is calculated from the conditionthat the energy gain rate for diffusive shock acceleration is balanced by theloss rate due to the interactions with the cosmic background radiation. incontrast to the earlier paper we have adopted here the description of thecosmic ray diffusion by jokipii (1987) which leads to considerably higherparticle energies. finally the injected particle spectrum at the clusters isintegrated over the cosmological distance to earth by considering the energyloss due to the interactions with the cosmic background radiation. ourcalculations show that the expected spectrum of high-energy protons from thecosmological ensemble of the cluster accretion shocks could match well theobserved cosmic ray spectrum near $10^{19}$ev with reasonable parameters andmodels if about $10^{-4}$ of the infalling kinetic energy can be injected intothe intergalactic space as the high energy particles.

astro-ph;9609110	cosmic ray interactions and the abundances of the chemical elements	our galaxy is the largest nuclear interaction experiment which we know,because of the interaction between cosmic ray particles and the interstellarmaterial. cosmic rays are particles, which have been accelerated in the galaxyor in extragalactic space. cosmic rays come as protons, electrons, heaviernuclei, and their antiparticles. up to energies up to some tens of tev ofparticle energy it is possible to derive chemical abundances of cosmic rays. ithas been proposed that cosmic ray particles can be attributed to three mainsites of origin and acceleration, a) supernova shocks in the interstellarmedium, b) supernova shocks in a stellar wind of the predecessor star, and c)powerful radio galaxies. this proposal leads to quantitative tests, which areencouraging sofar. quantitative models for transport and interaction appear tobe consistent with the data. li, be, b are secondary in cosmic rays, as aremany of the odd-z elements, as well as the sub-fe elements. at very lowenergies, cosmic ray particles are subject to ionization losses, which producea steep low energy cutoff; all particles below the cutoff are moved into thethermal material population, and the particles above it remain as cosmic rays.this then changes the chemical abundances in the interstellar medium, and is adominant process for many isotopes of li, be, b. with a quantitative theory forthe origin of cosmic rays proposed, it appears worthwhile to search for yetbetter spallation cross sections, especially near threshold. with such animproved set of cross sections, the theory of the interstellar medium and itschemical abundances, both in thermal and in energetic particles, could be takena large step forward.

astro-ph;9709232	limits on magnetic fields and relativistic electrons in the coma cluster  from multifrequency observations	relativistic electrons, seen in the large diffuse radio halo of the comacluster of galaxies, should scatter background photons to higher energies. wecalculate the inverse compton contributions from the microwave background, fromthe local radiation field of elliptical galaxies and from the thermal x-rayemission of the intra cluster medium to the different observed energy bands,and draw restrictions to the shape of the spectrum of the relativistic electronpopulation. the expected electron spectra in different halo formation modelsare discussed, and signatures for a future distinction of these models arepresented, tracing the injection processes and the influence of opticalthickness of the radio halo for very low frequency emission due to synchrotronself absorption. some of the upper limits on the electron spectrum translateinto lower limits of the halo magnetic fields, since the observed synchrotronradiation is known. despite uncertainties in the extrapolation of the radiospectrum to lower frequencies a lower limit to the central field strength ofb_o &gt; 0.3 mug seems to be sure. this is comparable to the value resulting fromminimal energy arguments. if b_o &lt; 1.2 mug, the recently reported extremeultraviolet excess of coma (lieu et al. 1996) could result from inverse comptonscattered microwave photons. formulae for transrelativistic thomson scatteringare given in the appendix.

astro-ph;9709250	the supergalactic structure and the origin of the highest energy cosmic  rays	the recent discoveries of several reliable events of high energy cosmic raysat an energy above 10^20 ev raise questions about their path through the nearbyuniverse. the two analyses of the haverah park data set and the akeno data setappear to have an inconsistent pattern. both data sets showed some measure of acorrelation with the supergalactic plane, the locus of cosmologically nearbygalaxies, radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies. we need a reasonable modelof the true intergalactic magnetic field. using recent cosmological simulationsof structure formation in the universe, we estimate the magnetic fields whichcorrespond to the upper limits in the rotation measure to distant radiosources. we estimate that the magnetic field strength in supergalactic sheetsand filaments may be in the range of 0.1 to 1 mug. if such strengths arerealized inside our local supercluster, this opens up the possibility to focuscharged particles in the direction perpendicular to the supergalatic plane,analoguously but in the opposite direction to solar wind modulation. iffocusing exists, it means that for all particles captured into the sheets, thedilution with distance d is 1/d instead of 1/d^2. this means in effect, that wemay see sources to much larger distances than expected sofar. this effect isrelevant only for energies for which the possible distances are smaller thanthe void scale of the cosmological galaxy distribution, in the range possiblyup to 100 mpc.

astro-ph;9709252	cosmic structure of magnetic fields	the simulations of the formation of cosmological structure allows todetermine the spatial inhomogeneity of cosmic magnetic fields. suchsimulations, however, do not give an absolute number for the strength of themagnetic field due to insufficient spatial resolution. combining thesesimulations with observations of the rotation measure to distant radio sourcesallows then to deduce upper limits for the strength of the magnetic field.these upper limits are of order 0.2 - 2 mug along the filaments and sheets ofthe galaxy distribution. in one case, the sheet outside the coma cluster, thereis a definitive estimate of the strength of the magnetic field consistent withthis range. such estimates are almost three orders of magnitude higher thanhitherto assumed usually. high energy cosmic ray particles can be eitherfocussed or strongly scattered in such magnetic filaments and sheets, dependingon the initial transverse momentum. the cosmological background in radio andx-ray wavelengths will have contributions from these intergalactic filamentsand sheets, should the magnetic fields really be as high as 0.2 - 2 mug.

astro-ph;9712293	cluster radio relics as a tracer of shock waves of the large-scale  structure formation	we present evidence for the existence of shock waves caused by the formationof the large-scale structure. in some clusters of galaxies peripherally locatedsources of extended diffuse radio emission exist, the so-called cluster radiorelics. they have steep radio spectra but no apparent cutoff, as old remnantsof radio galaxies usually have. therefore particle acceleration has to takeplace within them. we propose that shock structures of the cosmologicallarge-scale matter flows are responsible for the acceleration of relativisticelectrons: cluster accretion shocks and bow shocks of merger events. we developa theory of radio plasma having traversed these shocks and compare it toobservational data of nine radio relics (0038-096, 0917+75, 1140+203, 1253+275,1712+64, 1706+78, 2006-56, 2010-57, 1401-33) and their host clusters (a85,a786, a1367, coma, a2255, a2256, a3667, s753). the necessary accretion power,the spectral index of the radio spectrum, the acceleration efficiency of theshock, the diffusion coefficient in the post-shock region, and the predictedradio polarization in all of our examples fit into a coherent interpretation ofthe observational data. since polarization measurements are available only forfour sources, the predictions of our theory can be independently checked usingother examples. the predicted values of the shock compression ratio, densityand temperature of the infalling gas, magnetic field strength of the shockedand unshocked radio plasma are discussed within the frame of structureformation theory.

astro-ph;9801316	a possible mechanism for the mass ratio limitation in early type  galaxies	there is an interesting correlation between the central objects and theirhost galaxies in recent high resolution hst photometry of early type galaxiesand near-ir images of nearby quasar hosts. it has been shown that a) the hostsof these very luminous quasars are likely to be early type galaxies and that b)the mass ratio of central black holes (bhs) and their host spheroidalcomponents ($m_{bh}/m_{spheroid}$) is $\sim 0.002$ within a factor of three.using the hierarchical galaxy evolution scheme for the formation of early-typegalaxies, we present here a general viscous accretion disk model to trace thestar formation and central engine evolution before and after mergers. in ourmodel, starbursts and agn coexist; these two activities compete for the gassupply, interact with each other, probably feed back on each other and lockinto a final status. they thus constrain the ratio of central black hole massand its host spheroidal mass to a universal value of order $10^{-3}$.

astro-ph;9803275	cosmic magnetic fields in large scale filaments and sheets	we consider the possibility that cosmic magnetic field, instead of beinguniformly distributed, is strongly correlated with the large scale structure ofthe universe. then, the observed rotational measure of extra-galactic radiosources would be caused mostly by the clumpy magnetic field in cosmologicalfilaments/sheets rather than by a uniform magnetic field, which was oftenassumed in previous studies. as a model for the inhomogeneity of thecosmological magnetic field, we adopt a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation,where the field is passively included, and can approximately represent the realfield distribution with an arbitrary normalization for the field strength.then, we derive an upper limit of the magnetic field strength by comparing theobserved limit of rotational measure with the rotational measure expected fromthe magnetic field geometry in the simulated model universe. the resultingupper limit to the magnetic field in filaments and sheets is ${\bar b}_{fs} \la1 \mu g$ which is $\sim10^3$ times higher than the previously quoted values.this value is close to, but larger than, the equipartition magnetic fieldstrength in filaments and sheets. the amplification mechanism of the magneticfield to the above strength is uncertain. the implications of such a strengthof the cosmic magnetic field are discussed.

astro-ph;9808139	non-thermal origin of the euv and hex excess emission of the coma  cluster - the nature of the energetic electrons	the excess in extreme-ultraviolet (euv) radiation and high energy x-rays(hex) of coma may be modeled by power law spectra. their origin could beinverse compton (ic) emission by relativistic electrons. the scattered photonfields can either be the cmb or the starlight of the galaxies within thecluster. if the euv excess is due to cmb-ic, a strongly inhomogeneousmagnetized intra- cluster medium (icm) is required, in which the density of therelativistic electrons is anticorrelated with the magnetic fields. this couldbe understood if the electrons were accelerated during a major merger eventwithin the last 2 gyr and cooled afterwards in the inhomogeneous fields. if theeuv excess is due to starlight-ic, a population of relativistic, very lowenergy electrons has to be present, with a high energy density. in order tosurvive coulomb losses, these electrons have to be separated from the clustergas by confining magnetic fields. this could be remnant radio plasma from theepoch of violent quasar activity. the observed narrow radial profile of the euvexcess emission is due to the narrow photon distribution for this model. bothmodels favor very inhomogeneous magnetic field and relativistic electrondistributions. ic models for the hex excess seem to be implausible: cmb-icleads to a mainly unmagnetized icm, in contradiction to faraday rotationmeasurements. starlight scattering electrons would overproduce euv photons dueto simultaneously cmb-ic. we propose that the observed hex excess is due tobremsstrahlung of a small high energy power-law tail of the mainly thermal icmelectron distribution. such a tail is expected due to in-situ acceleration byturbulence.

astro-ph;9810226	the jet/disk symbiosis iii. what the radio cores in grs 1915+105, ngc  4258, m81, and sgr a tell us about accreting black holes	we have derived simplified equations for a freely expanding, pressure drivenjet model as a function of jet power and applied it successfully to the radiocores in the black hole candidates grs 1915+105, ngc 4258, and m81 which areobservationally well defined systems, and to sgr a*. by using equipartitionassumptions, the model has virtually no free parameters and can explain allsources by just scaling the jet power. in grs 1915+105 it also naturallyexplains the jet velocity and the radio time delay. the jet powers we derivefor the radio cores of the first three sources are comparable to theiraccretion disk luminosities, providing further evidence for the existence ofsymbiotic jet/disk systems and a common engine mechanism also in low-luminosityagn and stellar mass black holes. with the exception of sgr a* an advectiondominated accretion flow (adaf) does not seem to be necessary to explain any ofthe radio cores which span a large range in luminosity and size, as well as inblack hole masses and accretion rate---from eddington to extreme sub-eddington.we suggest, however, that the jet model can be used to derive minimum accretionrates and thus find that sgr a* seems to be truly radiatively deficient---evenin a starved black hole model---and that a combination of jet and adaf modelmay be one possible solution.

astro-ph;9811361	cosmic rays in the galactic center region	egret data on the gamma ray emission from the inner galaxy have shown arather flat spectrum, extending to about 50 gev. it is usually assumed thatthese gamma-rays arise from the interactions of cosmic ray nuclei with ambientmatter. cosmic ray particles have been observed up to 3 10^20 ev, with manyarguments suggesting, that up to about 3 10^18 ev they are of galactic origin.cosmic ray particles get injected by supernova explosions. their injectedspectrum is steepened by diffusive losses from the galaxy to yield the observedspectrum. as cosmic ray particles roam around in the galactic disk, theyencounter molecular clouds and through p-p collisions produce gamma rays frompion decay. the flux and spectrum of these gamma rays is then a clear signatureof cosmic rays throughout the galaxy. star formation activity peaks in thecentral region of the galaxy, around the galactic center. looking then at thegamma ray spectrum of the central region of our galaxy yields clues as to wherethe cosmic ray particles interact, and with what spectrum. using the flukamonte-carlo, we have modelled this spectrum, and find a best fit for a powerlawspectral index of 2.34, rather close to the suggested injection spectrum forsupernovae which explode into their own winds. this suggests that most cosmicray interaction happens near the sources of injection; this is consistent withthe spectrum of cosmic ray nuclei derived from spallation. one consequence isthat cosmic ray heating and ionization should be strong in the galactic centerregion.

astro-ph;9903036	a jet-disk symbiosis model for gamma ray bursts: ss 433 the next?	we consider a jet-disk symbiosis model to explain gamma ray bursts and theirafterglows. it is proposed that grbs develop in a pre-existing jet. we considera binary system formed by a neutron star and an o/b/wr companion in which theenergy of the grb is due to the accretion-induced collapse of the neutron starto a black hole. the high speed in the energy flow in agn-jets is generallybelieved to be initiated by strong magnetic field coupling to the accretiondisk of the black hole. we use the same mechanism here. we assume that in thistransition a large amount of energy is anisotropically released as poyntingflux along the polar axis. one may think of this process as a violent and rapidtwist. this energy release naturally initiates an ultrarelativistic shock wavein the pre-existing jet. the emission microphysics are as in fireball models.our model has only two parameters overall, the energy in the shock along thejet, and the fraction of this energy in energetic electrons and positrons. thesystem ss433 appears to have the properties required for a grb precursor in ourmodel. we show that our model can explain the initial gamma ray burstenergetics, the spectrum and temporal behaviour of the afterglows, the lowbaryon load, and do all this with a modest energy budget.

astro-ph;9912019	a jet-disk symbiosis model for gamma ray bursts: fluence distribution,  crs and $\nu$'s	we consider a jet-disk symbiosis model to explain gamma ray bursts and theirafterglows. it is proposed that grbs are created inside a pre-existing jet froma neutron star in a binary system which collapses to a black hole due toaccretion. in our model we assume that a fraction of the initial energy due tothis transition is deposited in the jet by magnetic fields. the observedemission is then due to an ultrarelativistic shock wave propagating along thejet. good agreement with observational data can be obtained for systems such asthe galactic jet source ss433. specifically, we are able to reproduce thetypical observed afterglow emission flux, its spectrum as a function of time,and the fluence distribution of the corrected data for the 4b batse catalogue.we also studied the relation between the cosmological evolution of our modeland the cosmic ray energy distribution. we used the star formation rate (sfr)as a function of redshift to obtain the distribution in fluences of grbs in ourmodel. the fluence in the gamma ray band has been used to calculate the energyin cosmic rays both in our galaxy and at extragalactic distances. this energyinput has been compared with the galactic and extragalactic spectrum of cosmicrays and neutrinos. we found that in the context of our model it is notpossible to have any contribution from grbs to either the extragalactic or thegalactic cosmic ray spectra.

0810.3140	no observational constraints from hypothetical collisions of  hypothetical dark halo primordial black holes with galactic objects	it was suggested by several authors that hypothetical primordial black holes(pbhs) may contribute to the dark matter in our galaxy. there are strongconstraints based on the hawking evaporation that practically exclude pbhs withmasses m~1e15-1e16g and smaller as significant contributors to the galacticdark matter. similarly, pbhs with masses greater than about 1e26g arepractically excluded by the gravitational lensing observation. the mass rangebetween 10e16g&lt;m&lt;10e26g is unconstrained. in this paper, we examine possibleobservational signatures in the unexplored mass range, investigatinghypothetical collisions of pbhs with main sequence stars, red giants, whitedwarfs, and neutron stars in our galaxy. this has previously been discussed aspossibly leading to an observable photon eruption due to shock productionduring the encounter. we find that such collisions are either too rare to beobserved (if the pbh masses are typically larger than about 1e20g), or producetoo little power to be detected (if the masses are smaller than about 1e20g).

0812.2710	new limits on sterile neutrinos from suzaku observations of the ursa  minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present results of our search for x-ray line emission associated with theradiative decay of the sterile neutrino, a well-motivated dark mattercandidate, in suzaku observatory spectra of the ursa minor dwarf spheroidalgalaxy. these data represent the first deep observation of one of these extrememass-to-light systems and the first dedicated dark matter search using an x-raytelescope. no such emission line is positively detected, and we place newconstraints on the combination of the sterile neutrino mass and theactive-sterile neutrino oscillation mixing angle. line flux upper limits arederived using a maximum-likelihood-based approach that, along with the lack ofintrinsic x-ray emission, enables us to minimize systematics and account forthose that remain. the limits we derive match or approach the best previousresults over the entire 1--20 kev mass range from a single suzaku observation.these are used to place constraints on the existence of sterile neutrinos withgiven parameters in the general case and in the case where they are assumed toconstitute all of the dark matter. the range allowed implies that sterileneutrinos remain a viable candidate to make up some -- or all -- of the darkmatter and also explain pulsar kicks and various other astrophysical phenomena.
