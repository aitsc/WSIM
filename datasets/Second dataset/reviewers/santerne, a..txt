1004.0790	observation of the full 12-hour-long transit of the exoplanet hd80606b.  warm-spitzer photometry and sophie spectroscopy	we present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanethd80606b. using the spitzer space telescope and its irac camera on thepost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation ofhd80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 january 2010. we complement thisphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneouslyperformed with sophie at haute-provence observatory. this provides radialvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previouslyuncovered with spectroscopy. this new data set allows the parameters of thissingular planetary system to be significantly refined. we obtained aplanet-to-star radius ratio r_p/r_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lowerthan the one measured from previous ground observations. we detected a featurein the spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. we also found atransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; thiscould be caused by actual ttvs due to an additional body in the system or byunderestimated systematic uncertainties. the sky-projected angle between thespin-axis of hd80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found tobe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the rossiter-mclaughlinanomaly. this allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitivelyrejected. over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, afew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two differentevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if theyexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. as in the caseof hd80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet aretilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario formassive planets in comparison with jupiter-mass planets.

1110.2256	higher-precision radial velocity measurements with the sophie  spectrograph using octagonal-section fibers	high-precision spectrographs play a key role in exoplanet searches using theradial velocity technique. but at the accuracy level of 1 m.s-1, required forsuper-earth characterization, stability of fiber-fed spectrograph performanceis crucial considering variable observing conditions such as seeing, guidingand centering errors and, telescope vignetting. in fiber-fed spectrographs suchas harps or sophie, the fiber link scrambling properties are one of the mainissues. both the stability of the fiber near-field uniformity at thespectrograph entrance and of the far-field illumination on the echelle grating(pupil) are critical for high-precision radial velocity measurements due to thespectrograph geometrical field and aperture aberrations. we conducted tests onthe sophie spectrograph at the 1.93-m ohp telescope to measure the instrumentsensitivity to the fiber link light feeding conditions: star decentering,telescope vignetting by the dome,and defocussing.  to significantly improve on current precision, we designed a fiber linkmodification considering the spectrograph operational constraints. we havedeveloped a new link which includes a piece of octagonal-section fiber, havinggood scrambling properties, lying inside the former circular-section fiber, andwe tested the concept on a bench to characterize near-field and far-fieldscrambling properties.  this modification has been implemented in spring 2011 on the sophiespectrograph fibers and tested for the first time directly on the sky todemonstrate the gain compared to the previous fiber link. scientific validationfor exoplanet search and characterization has been conducted by observingstandard stars.

1211.3045	wasp-71b: a bloated hot jupiter in a 2.9-day, prograde orbit around an  evolved f8 star	we report the discovery by the wasp transit survey of a highly-irradiated,massive (2.242 +/- 0.080 mjup) planet which transits a bright (v = 10.6),evolved f8 star every 2.9 days. the planet, wasp-71b, is larger than jupiter(1.46 +/- 0.13 rjup), but less dense (0.71 +/- 0.16 {\rho}jup). we also reportspectroscopic observations made during transit with the coralie spectrograph,which allow us to make a highly-significant detection of therossiter-mclaughlin effect. we determine the sky-projected angle between thestellar-spin and planetary-orbit axes to be {\lambda} = 20.1 +/- 9.7 degrees,i.e. the system is 'aligned', according to the widely-used alignment criteriathat systems are regarded as misaligned only when {\lambda} is measured to begreater than 10 degrees with 3-{\sigma} confidence. wasp-71, with an effectivetemperature of 6059 +/- 98 k, therefore fits the previously observed patternthat only stars hotter than 6250 k are host to planets in misaligned orbits. weemphasise, however, that {\lambda} is merely the sky-projected obliquity angle;we are unable to determine whether the stellar-spin and planetary-orbit axesare misaligned along the line-of-sight. with a mass of 1.56 +/- 0.07 msun,wasp-71 was previously hotter than 6250 k, and therefore might have beensignificantly misaligned in the past. if so, the planetary orbit has beenrealigned, presumably through tidal interactions with the cooling star'sgrowing convective zone.

1301.3760	transit timing variations in wasp-10b induced by stellar activity?	the hot-jupiter wasp-10b was reported by maciejewski et al. (2011a,b) to showtransit timing variations (ttv) with an amplitude of ~ 3.5 minutes. theseauthors proposed that the observed ttvs were caused by a 0.1 mjup perturbingcompanion with an orbital period of ~ 5.23 d, and hence, close to the outer 5:3mean motion resonance with wasp-10b. to test this scenario, we present eightnew transit light curves of wasp-10b obtained with the faulkes telescope northand the liverpool telescope. the new light curves, together with 22 previouslypublished ones, were modelled with a markov-chain monte-carlo transit fittingcode. (...)  our homogeneously derived transit times do not support the previous claimedttv signal, which was strongly dependent on 2 previously published transitsthat have been incorrectly normalised. nevertheless, a linear ephemeris is nota statistically good fit to the transit times of wasp-10b. we show that theobserved transit time variations are due to spot occultation features orsystematics. we discuss and exemplify the effects of occultation spot featuresin the measured transit times and show that despite spot occultation duringegress and ingress being difficult to distinguish in the transit light curves,they have a significant effect in the measured transit times. we conclude thatif we account for spot features, the transit times of wasp-10 are consistentwith a linear ephemeris with the exception of one transit (epoch 143) which isa partial transit. therefore, there is currently no evidence for the existenceof a companion to wasp-10b. our results support the lack of ttvs ofhot-jupiters reported for the kepler sample.

1401.1122	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission xxv. corot-27b: a  massive and dense planet on a short-period orbit	we report the discovery of a massive and dense transiting planet corot-27b ona 3.58 day orbit around a 4.2 gyr-old g2 star. the planet candidate wasidentified from the corot photometry, and was confirmed as a planet withground-based spectroscopy.  the confirmation of the planet candidate is based on radial velocityobservations combined with imaging to rule out blends. the characterisation ofthe planet and its host star is carried out using a bayesian approach where allthe data (corot photometry, radial velocities, and spectroscopiccharacterisation of the star) are used jointly. the bayesian analysis includesa study whether the assumption of white normally distributed noise holds forthe corot photometry, and whether the use of a non-normal noise distributionoffers advantages in parameter estimation and model selection.  corot-27b has a mass of $10.39 \pm 0.55$ $\mathrm{m}_{\rm jup}$, a radius of$1.01 \pm 0.04$ $\mathrm{r}_{\rm jup}$, a mean density of$12.6_{-1.67}^{+1.92}$ $\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$, and an effective temperature of$1500 \pm 130$ k. the planet orbits around its host star, a 4.2 gyr-old g2-starwith a mass $m_{\star}=1.06$ $m_{\odot}$, and a radius $r_{\star}=1.05$$r_{\odot}$, on a $0.048 \pm 0.007$ au orbit every 3.58 days. the radialvelocity observations allow us to exclude highly eccentric orbits, namely,$e&lt;0.065$ with a 99% confidence. given its high mass and density, theoreticalmodelling of corot-27b is demanding. we identify two solutions with heavyelement mass fractions of $0.11\pm0.08$ $\mathrm{m_{\oplus}}$ and $0.07\pm0.06$$\mathrm{m_{\oplus}}$, but even solutions void of heavy elements cannot beexcluded.  we carry out a secondary eclipse search from the corot photometry using amethod based on bayesian model selection, but conclude that the noise level istoo high to detect eclipses shallower than 9% of the transit depth.

1407.0181	impact of micro-telluric lines on precise radial velocities and its  correction	context: in the near future, new instruments such as espresso will arrive,allowing us to reach a precision in radial-velocity measurements on the orderof 10 cm/s. at this level of precision, several noise sources that until nowhave been outweighed by photon noise will start to contribute significantly tothe error budget. the telluric lines that are not neglected by the masks forthe radial velocity computation, here called micro-telluric lines, are one suchnoise source. aims: in this work we investigate the impact of micro-telluriclines in the radial velocities calculations. we also investigate how to correctthe effect of these atmospheric lines on radial velocities. methods: the workpresented here follows two parallel lines. first, we calculated the impact ofthe micro-telluric lines by multiplying a synthetic solar-like stellar spectrumby synthetic atmospheric spectra and evaluated the effect created by thepresence of the telluric lines. then, we divided harps spectra by syntheticatmospheric spectra to correct for its presence on real data and calculated theradial velocity on the corrected spectra. when doing so, one considers twoatmospheric models for the synthetic atmospheric spectra: the lblrtm and tapas.results: we find that the micro-telluric lines can induce an impact on theradial velocities calculation that can already be close to the currentprecision achieved with harps, and so its effect should not be neglected,especially for future instruments such as espresso. moreover, we find that themicro-telluric lines' impact depends on factors, such as the radial velocity ofthe star, airmass, relative humidity, and the barycentric earth radial velocityprojected along the line of sight at the time of the observation.

1407.1044	planets and stellar activity: hide and seek in the corot-7 system	since the discovery of the transiting super-earth corot-7b, severalinvestigations have yielded different results for the number and masses ofplanets present in the system, mainly owing to the star's high level ofactivity. we re-observed corot-7 in january 2012 with both harps and corot, sothat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometricdata. this allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's lightcurve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression ofconvective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. to account foractivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have aphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in theradial-velocity model, which we treat as a gaussian process with the samecovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the lightcurve. our model was incorporated into a monte carlo markov chain in order tomake a precise determination of the orbits of corot-7b and corot-7c. we measurethe masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 mearth and 13.56 +/- 1.08mearth, respectively. the density of corot-7b is (6.61 +/- 1.72)(rp/1.58rearth)^(-3) g.cm^(-3), which is compatible with a rocky composition. we searchfor evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with aperiod close to 9 days. we are not able to confirm the existence of a planetwith this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellarrotation at around 7.9 days. using bayesian model selection we find that amodel with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.

1407.2066	impact of occultations of stellar active regions on transmission  spectra: can occultation of a plage mimic the signature of a blue sky?	transmission spectroscopy during planetary transits, which is based on themeasurements of the variations of planet-to-star radius ratio as a function ofwavelength, is a powerful technique to study the atmospheric properties oftransiting planets. one of the main limitation of this technique is the effectsof stellar activity, which up until now, have been taken into account only byassessing the effect of non-occulted stellar spots on the estimates ofplanet-to-star radius ratio. in this paper, we study, for the first time, theimpact of the occultation of a stellar spot and plage on the transmissionspectra of transiting exoplanets. we simulated this effect by generating alarge number of transit light curves for different transiting planets, stellarspectral types, and for different wavelengths. results of our simulationsindicate that the anomalies inside the transit light curve can lead to asignificant underestimation or overestimation of the planet-to-star radiusratio as a function of wavelength. at short wavelengths, the effect can reachto a difference of up to 10% in the planet-to-star radius ratio, mimicking thesignature of light scattering in the planetary atmosphere. atmosphericscattering has been proposed to interpret the increasing slopes of transmissionspectra toward blue for exoplanets hd 189733b and gj 3470b. here we show thatthese signatures can be alternatively interpreted by the occultation of stellarplages. results also suggest that the best strategy to identify and quantifythe effects of stellar activities on the transmission spectrum of a planet isto perform several observations during the transit epoch at the samewavelength. this will allow for identifying the possible variations in transitdepth as a function of time due to stellar activity variability.

1409.8554	characterization of the four new transiting planets koi-188b, koi-195b,  koi-192b, and koi-830b	the characterization of four new transiting extrasolar planets is presentedhere. koi-188b and koi-195b are bloated hot saturns, with orbital periods of3.8 and 3.2 days, and masses of 0.25 and 0.34 m_jup. they are located in thelow-mass range of known transiting, giant planets. koi-192b has a similar mass(0.29 m_jup) but a longer orbital period of 10.3 days. this places it in adomain where only a few planets are known. koi-830b, finally, with a mass of1.27 m_jup and a period of 3.5 days, is a typical hot jupiter. the four planetshave radii of 0.98, 1.09, 1.2, and 1.08 r_jup, respectively. we detected nosignificant eccentricity in any of the systems, while the accuracy of our datadoes not rule out possible moderate eccentricities. the four objects were firstidentified by the kepler team as promising candidates from the photometry ofthe kepler satellite. we establish here their planetary nature thanks to theradial velocity follow-up we secured with the harps-n spectrograph at thetelescopio nazionale galileo. the combined analyses of the datasets allow us tofully characterize the four planetary systems. these new objects increase thenumber of well-characterized exoplanets for statistics, and provide new targetsfor individual follow-up studies. the pre-screening we performed with thesophie spectrograph at the observatoire de haute-provence as part of that studyalso allowed us to conclude that a fifth candidate, koi-219.01, is not a planetbut is instead a false positive.

1506.02019	the first radial velocity measurements of a microlensing event: no  evidence for the predicted binary	the gravitational microlensing technique allows the discovery of exoplanetsaround stars distributed in the disk of the galaxy towards the bulge. however,the alignment of two stars that led to the discovery is unique over thetimescale of a human life and cannot be re-observed. moreover, the target hostis often very faint and located in a crowded region. these difficulties hamperand often make impossible the follow-up of the target and study of its possiblecompanions. gould et al. (2013) predicted the radial-velocity curve of a binarysystem, ogle-2011-blg-0417, discovered and characterised from a microlensingevent by shin et al. (2012). we used the uves spectrograph mounted at the vlt,eso to derive precise radial-velocity measurements of ogle-2011-blg-0417. togather high-precision on faint targets of microlensing events, we proposed touse the source star as a reference to measure the lens radial velocities. weobtained ten radial velocities on the putative v=18 lens with a dispersion of~100 m/s, spread over one year. our measurements do not confirm themicrolensing prediction for this binary system. the most likely scenario isthat the assumed v=18 mag lens is actually a blend and not the primary lensthat is 2 magnitude fainter. further observations and analyses are needed tounderstand the microlensing observation and infer on the nature andcharacteristics of the lens itself.
