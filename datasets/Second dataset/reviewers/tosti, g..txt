0901.1284	swift observations of ibl and lbl objects	bl lacs are an enigmatic class of active galactic nuclei (agns),characterized by the non-thermal continuum typically attributed to synchrotronand inverse compton emission. depending on the frequency location of the maximaof these components, they are subdivided into three subclasses lbls, ibls, andhbls. we present the results of a set of observations of eight bl lac objectsof lbl and ibl type performed by the xrt and uvot detectors onboard the swiftsatellite between january 2005 and november 2006. we are mainly interested inmeasuring the spectral parameters, and particularly the steepness between theuv and the x-ray band, useful for determining the classification of thesesources. we compare the behavior of these sources with previous xmm-newton,bepposax obser- vations and with historical data in the x-ray and in theoptical band. we are also interested in classifying the sources in our sampleon the basis of the observations and comparing them with their classificationpresented in literature. we performed x-ray spectral analysis of observed bllac objects using a simple powerlaw and in a few cases the log-parabolic model.we also combined the uv emission with the low energy x-ray data to we usedobservational data to classify sources in our sample and derived parameters oftheir spectral energy distribution. we found that for the ibls x-rays lowstates show features of the high energy component, usually interpreted as dueto inverse compton emission. sources in our sample exhibit a range of temporaluv and x-ray behaviors, some objects having clear and neat correlated uv andx-ray variations (e.g. on231) and other objects showing no clear (e.g. ao0235+164) uv and x-ray correlation. finally, we also note that our estimates ofspectral curvature are in the range of that measured for the hbls.

0901.4124	swift observations of the very intense flaring activity of mrk 421  during 2006: i. phenomenological picture of electron acceleration and  predictions for the mev/gev emission	we present results from a deep spectral analysis of all the swiftobservations of mrk 421 from april 2006 to july 2006, when it reached itslargest x-ray flux recorded until 2006. the peak flux was about 85 milli-crabin the 2.0-10.0 kev band, with the peak energy (ep) of the spectral energydistribution (sed) laying often at energies larger than 10 kev. we performedspectral analysis of the swift observations investigating the trends of thespectral parameters in terms of acceleration and energetic featuresphenomenologically linked to the ssc model parameters, predicting their effectsin the gamma-ray band, in particular the spectral shape expected in the fermigamma-ray space telescope-lat band. we confirm that the x-ray spectrum is welldescribed by a log-parabolic distribution close to ep, with the peak flux ofthe sed (sp) being correlated with ep, and ep anti-correlated with thecurvature parameter (b). during the most energetic flares the uv-to-soft-x-rayspectral shape requires an electron distribution spectral index s about 2.3.present analysis shows that the uv-to-x-ray emission from mrk 421 is likely tobe originated by a population of electrons that is actually curved, with a lowenergy power-law tail. the observed spectral curvature is consistent both withstochastic acceleration or energy dependent acceleration probabilitymechanisms, whereas the power-law slope form xrt-uvot data is very close tothat inferred from the grbs x-ray afterglow and in agreement with the universalfirst-order relativistic shock acceleration models. this scenario hints thatthe magnetic turbulence may play a twofold role: spatial diffusion relevant tothe first order process and momentum diffusion relevant to the second orderprocess.

1004.2352	gamma-ray spectral evolution of ngc1275 observed with fermi-lat	we report on a detailed investigation of the high-energy gamma-ray emissionfrom ngc\,1275, a well-known radio galaxy hosted by a giant elliptical locatedat the center of the nearby perseus cluster. with the increased photonstatistics, the center of the gamma-ray emitting region is now measured to beseparated by only 0.46' from the nucleus of ngc1275, well within the 95%confidence error circle with radius ~1.5'. early fermi-lat observationsrevealed a significant decade-timescale brightening of ngc1275 at gev photonenergies, with a flux about seven times higher than the one implied by theupper limit from previous egret observations. with the accumulation of one-yearof fermi-lat all-sky-survey exposure, we now detect flux and spectralvariations of this source on month timescales, as reported in this paper. theaverage &gt;100 mev gamma-ray spectrum of ngc1275 shows a possible deviation froma simple power-law shape, indicating a spectral cut-off around an observedphoton energy of e = 42.2+-19.6 gev, with an average flux of f = (2.31+-0.13) x10^{-7} ph/cm^2/s and a power-law photon index, gamma = 2.13+-0.02. the largestgamma-ray flaring event was observed in april--may 2009 and was accompanied bysignificant spectral variability above e &gt; 1-2 gev. the gamma-ray activity ofngc1275 during this flare can be described by a hysteresis behavior in the fluxversus photon index plane. the highest energy photon associated with thegamma-ray source was detected at the very end of the observation, with theobserved energy of e = 67.4gev and an angular separation of about 2.4' from thenucleus. in this paper we present the details of the fermi-lat data analysis,and briefly discuss the implications of the observed gamma-ray spectralevolution of ngc1275 in the context of gamma-ray blazar sources in general.

1005.1569	the sooner: a large robotic telescope	the approach of observational astronomy is mainly aimed at the constructionof larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelengthcoverage. certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completelyfulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes(bh), neutron stars (ns) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.recently, mainly through the vela, beppo-sax and swift satellites, we reached areasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the universe and of some ofthe processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (bh). weplan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics ofvery fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extremecompact objects. the innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) thedesign (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotictelescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the uniquefeatures: "no telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengthsobservations (photometry, spectroscopy o\&amp; polarimetry); 3) high timeresolution observations. the conceptual design of the telescope and relatedinstrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: high frequencya-periodic variability, polarization, high z grbs, short grbs, grb-supernovaeassociation, multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersionspectroscopy. this experiment will turn the "exception" (like the opticalobservations of grb 080319b) to "routine".

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1107.3370	broad line radio galaxies observed with fermi-lat: the origin of the gev  gamma-ray emission	we report on a detailed investigation of the gamma-ray emission from 18 broadline radio galaxies (blrgs) based on two years of fermi large area telescope(lat) data. we confirm the previously reported detections of 3c 120 and 3c 111in the gev photon energy range; a detailed look at the temporal characteristicsof the observed gamma-ray emission reveals in addition possible fluxvariability in both sources. no statistically significant gamma-ray detectionof the other blrgs was however found in the considered dataset. though thesample size studied is small, what appears to differentiate 3c 111 and 3c 120from the blrgs not yet detected in gamma-rays is the particularly strongnuclear radio flux. this finding, together with the indications of thegamma-ray flux variability and a number of other arguments presented, indicatethat the gev emission of blrgs is most likely dominated by the beamed radiationof relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles. in this paper wealso analyzed a comparison sample of high accretion-rate seyfert 1 galaxies,which can be considered radio-quiet counterparts of blrgs, and found none weredetected in gamma-rays. a simple phenomenological hybrid model applied for thebroad-band emission of the discussed radio-loud and radio-quiet type 1 activegalaxies suggests that the relative contribution of the nuclear jets to theaccreting matter is &gt; 1 percent on average for blrgs, whilst &lt;0.1 percent forseyfert 1 galaxies.

1203.0568	infrared colors of the gamma-ray detected blazars	blazars constitute the most enigmatic class of extragalactic gamma-raysources, and their observational features have been ascribed to a relativisticjet closely aligned to the line of sight. they are generally divided in twomain classes: the bl lac objects (bl lacs) and the flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). in the case of bl lacs the double bumped spectral energy distribution(sed) is generally described by the synchrotron self compton (ssc) emission,while for the fsrqs it is interpreted as due to external compton (ec) emission.recently, we showed that in the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] micron color- color diagramthe blazar population covers a distinct region (i.e., the wise blazar strip,wbs), clearly separated from the other extragalactic sources that are dominatedby thermal emission. in this paper we investigate the relation between theinfrared and gamma-ray emission for a subset of confirmed blazars from theliterature, associated with fermi sources, for which wise archival observationsare available. this sample is a proper subset of the sample of sources usedpreviously, and the availability of fermi data is critical to constrain themodels on the emission mechanisms for the blazars. we found that the selectedblazars also lie on the wise blazar strip covering a narrower region of theinfrared color-color planes than the overall blazars population. we then foundan evident correlation between the ir and gamma-ray spectral indices expectedin the ssc and ec frameworks. finally, we determined the ratio between theirgamma-ray and infrared fluxes, a surrogate of the ratio of powers between theinverse compton and the synchrotron sed components, and used such parameter totest different emitting scenarios blazars.

1203.1330	the wise gamma-ray strip parametrization: the nature of the gamma-ray  active galactic nuclei of uncertain type	despite the large number of discoveries made recently by fermi, the originsof the so called unidentified gamma-ray sources remain unknown. the largenumber of these sources suggests that among them there could be a populationthat significantly contributes to the isotropic gamma-ray background and istherefore crucial to understand their nature. the first step toward a completecomprehension of the unidentified gamma-ray source population is to identifythose that can be associated with blazars, the most numerous class ofextragalactic sources in the gamma-ray sky. recently, we discovered thatblazars can be recognized and separated from other extragalactic sources usingthe infrared (ir) wise satellite colors. the blazar population delineates aremarkable and distinctive region of the ir color-color space, the wise blazarstrip. in particular, the subregion delineated by the gamma-ray emittingblazars is even narrower and we named it as the wise gamma-ray strip (wgs). inthis paper we parametrize the wgs on the basis of a single parameter s that wethen use to determine if gamma-ray active galactic nuclei of the uncertain type(agus) detected by fermi are consistent with the wgs and so can be consideredblazar candidates. we find that 54 agus out of a set 60 analyzed have ir colorsconsistent with the wgs; only 6 agus are outliers. this result implies that avery high percentage (i.e., in this sample about 90%) of the agus detected byfermi are indeed blazar candidates.

1203.3801	unidentifed gamma-ray sources: hunting gamma-ray blazars	one of the main scientific objectives of the ongoing fermi mission isunveiling the nature of the unidentified gamma-ray sources (ugss). despite thelarge improvements of fermi in the localization of gamma-ray sources withrespect to the past gamma-ray missions, about one third of the fermi-detectedobjects are still not associated to low energy counterparts. recently, usingthe wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) survey, we discovered thatblazars, the rarest class of active galactic nuclei and the largest populationof gamma-ray sources, can be recognized and separated from other extragalacticsources on the basis of their infrared (ir) colors. based on this result, wedesigned an association method for the gamma-ray sources to reognize if thereis a blazar candidate within the positional uncertainty region of a genericgamma-ray source. with this new ir diagnostic tool, we searched for gamma-rayblazar candidates associated to the ugs sample of the second fermi gamma-raycatalog (2fgl). we found that our method associates at least one gamma-rayblazar candidate as a counterpart each of 156 out of 313 ugss analyzed. thesenew low-energy candidates have the same ir properties as the blazars associatedto gamma-ray sources in the 2fgl catalog.

1203.4230	searching for gamma-ray blazar candidates among the unidentified  integral sources	the identification of low-energy counterparts for gamma-ray sources is one ofthe biggest challenge in modern gamma-ray astronomy. recently, we developed andsuccessfully applied a new association method to recognize gamma-ray blazarcandidates that could be possible counterparts for the unidentified gamma-raysources above 100 mev in the second fermi large area telescope (lat) catalog(2fgl). this method is based on the infrared (ir) colors of the recentwide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) all-sky survey. in this letter weapplied our new association method to the case of unidentified integral sources(uiss) listed in the fourth soft gamma-ray source catalog (4ic). only 86 uissout of the 113 can be analyzed, due to the sky coverage of the wise preliminarydata release. among these 86 uiss, we found that 18 appear to have a gamma-rayblazar candidate within their positional error region. finally, we analyzed theswift archival data available for 10 out these 18 gamma-ray blazar candidates,and we found that 7 out of 10 are clearly detected in soft x-rays and/or in theoptical-ultraviolet band. we cannot confirm the associations between the uissand the selected gamma-ray blazar candidates due to the discrepancies betweenthe integral and the soft x-ray spectra. however, the discovery of the softx-ray counterparts for the selected gamma-ray blazar candidates adds animportant clue to help understand their origin and to confirm their blazarnature.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1305.2025	minimal spanning tree algorithm for gamma-ray source detection in sparse  photon images: cluster parameters and selection strategies	the minimal spanning tree (mst) algorithm is a graph-theoreticalcluster-finding method. we previously applied it to gamma-ray bidimensionalimages, showing that it is quite sensitive in finding faint sources. possiblesources are associated with the regions where the photon arrival directionsclusterize. mst selects clusters starting from a particular "tree" connectingall the point of the image and performing a cut based on the angular distancebetween photons, with a number of events higher than a given threshold. in thispaper, we show how a further filtering, based on some parameters linked to thecluster properties, can be applied to reduce spurious detections. we find thatthe most efficient parameter for this secondary selection is the magnitude m ofa cluster, defined as the product of its number of events by its clusteringdegree. we test the sensitivity of the method by means of simulated and realfermi-large area telescope (lat) fields. our results show that sqrt(m) isstrongly correlated with other statistical significance parameters, derivedfrom a wavelet based algorithm and maximum likelihood (ml) analysis, and thatit can be used as a good estimator of statistical significance of mstdetections. we apply the method to a 2-year lat image at energies higher than 3gev, and we show the presence of new clusters, likely associated with bl lacobjects.

0801.4029	simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the blazar 1es1959+650 at a  low tev flux	we present the results from a multiwavelength campaign on the tev blazar 1es1959+650, performed in may, 2006. data from the optical, uv, soft- andhard-x-ray and very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray (e &gt; 100 gev) bands wereobtained with the suzaku and swift satellites, with the magic telescope andother ground based facilities. the source spectral energy distribution (sed),derived from suzaku and magic observations at the end of may 2006, shows theusual double hump shape, with the synchrotron peak at a higher flux level thanthe compton peak. with respect to historical values, during our campaign thesource exhibited a relatively high state in x-rays and optical, while in thevhe band it was at one of the lowest level so far recorded. we also monitoredthe source for flux-spectral variability on a time window of 10 days in theoptical-uv and x-ray bands and 7 days in the vhe band. the source varies morein the x-ray, than in the optical band, with the 2-10 kev x-ray flux varying bya factor of ~2. the synchrotron peak is located in the x-ray band and moves tohigher energies as the source gets brighter, with the x-ray fluxes above itvarying more rapidly than the x-ray fluxes at lower energies. the variabilitybehaviour observed in the x-ray band cannot be produced by emitting regionsvarying independently, and suggests instead some sort of ``standing shock''scenario. the overall sed is well represented by an homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron inverse compton emission model, from which we derive physicalparameters that are typical of high energy peaked blazars.

1410.3696	the spectrum of isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 100 mev and  820 gev	the {\gamma}-ray sky can be decomposed into individually detected sources,diffuse emission attributed to the interactions of galactic cosmic rays withgas and radiation fields, and a residual all-sky emission component commonlycalled the isotropic diffuse {\gamma}-ray background (igrb). the igrb comprisesall extragalactic emissions too faint or too diffuse to be resolved in a givensurvey, as well as any residual galactic foregrounds that are approximatelyisotropic. the first igrb measurement with the large area telescope (lat) onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fermi) used 10 months of sky-surveydata and considered an energy range between 200 mev and 100 gev. improvementsin event selection and characterization of cosmic-ray backgrounds, betterunderstanding of the diffuse galactic emission, and a longer data accumulationof 50 months, allow for a refinement and extension of the igrb measurement withthe lat, now covering the energy range from 100 mev to 820 gev. the igrbspectrum shows a significant high-energy cutoff feature, and can be welldescribed over nearly four decades in energy by a power law with exponentialcutoff having a spectral index of $2.32\pm0.02$ and a break energy of$(279\pm52)$ gev using our baseline diffuse galactic emission model. the totalintensity attributed to the igrb is $(7.2\pm0.6) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ above 100 mev, with an additional $+15$%/$-30$% systematicuncertainty due to the galactic diffuse foregrounds.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

astro-ph;0002255	multiwavelength observations of mkn 501 during the 1997 high state	during the observation period 1997, the nearby blazar mkn 501 showedextremely strong emission and high variability. we examine multiwavelengthaspects of this event using radio, optical, soft and hard x-ray and tev data.we concentrate on the medium-timescale variability of the broadband spectra,averaged over weekly intervals.  we confirm the previously found correlation between soft and hard x-rayemission and the emission at tev energies, while the source shows only minorvariability at radio and optical wavelengths. the non-linear correlationbetween hard x-ray and tev fluxes is consistent with a simple analytic estimatebased on an ssc model in which klein-nishina effects are important for thehighest-energy electrons in the jet, and flux variations are caused byvariations of the electron density and/or the spectral index of the electroninjection spectrum.  the time-averaged spectra are fitted with a synchrotron self-compton (ssc)dominated leptonic jet model, using the full klein-nishina cross section andfollowing the self-consistent evolution of relativistic particles along thejet, accounting for gamma-gamma absorption and pair production within thesource as well as due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation. thecontribution from external inverse-compton scattering is tightly constrained bythe low maximum egret flux and found to be negligible at tev energies. we findthat high levels of the x-ray and tev fluxes can be explained by a hardening ofthe energy spectra of electrons injected at the base of the jet, in remarkablecontrast to the trend found for gamma-ray flares of the flat-spectrum radioquasar pks 0528+134.

astro-ph;0302518	optical and radio behaviour of the bl lacertae object 0716+714	eight optical and four radio observatories have been intensively monitoringthe bl lac object 0716+714 in the last years: 4854 data points have beencollected in the ubvri bands since 1994, while radio light curves extend backto 1978. many of these data are presented here for the first time. thelong-term trend shown by the optical light curves seems to vary with acharacteristic time scale of about 3.3 years, while a longer period of 5.5-6years seems to characterize the radio long-term variations. in general, opticalcolour indices are only weakly correlated with brightness. the radio fluxbehaviour at different frequencies is similar, but the flux variation amplitudedecreases with increasing wavelength. the radio spectral index varies withbrightness (harder when brighter), but the radio fluxes seem to be the sum oftwo different-spectrum contributions: a steady base level and a harder-spectrumvariable component. once the base level is removed, the radio variations appearas essentially achromatic, similarly to the optical behaviour. flux variationsat the higher radio frequencies lead the lower-frequency ones with week-monthtime scales. the behaviour of the optical and radio light curves is quitedifferent, the broad radio outbursts not corresponding in time to the fasteroptical ones and the cross-correlation analysis indicating only weakcorrelation with long time lags. however, minor radio flux enhancementssimultaneous with the major optical flares can be recognized, which may implythat the mechanism producing the strong flux increases in the optical band alsomarginally affects the radio one.

astro-ph;0511673	log-parabolic spectra and particle acceleration in blazars. iii: ssc  emission in the tev band from mkn 501	curved broad-band spectral distributions of non-thermal sources like blazarsare described well by a log-parabolic (lp) law where the second degree termmeasures the curvature. lp energy spectra can be obtained for relativisticelectrons by means of a statistical acceleration mechanism whose probability ofacceleration depends on energy. in this paper we compute the spectra radiatedby an electron population via synchrotron (s) and synchro-self compton(ssc)processes to derive the relations between the lp parameters. these spectra wereobtained by means of an accurate numerical code. we found that the ratiobetween the curvature parameters of the s spectrum to that of the electrons isequal to about 0.2 instead of 0.25, the value foreseen in the deltaapproximation. inverse compton spectra are also intrinsically curved and can beapproximated by a log-parabola only in limited ranges. the curvature parameter,estimated around the sed peak, may vary from a lower value than that of the sspectrum up to that of emitting electrons depending on whether the scatteringis in the thomson or in the klein-nishina regime. we applied this analysis tocomputing the ssc emission from the bl lac object mkn 501 during the largeflare of april 1997. we fit simultaneous bepposax and cat data and reproducedintensities and spectral curvatures of both components with good accuracy. thelarge curvature observed in the tev range was found to be mainly intrinsic, andtherefore did not require a large pair production absorption against theextragalactic background. we regard this finding as an indication that theuniverse is more transparent at these energies than previously assumed byseveral models found in the literature. this conclusion is supported by recentdetection of two relatively high redshift blazars with h.e.s.s.

astro-ph;9912055	the concave x-ray spectrum of the blazar on 231: the signature of  intermediate bl lac objects	on 231 was observed with bepposax in may and june 1998, following anexceptional optical outburst which occured in april--may. we measured the x-rayspectrum from 0.1 up to 100 kev. in both occasions the spectrum had a concaveshape, with a break detected at about 4 and 2.5 kev, respectively. we interpretthe steeper component at energies below the break as due to synchrotronemission and the extremely flat component at energies above the break as due toinverse compton emission. this is so far the best example in which both thesynchrotron and the inverse compton component are detected simultaneously andwith the same instruments in the x-ray spectrum of a blazar. we detect adecrease of the x-ray flux of about 30% below the break between the first andthe second observation, and smaller variability amplitude between 4 and 10 kev.during the may observation we also detected a fast variability event with theflux below 4 kev increasing by about a factor of three in 5 hours. above 4 kevno variability was detected. we discuss these results in the framework ofsynchrotron self-compton models.

0810.2189	agile observation of a gamma-ray flare from the blazar 3c 279	context. we report the detection by the agile satellite of an intensegamma-ray flare from the gamma-ray source 3eg j1255-0549, associated to theflat spectrum radio quasar 3c 279, during the agile pointings towards the virgoregion on 2007 july 9-13.  aims. the simultaneous optical, x-ray and gamma-ray covering allows us tostudy the spectral energy distribution (sed) and the theoretical modelsrelative to the flaring episode of mid-july.  methods. agile observed the source during its science performanceverification phase with its two co-aligned imagers: the gamma- ray imagingdetector (grid) and the hard x-ray imager (super-agile) sensitive in the 30 mev- 50 gev and 18 - 60 kev respectively. during the agile observation the sourcewas monitored simultaneously in optical band by the rem telescope and in thex-ray band by the swift satellite through 4 too observations.  results. during 2007 july 9-13 july 2007, agile-grid detected gamma-rayemission from 3c 279, with the source at ~2 deg from the center of the field ofview, with an average flux of (210+-38) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for energy above100 mev. no emission was detected by super-agile, with a 3-sigma upper limit of10 mcrab. during the observation lasted about 4 days no significative gamma-rayflux variation was observed.  conclusions. the spectral energy distribution is modelled with a homogeneousone-zone synchrotron self compton emission plus the contributions by externalcompton scattering of direct disk radiation and, to a lesser extent, byexternal compton scattering of photons from the broad line region.

0704.0958	simultaneous swift and rem monitoring of the blazar pks0537-441 in 2005	the blazar pks0537-441 has been observed by swift between the end of 2004 andnovember 2005. the bat monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 ms, and thexrt and uvot pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it oneof the agns best monitored by swift. the automatic optical and infraredtelescope rem has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. injanuary-february 2005 pks0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in opticaland x-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in x-rays and about a factor 60brighter in the optical than observed in december 2004. the july 2005observation recorded a fainter x-ray state. the simultaneous optical state,monitored by both swift uvot and rem, is high, and in the vri bands it iscomparable to what was recorded in early january 2005, before the outburst. innovember 2005, the source subsided both in x-rays and optical to a quiescentstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to thejanuary-february 2005 outburst, respectively. our monitoring shows an overallwell correlated optical and x-ray decay. on the shorter time scales (days orhours), there is no obvious correlation between x-ray and optical variations,but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed onmonthly time scales. the widely different amplitude of the long termvariability in optical and x-rays is very unusual and makes this observation aunique case study for blazar activity. the spectral energy distributions areinterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse compton mechanisms within ajet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation dependson the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.
