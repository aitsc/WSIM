1005.1783	a herschel study of yso evolutionary stages and formation timelines in  two fields of the hi-gal survey	we present a first study of the star-forming compact dust condensationsrevealed by herschel in the two 2 \times 2 \degr galactic plane fields centeredat [l;b] = [30\degr; 0 \degr] and [l;b] = [59\degr; 0 \degr], respectively, andobserved during the science demonstration phase for the herschel infraredgalactic plane survey (hi-gal) key-project. compact source catalogs extractedfor the two fields in the five hi-gal bands (70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m)were merged based on simple criteria of positional association and spectralenergy distribution (sed) consistency into a final catalog which contains onlycoherent seds with counterparts in at least three adjacent herschel bands.these final source lists contain 528 entries for the l = 30\degr field, and 444entries for the l = 59\degr field. the sed coverage has been augmented withancillary data at 24 $\mu$m and 1.1 mm. sed modeling for the subset of 318 and101 sources (in the two fields, respectively) for which the distance is knownwas carried out using both a structured star/disk/envelope radiative transfermodel and a simple isothermal grey-body. global parameters like mass,luminosity, temperature and dust properties have been estimated. the lbol/menvratio spans four orders of magnitudes from values compatible with thepre-protostellar phase to embedded massive zero-age main sequence stars.sources in the l = 59\degr field have on average lower l/m, possibly outliningan overall earlier evolutionary stage with respect to the sources in the l =30\degr field. many of these cores are actively forming high-mass stars,although the estimated core surface densities appear to be an order ofmagnitude below the 1 g cm$^{-2}$ critical threshold for high-mass starformation.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1008.2513	the methanol lines and hot core of omc2-fir4, an intermediate-mass  protostar, with herschel-hifi	in contrast with numerous studies on the physical and chemical structure oflow- and high-mass protostars, much less is known about their intermediate-masscounterparts, a class of objects that could help to elucidate the mechanisms ofstar formation on both ends of the mass range. we present the first resultsfrom a rich hifi spectral dataset on an intermediate-mass protostar, omc2-fir4,obtained in the chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions) keyprogramme. the more than 100 methanol lines detected between 554 and 961 ghzcover a range in upper level energy of 40 to 540 k. our physical interpretationfocusses on the hot core, but likely the cold envelope and shocked regions alsoplay a role in reality, because an analysis of the line profiles suggests thepresence of multiple emission components. an upper limit of 10^-6 is placed onthe methanol abundance in the hot core, using a population diagram, large-scalesource model and other considerations. this value is consistent with abundancespreviously seen in low-mass hot cores. furthermore, the highest energy lines atthe highest frequencies display asymmetric profiles, which may arise frominfall around the hot core.

1106.5440	herschel observations of the herbig-haro objects hh52-54	we are aiming at the observational estimation of the relative contribution tothe cooling by co and h2o, as this provides decisive information for theunderstanding of the oxygen chemistry behind interstellar shock waves. methods.the high sensitivity of hifi, in combination with its high spectral resolutioncapability, allows us to trace the h2o outflow wings at unprecedentedsignal-to-noise. from the observation of spectrally resolved h2o and co linesin the hh52-54 system, both from space and from ground, we arrive at thespatial and velocity distribution of the molecular outflow gas. solving thestatistical equilibrium and non-lte radiative transfer equations provides uswith estimates of the physical parameters of this gas, including the coolingrate ratios of the species. the radiative transfer is based on an ali code,where we use the fact that variable shock strengths, distributed along thefront, are naturally implied by a curved surface. based on observations of coand h2o spectral lines, we conclude that the emission is confined to the hh54region. the quantitative analysis of our observations favours a ratio of theco-to-h2o-cooling-rate &gt;&gt; 1. from the best-fit model to the co emission, wearrive at an h2o abundance close to 1e-5. the line profiles exhibit twocomponents, one of which is triangular and another, which is a superposed,additional feature. this additional feature likely originates from a regionsmaller than the beam where the ortho-water abundance is smaller than in thequiescent gas. comparison with recent shock models indicate that a planar shockcan not easily explain the observed line strengths and triangular lineprofiles.we conclude that the geometry can play an important role. althoughabundances support a scenario where j-type shocks are present, higher coolingrate ratios than predicted by these type of shocks are derived.

1202.1413	the herschel view of the on-going star formation in the vela-c molecular  cloud	as part of the herschel guaranteed time key program 'hobys', we present thephotometric survey of the star forming region vela-c, one of the nearest sitesof low-to-high-mass star formation in the galactic plane. vela-c has beenobserved with pacs and spire in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over anarea of about 3 square degrees. a photometric catalogue has been extracted fromthe detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the localbackground. out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. their spectral energydistributions (seds) have been fitted with a modified black body function. weclassify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. for two furthersources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are class0 protostars.  from sed fitting we have derived key physical parameters. protostellarsources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. boththese evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) ofmoderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a morepeaked intensity distribution. moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellarsources may indicate that they will not fragment further. a virial analysis ofthe starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sourcesgravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. we fit a power law n(logm) propm^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.this is in between that typical of co clumps and those of cores in nearbystar-forming regions. we interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of oursample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

1208.4140	the chess survey of the l1157-b1 shock region: co spectral signatures of  jet-driven bowshocks	the unprecedented sensitivity of herschel coupled with the high resolution ofthe hifi spectrometer permits studies of the intensity-velocity relationshipi(v) in molecular outflows, over a higher excitation range than possible up tonow. in the course of the chess key program, we have observed toward the brightbowshock region l1157-b1 the co rotational transitions between j=5-4 andj=16-15 with hifi, and the j=1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 with the iram-30m and the csotelescopes. we find that all the line profiles i_{co}(v) are well fit by alinear combination of three exponential laws exp(-|v/v_0|) with v_0= 12.5, 4.4and 2.5km/s. the first component dominates the co emission at j_up &gt; 13, aswell as the high-excitation lines of sio and h2o. the second componentdominates for 3 &lt; j_up &lt; 10 and the third one for j_up &lt; 2. we show that theseexponentials are the signature of quasi-isothermal shocked gas components: theimpact of the jet against the l1157-b1 bowshock (t= 210k), the walls of theoutflow cavity associated with b1 (t= 64k) and the older cavity l1157-b2 (t=23k), respectively. analysis of the co line flux in the large-velocity gradientapproximation further shows that the emission arises from dense gas (n(h2) &gt;1e5-1e6 cm-3) close to lte up to j=20. we find that the co j=2-1intensity-velocity relation observed in various other molecular outflows issatisfactorily fit by similar exponential laws, which may hold an importantclue to their entrainment process.

1209.0294	h2o line mapping at high spatial and spectral resolution - herschel  observations of the vla1623 outflow	apart from being an important coolant, h2o is known to be a tracer ofhigh-velocity molecular gas. recent models predict relatively high abundancesbehind interstellar shockwaves. the dynamical and physical conditions of theh2o emitting gas, however, are not fully understood yet. we aim to determinethe abundance and distribution of h2o, its kinematics and the physicalconditions of the gas responsible for the h2o emission. the observed lineprofile shapes help us understand the dynamics in molecular outflows. we mappedthe vla1623 outflow, in the ground-state transitions of o-h2o, with the hifiand pacs instruments. we also present observations of higher energy transitionsof o-h2o and p-h2o obtained with hifi and pacs towards selected outflowpositions. from comparison with non-lte radiative transfer calculations, weestimate the physical parameters of the water emitting regions. the observedwater emission line profiles vary over the mapped area. spectral features andcomponents, tracing gas in different excitation conditions, allow us toconstrain the density and temperature of the gas. the h2o emission originatesin a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm h2 gas(t\gtrsim200k). thus, the h2o emission traces a gas component significantlywarmer than the gas responsible for the low-j co emission. the h2o columndensities at the co peak positions are low, i.e. n(h2o) \simeq (0.03-10)x10e14cm-2. the h2o abundance with respect to h2 in the extended outflow is estimatedat x(h2o)&lt;1x10e-6, significantly lower than what would be expected from mostrecent shock models. the h2o emission traces a gas component moving atrelatively high velocity compared to the low-j co emitting gas. however, otherdynamical quantities such as the momentum rate, energy and mechanicalluminosity are estimated to be the same, independent of the molecular tracerused, co or h2o.

1210.7178	mapping water in protostellar outflows with herschel: pacs and hifi  observations of l1448-c	we investigate on the spatial and velocity distribution of h2o along thel1448 outflow, its relationship with other tracers, and its abundancevariations, using maps of the o-h2o 1_{10}-1_{01} and 2_{12}-1_{01} transitionstaken with the herschel-hifi and pacs instruments, respectively. water emissionappears clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along theoutflow. the bulk of the 557 ghz line is confined to radial velocities in therange \pm 10-50 km/s but extended emission associated with the l1448-c extremehigh velocity (ehv) jet is also detected. the h2o 1_{10}-1_{01}/co(3-2) ratioshows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect differentand changing physical conditions in the gas responsible for the emissions fromthe two species. in the ehv jet, a low h2o/sio abundance ratio is inferred,that could indicate molecular formation from dust free gas directly ejectedfrom the proto-stellar wind. we derive averaged tkin and n(h2) values of about300-500 k and 5 10^6 cm-3 respectively, while a water abundance with respect toh2 of the order of 0.5-1 10^{-6} along the outflow is estimated. the fairlyconstant conditions found all along the outflow implies that evolutionaryeffects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role inthe h2o chemistry. the results of our analysis show that the bulk of theobserved h2o lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after beingheated to high temperatures, has been already cooled down to a few hundred k.the relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism todiminish the h2o gas in the post-shock region. among the possible scenarios, wefavor h2o photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low velocitynon-dissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a fuvfield of sufficient strength.

1211.6360	herschel view of the taurus b211/3 filament and striations: evidence of  filamentary growth?	we present first results from the herschel gould belt survey for theb211/l1495 region in the taurus molecular cloud. thanks to their highsensitivity and dynamic range, the herschel images reveal the structure of thedense, star-forming filament b211 with unprecedented detail, along with thepresence of striations perpendicular to the filament and generally orientedalong the magnetic field direction as traced by optical polarization vectors.based on the column density and dust temperature maps derived from the herscheldata, we find that the radial density profile of the b211 filament approaches apower-law behavior {\rho} {\propto} r^(-2.0{\pm}0.4) at large radii and thatthe temperature profile exhibits a marked drop at small radii. the observeddensity and temperature profiles of the b211 filament are in good agreementwith a theoretical model of a cylindrical filament undergoing gravitationalcontraction with a polytropic equation of state: p {\propto} {\rho}^{\gamma}and t {\propto} {\rho}^({\gamma}-1), with {\gamma}=0.97{\pm}0.01&lt;1 (i.e. notstrictly isothermal). the morphology of the column density map, where some ofthe perpendicular striations are apparently connected to the b211 filament,further suggests that the material may be accreting along the striations ontothe main filament. the typical velocities expected for the infalling materialin this picture are ~0.5-1 km/s, which are consistent with the existingkinematical constraints from previous co observations.

1304.4098	first results from the herschel gould belt survey in taurus	the whole of the taurus region (a total area of 52 sq. deg.) has beenobserved by the herschel spire and pacs instruments at wavelengths of 70, 160,250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m as part of the herschel gould belt survey. in thispaper we present the first results from the part of the taurus region thatincludes the barnard 18 and l1536 clouds. a new source-finding routine, thecardiff source-finding algorithm (csar), is introduced, which is loosely basedon clumpfind, but that also generates a structure tree, or dendrogram, whichcan be used to interpret hierarchical clump structure in a complex region.sources were extracted from the data using the hierarchical version of csar andplotted on a mass-size diagram. we found a hierarchy of objects with sizes inthe range 0.024-2.7 pc. previous studies showed that gravitationally boundprestellar cores and unbound starless clumps appeared in different places onthe mass-size diagram. however, it was unclear whether this was due to a lackof instrumental dynamic range or whether they were actually two distinctpopulations. the excellent sensitivity of herschel shows that our sources fillthe gap in the mass-size plane between starless and pre-stellar cores, andgives the first clear supporting observational evidence for the theory thatunbound clumps and (gravitationally bound) prestellar cores are all part of thesame population, and hence presumably part of the same evolutionary sequence(c.f. simpson et al. 2011).

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1403.2426	a herschel and bima study of the sequential star formation near the w48a  hii region	we present the results of herschel hobys photometric mapping combined withbima observations and additional archival data, and perform an in-depth studyof the evolutionary phases of the star-forming clumps in w 48a and theirsurroundings. age estimates for the compact sources were derived frombolometric luminosities and envelope masses, which were obtained from the dustcontinuum emission, and agree within an order of magnitude with age estimatesfrom molecular line and radio data. the clumps in w 48a are linearly aligned byage (east-old to west-young): we find a ultra compact (uc) hii region, a youngstellar object (yso) with class ii methanol maser emission, a yso with amassive outflow, and finally the nh_2d prestellar cores from pillai et al. thisremarkable positioning reflects the (star) formation history of the region. wefind that it is unlikely that the star formation in the w 48a molecular cloudwas triggered by the uchii region and discuss the aquila supershell expansionas a mayor influence on the evolution of w 48a. we conclude that thecombination of herschel continuum data with interferometric molecular line andradio continuum data is important to derive trustworthy age estimates andinterpret the origin of large scale structures through kinematic information.

1404.7142	class 0 protostars in the perseus molecular cloud: a correlation between  the youngest protostars and the dense gas distribution	we use pacs and spire continuum data at 160 um, 250 um, 350 um, and 500 umfrom the herschel gould belt survey to sample seven clumps in perseus: b1,b1-e, b5, ic348, l1448, l1455, and ngc1333. additionally, we identify andcharacterize the embedded class 0 protostars using detections of compactherschel sources at 70 um as well as archival spitzer catalogues and scuba 850um photometric data. we identify 28 candidate class 0 protostars, four of whichare newly discovered sources not identified with spitzer. we find that the starformation efficiency of clumps, as traced by class 0 protostars, correlatesstrongly with the flatness of their respective column density distributions athigh values. this correlation suggests that the fraction of high column densitymaterial in a clump reflects only its youngest protostellar population ratherthan its entire source population. we propose that feedback from either theformation or evolution of protostars changes the local density structure ofclumps.

1409.8111	resolving the shocked gas in hh54 with herschel: co line mapping at high  spatial and spectral resolution	the hh54 shock is a herbig-haro object, located in the nearby chamaeleon iicloud. observed co line profiles are due to a complex distribution in density,temperature, velocity, and geometry. resolving the hh54 shock wave in thefar-infrared cooling lines of co constrain the kinematics, morphology, andphysical conditions of the shocked region. we used the pacs and spireinstruments on board the herschel space observatory to map the full firspectrum in a region covering the hh54 shock wave. complementary herschel-hifi,apex, and spitzer data are used in the analysis as well. the observed featuresin the line profiles are reproduced using a 3d radiative transfer model of abow-shock, constructed with the line modeling engine code (lime). the firemission is confined to the hh54 region and a coherent displacement of thelocation of the emission maximum of co with increasing j is observed. the peakpositions of the high-j co lines are shifted upstream from the lower j co linesand coincide with the position of the spectral feature identified previously inco(10-9) profiles with hifi. this indicates a hotter molecular component in theupstream gas with distinct dynamics. the coherent displacement with increasingj for co is consistent with a scenario where iras12500-7658 is the excitingsource of the flow, and the 180 k bow-shock is accompanied by a hot (800 k)molecular component located upstream from the apex of the shock and blueshiftedby -7 km s$^{-1}$. the spatial proximity of this knot to the peaks of theatomic fine-structure emission lines observed with spitzer and pacs ([oi]63,145 $\mu$m) suggests that it may be associated with the dissociative shock asthe jet impacts slower moving gas in the hh54 bow-shock.

1410.8453	the density structure of the l1157 molecular outflow	we present a multiline cs survey towards the brightest bow-shock b1 in theprototypical chemically active protostellar outflow l1157. we made use of(sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the chemical herschel surveys ofstar forming regions (chess) and astrochemical surveys at iram (asai) keyscience programs. we detected $^{12}$c$^{32}$s, $^{12}$c$^{34}$s,$^{13}$c$^{32}$s, and $^{12}$c$^{33}$s emissions, for a total of 18transitions, with $e_{\rm u}$ up to $\sim$ 180 k. the unprecedented sensitivityof the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealinghigh-velocity emission, up to 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic. theprofiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that areremarkably similar to what previously found using co. these components havebeen related to the cavity walls produced by the $\sim$ 2000 yr b1 shock andthe older ($\sim$ 4000 yr) b2 shock, respectively. the combination of low- andhigh-excitation cs emission was used to properly sample the different physicalcomponents expected in a shocked region. our cs observations show that thismolecule is highlighting the dense, $n_{\rm h_2}$ = 1--5 $\times$ 10$^{5}$cm$^{-3}$, cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in l1157. in addition,the highest excitation (e$_u$ $\geq$ 130 k) cs lines provide us with thesignature of denser (1--5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, associated with amolecular reformation zone of a dissociative j-type shock, which is expected toarise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities. the csfractional abundance increases up to $\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ in all the kinematicalcomponents. this value is consistent with what previously found forprototypical protostars and it is in agreement with the prediction of theabundances obtained via the chemical code astrochem.

1412.8318	astrochemistry at work in the l1157-b1 shock: acetaldehyde formation	the formation of complex organic molecules (coms) in protostellarenvironments is a hotly debated topic. in particular, the relative importanceof the gas phase processes as compared to a direct formation of coms on thedust grain surfaces is so far unknown. we report here the first high-resolutionimages of acetaldehyde (ch$_3$cho) emission towards the chemically richprotostellar shock l1157-b1, obtained at 2 mm with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer. six blueshifted ch$_3$cho lines with $e_{\rm u}$ = 26-35 k havebeen detected. the acetaldehyde spatial distribution follows the young ($\sim$2000 yr) outflow cavity produced by the impact of the jet with the ambientmedium, indicating that this com is closely associated with the region enrichedby iced species evaporated from dust mantles and released into the gas phase. ahigh ch$_3$cho relative abundance, 2-3 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$, is inferred,similarly to what found in hot-corinos. astrochemical modelling indicates thatgas phase reactions can produce the observed quantity of acetaldehyde only if alarge fraction of carbon, of the order of 0.1%, is locked into icedhydrocarbons.

1507.05926	a census of dense cores in the aquila cloud complex: spire/pacs  observations from the herschel gould belt survey	we present and discuss the results of the herschel gould belt surveyobservations in a ~11 deg^2 area of the aquila molecular cloud complex at d~260pc, imaged with the spire/pacs cameras from 70 to 500 micron. we identify acomplete sample of starless dense cores and embedded protostars in this region,and analyze their global properties and spatial distributions. we find a totalof 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellarcores, and they will likely form stars in the future. we also detect 58protostellar cores. the core mass function (cmf) derived for the prestellarcores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (imf),supporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the imfand the cmf. the global shift in mass scale observed between the cmf and theimf is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. bycomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,we estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 myr. we find a strongcorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and thedensest filaments. about 90% of the herschel-identified prestellar cores arelocated above a background column density corresponding to a_v~7, and ~75% ofthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unitlength &gt;~16 m_sun/pc. these findings support a picture wherein the cores makingup the peak of the cmf (and probably responsible for the base of the imf)result primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginallysupercritical filaments. given that filaments appear to dominate the massbudget of dense gas at a_v&gt;7, our findings also suggest that the physics ofprestellar core formation within filaments is responsible for a characteristic"efficiency" sfr/m_dense ~5+-2 x 10^-8 yr^-1 for the star formation process indense gas.

1507.08869	detection of two power-law tails in the probability distribution  functions of massive gmcs	we report the novel detection of complex high-column density tails in theprobability distribution functions (pdfs) for three high-mass star-formingregions (cepob3, monr2, ngc6334), obtained from dust emission observed withherschel. the low column density range can be fit with a lognormaldistribution. a first power-law tail starts above an extinction (av) of ~6-14.it has a slope of alpha=1.3-2 for the rho~r^-alpha profile for an equivalentdensity distribution (spherical or cylindrical geometry), and is thusconsistent with free-fall gravitational collapse. above av~40, 60, and 140, wedetect an excess that can be fitted by a flatter power law tail with alpha&gt;2.it correlates with the central regions of the cloud (ridges/hubs) of size ~1 pcand densities above 10^4 cm^-3. this excess may be caused by physical processesthat slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass towards higher densities.possible are: 1. rotation, which introduces an angular momentum barrier, 2.increasing optical depth and weaker cooling, 3. magnetic fields, 4. geometricaleffects, and 5. protostellar feedback. the excess/second power-law tail isclosely linked to high-mass star-formation though it does not imply a universalcolumn density threshold for the formation of (high-mass) stars.

1509.01819	a possible link between the power spectrum of interstellar filaments and  the origin of the prestellar core mass function	two major features of the prestellar cmf are: 1) a broad peak below 1 msun,presumably corresponding to a mean gravitational fragmentation scale, and 2) acharacteristic power-law slope, very similar to the salpeter slope of thestellar initial mass function (imf) at the high-mass end. while recent herschelobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar cmf is close to thethermal jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of thepower-law tail of the cmf/imf at the high-mass end is less clear. inutsuka(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-lawtail can be understood as resulting from the growth of an initial spectrum ofdensity perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellarturbulence. here, we report the statistical properties of the line-massfluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with herschelusing a 1-d power spectrum analysis. the observed filament power spectra werefitted by a power-law function $(p_{true}(s) \propto s^{\alpha})$ afterremoving the effect of beam convolution at small scales. a gaussian-likedistribution of power-spectrum slopes was found centered at -1.6, close to thatof the one-dimensional velocity power spectrum generated by subsonickolomogorov turbulence (-1.67). an empirical correlation, $p^{0.5}(s_0) \propto&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;^{1.4 \pm 0.1} $, was also found between the amplitude of eachfilament power spectrum $p(s_0)$ and the mean column density along the filament$&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;$. finally, the dispersion of line-mass fluctuations along eachfilament $\sigma_{\rm m_{line}}$ was found to scale with the physical length$l$ of the filament, roughly as $\sigma_{m_{line}} \propto l^{0.7}$. overall,our results are consistent with the suggestion that the bulk of the cmf/imfresults from the gravitational fragmentation of filaments.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

astro-ph;0505168	chemical differentiation along the cepa-east outflows	we present the results of a multiline survey at mm-wavelengths of the cepheusa star forming region. four main flows have been identified: three pointing inthe sw, ne, and se directions and accelerating high density cs clumps. thefourth outflow, revealed by high-sensitivity hdo observations, is pointingtowards south and is associated with conditions particularly favourable to achemical enrichment. the analysis of the line profiles shows that the siomolecule dominates at the highest velocities and at the highest excitationconditions, confirming its close association with shocks. h2s, so2, and sopreferentially trace more quiescent regions than sio, and in particular a lackof bright h2s emission at the highest velocities is found. ocs and h2cs emit atquite high velocities, where the abundances of three shock tracers like sio,ch3oh, and hdo are higher. these results may indicate that h2s is not the onlymajor sulphur carrier in the grain mantles, and that ocs and h2cs may probablyplay an important role on the grains; or that alternatively they rapidly formonce the mantle is evaporated after the passage of a shock. finally, theoutflow peak emission has been compared with recent time-dependent sulphurchemistry models: the results indicate that, if associated with accuratemeasurements of the physical conditions, the ch3oh/h2cs column density ratiocan be used as an effective chemical clock to date the age of shocked gas.
