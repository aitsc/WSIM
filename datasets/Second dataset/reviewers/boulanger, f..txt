0706.1510	aromatic emission from the ionised mane of the horsehead nebula	we study the evolution of the aromatic infrared bands (aibs) emitters acrossthe illuminated edge of the horsehead nebula and especially their survival andproperties in the hii region. we present spectral mapping observations takenwith the infrared spectrograph (irs) at wavelengths 5.2-38 microns. a strongaib at 11.3 microns is detected in the hii region, relative to the other aibsat 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 microns. the intensity of this band appears to becorrelated with the intensity of the [neii] at 12.8 microns and of halpha,which shows that the emitters of the 11.3 microns band are located in theionised gas. the survival of pahs in the hii region could be due to themoderate intensity of the radiation field (g0 about 100) and the lack ofphotons with energy above about 25ev. the enhancement of the intensity of the11.3 microns band in the hii region, relative to the other aibs can beexplained by the presence of neutral pahs. our observations highlight atransition region between ionised and neutral pahs observed with idealconditions in our galaxy. a scenario where pahs can survive in hii regions andbe significantly neutral could explain the detection of a prominent 11.3microns band in other spitzer observations.

[si ii]34.82$\mu$memission, detected at a luminosity of 1/10th of that of the h$_2$, appears totrace the group-wide shock closely and in addition, we detect weak[feii]25.99$\mu$m emission from the most x-ray luminous part of the shock.comparison with shock models reveals that this emission is consistent withregions of fast shocks (100 &lt; $v_{s}$ &lt; 300 km/s) experiencing depletion ofiron and silicon onto dust grains. star formation in the shock (as traced viaionic lines, pah and dust emission) appears in the intruder galaxy, but moststrikingly at either end of the radio shock. the shock ridge itself showslittle star formation, consistent with a model in which the tremendous h$_{2}$power is driven by turbulent energy transfer from motions in a post-shockedlayer. the significance of the molecular hydrogen lines over other measuredsources of cooling in fast galaxy-scale shocks may have crucial implicationsfor the cooling of gas in the assembly of the first galaxies.

1004.0677	observations and modeling of the dust emission from the h2-bright  galaxy-wide shock in stephan's quintet	spitzer space telescope observations revealed powerful mid-infrared (mid-ir)h2 rotational line emission from the stephan's quintet (sq) x-ray emittinglarge scale shock associated with a collision between two galaxies. because h2forms on dust grains, the presence of h2 is physically linked to the survivalof dust, and we expect some dust emission to come from the molecular gas. totest this interpretation, ir observations and dust modeling are used toidentify and characterize the thermal dust emission from the shocked moleculargas. the spatial distribution of the ir emission allows us to isolate the faintpah and dust continuum emission associated with the molecular gas in the sqshock. we model the spectral energy distribution (sed) of this emission, andfit it to spitzer observations. faint pah and dust continuum emission aredetected in the sq shock, outside star-forming regions. the 12/24um flux ratioin the shock is remarkably close to that of the diffuse galactic interstellarmedium, leading to a galactic pah/vsg abundance ratio. however, the propertiesof the pah emission spectrum in the shock differ from that of the galaxy, whichmay suggest an enhanced fraction of large and neutrals pahs. the ir sed isconsistent with the expected emission from dust associated with the warm(&gt;150k) h2 gas, heated by a uv radiation field of intensity comparable to thatof the solar neighborhood, in agreement with galex uv observations. thepresence of pahs and dust grains in the high-speed (1000km/s) galaxy collisionsuggests that dust survives. we propose that the dust that survived destructionwas in pre-shock gas at densites larger than a few 0.1cm-3, which was notshocked at velocities larger than 200km/s.

1007.4701	the energetics of molecular gas in ngc 891 from h2 and fir spectroscopy	we have studied the molecular hydrogen energetics of the edge-on spiralgalaxy ngc\,891, using a 34-position map in the lowest three pure rotationalh$_2$ lines observed with the spitzer infrared spectrograph. the s(0), s(1),and s(2) lines are bright with an extinction corrected total luminosity of$\sim2.8 \times 10^{7}$ l$_{\odot}$, or 0.09\% of the total-infrared luminosityof ngc\,891. the h$_2$ line ratios are nearly constant along the plane of thegalaxy -- we do not observe the previously reported strong drop-off in thes(1)/s(0) line intensity ratio in the outer regions of the galaxy, so we findno evidence for the very massive cold co-free molecular clouds invoked toexplain the past observations. the h$_2$ level excitation temperatures increasemonotonically indicating more than one component to the emitting gas. more than99\% of the mass is in the lowest excitation (t$_{ex}$ $\sim$125 k) ``warm''component. in the inner galaxy, the warm h$_2$ emitting gas is $\sim$15\% ofthe co(1-0)-traced cool molecular gas, while in the outer regions the fractionis twice as high. this large mass of warm gas is heated by a combination of thefar-uv photons from stars in photo-dissociation regions (pdrs) and thedissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. including the observed far-infrared[oi] and [cii] fine-structure line emission and far-infrared continuum emissionin a self-consistent manner to constrain the pdr models, we find essentiallyall of the s(0) and most (70\%) of the s(1) line arises from low excitationpdrs, while most (80\%) of the s(2) and the remainder of the s(1) line emissionarises from low velocity microturbulent dissipation.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1008.1315	gas morphology and energetics at the surface of pdrs: new insights with  herschel observations of ngc 7023	we investigate the physics and chemistry of the gas and dust in densephoton-dominated regions (pdrs), along with their dependence on theilluminating uv field. using herschel-hifi observations, we study the gasenergetics in ngc 7023 in relation to the morphology of this nebula. ngc 7023is the prototype of a pdr illuminated by a b2v star and is one of the keytargets of herschel. our approach consists in determining the energetics of theregion by combining the information carried by the mid-ir spectrum (extinctionby classical grains, emission from very small dust particles) with that of themain gas coolant lines. in this letter, we discuss more specifically theintensity and line profile of the 158 micron (1901 ghz) [cii] line measured byhifi and provide information on the emitting gas. we show that both the [cii]emission and the mid-ir emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)arise from the regions located in the transition zone between atomic andmolecular gas. using the meudon pdr code and a simple transfer model, we findgood agreement between the calculated and observed [cii] intensities. hifiobservations of ngc 7023 provide the opportunity to constrain the energetics atthe surface of pdrs. future work will include analysis of the main coolant line[oi] and use of a new pdr model that includes pah-related species.

0704.2175	statistical properties of dust far-infrared emission	the description of the statistical properties of dust emission givesimportant constraints on the physics of the interstellar medium but it is alsoa useful way to estimate the contamination of diffuse interstellar emission inthe cases where it is considered a nuisance. the main goals of this analysis ofthe power spectrum and non-gaussian properties of 100 micron dust emission are1) to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in threedimensions, 2) to review and extend previous estimates of the cirrus noise dueto dust emission and 3) to produce simulated dust emission maps that reproducethe observed statistical properties. the main results are the following. 1) thecirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previouslyoverestimated. it is found to be proportional to &lt;i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;^1.5, where&lt;i&gt; is the local average brightness at 100 micron. this scaling is inaccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at agiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasingamplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) the spectral index of dustemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is &lt;gamma&gt;=-2.9 on averagebut shows significant variations over the sky. bright regions havesystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) the skewness andkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strongnon-gaussianity. 4) based on our characterization of the 100 micron powerspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a functionof wavelength and scale. 5) finally we present a method based on a modificationof gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproducethe power spectrum and non-gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.

1010.2769	the global dust sed: tracing the nature and evolution of dust with  dustem	the planck and herschel missions are currently measuring the farir-mmemission of dust, which combined with existing ir data, will for the first timeprovide the full sed of the galactic ism dust emission with an unprecedentedsensitivity and angular resolution. it will allow a systematic study of thedust evolution processes that affect the sed. here we present a versatilenumerical tool, dustem, that predicts the emission and extinction of dust giventheir size distribution and their optical and thermal properties. in order tomodel dust evolution, dustem has been designed to deal with a variety of graintypes, structures and size distributions and to be able to easily include newdust physics. we use dustem to model the dust sed and extinction in the diffuseinterstellar medium at high-galactic latitude (dhgl), a natural reference sed.we present a coherent set of observations for the dhgl sed. the dust componentsin our dhgl model are (i) pahs, (ii) amorphous carbon and (iii) amorphoussilicates. we use amorphous carbon dust, rather than graphite, because itbetter explains the observed high abundances of gas-phase carbon in shockedregions of the interstellar medium. using the dustem model, we illustrate how,in the optically thin limit, the iras/planck hfi (and likewise spitzer/herschelfor smaller spatial scales) photometric band ratios of the dust sed candisentangle the influence of the exciting radiation field intensity andconstrain the abundance of small grains relative to the larger grains. we alsodiscuss the contributions of the different grain populations to the iras,planck and herschel channels. such information is required to enable a study ofthe evolution of dust as well as to systematically extract the dust thermalemission from cmb data and to analyze the emission in the planck polarizedchannels. the dustem code described in this paper is publically available.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2039	planck early results: first assessment of the high frequency instrument  in-flight performance	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) is designed to measure thetemperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgroundand galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545and 857 ghz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 ghz), 7' (143 ghz), and 5'(217 ghz and higher). hfi has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 may2009. the bolometers cooled to 100 mk as planned. the settings of the readoutelectronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize hfi's noiseperformance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during groundtesting. observations of mars, jupiter, and saturn verified both the opticalsystem and the time response of the detection chains. the optical beams areclose to predictions from physical optics modeling. the time response of thedetection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. the detectors suffer froman unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. due tothe redundancy of planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percentof data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.the cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation onperiods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of allbolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. only thehigh energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is aprobable source of low frequency noise.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

0704.3257	millimeter dust continuum emission unveiling the true mass of giant  molecular clouds in the small magellanic cloud	co observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas inexternal galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largelyunderestimated. at present, the kinematic information of co data cubes are usedto estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds.millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and couldunveil h2 envelopes lacking co. these different tracers must be compared indifferent environments. this study compares virial masses to masses deducedfrom millimeter emission, in two gmc samples: the local molecular clouds in ourgalaxy and their equivalents in the small magellanic cloud (smc), one of thenearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. in our galaxy, mass estimates deducedfrom millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma rayanalysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. virial masses aresystematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeterdust emission. this difference decreases toward high masses and has alreadybeen reported in previous studies. in the smc however, molecular cloud massesdeduced from simba millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice onaverage for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)than the virial masses from sest co observations. the observed excess can notbe accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. taking a generalform for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15micro gauss in smc clouds could provide additional support to the clouds andexplain the difference observed. masses of smc molecular clouds have thereforebeen underestimated so far. magnetic pressure may contribute significantly totheir support.

1203.4203	detection of powerful mid-ir h2 emission in the bridge between the taffy  galaxies	we report the detection of strong, resolved emission from warm h2 in thetaffy galaxies and bridge. relative to the continuum and faint pah emission,the h2 emission is the strongest in the connecting bridge, approachingl(h2)/l(pah8{\mu}m) = 0.1 between the two galaxies, where the purely rotationallines of h2 dominate the mid-infrared spectrum in a way very reminiscent of thegroup-wide shock in the interacting group stephan's quintet. the surfacebrightness in the 0-0 s(0) and s(1) h2 lines in the bridge is more than twicethat observed at the center of the stephan's quintet shock. we observe a warmh2 mass of 4.2 \times 108 m\odot in the bridge, but taking into account theunobserved bridge area, the total warm mass is likely to be twice this value.we use excitation diagrams to characterize the warm molecular gas, finding anaverage surface mass of 5 \times 106 m\odot kpc-2 and typical excitationtemperatures of 150-175 k. h2 emission is also seen in the galaxy disks,although there the emission is more consistent with normal star forminggalaxies. we investigate several possible heating mechanisms for the bridgegas, but favor the conversion of kinetic energy from the head-on collision viaturbulence and shocks as the main heating source. since the cooling time forthe warm h2 is short (5000 yr), shocks must be permeating the molecular gas inbridge region in order to continue heating the h2.

1301.4549	enhanced warm h2 emission in the compact group mid-infrared "green  valley"	we present results from a spitzer, mid-infrared spectroscopy study of asample of 74 galaxies located in 23 hickson compact groups, chosen to be at adynamically-active stage of hi depletion. we find evidence for enhanced warm h2emission (i.e. above that associated with uv excitation in star-formingregions) in 14 galaxies (~20%), with 8 galaxies having extreme values of l(h2s(0)-s(3))/l(7.7micron pah), in excess of 0.07. such emission has been seenpreviously in the compact group hcg 92 (stephan's quintet), and was shown to beassociated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with alarge-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, withtidal debris in the intragroup medium. similarly, shock excitation or turbulentheating is likely responsible for the enhanced h2 emission in the compact groupgalaxies, since other sources of heating (uv or x-ray excitation from starformation or agn) are insufficient to account for the observed emission. thegroup galaxies fall predominantly in a region of mid-infrared color-color spaceidentified by previous studies as being connected to rapid transformations inhcg galaxy evolution. furthermore, the majority of h2-enhanced galaxies lie inthe optical "green valley" between the blue cloud and red-sequence, and areprimarily early-type disk systems. we suggest that h2-enhanced systems mayrepresent a specific phase in the evolution of galaxies in dense environmentsand provide new insight into mechanisms which transform galaxies onto theoptical red sequence.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1304.7734	on the self-regulation of intense star-formation in galaxies at z=1-3	(abridged) we have analyzed the properties of the rest-frame optical emissionlines of a sample of 53 intensely star forming galaxies at z=1.3 to 2.7observed with sinfoni on the eso-vlt. we find large velocity dispersions in thelines, sigma=30-250 km/s. our data agree well with simulations where we appliedbeam-smearing and assumed a scaling relation of the form: velocity dispersionis proportional to the square root of the star-formation intensity(star-formation rate per unit area). we conclude that the dispersions areprimarily driven by star formation. to explain the high surface brightness andoptical line ratios, high thermal pressures in the warm ionized medium, wim,are required (log p/k (k/cm^3)&gt;~6-7). such thermal pressures in the wim aresimilar to those observed in nearby starburst galaxies, but occur over muchlarger physical scales. moreover, the relatively low ionization parametersnecessary to fit the high surface brightnesses and optical line ratios suggestthat the gas is not only directly associated with regions of star formation,but is wide spread throughout the general ism. thus the optical emission linegas is a tracer of the large scale dynamics of the bulk of the ism. we presenta simple model for the energy input from young stars in an accreting galaxy, toargue that the intense star-formation is supporting high turbulent pressure,which roughly balances the gravitational pressure and thus enables distant gasaccreting disks to maintain a toomre disk instability parameter q~1. for a starformation efficiency of 3%, only 5-15% of the mechanical energy from youngstars that is deposited in the ism is needed to support the level of turbulencerequired for maintaining this balance. since this balance is maintained byenergy injected into the ism by the young stars themselves, this suggests thatstar formation in high redshift galaxies is self-regulating.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1309.1525	shock-enhanced c+ emission and the detection of h2o from stephan's  quintet's group-wide shock using herschel	we present the first herschel spectroscopic detections of the [oi]63 and[cii]158 micron fine-structure transitions, and a single para-h2o line from the35 x 15 kpc^2 shocked intergalactic filament in stephan's quintet. the filamentis believed to have been formed when a high-speed intruder to the groupcollided with clumpy intergroup gas. observations with the pacs spectrometerprovide evidence for broad (&gt; 1000 km s^-1) luminous [cii] line profiles, aswell as fainter [oi]63micron emission. spire fts observations reveal wateremission from the p-h2o (111-000) transition at several positions in thefilament, but no other molecular lines. the h2o line is narrow, and may beassociated with denser intermediate-velocity gas experiencing the strongestshock-heating. the [cii]/pah{tot) and [cii]/fir ratios are too large to beexplained by normal photo-electric heating in pdrs. hii region excitation orx-ray/cosmic ray heating can also be ruled out. the observations lead to theconclusion that a large fraction the molecular gas is diffuse and warm. wepropose that the [cii], [oi] and warm h2 line emission is powered by aturbulent cascade in which kinetic energy from the galaxy collision with theigm is dissipated to small scales and low-velocities, via shocks and turbulenteddies. low-velocity magnetic shocks can help explain both the [cii]/[oi]ratio, and the relatively high [cii]/h2 ratios observed. the discovery that[cii] emission can be enhanced, in large-scale turbulent regions in collisionalenvironments has implications for the interpretation of [cii] emission inhigh-z galaxies.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1410.6155	exceptional agn-driven turbulence inhibits star formation in the 3c 326n  radio-galaxy	we detect bright [cii]158$\mu$m line emission from the radio galaxy 3c 326nat z=0.09, which shows weak star formation ($sfr&lt;0.07$m$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$)despite having strong h$_2$ line emission and $2\times 10^9$m$_{\odot}$ ofmolecular gas. the [cii] line is twice as strong as the 0-0s(1) 17$\mu$m h$_2$line, and both lines are much in excess what is expected from uv heating. wecombine infrared spitzer and herschel data with gas and dust modeling to inferthe gas physical conditions. the [cii] line traces 30 to 50% of the moleculargas mass, which is warm (70&lt;t&lt;100k) and at moderate densities$700&lt;n_{h}&lt;3000$cm$^{-3}$. the [cii] line is broad with a blue-shifted wing,and likely to be shaped by a combination of rotation, outflowing gas, andturbulence. it matches the near-infrared h$_2$ and the na d optical absorptionlines. if the wing is interpreted as an outflow, the mass loss rate would belarger than 20m$_{\odot}$/yr, and the depletion timescale shorter than theorbital timescale ($10^8$yr). these outflow rates may be over-estimated becausethe stochastic injection of turbulence on galactic scales can contribute to theskewness of the line profile and mimic outflowing gas. we argue that thedissipation of turbulence is the main heating process of this gas. cosmic rayscan also contribute to the heating but they require an average gas densitylarger than the observational constraints. we show that strong turbulentsupport maintains a high gas vertical scale height (0.3-4kpc) in the disk andcan inhibit the formation of gravitationally-bound structures at all scales,offering a natural explanation for the weakness of star formation in 3c 326n.to conclude, the bright [cii] line indicates that strong agn jet-driventurbulence may play a key role in enhancing the amount of molecular gas(positive feedback) but yet can prevent star formation on galactic scales(negative feedback).

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01586	planck 2015 results. vii. hfi toi and beam processing	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) has observed the full sky at sixfrequencies (100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 ghz) in intensity and at fourfrequencies in linear polarization (100, 143, 217, and 353 ghz). in order toobtain sky maps, the time-ordered information (toi) containing the detector andpointing samples must be processed and the angular response must be assessed.the full mission toi is included in the planck 2015 release. this paperdescribes the hfi toi and beam processing for the 2015 release. hfi calibrationand map-making are described in a companion paper. the main pipeline has beenmodified since the last release (2013 nominal mission in intensity only), byincluding a correction for the non-linearity of the warm readout and byimproving the model of the bolometer time response. the beam processing is anessential tool that derives the angular response used in all the planck sciencepapers and we report an improvement in the effective beam window functionuncertainty of more than a factor 10 relative to the 2013 release. noisecorrelations introduced by pipeline filtering function are assessed usingdedicated simulations. angular cross-power spectra using datasets that aredecorrelated in time are immune to the main systematic effects.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.04941	mixed aliphatic and aromatic composition of evaporating very small  grains in ngc 7023 revealed by the 3.4/3.3 $\mu$m ratio	in photon-dominated regions (pdrs), uv photons from nearby stars lead to theevaporation of very small grains (vsgs) and the production of gas-phasepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). our goal is to achieve better insightinto the composition and evolution of evaporating very small grains (evsgs) andpahs through analyzing the infrared (ir) aliphatic and aromatic emission bands.we combined spectro-imagery in the near- and mid-ir to study the spatialevolution of the emission bands in the prototypical pdr ngc 7023. we usednear-ir spectra obtained with akari to trace the evolution of the 3.3$\mu$m and3.4$\mu$m bands, which are associated with aromatic and aliphatic c-h bonds onpahs. the spectral fitting involves an additional broad feature centred at3.45$\mu$m. mid-ir observations obtained with spitzer are used to discriminatethe signatures of evsgs, neutral and cationic pahs. we correlated the spatialevolution of all these bands with the intensity of the uv field to explore theprocessing of their carriers. the intensity of the 3.45$\mu$m plateau shows anexcellent correlation with that of the 3.3$\mu$m aromatic band (correlationcoefficient r = 0.95), indicating that the plateau is dominated by the emissionfrom aromatic bonds. the ratio of the 3.4$\mu$m and 3.3$\mu$m band intensity($i_{3.4}/i_{3.3}$) decreases by a factor of 4 at the pdr interface from themore uv-shielded to the more exposed layers. the transition region between thealiphatic and aromatic material is found to correspond spatially with thetransition zone between neutral pahs and evsgs. we conclude that thephoto-processing of evsgs leads to the production of pahs with attachedaliphatic sidegroups that are revealed by the 3.4$\mu$m emission band. ouranalysis provides evidence for the presence of very small grains of mixedaromatic and aliphatic composition in pdrs.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

1505.02779	planck intermediate results. xxxviii. e- and b-modes of dust  polarization from the magnetized filamentary structure of the interstellar  medium	the quest for a b-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) requires thecharacterization of foreground polarization from galactic dust. we present astatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 ghz planck stokesmaps at high galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as apolarized foreground to the cmb. we filter the intensity and polarization mapsto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetrybetween e-modes and b-modes is observed. using the smoothed hessian major axisfilament finder, we identify 259 filaments at high galactic latitude, withlengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for atypical distance of 100 pc). these filaments show a preferred orientationparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derivedfrom their polarization angles. we present mean maps of the filaments in stokesi, q, u, e, and b, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align theorientations of the filaments. combining the stacked images and the histogramof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of thefilaments to be 11 %. furthermore, we show that the correlation between thefilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the e and basymmetry and the $c_{\ell}^{te}/c_{\ell}^{ee}$ ratio, reported in the powerspectra analysis of the planck 353 ghz polarization maps. future models of thedust foreground for cmb polarization studies will need to take into account theobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure ofinterstellar matter.

1505.04069	spatially resolved spitzer-irs spectral maps of the superwind in m82	we have mapped the superwind/halo region of the nearby starburst galaxy m82in the mid-infrared with $spitzer-irs$. the spectral regions covered includethe h$_2 s(1)-s(3)$, [neii], [neiii] emission lines and pah features. weestimate the total warm h$_2$ mass and the kinetic energy of the outflowingwarm molecular gas to be between $m_{warm}\sim5-17\times10^6$ m$_{\odot}$ and$e_{k}\sim6-20\times10^{53}$ erg. using the ratios of the 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3micron pah features in the irs spectra, we are able to estimate the averagesize and ionization state of the small grains in the superwind. there are largevariations in the pah flux ratios throughout the outflow. the 11.3/7.7 and the6.2/7.7 pah ratios both vary by more than a factor of five across the windregion. the northern part of the wind has a significant population of pah'swith smaller 6.2/7.7 ratios than either the starburst disk or the southernwind, indicating that on average, pah emitters are larger and more ionized. thewarm molecular gas to pah flux ratios (h$_2/pah$) are enhanced in the outflowby factors of 10-100 as compared to the starburst disk. this enhancement in theh$_2/pah$ ratio does not seem to follow the ionization of the atomic gas (asmeasured with the [neiii]/[neii] line flux ratio) in the outflow. this suggeststhat much of the warm h$_2$ in the outflow is excited by shocks. the observedh$_2$ line intensities can be reproduced with low velocity shocks ($v &lt; 40$ kms$^{-1}$) driven into moderately dense molecular gas ($10^2 &lt;n_h &lt; 10^4$cm$^{-3}$) entrained in the outflow.

0805.3109	the molecular hydrogen explorer h2ex	the molecular hydrogen explorer, h2ex, was proposed in response to the esa2015 - 2025 cosmic vision call as a medium class space mission with nasa andcsa participations. the mission, conceived to understand the formation ofgalaxies, stars and planets from molecular hydrogen, is designed to observe thefirst rotational lines of the h2 molecule (28.2, 17.0, 12.3 and 9.7 micron)over a wide field, and at high spectral resolution. h2ex can provide aninventory of warm (&gt; 100 k) molecular gas in a broad variety of objects,including nearby young star clusters, galactic molecular clouds, activegalactic nuclei, local and distant galaxies. the rich array of molecular,atomic and ionic lines, as well as solid state features available in the 8 to29 micron spectral range brings additional science dimensions to h2ex. wepresent the optical and mechanical design of the h2ex payload based on aninnovative imaging fourier transform spectrometer (ifts) fed by a 1.2mtelescope. the 20'x20' field of view is imaged on two 1024x1024 si:asdetectors. the maximum resolution of 0.032 cm^-1 (fwhm) means a velocityresolution of 10 km s^-1 for the 0-0 s(3) line at 9.7 micron. this instrumentoffers the large field of view necessary to survey extended emission in thegalaxy and local universe galaxies as well as to perform unbiased extragalacticand circumstellar disks surveys. the high spectral resolution makes h2exuniquely suited to study the dynamics of h2 in all these environments. themission plan is made of seven wide-field spectro-imaging legacy programs, fromthe cosmic web to galactic young star clusters, within a nominal two yearsmission. the payload has been designed to re-use the planck platform andpassive cooling design.

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1510.02107	warm molecular hydrogen at high redshift with the james webb space  telescope	the build-up of galaxies is regulated by a complex interplay betweengravitational collapse, galaxy merging and feedback related to agn and starformation. the energy released by these processes has to dissipate for gas tocool, condense, and form stars. how gas cools is thus a key to understandgalaxy formation. \textit{spitzer space telescope} infrared spectroscopyrevealed a population of galaxies with weak star formation and unusuallypowerful h$_2$ line emission. this is a signature of turbulent dissipation,sustained by large-scale mechanical energy injection. the cooling of themultiphase interstellar medium is associated with emission in the h$_2$ lines.these results have profound consequences on our understanding of regulation ofstar formation, feedback and energetics of galaxy formation in general. thefact that h$_2$ lines can be strongly enhanced in high-redshift turbulentgalaxies will be of great importance for the \textit{james webb spacetelescope} observations which will unveil the role that h$_2$ plays as acooling agent in the era of galaxy assembly.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

astro-ph;0002284	the extragalactic background and its fluctuations in the far-infrared  wavelengths	a cosmic far-infrared background (cfirb) has long been predicted that wouldtraces the intial phases of galaxy formation. it has been first detected bypuget et al.(1996) using cobe data and has been later confirmed by severalrecent studies (fixsen et al. 1998, hauser et al. 1998, lagache et al. 1999).we will present a new determination of the cfirb that uses for the first time,in addition to cobe data, two independent gas tracers: the hi survey ofleiden/dwingeloo (hartmann, 1998) and the wham h$_{\alpha}$ survey (reynolds etal 1998). we will see that the cfirb above 100 micron is now very wellconstrained. the next step is to see if we can detect its fluctuations. tosearch for the cfirb fluctuations, we have used the firback observations.firback is a deep cosmological survey conducted at 170 micron with isophot(dole et al., 2000). we show that the emission of unresolved extra-galacticsources clearly dominates, at arcminute scales, the background fluctuations inthe lowest galactic emission regions. this is the first detection of the cfirbfluctuations.

astro-ph;0103373	isocam observations of the rho ophiuchi cloud: luminosity and mass  functions of the pre-main sequence embedded cluster	we present the results of the first extensive mid-infrared (ir) imagingsurvey of the rho ophiuchi embedded cluster, performed with the isocam cameraon board the iso satellite. the main molecular cloud l1688, as well as l1689nand l1689s, have been completely surveyed for point sources at 6.7 and 14.3micron. a total of 425 sources are detected including 16 class i, 123 class ii,and 77 class iii young stellar objects (ysos). essentially all of the mid-irsources coincide with near-ir sources, but a large proportion of them arerecognized for the first time as ysos. our dual-wavelength survey allows us toidentify essentially all the ysos with ir excess in the embedded cluster downto fnu ~ 10 - 15 mjy. it more than doubles the known population of class iiysos and represents the most complete census to date of newly formed stars inthe rho ophiuchi central region. the stellar luminosity function of thecomplete sample of class ii ysos is derived with a good accuracy down to l=0.03 lsun. a modeling of this lumino- sity function, using available pre-mainsequence tracks and plausible star for- mation histories, allows us to derivethe mass distribution of the class ii ysos which arguably reflects the imf ofthe embedded cluster. we estimate that the imf in rho ophiuchi is welldescribed by a two-component power law with a low- mass index of -0.35+/-0.25,a high-mass index of -1.7 (to be compared with the salpeter value of -1.35),and a break occurring at m = 0.55+/-0.25 msun. this imf is flat with noevidence for a low-mass cutoff down to at least 0.06 msun.

astro-ph;0104150	photoelectric effect on dust grains across the l1721 cloud in the rho  ophiuchi molecular complex	we present iso-lws measurements of the main gas cooling lines, c+ 158 mum ando 63 mum towards a moderate opacity molecular cloud (av=3), l1721, illuminatedby the b2 star nu sco (x = 5-10). these data are combined with an extinctionmap and iras dust emission images to test our understanding of gas heating andcooling in photo-dissociation regions (pdrs). this nearby pdr is spatiallyresolved in the iras images; variations in the iras colors across the cloudindicate an enhanced abundance of small dust grains within the pdr. a spatialcorrelation between the gas cooling lines and the infrared emission from smalldust grains illustrates the dominant role of small dust grains in the gasheating through the photoelectric effect. the photoelectric efficiency,determined from the observations by ratioing the power radiated by gas andsmall dust grains, is in the range 2 to 3% in close agreement with recenttheoretical estimates. the brightness profiles across the pdr in the c+ 158 mumand o 63 mum lines are compared with model calculations where the densityprofile is constrained by the extinction data and where the gas chemical andthermal balances are solved at each position. we show that abundance variationsof small dust grains across the pdr must be considered to account for the lwsobservations.

astro-ph;0106507	far-infrared dust opacity and visible extinction in the polaris flare	we present an extinction map of the polaris molecular cirrus cloud derivedfrom star counts and compare it with the schlegel et al. (1998) extinction mapderived from the far--infrared dust opacity. we find that, within the polariscloud, the schlegel et al. av values are a factor 2 to 3 higher than the starcount values. we propose that this discrepancy results from a difference in$\tau_{fir}/ a_v$ between the diffuse atomic medium and the polaris cloud. weuse the difference in spectral energy distribution, warm for the diffuse atomicmedium, cold for the polaris cloud, to separate their respective contributionto the line of sight integrated infrared emission and find that the$\tau_{fir}/ a_v$ of cold dust in polaris is on average 4 times higher than theschlegel et al. value for dust in atomic cirrus. this change in dust propertycould be interpreted by a growth of fluffy particles within low opacitymolecular cirrus clouds such as polaris. our work suggests that variations indust emissivity must be taken into account to estimate av from dust emissionwherever cold infrared emission is present (i.e. molecular clouds).

astro-ph;0203192	isocam observations of the ursa major cirrus: evidence for large  abundance variations of small dust grains	we present mid-ir imaging observations of a high galactic latitude cirrusobtained with the iso camera isocam at 6" angular resolution. the observationswere done with two filters lw2 (5-8.5 microns) and lw3 (12-18 microns) thatmeasure respectively the aromatic carbon bands and the underlying continuumemission from small dust particles. three 0.05 square degree images sampleatomic and molecular sections in the ursa major cirrus. these images arecompared with hi, co and iras observations. in such a cloud transparent tostellar light (av &lt; 0.5) the mid-infrared to 100 microns and the mid-iremissivity per hydrogen are related to the abundance and the optical propertiesof small dust particles independently of any modelling of the penetration ofthe radiation. within the atomic section of the cloud, the comparison betweenisocam images and 21 cm interferometric data highlights an enhancement of themid-ir emitters abundance by a factor ~5 in an hi filament characterized by alarge transverse velocity gradient suggestive of rotation. furthermore, a dropin the abundance of the same mid-ir emitters is observed at the interfacebetween the atomic and molecular cirrus sections. we propose that theseabundance variations of the mid-ir emitters are related to the production ofsmall dust particles by grain shattering in energetic grain-grain collisionsgenerated by turbulent motions within the cirrus and inversely by theirdisappearance due to coagulation on large grains. at the atomic-molecularinterface we also observe a decrease of the lw2/lw3 ratio by a factor 2 in themolecular region. this could result from a modification of the dust sizedistribution or of the intrinsic optical properties of the small dustparticles.

astro-ph;0311040	some empirical estimates of the h2 formation rate in photon-dominated  regions	we combine recent iso observations of the vibrational ground state lines ofh2 towards photon-dominated regions (pdrs) with observations of vibrationallyexcited states made with ground-based telescopes in order to constrain theformation rate of h2 on grain surfaces under the physical conditions in thelayers responsible for h2 emission. we use steady state pdr models in order toexamine the sensitivity of different h2 line ratios to the h2 formation raterf. we show that the ratio of the 0-0 s(3) to the 1-0 s(1) line increases withrf but that one requires independent estimates of the radiation field incidentupon the pdr and the density in order to infer rf from the h2 line data. weconfirm the earlier result of habart et al. (2003) that the h2 formation ratein regions of moderate excitation such as oph w, s140 and ic 63 is a factor of5 times larger than the standard rate inferred from uv observations of diffuseclouds. on the other hand, towards regions of higher radiation field such asthe orion bar and ngc 2023, we derive h2 formation rates consistent with thestandard value. we find also a correlation between the h2 1-0 s(1) line and pahemission suggesting that rf scales with the pah abundance. with the aim ofexplaining these results, we consider some empirical models of the h2 formationprocess. here we consider both formation on big (a~0.1 microns) and small (a~10angstroms) grains by either direct recombination from the gas phase orrecombination of physisorbed h atoms with atoms in a chemisorbed site. weconclude that indirect chemisorption is most promising in pdrs. moreover smallgrains which dominate the total grain surface and spend most of their time atrelatively low temperatures may be the most promising surface for forming h2 inpdrs.

astro-ph;0604238	spitzer/irac and isocam/cvf insights on the origin of the near to mid-ir  galactic diffuse emission	we measure irac colors of extended emission in several fields covering arange of galactic latitudes and longitudes outside of star forming regions. wedetermine the nature of the galactic diffuse emission in spitzer/irac images bycombining them with spectroscopic data. we show that pah features make theemission in the irac 5.8 and 8.0 $\mu$m channels, whereas the 3.3 $\mu$mfeature represents only 20 to 50% of the irac 3.6 $\mu$m channel. a nircontinuum is necessary to account for irac 4.5 $\mu$m emission and theremaining fraction of the irac 3.6 $\mu$m emission. this continuum cannot beaccounted by scattered light. it represents 9% of the total power absorbed bypahs and 120% of the interstellar uv photon flux. the 3.3 $\mu$m feature isobserved to vary from field-to-field with respect to the irac 8.0 $\mu$mchannel. the continuum and 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensities are not correlated.we present model calculations which relate our measurements of the pahsspectral energy distribution to the particles size and ionization state. cationand neutral pahs emission properties are inferred empirically from\object{ngc7023} observations. pahs caracteristics are best constrained in aline of sight towards the inner galaxy, dominated by the cold neutral mediumphase : we find that the pah cation fraction is about 50% and that their meansize is about 60 carbon atoms. a significant field-to-field dispersion in thepah mean size, from 40 to 80 carbon atoms, is necessary to account for theobserved variations in the 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensity relative to the irac8.0 $\mu$m flux. however, one cannot be secure about the feature interpretationas long as the continuum origin remains unclear.

astro-ph;0608189	spitzer sage survey of the large magellanic cloud ii: evolved stars and  infrared color magnitude diagrams	color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) are presented for the spitzer sage (surveyingthe agents of a galaxy's evolution) survey of the large magellanic cloud (lmc).irac and mips 24 um epoch one data are presented. these data represent thedeepest, widest mid-infrared cmds of their kind ever produced in the lmc.combined with the 2mass survey, the diagrams are used to delineate the evolvedstellar populations in the large magellanic cloud as well as galacticforeground and extragalactic background populations. some 32000 evolved starsbrighter than the tip of the red giant branch are identified. of these,approximately 17500 are classified as oxygen-rich, 7000 carbon-rich, andanother 1200 as ``extreme'' asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. brightermembers of the latter group have been called ``obscured'' agb stars in theliterature owing to their dusty circumstellar envelopes. a large number (1200)of luminous oxygen--rich agb stars/m supergiants are also identified. finally,there is strong evidence from the 24 um mips channel that previouslyunexplored, lower luminosity oxygen-rich agb stars contribute significantly tothe mass loss budget of the lmc (1200 such sources are identified).

astro-ph;0608655	dust in high-velocity clouds : relevance for planck	the recent detection of dust emission in complex c, the largest high-velocitycloud (hvc) on the sky, opens a very interesting perspective for planck. thehvc dust temperature determined using iras and spitzer observations is low(t~10.7 k) in accordance with its great distance from the galaxy (&gt; 5 kpc).peak column density in 30 arcmin beam is nh ~10^20 cm-2 which is typical ofhvcs and similar to cirrus column density in diffuse regions. on the other handhvcs appear to be very clumpy at smaller angular scales; several observationsat the arcminute scale resolution show significant structure and higherbrightness contrasts than in typical cirrus emission. in this contribution weshow that, even with their moderate column density, the cold temperature, highemissivity and high column density contrast of hvcs should lead to significantand detectable emission in the planck-hfi frequency range. in order to separatethe hvc emission from the galactic cirrus emission, the use of 21 cmobservations will be mandatory.

astro-ph;0702019	isocam mid-infrared spectroscopy and nir photometry of the hii complex  n4 in lmc	[abridged] we present the analysis of isocam-cvf and nir photometry data ofthe hii region complex n4 in lmc. the aim is twofold: 1) to study theconnection between the ism and the star content of this region; 2)toinvestigate the effects of the lower than galactic metallicity on dustproperties. a dust features -- gas lines -- continuum fitting technique on thedata, allows the production of images in each single emission and the detailedanalysis of dust, and ionized gas. the nir photometry provides, for the firsttime, information on the stellar content of n4. the images in single dustfeature bands and gas lines clearly show that the hii region core is completelydevoid of the carriers responsible for the aromatic features (afs). on theother hand, the ionized gas arises almost completely in this dust cavity, wherealso the two main exciting stars of n4 are located. we find evidences that theeffect of lower than galactic metallicity on the carriers responsible for theafs, is not to prevent their formation or to modify their chemical properties,but to enhance their destruction by the high and hard isrf. we show that thismechanism is more efficient on smaller dust particles/molecules thus affectingthe dust-size distribution. we argue that effects on dust--size distribution,rather than thedifferent dust properties due to a lower metallicity, should betaken into account when analyzing more distant relatively low metallicitygalaxies. finally, the analysis of the stellar content of n4 reveals 7 stars: 4reddened o ms stars and 3 stars with envelopes. in particular, one of these,seems to be an ultra compact hii region containing an embedded yso.

astro-ph;9804020	mid--ir emission of galaxies in the virgo cluster: ii. integrated  properties	we analyse the integrated properties of the mid-ir emission of a complete,optically selected sample of galaxies in the virgo cluster observed with theisocam instrument on board the iso satellite. the analysis shows that themid-ir emission up to 15 mic of optically-selected, normal early-type galaxies(e, s0 and s0a) is dominated by the rayleigh-jeans tail of the cold stellarcomponent. the mid-ir emission of late-type galaxies is instead dominated bythe thermal emission from dust. the small dust grains emitting in the mid-irhave an excess of emission if compared to big grains emitting in the far-ir.while the far-ir emission increases with the intensity of the interstellarradiation field, their mid-ir emission is non--linearly related to the uvradiation field. the spectral energy distributions of the target galaxiesindicate that there is a linear relationship between the uv radiation field andthe mid-ir emission of galaxies for low or intermediate activities of starformation, while the emission from the hot dust seems to drop for strong uvfields. the mid-ir colour of late-type galaxies is not related to theiractivity of star formation. the properties of the dust emission in the mid-irseem more related to the mass than to the morphological type of the targetgalaxy. since the activity of star formation is anticorrelated to the mass ofgalaxies, this reflects a relationship between the emission of dust in themid-ir and the uv radiation field: galaxies with the lowest mid-ir emission fora given uv field are low mass, dwarf galaxies. these observational evidencesare easily explained if the carriers of the unidentified infrared bands thatdominate the 6.75 mic emission are destroyed by the intense uv radiation fieldof dwarf galaxies, although abundance effects can also play a role.

astro-ph;9812474	the interstellar cold dust observed by cobe	using dirbe and firas maps at high latitude ($|b|&gt;10^{\circ}$) we derive thespatial distribution of the dust temperature associated with the diffuse cirrusand the dense molecular clouds. for a $\nu^2$ emissivity law, we find that theequilibrium dust temperature of the cirrus is about 17.5 k with only smallvariations over the high latitude sky. comparison of the far infrared dirbemaps shows the presence of a colder emission component with a temperaturearound 15 k, assuming a $\nu^2$ emissivity law. the lowest values of thetemperature found in the cold regions ($\sim 13 k$) are compatible with theresults recently obtained for dense cores in star forming regions by theballoon-borne experiment spm-pronaos (ristorcelli et al., 1996, 1998, serra etal., 1997). this cold component is in particular present in the direction ofknown molecular complexes with low star forming activity such as taurus. theassociation between the cold component and molecular clouds is furtherdemonstrated by the fact that all sky pixels with significant cold emissionhave an excess ir emission with respect to the high latitude ir/hi correlation.we have deduced a threshold value of the column density, $n_{hi} = 2.5 10^{20}h/cm^2$, below which cold dust is not detected within the firas beam of $\sim7\degr$. we have re-examined the problem of the existence of a very cold dustcomponent ($t \sim 7 k$) by combining dirbe maps of the cold emission withfiras spectra, corrected for the isotropic component found in puget et al.(1996). the warm and cold component deduced from the analysis of dirbe mapsaccount for the galactic firas spectra with no need for a very cold component($t\sim7$ k).

astro-ph;9901059	first detection of the wim dust emission. implication for the cosmic  far-infrared background	we present a new analysis of the far-ir emission at high galactic latitudebased on cobe and hi data. a decomposition of the far-ir emission over the hi,h^+ and h_2 galactic gas components and the cosmic far infrared background(cfirb) is described.  for the first time the far-ir emission of dust associated with the warmionised medium (wim) is evidenced. this component determined on about 25% ofthe sky is detected at a 10 sigma level in the [200, 350]micron band. the bestrepresentation of the wim dust spectrum is obtained for a temperature of 29.1 kand an emissivity law $tau/n_h+=3.8 \pm 0.8 10^{-26} (\lambda/250\mic)^{-1}cm^2$. with a spectral index equal to 2, the emissivity law becomes$\tau/n_h^+= 1.0 \pm 0.2 10^{-25} (\lambda/250\mic)^{-2} cm^2$, with atemperature of 20 k, which is significantly higher than the temperature of dustassociated with hi gas. the variation in the dust spectrum from the hi to thewim component can be explained by only changing the upper cutoff of the biggrain size distribution from 0.1 micron to 30 nm. the detection of ir emissionof dust in the wim significantly decreases the intensity of the cfirb,especially around 200 micron which corresponds to the peak of energy.

0810.0348	h2 energetics in galaxy-wide shocks: insights in starburst triggering  and galaxy formation	spitzer space telescope observations led to the surprising detection of adiverse set of extragalactic sources whose infrared spectra are dominated byline emission of molecular hydrogen (h2). the absence or relative weakness oftypical signs of star formation (like dust features, lines of ionized gas)suggest the presence of large quantities of h2 gas with no (or very little)associated star formation. we use the stephan's quintet (sq) galaxy collisionto define a physical framework to describe the h2 formation and emission ingalaxy-wide shocks. sq observations show that exceptionally turbulent h2 gas iscoexisting with a hot, x-ray emitting plasma. the extreme mid-ir h2 emissionfrom the shock exceeds that of the x-rays. these observations set a new lighton the contribution of h2 to the cooling of the interstellar medium, on therelation between molecular gas and star formation, and on the energetics ofgalaxy formation.  these observations can be interpreted by considering that the shock is movingthrough an inhomogeneous medium. they suggest that most of the shock energy istransferred to bulk kinetic energy of the h2 gas. the turbulent energy of thepost-shock gas drives a mass cycle across the different gas phases where h2 isforming out of the hot/warm gas. this interpretation puts the h2 emission intoa broader context including optical and x-ray observations. we propose that theturbulence in the clouds is powered by a slow energy and momentum transfer fromthe bulk motion of the gas and that the dissipation of this turbulent energy inturn is powering the h2 emission.
