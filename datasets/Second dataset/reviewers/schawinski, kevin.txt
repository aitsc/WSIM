0901.1663	do moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei suppress star formation?	the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies are thought tobe linked, but the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is stillpoorly understood. both observations and simulations of galaxy formationsuggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (agn), as the centralsupermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellarmaterial and suppresses star formation. in this letter, we show that most hostgalaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universehave intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioningfrom star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to betrue for all agn independent of obscuration. the intermediate colors suggestthat star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 myr ago. thisresult indicates that either the agn are very long-lived, accreting for morethan 1 gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a ~100 myr time delaybetween the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. thefirst explanation is unlikely given current estimates for agn lifetimes, solow-lumiosity agn must shut down star formation before substantial black holeaccretion activity is detected. the scarcity of agn host galaxies in the bluecloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation andblack hole growth are coeval. lastly, these observations also strongly supportthe `unified model' of agn as the host galaxy colors are independent ofobscuration towards the central engine.

0903.3415	galaxy zoo: a sample of blue early-type galaxies at low redshift	we report the discovery of a population of nearby, blue early-type galaxieswith high star formation rates (0.5 &lt; sfr &lt; 50 msun/yr). they are identified bytheir visual morphology as provided by galaxy zoo for sdss dr6 and their u-rcolour. we select a volume-limited sample in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt;0.05, corresponding to luminosities of approximately l* and above, and with u-rcolours significantly bluer than the red sequence. we confirm the early-typemorphology of the objects in this sample and investigate their environmentaldependence and star formation properties. blue early-type galaxies tend to livein lower-density environments than `normal' red sequence early-types and makeup 5.7 +/-0.4% of the low-redshift early-type galaxy population. we find thatsuch blue early-type galaxies are virtually absent at high velocity dispersionsabove 200 km/s. our analysis uses emission line diganostic diagrams and we findthat ~25% of them are actively starforming, while another ~25% host both starformation and an agn. another ~12% are agn. the remaining 38% show no strongemission lines. when present and uncontaminated by an agn contribution, thestar formation is generally intense. we consider star formation rates derivedfrom halpha, u-band and infrared luminosities, and radial colour profiles, andconclude that the star formation is spatially extended. of those objects thatare not currently undergoing star formation must have ceased doing so recentlyin order to account for their blue optical colours. the gas phase metallicityof the actively starforming blue early-types galaxies is supersolar in allcases. we discuss the place of these objects in the context of galaxyformation. a catalogue of all 204 blue early-type galaxies in our sample,including star formation rates and emission line classification, is provided.

0905.0850	how old are sn ia progenitor systems? new observational constraints on  the distribution of time delays from galex	the time delay between the formation of the progenitor systems of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and their detonation is a vital discriminant between thevarious progenitor scenarios that have been proposed for them. we use sdssoptical and galex ultraviolet observations of the early-type host galaxies of21 nearby sne ia and quantify the presence or absence of any young stellarpopulation to constrain the minimum time delay for each supernova. we find thatearly-type host galaxies lack `prompt' sne ia with time delays of &lt;100 myr andthat ~70% sne ia have minimum time delays of 275 myr -- 1.25 gyr, with a medianof 650 myr, while at least 20% sne ia have minimum time delays of at least 1gyr at 95% confidence and two of these four sne ia are are likely older than 2gyr. the distribution of minimum time delays observed matches most closely theexpectation for the single-degenerate channel with a main sequence donor.furthermore, we do not find any evidence that sub-luminous sne ia areassociated with long time delays.

0906.0994	galaxy zoo: a correlation between coherence of galaxy spin chirality and  star formation efficiency	we report on the finding of a correlation between galaxies' past starformation activity and the degree to which neighbouring galaxies rotation axesare aligned. this is obtained by cross-correlating star formation histories,derived with moped, and spin direction (chirality), as determined by the galaxyzoo project, for a sample of sdss galaxies. our findings suggest that spiralgalaxies which formed the majority of their stars early (z &gt; 2) tend to displaycoherent rotation over scales of ~10 mpc/h. the correlation is weaker forgalaxies with significant recent star formation. we find evidence for thisalignment at more than the 5-sigma level, but no correlation with other galaxystellar properties. this finding can be explained within the context ofhierarchical tidal-torque theory if the sdss galaxies harboring the majority ofthe old stellar population where formed in the past, in the same filament andat about the same time. galaxies with significant recent star formation insteadare in the field, thus influenced by the general tidal field that will alignthem in random directions or had a recent merger which would promote starformation, but deviate the spin direction.

0906.5304	galaxy zoo : 'hanny's voorwerp', a quasar light echo?	we report the discovery of an unusual object near the spiral galaxy ic 2497,discovered by visual inspection of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) as partof the galaxy zoo project. the object, known as hanny's voorwerp, is bright inthe sdss g band due to unusually strong oiii 4959-5007 emission lines. wepresent the results of the first targeted observations of the object in theoptical, uv and x-ray, which show that the object contains highly ionized gas.although the line ratios are similar to extended emission-line regions nearluminous agn, the source of this ionization is not apparent. the emission-lineproperties, and lack of x-ray emission from ic 2497, suggest either a highlyobscured agn with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of theobject but not the galaxy's own circumnuclear gas, or, as we argue, the firstdetection of a quasar light echo. in this case, either the luminosity of thecentral source has decreased dramatically or else the obscuration in the systemhas increased within 10^5 years. this object may thus represent the firstdirect probe of quasar history on these timescales.

0907.4155	galaxy zoo green peas: discovery of a class of compact extremely  star-forming galaxies	we investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as"green peas", first noted by volunteers in the galaxy zoo project because oftheir peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in sdss imaging.their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [o iii]5007 a, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to ~1000 a. we discuss awell-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are stronglystar forming, although there are some agn interlopers including 8 newlydiscovered narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies. the star-forming peas are low massgalaxies (m~10^8.5 - 10^10 m_sun) with high star formation rates (~10m_sun/yr), low metallicities (log[o/h] + 12 ~ 8.7) and low reddening (e(b-v) &lt;0.25) and they reside in low density environments. they have some of thehighest specific star formation rates (up to ~10^{-8} yr^{-1}) seen in thelocal universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds ofmyrs. the few star-forming peas with hst imaging appear to have several clumpsof bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that mayindicate recent or ongoing mergers. the peas are similar in size, mass,luminosity and metallicity to luminous blue compact galaxies. they are alsosimilar to high redshift uv-luminous galaxies, e.g., lyman-break galaxies andlyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which tostudy the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshiftgalaxies. studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essentialto understanding the build up of stellar mass in the universe.

0908.2033	galaxy zoo: reproducing galaxy morphologies via machine learning	we present morphological classifications obtained using machine learning forobjects in sdss dr6 that have been classified by galaxy zoo into three classes,namely early types, spirals and point sources/artifacts. an artificial neuralnetwork is trained on a subset of objects classified by the human eye and wetest whether the machine learning algorithm can reproduce the humanclassifications for the rest of the sample. we find that the success of theneural network in matching the human classifications depends crucially on theset of input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. the coloursand parameters associated with profile-fitting are reasonable in separating theobjects into three classes. however, these results are considerably improvedwhen adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. theadaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguishbetween early type galaxies and the point sources/artifacts. using a set oftwelve parameters, the neural network is able to reproduce the humanclassifications to better than 90% for all three morphological classes. we findthat using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade ourresults given our particular choice of the input parameters to the network. weconclude that it is promising to use machine- learning algorithms to performmorphological classification for the next generation of wide-field imagingsurveys and that the galaxy zoo catalogue provides an invaluable training setfor such purposes.

0910.4113	galaxy zoo: passive red spirals	we study the spectroscopic properties and environments of red spiral galaxiesfound by the galaxy zoo project. by carefully selecting face-on, disk dominatedspirals we construct a sample of truly passive disks (not dust reddened, nordominated by old stellar populations in a bulge). as such, our red spiralsrepresent an interesting set of possible transition objects between normal bluespirals and red early types. we use sdss data to investigate the physicalprocesses which could have turned these objects red without disturbing theirmorphology. red spirals prefer intermediate density regimes, however there areno obvious correlations between red spiral properties and environment -environment alone is not sufficient to determine if a spiral will become red.red spirals are a small fraction of spirals at low masses, but are asignificant fraction at large stellar masses - massive galaxies are redindependent of morphology. we confirm that red spirals have older stellar popnsand less recent star formation than the main spiral population. while thepresence of spiral arms suggests that major star formation cannot have ceasedlong ago, we show that these are not recent post-starbursts, so star formationmust have ceased gradually. intriguingly, red spirals are ~4 times more likelythan normal spirals to host optically identified seyfert or liner, with most ofthe difference coming from liners. we find a curiously large bar fraction inthe red spirals suggesting that the cessation of star formation and barinstabilities are strongly correlated. we conclude by discussing the possibleorigins. we suggest they may represent the very oldest spiral galaxies whichhave already used up their reserves of gas - probably aided by strangulation,and perhaps bar instabilities moving material around in the disk.

0912.0259	environment and self-regulation in galaxy formation	the environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxiesconsiderably best visible through the well-known morphology-densityrelationship. in this paper we study the effect of environment on the evolutionof early-type galaxies by analysing the stellar population properties of 3,360galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the sdss in theredshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.06. we find that the distribution of ages is bimodalwith a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ~2.5gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. this is analogue to 'redsequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containingboth early and late type galaxies. the fraction of the young, rejuvenatedgalaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasingenvironmental density up to about 45 per cent. the rejuvenated galaxies havelower alpha/fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoingstar formation through their emission line spectra. all objects that host agnin their centres without star formation are part of the red sequencepopulation. we confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results thatluminosity weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha/fe element ratios of the redsequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass.most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive toenvironmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. we infer thatearly-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billionyears ago around z~0.2. a self-regulated formation phase without environmentaldependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which theenvironment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy interactions.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1001.1744	galaxy zoo: dust in spirals	we investigate the effect of dust on spiral galaxies by measuring theinclination-dependence of optical colours for 24,276 well-resolved sdssgalaxies visually classified in galaxy zoo. we find clear trends of reddeningwith inclination which imply a total extinction from face-on to edge-on of 0.7,0.6, 0.5 and 0.4 magnitudes for the ugri passbands. we split the sample into"bulgy" (early-type) and "disky" (late-type) spirals using the sdss fracdev (orf_dev) parameter and show that the average face-on colour of "bulgy" spirals isredder than the average edge-on colour of "disky" spirals. this shows that theobserved optical colour of a spiral galaxy is determined almost equally by thespiral type (via the bulge-disk ratio and stellar populations), and reddeningdue to dust. we find that both luminosity and spiral type affect the totalamount of extinction, with "disky" spirals at m_r ~ -21.5 mags having the mostreddening. this decrease of reddening for the most luminous spirals has notbeen observed before and may be related to their lower levels of recent starformation. we compare our results with the latest dust attenuation models oftuffs et al. we find that the model reproduces the observed trends reasonablywell but overpredicts the amount of u-band attenuation in edge-on galaxies. weend by discussing the effects of dust on large galaxy surveys and emphasizethat these effects will become important as we push to higher precisionmeasurements of galaxy properties and their clustering.

1001.3141	galaxy zoo: the fundamentally different co-evolution of supermassive  black holes and their early- and late-type host galaxies	we use data from the sloan digital sky survey and visual classifications ofmorphology from the galaxy zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearbyuniverse (z &lt; 0.05) and to break down the agn host galaxy population by color,stellar mass and morphology. we find that black hole growth at luminositiesl_oiii &gt;1e40 erg/s in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different.agn host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses(1e10-1e11 msun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram andtheir central black holes have median masses around 1e6.5 msun. however, bycomparing early- and late-type agn host galaxies to their non-activecounterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it ispreferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that aregrowing, while late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive}blackholes that are growing. the duty cycle of agn in early-type galaxies isstrongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1e10 msun) of thered sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloudprogenitors. the duty cycle of agn in late-type galaxies on the other handpeaks in massive (1e11 msun) green and red late-types which generally do nothave a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. at high eddingtonratios (l/l_edd &gt; 0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of agnare the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. finally, the milky waylikely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the agn dutycycle of late-type galaxies is highest. we discuss the implications of theseresults for our understanding of the role of agn in the evolution of galaxies

1002.3424	demography of sdss early-type galaxies from the perspective of radial  color gradients	we have investigated the radial g-r color gradients of early-type galaxies inthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr6 in the redshift range 0.00&lt;z&lt;0.06. themajority of massive early-type galaxies show a negative color gradient(red-cored) as generally expected for early-type galaxies. on the other hand,roughly 30 per cent of the galaxies in this sample show a positive colorgradient (blue-cored). these "blue-cored" galaxies often show strong h betaabsorption line strengths and/or emission line ratios that are indicative ofthe presence of young stellar populations. combining the optical data withgalaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv photometry, we find that all blue-coredgalaxies show uv-optical colors that can only be explained by young stellarpopulations. this implies that most of the residual star formation inearly-type galaxies is centrally concentrated. blue-cored galaxies arepredominantly low velocity dispersion systems. a simple model shows that theobserved positive color gradients (blue-cored) are visible only for a billionyears after a star formation episode for the typical strength of recent starformation. the observed effective radius decreases and the mean surfacebrightness increases due to this centrally-concentrated star formation episode.as a result, the majority of blue-cored galaxies may lie on different regionsin the fundamental plane from red-cored ellipticals. however, the position ofthe blue-cored galaxies on the fundamental plane cannot be solely attributed torecent star formation but require substantially lower velocity dispersion. weconclude that a low-level of residual star formation persists at the centers ofmost of low-mass early-type galaxies, whereas massive ones are mostly quiescentsystems with metallicity-driven red cores.

1003.0449	galaxy zoo: bars in disk galaxies	we present first results from galaxy zoo 2, the second phase of the highlysuccessful galaxy zoo project (www.galaxyzoo.org). using a volume-limitedsample of 13665 disk galaxies (0.01&lt; z &lt; 0.06 and m_r&lt;-19.38), we study thefraction of galaxies with bars as a function of global galaxy properties likecolour, luminosity and bulge prominence. overall, 29.4+/-0.5% of galaxies inour sample have a bar, in excellent agreement with previous visually classifiedsamples of galaxies (although this overall fraction is lower than measured byautomated bar-finding methods). we see a clear increase in the bar fractionwith redder (g-r) colours, decreased luminosity and in galaxies with moreprominent bulges, to the extent that over half of the red, bulge-dominated,disk galaxies in our sample possess a bar. we see evidence for a colourbi-modality for our sample of disk galaxies, with a "red sequence" that is bothbulge and bar-dominated, and a "blue cloud" which has little, or no, evidencefor a (classical) bulge or bar. these results are consistent with similartrends for barred galaxies seen recently both locally and at higher redshift,and with early studies using the rc3. we discuss these results in the contextof internal (secular) galaxy evolution scenarios and the possible links to theformation of bars and bulges in disk galaxies.

1003.4018	the role of mergers in early-type galaxy evolution and black hole growth	models of galaxy formation invoke the major merger of gas-rich progenitorgalaxies as the trigger for significant phases of black hole growth and theassociated feedback that suppresses star formation to create red spheroidalremnants. however, the observational evidence for the connection betweenmergers and active galactic nucleus (agn) phases is not clear. we analyze asample of low-mass early-type galaxies known to be in the process of migratingfrom the blue cloud to the red sequence via an agn phase in the green valley.using deeper imaging from sdss stripe 82, we show that the fraction of objectswith major morphological disturbances is high during the early starburst phase,but declines rapidly to the background level seen in quiescent early-typegalaxies by the time of substantial agn radiation several hundred myr after thestarburst. this observation empirically links the agn activity in low-redshiftearly-type galaxies to a significant merger event in the recent past. the largetime delay between the merger-driven starburst and the peak of agn activityallows for the merger features to decay to the background and hence may explainthe weak link between merger features and agn activity in the literature.

1008.1583	a simple model for agn feedback in nearby early-type galaxies	recent work indicates that star-forming early-type galaxies (etgs) residingin the blue cloud migrate rapidly to the red sequence within around a gyr,passing through several phases of increasingly strong agn activity in theprocess (schawinski et al. 2007, mnras, 382, 1415; s07 hereafter). we show thatnatural depletion of the gas reservoir through star formation (i.e. in theabsence of any feedback from the agn) induces a blue-to-red reddening rate thatis several factors lower than that observed in s07. this is because the gasdepletion rate due to star formation alone is too slow, implying that anotherprocess needs to be invoked to remove gas from the system and accelerate thereddening rate. we develop a simple phenomenological model, in which a fractionof the agn's luminosity couples to the gas reservoir over a certain 'feedbacktimescale' and removes part of the gas mass from the galaxy, while theremaining gas continues to contribute to star formation. we use the model toinvestigate scenarios which yield migration times consistent with the resultsof s07. we find that acceptable models have feedback timescales &lt;0.2 gyrs. themass fraction in young stars in the remnants is &lt;5% and the residual gasfractions are less than 0.6%, in good agreement with the recent literature. atleast half of the initial gas reservoir is removed as the galaxies evolve fromthe blue cloud to the red sequence. if we restrict ourselves to feedbacktimescales similar to the typical duty cycles of local agn (a few hundred myrs)then a few tenths of a percent of the luminosity of an early-type seyfert(10^11 lsun) must couple to the gas reservoir in order to produce migrationtimes that are consistent with the observations.

1009.2501	heavily obscured agn in high redshift luminous infrared galaxies	we take advantage of the rich multi-wavelength data available in the chandradeep field south (cdf-s), including the 4 msec chandra observations (thedeepest x-ray data to date), in order to search for heavily-obscuredlow-luminosity agn among infrared-luminous galaxies. in particular, we obtaineda stacked rest-frame x-ray spectrum for samples of galaxies binned in terms oftheir ir luminosity or stellar mass. we detect a significant signal at e~1 to 8kev, which we interpret as originating from a combination of emissionassociated with star-formation processes at low energies combined with aheavily-obscured agn at e&gt;5 kev. we further find that the relative strength ofthis agn signal decays with decreasing ir luminosity, indicating a higher agnfraction for more luminous ir sources. together, these results strongly suggestthe presence of a large number of obscured agn in ir-luminous galaxies. usingsamples binned in terms of stellar mass in the host galaxy, we find asignificant excess at e=6-7 kev for sources with m&gt;10^{11} msun, consistentwith a large obscured agn population in high mass galaxies. in contrast, nostrong evidence of agn activity was found for less-massive galaxies. theintegrated intensity at high energies indicates that a significant fraction ofthe total black hole growth, ~22%, occurs in heavily-obscured systems that arenot individually detected in even the deepest x-ray observations. there arealso indications that the number of low-luminosity, heavily-obscured agn doesnot evolve significantly with redshift, in contrast to the strong evolutionseen in higher luminosity sources.

(1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

0709.3015	observational evidence for agn feedback in early-type galaxies	a major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is theinclusion of so-called agn feedback. the energy input from an active centralmassive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxiesat later epochs. a major problem is that this process is poorly understood, andcompelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. insearch for signatures of agn feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 from the sdss database.key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterionthrough visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased againstrecent star formation and nuclear activity. the objects with emission (~20 percent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in thecolour-mass diagram. star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, whileearly-types with agn are located considerably closer to and almost on the redsequence. star formation-agn composites are found right between these twoextremes. we further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novelmethod that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-uv to near-ir andstellar absorption indices. we find that in those objects deviating from thered sequence star formation occurred several 100 myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. we identify an evolutionary sequence fromstar formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. this transition processlasts about 1 gyr, and the peak agn phase occurs roughly half a gyr after thestarburst. the most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressedby nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.

1104.5394	galaxy zoo: bar lengths in nearby disk galaxies	we present an analysis of bar length measurements of 3150 local galaxies in avolume limited sample of low redshift (z &lt; 0.06) disk galaxies. barred galaxieswere initially selected from the galaxy zoo 2 project, and the lengths andwidths of the bars were manually drawn by members of the galaxy zoo communityusing a google maps interface. bars were measured independently by differentobservers, multiple times per galaxy (&gt;=3), and we find that observers wereable to reproduce their own bar lengths to 3% and each others' to better than20%. we find a "color bimodality" in our disk galaxy population with barlength, i.e., longer bars inhabit redder disk galaxies and the bars themselvesare redder, and that the bluest galaxies host the smallest galactic bars (&lt; 5kpc/h). we also find that bar and disk colors are clearly correlated, and forgalaxies with small bars, the disk is, on average, redder than the bar colors,while for longer bars the bar then itself is redder, on average, than the disk.we further find that galaxies with a prominent bulge are more likely to hostlonger bars than those without bulges. we categorise our galaxy populations byhow the bar and/or ring are connected to the spiral arms. we find that galaxieswhose bars are directly connected to the spiral arms are preferentially bluerand that these galaxies host typically shorter bars. within the scatter, wefind that stronger bars are found in galaxies which host a ring (and only aring). the bar length and width measurements used herein are made publiclyavailable for others to use (http://data.galaxyzoo.org).

1106.1896	improved and quality-assessed emission and absorption line measurements  in sloan digital sky survey galaxies	we present a new database of absorption and emission-line measurements basedon the entire spectral atlas from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) 7th datarelease of galaxies within a redshift of 0.2. our work makes use of thepublicly available penalized pixel-fitting(ppxf) and gas and absorption linefitting (gandalf) idl codes, aiming to improve the existing measurements forstellar kinematics, the strength of various absorption-line features, and theflux and width of the emissions from different species of ionised gas. our fitto the stellar continuum uses both standard stellar population models andempirical templates obtained by combining a large number of stellar spectra inorder to fit a subsample of high-quality sdss spectra for quiescent galaxies.furthermore, our fit to the nebular spectrum includes an exhaustive list ofboth recombination and forbidden lines. foreground galactic extinction isimplicitly treated in our models, whereas reddening in the sdss galaxies isincluded in the form of a simple dust screen component affecting the entirespectrum that is accompanied by a second reddening component affecting only theionised gas emission. in order to check for systematic departures, we provide aquality assessment for our fit to the sdss spectra in our sample. this qualityassessment also allows the identification of objects with either problematicdata or peculiar features. for example, based on the quality assessment,approximately 1% of the sdss spectra classified as "galaxies" by the sdsspipeline do in fact require additional broad lines to be matched, even thoughthey do not show a strong continuum from an active nucleus, as do the sdssobjects classified as "quasars". finally, we provide new spectral templates forgalaxies of different hubble types, obtained by combining the results of ourspectral fit for a subsample of 452 morphologically selected objects.

1106.2163	chandra discovery of a binary active galactic nucleus in mrk 739	we have discovered a binary agn in the galaxy mrk 739 using chandra and swiftbat. we find two luminous l_2-10 kev=1.1*10^43 and 1.0*10^42 erg/s, unresolvednuclei with a projected separation of 3.4 kpc (5.8\pm0.1) coincident with twobulge components in the optical image. the western x-ray source (mrk 739w) ishighly variable (2.5x) during the 4-hour chandra observation and has a veryhard spectrum consistent with an agn. while the eastern component was alreadyknown to be an agn based on the presence of broad optical recombination lines,mrk 739w shows no evidence of being an agn in optical, uv, and radioobservations, suggesting the critical importance of high spatial resolutionhard x-ray observations (&gt;2 kev) in finding these binary agn. a high level ofstar formation combined with a very low l_[o iii]/l_2-10 kev ratio cause theagn to be missed in optical observations. co observations of the (3-2) and(2-1) lines indicate large amounts of molecular gas in the system that could bedriven towards the black holes during the violent galaxy collision and be keyto fueling the binary agn. mrk 739e has a high eddington ratio of 0.71 and asmall black hole (log m_bh=7.05\pm0.3) consistent with an efficiently accretingagn. other than ngc 6240, this stands as the nearest case of a binary agndiscovered to date.

1106.3079	black hole growth in the early universe is self-regulated and largely  hidden from view	the formation of the first massive objects in the infant universe remainsimpossible to observe directly and yet it sets the stage for the subsequentevolution of galaxies. while some black holes with masses &gt; billion solarmasses? have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion yearsafter the big bang, these individual extreme objects have limited utility inconstraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes. the initialconditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growthprocess. from deep, optimally stacked, archival x-ray observations, we measurethe amount of black hole growth in z=6-8 galaxies (0.7-1 billion years afterthe big bang). our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with theirhosts throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. we find thatmost copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significantamounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highestenergy x-rays. this suggests that black holes grow significantly more thanpreviously thought during these early bursts, and due to obscuration they donot contribute to the re-ionization of the universe with their ultravioletemission.

1107.5306	galaxy zoo: dust and molecular gas in early-type galaxies with prominent  dust lanes	we study dust and associated molecular gas in 352 nearby early-type galaxies(etgs) with prominent dust lanes. 65% of these `dusty etgs' (d-etgs) aremorphologically disturbed, suggesting a merger origin. this is consistent withthe d-etgs residing in lower density environments compared to the controlsdrawn from the general etg population. 80% of d-etgs inhabit the field(compared to 60% of the controls) and &lt;2% inhabit clusters (compared to 10% ofthe controls). compared to the controls, d-etgs exhibit bluer uv-opticalcolours (indicating enhanced star formation) and an agn fraction that is morethan an order of magnitude greater (indicating higher incidence of nuclearactivity). the clumpy dust mass residing in large-scale features is estimated,using the sdss r-band images, to be 10^{4.5}-10^{6.5} msun. a comparison to thetotal (clumpy + diffuse) dust masses- calculated using the far-ir fluxes of 15%of the d-etgs that are detected by the iras- indicates that only ~20% of thedust resides in these large-scale features. the dust masses are several timeslarger than the maximum value expected from stellar mass loss, ruling out aninternal origin. the dust content shows no correlation with the blueluminosity, indicating that it is not related to a galactic scale cooling flow.no correlation is found with the age of the recent starburst, suggesting thatthe dust is accreted directly in the merger rather than being produced in situby the triggered star formation. using molecular gas-to-dust ratios of etgs inthe literature we estimate that the median current and initial molecular gasfraction are ~1.3% and ~4%, respectively. recent work suggests that the mergeractivity in nearby etgs largely involves minor mergers (mass ratios between1:10 and 1:4). if the iras-detected d-etgs form via this channel, then theoriginal gas fractions of the accreted satellites are 20%-44%.

1107.5310	galaxy zoo: dust lane early-type galaxies are tracers of recent,  gas-rich minor mergers	we present the second of two papers concerning the origin and evolution oflocal early-type galaxies exhibiting dust features. we use optical and radiodata to examine the nature of active galactic nucleus (agn) activity in theseobjects, and compare these with a carefully constructed control sample. we findthat dust lane early-type galaxies are much more likely to host emission-lineagn than the control sample galaxies. moreover, there is a strong correlationbetween radio and emission-line agn activity in dust lane early-types, but notthe control sample. dust lane early-type galaxies show the same distribution ofagn properties in rich and poor environments, suggesting a similar triggeringmechanism. by contrast, this is not the case for early-types with no dustfeatures. these findings strongly suggest that dust lane early-type galaxiesare starburst systems formed in gas-rich mergers. further evidence in supportof this scenario is provided by enhanced star formation and black holeaccretion rates in these objects. dust lane early-types therefore represent anevolutionary stage between starbursting and quiescent galaxies. in theseobjects, the agn has already been triggered but has not as yet completelydestroyed the gas reservoir required for star formation.

1108.4410	tidal dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe	we present a statistical observational study of the tidal dwarf (td)population in the nearby universe, by exploiting a large, homogeneous catalogueof galaxy mergers compiled from the sdss. 95% of td-producing mergers involvetwo spiral progenitors, while most remaining systems have at least one spiralprogenitor. the fraction of td-producing mergers where both parents areearly-type galaxies is &lt;2%, suggesting that tds are unlikely to form in suchmergers. the bulk of td-producing systems inhabit a field environment and havemass ratios greater than 1:7 (the median value is 1:2.5). tds forming at thetidal-tail tips are ~4 times more massive than those forming at the base of thetails. tds have stellar masses that are less than 10% of the stellar masses oftheir parents and typically lie within 15 optical half-light radii of theirparent galaxies. the td population is typically bluer than the parents, with amedian offset of ~0.3 mag in the (g-r) colour and the td colours are notaffected by the presence of agn activity in their parents. an analysis of theirstar formation histories indicates that tds contain both newly formed stars(with a median age of ~30 myr) and old stars drawn from the parent disks, eachcomponent probably contributing roughly equally to their stellar mass. thus,tds are not formed purely through gas condensation in tidal tails but host asignificant component of old stars from the parent disks. finally, an analysisof the td contribution to the local dwarf-to-massive galaxy ratio indicatesthat ~6% of dwarfs in nearby clusters may have a tidal origin, if td productionrates in nearby mergers are representative of those in the high-redshiftuniverse. even if td production rates at high redshift were several factorshigher, it seems unlikely that the entire dwarf galaxy population today is aresult of merger activity over the lifetime of the universe.

1110.6921	the galaxy zoo survey for giant agn-ionized clouds: past and present  black-hole accretion events	some active galactic nuclei (agn) are surrounded by extended emission-lineregions (eelrs), which trace both the illumination pattern of escapingradiation and its history over the light-travel time from the agn to the gas.from a new set of such eelrs, we present evidence that the agn in many seyfertgalaxies undergo luminous episodes 20,000-200,000 years in duration. motivatedby the discovery of the spectacular nebula known as hanny's voorwerp, ionizedby a powerful agn which has apparently faded dramatically within ~ 100,000years, galaxy zoo volunteers have carried out both targeted and serendipitoussearches for similar emission-line clouds around low-redshift galaxies.wepresent the resulting list of candidates and describe spectroscopy identifying19 galaxies with agn-ionized regions at projected radii &gt; 10 kpc. this searchrecovered known eelrs and identified additional previously unknown cases, onewith detected emission to r = 37 kpc. at least 14/19 are in interacting ormerging systems; tidal tails are a prime source of extraplanar ionized gas. wesee a mix of one- and two-sided structures, with observed cone angles from23-112 degrees. we consider the energy balance in the ionized clouds, withlower and upper bounds on ionizing luminosity from recombination andionization-parameter arguments, and estimate the luminosity of the core fromthe far-infrared data. the implied ratio of ionizing radiation seen by theclouds to that emitted by the nucleus, for a constant nuclear source, rangesfrom 0.02 to &gt; 12; 7/19 exceed unity. small values imply heavily obscured agn.however, large values may require that the agn has faded over tens of thousandsof years, giving us several examples of systems in which such dramaticlong-period variation has occurred; this is the only current technique foraddressing these timescales in agn history.

1111.0969	galaxy zoo: the environmental dependence of bars and bulges in disc  galaxies	we present an analysis of the environmental dependence of bars and bulges indisc galaxies, using a volume-limited catalogue of 15810 galaxies at z&lt;0.06from the sloan digital sky survey with visual morphologies from the galaxy zoo2 project. we find that the likelihood of having a bar, or bulge, in discgalaxies increases when the galaxies have redder (optical) colours and largerstellar masses, and observe a transition in the bar and bulge likelihoods, suchthat massive disc galaxies are more likely to host bars and bulges. we usegalaxy clustering methods to demonstrate statistically significantenvironmental correlations of barred, and bulge-dominated, galaxies, fromprojected separations of 150 kpc/h to 3 mpc/h. these environmental correlationsappear to be independent of each other: i.e., bulge-dominated disc galaxiesexhibit a significant bar-environment correlation, and barred disc galaxiesshow a bulge-environment correlation. we demonstrate that approximately half(50 +/- 10%) of the bar-environment correlation can be explained by the factthat more massive dark matter haloes host redder disc galaxies, which are thenmore likely to have bars. likewise, we show that the environmental dependenceof stellar mass can only explain a small fraction (25 +/- 10%) of thebar-environment correlation. therefore, a significant fraction of our observedenvironmental dependence of barred galaxies is not due to colour or stellarmass dependences, and hence could be due to another galaxy property. finally,by analyzing the projected clustering of barred and unbarred disc galaxies withhalo occupation models, we argue that barred galaxies are in slightlyhigher-mass haloes than unbarred ones, and some of them (approximately 25%) aresatellite galaxies in groups. we also discuss implications about the effects ofminor mergers and interactions on bar formation.

1111.5008	spheroidal post-mergers in the local universe	galaxy merging is a fundamental aspect of the standard hierarchical galaxyformation paradigm. recently, the galaxy zoo project has compiled a large,homogeneous catalogue of 3373 mergers, through direct visual inspection of theentire sdss spectro- scopic sample. we explore a subset of galaxies from thiscatalogue that are spheroidal 'post-mergers' (spms) - where a single remnant isin the final stages of relaxation after the merger and shows evidence for adominant bulge, making them plausible progenitors of early-type galaxies. ourresults indicate that the spms have bluer colours than the general early-typegalaxy population possibly due to merger-induced star formation. an analysisusing optical emission line ratios indicates that 20 of our spms exhibit lineror seyfert-like activity (68%), while the remaining 10 galaxies are classifiedas either star forming (16%) or quiescent (16%). a comparison to the emissionline activity in the ongoing mergers from darg et al. indicates that the agnfraction rises in the post-mergers, suggesting that the agn phase probablybecomes dominant only in the very final stages of the merger process. theoptical colours of the spms and the plausible mass ratios for their progenitorsindicate that, while a minority are consistent with major mergers between twoearly-type galaxies, the vast majority are remnants of major mergers where atleast one progenitor is a late-type galaxy.

1111.6973	evidence for three accreting black holes in a galaxy at z~1.35: a  snapshot of recently formed black hole seeds?	one of the key open questions in cosmology today pertains to understandingwhen, where and how super massive black holes form, while it is clear thatmergers likely play a significant role in the growth cycles of black holes, howsupermassive black holes form, and how galaxies grow around them. here, wepresent hubble space telescope wfc3/ir grism observations of a clumpy galaxy atz=1.35, with evidence for 10^6 - 10^7 msun rapidly growing black holes inseparate sub-components of the host galaxy. these black holes could have beenbrought into close proximity as a consequence of a rare multiple galaxy mergeror they could have formed in situ. such holes would eventually merge into acentral black hole as the stellar clumps/components presumably coalesce to forma galaxy bulge. if we are witnessing the in-situ formation of multiple blackholes, their properties can inform seed formation models and raise thepossibility that massive black holes can continue to emerge in star-forminggalaxies as late as z=1.35 (4.8 gyr after the big bang).

1203.6847	another thread in the tapestry of stellar feedback: x-ray binaries	we consider x-ray binaries (xbs) as potential sources of stellar feedback.xbs observationally appear able to deposit a high fraction of their poweroutput into their local interstellar medium, which may make them anon-negligible source of energy input. the formation rate of the most luminousxbs rises with decreasing metallicity, which should increase their significanceduring galaxy formation in the early universe. we also argue that stochasticeffects are important to xb feedback (xbf) and may dominate the systematicchanges due to metallicity in many cases. large stochastic variation in themagnitude of xbf at low absolute star formation rates provides a natural reasonfor diversity in the evolution of dwarf galaxies which were initially almostidentical, with several percent of such halos experiencing energy input fromxbs roughly two orders of magnitude above the most likely value. theseprobability distributions suggest that the effect of xbf is most commonlysignificant for total stellar masses between ~10^7 and 10^8 msun, which mightresolve a current problem with modelling populations of such galaxies. weexplain how xbs might inject energy before luminous supernovae (sne) contributesignificantly to feedback and how xbs can assist in keeping gas hot long afterthe last core-collapse sn has exploded. [...] xbf could be especially importantto some dwarf galaxies, potentially heating gas without expelling it; theproperties of xbf also match those previously derived as allowing episodic starformation. we also argue that the efficiency of sn feedback (snf) might bereduced when xbf has had the opportunity to act first. in addition, we notethat the effect of snf is unlikely to be scale-free; galaxies smaller than ~100pc might well experience less effective snf.

[o iii] and h-alpha+ [n ii] images show fine structure in hanny's voorwerp, with limb-brightenedsections and small areas where h-alpha is strong. we identify these as regionsionized by recent star formation, in contrast to the agn ionization of theentire cloud. these candidate "normal" h ii regions contain blue continuumobjects, whose colors are consistent with young stellar populations; theyappear only in a 2-kpc region toward ic 2497 in projection. theionization-sensitive ratio [o iii]/h-alpha shows no discernible pattern nearthe prominent "hole" in the ionized gas. the independence of ionization andsurface brightness suggests that substantial spatial structure remainsunresolved, to such an extent that the surface brightness sample the number ofdenser filaments rather than the characteristic density in emission regions.these results fit with our picture of an ionization echo from an agn whoseionizing luminosity has dropped by a factor &gt; 100 (and possibly much more)within the last 1-2 x 10^5 years; we suggest a sequence of events and discussimplications of such rapid fluctuations for agn demographics.

1206.5020	galaxy zoo: quantifying morphological indicators of galaxy interaction	we use galaxy zoo 2 visual classifications to study the morphologicalsignatures of interaction between similar-mass galaxy pairs in the sloandigital sky survey. we find that many observable features correlate withprojected pair separation; not only obvious indicators of merging, disturbanceand tidal tails, but also more regular features, such as spiral arms and bars.these trends are robustly quantified, using a control sample to account forobservational biases, producing measurements of the strength and separationscale of various morphological responses to pair interaction. for example, wefind that the presence of spiral features is enhanced at scales &lt; 70 h^-1 kpc,probably due to both increased star formation and the formation of tidal tails.on the other hand, the likelihood of identifying a bar decreases significantlyin pairs with separations &lt; 30 h^-1 kpc, suggesting that bars are suppressed byclose interactions between galaxies of similar mass. we go on to show howmorphological indicators of physical interactions provide a way ofsignificantly refining standard estimates for the frequency of close pairinteractions, based on velocity offset and projected separation. the presenceof loosely wound spiral arms is found to be a particularly reliable signal ofan interaction, for projected pair separations up to ~100 h^-1 kpc. we use thisindicator to demonstrate our method, constraining the fraction of low-redshiftgalaxies in truly interacting pairs, with m_* &gt; 10^9.5 m_sun and mass ratio &lt;4, to be between 0.4 - 2.7 per cent.

(3) both theradio and the emission-line luminosity of radio agn evolve significantly withredshift. however, radio galaxies with similar stellar population parameters,have similar emission-line properties both at high- and at low-redshift. theseresults suggest that massive galaxies experience cyclical episodes of gasaccretion, star formation and black hole growth, followed by the production ofa radio jet that shuts down further activity. the behaviour of galaxies withlog m*/msun &gt; 11.4 is the same at z = 0.6 as it is at z = 0.2, except thathigher redshift galaxies experience more star formation and black hole growthand produce more luminous radio jets during each accretion cycle.

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

1306.2325	the hot and energetic universe: the formation and growth of the earliest  supermassive black holes	a crucial challenge in astrophysics over the coming decades will be tounderstand the origins of supermassive black holes (smbhs) that lie at thecentres of most, if not all, galaxies. the processes responsible for theinitial formation of these smbhs and their early growth via accretion - whenthey are seen as active galactic nuclei (agn) - remain unknown. to address thischallenge, we must identify low luminosity and obscured z&gt;6 agns, whichrepresent the bulk of early smbh growth. sensitive x-ray observations are aunique signpost of accretion activity, uncontaminated by star formationprocesses, which prevent reliable agn identification at other wavelengths (e.g.optical, infrared). the athena+ wide field imager will enable x-ray surveys tobe carried out two orders of magnitude faster than with chandra or xmm-newton,opening a new discovery space and identifying over 400 z&gt;6 agn, includingobscured sources. athena+ will also play a fundamental role to enhance thescientific return of future multiwavelength facilities that will probe thephysical conditions within the host galaxies of early smbhs, which is vital forunderstanding how smbhs form, what fuels their subsequent growth, and to assesstheir impact on the early universe. follow-up of samples of z&gt;6 galaxies withthe athena+ x-ray integral field unit could also reveal the presence of highlyobscured agns, thanks to the detection of strong iron lines. thus, athena+ willenable the first quantitative measurements of the extent and distribution ofsmbh accretion in the early universe.

1310.2941	galaxy zoo: observing secular evolution through bars	in this paper, we use the galaxy zoo 2 dataset to study the behavior of barsin disk galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate (ssfr), andbulge prominence. our sample consists of 13,295 disk galaxies, with an overall(strong) bar fraction of $23.6\pm 0.4\%$, of which 1,154 barred galaxies alsohave bar length measurements. these samples are the largest ever used to studythe role of bars in galaxy evolution. we find that the likelihood of a galaxyhosting a bar is anti-correlated with ssfr, regardless of stellar mass or bulgeprominence. we find that the trends of bar likelihood and bar length with bulgeprominence are bimodal with ssfr. we interpret these observations usingstate-of-the-art simulations of bar evolution which include live halos and theeffects of gas and star formation. we suggest our observed trends of barlikelihood with ssfr are driven by the gas fraction of the disks; a factordemonstrated to significantly retard both bar formation and evolution inmodels. we interpret the bimodal relationship between bulge prominence and barproperties as due to the complicated effects of classical bulges and centralmass concentrations on bar evolution, and also to the growth of diskypseudobulges by bar evolution. these results represent empirical evidence forsecular evolution driven by bars in disk galaxies. this work suggests that barsare not stagnant structures within disk galaxies, but are a criticalevolutionary driver of their host galaxies in the local universe ($z&lt;1$).

1401.0773	the ultraviolet attenuation law in backlit spiral galaxies	(abridged) the effective extinction law (attenuation behavior) in galaxies inthe emitted ultraviolet is well known only for actively star-forming objectsand combines effects of the grain properties, fine structure in the dustdistribution, and relative distributions of stars and dust. we use galex, xmmoptical monitor, and hst data to explore the uv attenuation in the outer partsof spiral disks which are backlit by other uv-bright galaxies, starting withcandidates provided by galaxy zoo participants. our analysis incorporatesgalaxy symmetry, using non-overlapping regions of each galaxy to derive errorestimates on the attenuation measurements. the entire sample has an attenuationlaw close to the calzetti et al. (1994) form; the uv slope for the overallsample is substantially shallower than found by wild et al. (2011), areasonable match to the more distant galaxies in our sample but not to theweighted combination including ngc 2207. the nearby, bright spiral ngc 2207alone gives accuracy almost equal to the rest of our sample, and its outer armshave a very low level of foreground starlight. this "grey" law can be producedfrom the distribution of dust alone, without a necessary contribution fromdifferential escape of stars from dense clouds. the extrapolation needed tocompare attenution between backlit galaxies at moderate redshifts, and localsystems from sdss data, is mild enough to allow use of galaxy overlaps to tracethe cosmic history of dust. for ngc 2207, the covering factor of clouds withsmall optical attenuation becomes a dominant factor farther into theultraviolet, which opens the possibility that widespread diffuse dust dominatesover dust in star-forming regions deep into the ultraviolet. comparison withpublished radiative-transfer models indicates that the role of dust clumpingdominates over differences in grain populations, at this spatial resolution.

1402.4814	the green valley is a red herring: galaxy zoo reveals two evolutionary  pathways towards quenching of star formation in early- and late-type galaxies	we use sdss+\textit{galex}+galaxy zoo data to study the quenching of starformation in low-redshift galaxies. we show that the green valley between theblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxiesin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through whichmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. rather, an analysis that takesmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blueearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologiesare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.in contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation ratesdecline very slowly. we summarize a range of observations that lead to theseconclusions, including uv-optical colours and halo masses, which both show astriking dependence on morphological type. we interpret these results in termsof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. we conclude thatlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply ofgas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustionof the remaining gas over several gyr, driven by secular and/or environmentalprocesses. in contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gassupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapidquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.this gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, andmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly agnfeedback.

1408.5159	hst imaging of fading agn candidates i: host-galaxy properties and  origin of the extended gas	we present narrow- and medium-band hst imaging, with additional supportingground-based data, for 8 galaxies identified as hosting fading agn. these haveagn-ionized gas projected &gt;10 kpc from the nucleus, and significant shortfallof ionizing radiation between the distant gas and the agn, indicating fadingagn on ~50,000-year timescales. every system shows evidence of ongoing or pastinteractions; a similar sample of obscured agn with extended ionized cloudsshares this incidence of disturbances. several systems show multiple dust lanesin different orientations, broadly fit by differentially precessing disks ofaccreted material ~1.5 gyr after initial arrival. the gas has lower metallicitythan the nuclei; three systems have abundances uniformly well below solar,consistent with an origin in tidally disrupted low-luminosity galaxies, whilesome systems have more nearly solar abundances (accompanied by such signaturesas multiple doppler components), which may suggest redistribution of gas byoutflows within the host galaxies themselves. these aspects are consistent witha tidal origin for the extended gas in most systems, although the ionized gasand stellar tidal features do not always match closely. in contrast to cloudsnear radio-loud agn, these are dominated by rotation, in some cases in warpeddisks. outflows are important only in localized regions near some of the agn.in ugc 7342 and ugc 11185, luminous star clusters are seen within projectedionization cones, potentially triggered by outflows. as in the discoveryexample hanny's voorwerp/ic 2497, some clouds lack a strong correlation betweenh-alpha surface brightness and ionization parameter, indicating unresolved finestructure. together with thin coherent filaments spanning several kpc,persistence of these structures over their orbital lifetimes may require a rolefor magnetic confinement.

1409.1214	galaxy zoo: candels barred disks and bar fractions	the formation of bars in disk galaxies is a tracer of the dynamical maturityof the population. previous studies have found that the incidence of bars indisks decreases from the local universe to z ~ 1, and by z &gt; 1 simulationspredict that bar features in dynamically mature disks should be extremely rare.here we report the discovery of strong barred structures in massive diskgalaxies at z ~ 1.5 in deep rest-frame optical images from candels. from withina sample of 876 disk galaxies identified by visual classification in galaxyzoo, we identify 123 barred galaxies. selecting a sub-sample within the sameregion of the evolving galaxy luminosity function (brighter than l*), we findthat the bar fraction across the redshift range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 2 (f_bar = 10.7 +6.3-3.5% after correcting for incompleteness) does not significantly evolve. wediscuss the implications of this discovery in the context of existingsimulations and our current understanding of the way disk galaxies have evolvedover the last 11 billion years.

1501.01080	a turnover in the galaxy main sequence of star formation at $m_{*} \sim  10^{10} m_{\odot}$ for redshifts $z &lt; 1.3$	the relationship between galaxy star formation rates (sfr) and stellar masses($m_\ast$) is re-examined using a mass-selected sample of $\sim$62,000star-forming galaxies at $z \le 1.3$ in the cosmos 2-deg$^2$ field. using newfar-infrared photometry from $herschel$-pacs and spire and $spitzer$-mips 24$\mu$m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the nrk method based ongalaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram $(nuv - r)$ vs. $(r -k)$, we are able to more accurately determine total sfrs for our completesample. at all redshifts, the relationship between median $sfr$ and $m_\ast$follows a power-law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant sfrat high stellar masses. we describe a new parameterization that provides thebest fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope,turnover mass, and overall scaling. the turnover in the main sequence occurs ata characteristic mass of about $m_{0} \sim 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ at all redshifts.the low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling risesin sfr as a function of $(1+z)^{4.12 \pm 0.10}$. a broken power-law fit belowand above the turnover mass gives relationships of $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.88 \pm0.06}$ below the turnover mass and $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.27 \pm 0.04}$ abovethe turnover mass. galaxies more massive than $m_\ast \gtrsim 10^{10}\ m_{\rm\odot}$ have on average, a much lower specific star formation rate (ssfr) thanwould be expected by simply extrapolating the traditional linear fit to themain sequence found for less massive galaxies.

1502.01033	galaxy zoo: the effect of bar-driven fueling on the presence of an  active galactic nucleus in disc galaxies	we study the influence of the presence of a strong bar in disc galaxies whichhost an active galactic nucleus (agn). using data from the sloan digital skysurvey and morphological classifications from the galaxy zoo 2 project, wecreate a volume-limited sample of 19,756 disc galaxies at $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.05$ whichhave been visually examined for the presence of a bar. within this sample, agnhost galaxies have a higher overall percentage of bars (51.8%) than inactivegalaxies exhibiting central star formation (37.1%). this difference isprimarily due to known effects; that the presence of both agn and galactic barsis strongly correlated with both the stellar mass and integrated colour of thehost galaxy. we control for this effect by examining the difference in agnfraction between barred and unbarred galaxies in fixed bins of mass and colour.once this effect is accounted for, there remains a small but statisticallysignificant increase that represents 16% of the average barred agn fraction.using the $l_{\rm{[o iii]}}/m_{bh} $ratio as a measure of agn strength, we showthat barred agn do not exhibit stronger accretion than unbarred agn at a fixedmass and colour. the data are consistent with a model in which bar-drivenfueling does contribute to the probability of an actively growing black hole,but in which other dynamical mechanisms must contribute to the direct agnfueling via smaller, non-axisymmetric perturbations.

1502.03444	galaxy zoo: the dependence of the star formation-stellar mass relation  on spiral disk morphology	we measure the stellar mass-star formation rate relation in star-forming diskgalaxies at z&lt;0.085, using galaxy~zoo morphologies to examine differentpopulations of spirals as classified by their kiloparsec-scale structure. weexamine the number of spiral arms, their relative pitch angle, and the presenceof a galactic bar in the disk, and show that both the slope and dispersion ofthe m-sfr relation is constant when varying all the above parameters. we alsoshow that mergers (both major and minor), which represent the strongestconditions for increases in star formation at a constant mass, only boost thesfr above the main relation by ~0.3 dex; this is significantly smaller than theincrease seen in merging systems at z&gt;1. of the galaxies lying significantlyabove the m-sfr relation in the local universe, more than 50% are mergers. weinterpret this as evidence that the spiral arms, which are imperfectreflections of the galaxy's current gravitational potential, are either fullyindependent of the various quenching mechanisms or are completely overwhelmedby the combination of outflows and feedback. the arrangement of the starformation can be changed, but the system as a whole regulates itself even inthe presence of strong dynamical forcing.

0804.4483	galaxy zoo : morphologies derived from visual inspection of galaxies  from the sloan digital sky survey	in order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies onemust first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massivesystems: spirals and early-type systems. this paper introduces a project,galaxy zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly onemillion galaxies, extracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). thisachievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visuallyinspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. the project has obtainedmore than 40,000,000 individual classifications made by ~100,000 participants.we discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how theclassifications were performed and processed. we find that galaxy zoo resultsare consistent with those for subsets of sdss galaxies classified byprofessional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provides a robustmorphological catalogue. obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspectionavoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such ascolour, concentration or structual parameters. in addition, this catalogue canbe used to directly compare sdss morphologies with older data sets. thecolour--magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and weillustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colouralone as a proxy for morphology.

1503.07877	an infrared study of local galaxy mergers	we combine a large, homogeneous sample of $\sim$3000 local mergers with theimperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), to perform a blindfar-infrared (fir) study of the local merger population. the iras-detectedmergers are mostly ($98\%$) spiral-spiral systems, residing in low densityenvironments, a median fir luminosity of $10^{11} l_\odot$ (which translates toa median star formation rate of around 15$m_\odot yr^{-1}$). the fir luminosity-- and therefore the star formation rate -- shows little correlation with grouprichness and scales with the total stellar mass of the system, with little orno dependence on the merger mass ratio. in particular, minor mergers (massratios $&lt;1:3$) are capable of driving strong star formation (between 10 and$173 m_\odot yr^{-1}$) and producing systems that are classified as lirgs,luminous infrared galaxies ($65\%$ of our lirgs are minor mergers), with someminor-merging systems being close to the ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg)limit. optical emission line ratios indicate that the agn fraction increaseswith increasing fir luminosity, with all ulirg mergers having some form of agnactivity. finally, we estimate that the lirg-to-ulirg transition along a mergersequence typically takes place over a relatively short timescale of $\sim$160myr.

1504.02111	major mergers host the most luminous red quasars at z ~ 2: a hubble  space telescope wfc3/ir study	we used the hubble space telescope wfc3 near-infrared camera to image thehost galaxies of a sample of eleven luminous, dust-reddened quasars at z ~ 2 --the peak epoch of black hole growth and star formation in the universe -- totest the merger-driven picture for the co-evolution of galaxies and theirnuclear black holes. the red quasars come from the first+2mass red quasarsurvey and a newer, deeper, ukidss+first sample. these dust-reddened quasarsare the most intrinsically luminous quasars in the universe at all redshifts,and may represent the dust-clearing transitional phase in the merger-drivenblack hole growth scenario. probing the host galaxies in rest-frame visiblelight, the hst images reveal that 8/10 of these quasars have actively merginghosts, while one source is reddened by an intervening lower redshift galaxyalong the line-of-sight. we study the morphological properties of the quasarhosts using parametric sersic fits as well as the non-parametric estimators(gini coefficient, m_{20} and asymmetry). their properties are heterogeneousbut broadly consistent with the most extreme morphologies of local mergingsystems such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies. the red quasars have aluminosity range of log(l_bol) = 47.8 - 48.3 (erg/s) and the merger fraction oftheir agn hosts is consistent with merger-driven models of luminous agnactivity at z=2, which supports the picture in which luminous quasars andgalaxies co-evolve through major mergers that trigger both star formation andblack hole growth.

0805.2612	galaxy zoo: the dependence of morphology and colour on environment	we analyse the relationships between galaxy morphology, colour, environmentand stellar mass using data for over 100,000 objects from galaxy zoo, thelargest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled. weconclusively show that colour and morphology fractions are very differentfunctions of environment. both are sensitive to stellar mass; however, at fixedstellar mass, while colour is also highly sensitive to environment, morphologydisplays much weaker environmental trends. only a small part of both relationscan be attributed to variation in the stellar mass function with environment.galaxies with high stellar masses are mostly red, in all environments andirrespective of their morphology. low stellar-mass galaxies are mostly blue inlow-density environments, but mostly red in high-density environments, againirrespective of their morphology. the colour-density relation is primarilydriven by variations in colour fractions at fixed morphology, in particular thefraction of spiral galaxies that have red colours, and especially at lowstellar masses. we demonstrate that our red spirals primarily include galaxieswith true spiral morphology. we clearly show there is an environmentaldependence for colour beyond that for morphology. before using the galaxy zoomorphologies to produce the above results, we first quantify a luminosity-,size- and redshift-dependent classification bias that affects this dataset, andprobably most other studies of galaxy population morphology. a correction forthis bias is derived and applied to produce a sample of galaxies with reliablemorphological type likelihoods, on which we base our analysis.

0809.1096	destruction of molecular gas reservoirs in early-type galaxies by active  galactic nucleus feedback	residual star formation at late times in early-type galaxies and theirprogenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red,passively evolving systems we see today. likewise, residual or newly accretedreservoirs of molecular gas that are fuelling star formation must be destroyed.this suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonlyattributed to agn feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelledduring a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. however,direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of thismolecular gas and an agn phase has been missing so far. we present newmm-wavelength observations from the iram 30m telescope of a sample of lowredshift sdss early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process ofquenching of late-time star formation. our observations show that thedisappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 myr with theonset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to starformation alone. since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerfulquasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity agn episodes aresufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. this`suppression mode' of agn feedback is very different from the `truncation mode'linked to powerful quasar activity during early phases of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0603244	the physical nature of lyman alpha emitting galaxies at z=3.1	we selected 40 candidate lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) at z ~=3.1 withobserved frame equivalent widths &gt;150a and inferred emission line fluxes&gt;2.5x10^-17 ergs/cm^2/s from deep narrow-band and broad-band musyc images ofthe extended chandra deep field south. covering 992 sq. arcmin, this is thelargest ``blank field'' surveyed for laes at z ~3, allowing an improvedestimate of the space density of this population of 3+-1x10^-4 h_70^3/mpc^3.spectroscopic follow-up of 23 candidates yielded 18 redshifts, all at z ~=3.1.over 80% of the laes are dimmer in continuum magnitude than the typical lymanbreak galaxy spectroscopic limit of r= 25.5 (ab), with a median continuummagnitude r ~=27 and very blue continuum colors, (v-z) ~=0. over 80% of thelaes have the right uvr colors to be selected as lyman break galaxies, but only10% also have r&lt;=25.5. stacking the ubvrizjk fluxes reveals that laes havestellar masses ~=5x10^8 h_70^-2 m_sun and minimal dust extinction, a_v &lt; ~ 0.1.inferred star formation rates are ~=6 h_70^-2 m_sun/yr, yielding a cosmic starformation rate density of 2x10^-3 h_70 m_sun/yr/mpc^3. none of our laecandidates show evidence for rest-frame emission line equivalent widthsew_rest&gt;240a which might imply a non-standard imf. one candidate is detected bychandra, implying an agn fraction of 2+-2% for lae candidate samples. insummary, laes at z ~ 3 have rapid star formation, low stellar mass, little dustobscuration and no evidence for a substantial agn component.

astro-ph;0703503	the look-back time evolution of far-ultraviolet flux from the brightest  cluster elliptical galaxies at z &lt; 0.2	we present the galex uv photometry of the elliptical galaxies in abellclusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) for the study of the look-back timeevolution of the uv upturn phenomenon. the brightest elliptical galaxies (m_r &lt;-22) in 12 remote clusters are compared with the nearby giant ellipticalgalaxies of comparable optical luminosity in the fornax and virgo clusters. thesample galaxies presented here appear to be quiescent without signs of massivestar formation or strong nuclear activity, and show smooth, extended profilesin their uv images indicating that the far-uv (fuv) light is mostly produced byhot stars in the underlying old stellar population. compared to theircounterparts in nearby clusters, the fuv flux of cluster giant ellipticalgalaxies at moderate redshifts fades rapidly with ~ 2 gyrs of look-back time,and the observed pace in fuv - v color evolution agrees reasonably well withthe prediction from the population synthesis models where the dominant fuvsource is hot horizontal-branch stars and their progeny. a similar amount ofcolor spread (~ 1 mag) in fuv - v exists among the brightest cluster ellipticalgalaxies at z ~ 0.1, as observed among the nearby giant elliptical galaxies ofcomparable optical luminosity.

0811.3970	galaxy zoo: disentangling the environmental dependence of morphology and  colour	we analyze the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour withtwo-point clustering statistics, using data from the galaxy zoo, the largestsample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled, extracted from thesloan digital sky survey. we present two-point correlation functions of spiraland early-type galaxies, and we quantify the correlation between morphology andenvironment with marked correlation functions. these yield clear and preciseenvironmental trends across a wide range of scales, analogous to similarmeasurements with galaxy colours, indicating that the galaxy zooclassifications themselves are very precise. we measure morphology markedcorrelation functions at fixed colour and find that they are relatively weak,with the only residual correlation being that of red galaxies at small scales,indicating a morphology gradient within haloes for red galaxies. at fixedmorphology, we find that the environmental dependence of colour remains strong,and these correlations remain for fixed morphology \textit{and} luminosity. animplication of this is that much of the morphology--density relation is due tothe relation between colour and density. our results also have implications forgalaxy evolution: the morphological transformation of galaxies is usuallyaccompanied by a colour transformation, but not necessarily vice versa. aspiral galaxy may move onto the red sequence of the colour-magnitude diagramwithout quickly becoming an early-type. we analyze the significant populationof red spiral galaxies, and present evidence that they tend to be located inmoderately dense environments and are often satellite galaxies in the outskirtsof haloes. finally, we combine our results to argue that central and satellitegalaxies tend to follow different evolutionary paths.
