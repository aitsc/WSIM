0903.1661	the mass-loss return from evolved stars to the lmc: empirical relations  for excess emission at 8 and 24 \mu m	we present empirical relations describing excess emission from evolved starsin the large magellanic cloud (lmc) using data from the sage (surveying theagents of a galaxy's evolution) survey which includes the irac 3.6, 4.5, 5.8and 8.0 \mu m and mips 24, 70 and 160 \mu m bands. we combine the sage datawith the two micron all sky survey (2mass; j, h and ks) and the opticalmagellanic cloud photometric survey (mcps; u, b, v and i) point source catalogsto create complete spectral energy distributions (seds) of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) star candidates in the lmc. agb star outflows are among the mainproducers of dust in a galaxy, and this mass loss results in an excess in thefluxes observed in the 8 and 24 \mic m bands. we identify oxygen-rich,carbon-rich and extreme agb star populations in our sample based on their 2massand irac colors. we calculate excesses fluxes in the mid-ir bands by comparisonof the seds with model photospheres. we find about 16,000 o-rich, 6300 c-richand 1000 extreme sources with reliable 8 \mu m excesses, and about 4500 o-rich,5300 c-rich and 960 extreme sources with reliable 24 \mic m excesses. theexcesses are in the range 0.1 mjy--5 jy. the 8 and 24 \mic m excesses for allthree types of agb candidates show a general increasing trend with luminosity.the dust color temperature derived from the ratio of the 8 and 24 \mic mexcesses decreases with an increase in excess, while the 24 \mic m opticaldepth increases with excess. the extreme agb candidates are the majorcontributors to the mass loss, and we estimate the total agb mass-loss returnto the lmc to be (5.9--13)\times 10^{-3} msun yr^{-1}.

1002.4876	escape of about five per cent of lyman-alpha photons from high-redshift  star-forming galaxies	the lyman-alpha (lya) emission line is the primary observational signature ofstar-forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and has enabled the compilationof large samples of galaxies with which to study cosmic evolution. the resonantnature of the line, however, means that lya photons scatter in the neutralinterstellar medium of their host galaxies, and their sensitivity to absorptionby interstellar dust may therefore be enhanced greatly. this implies that thelya luminosity may be significantly reduced, or even completely suppressed.hitherto, no unbiased empirical test of the escaping fraction (f_esc) of lyaphotons has been performed at high redshifts. here we report that the averagefesc from star-forming galaxies at redshift z = 2.2 is just 5 per cent byperforming a blind narrowband survey in lya and ha. this implies that numerousconclusions based on lya-selected samples will require upwards revision by anorder of magnitude and we provide a benchmark for this revision. we demonstratethat almost 90 per cent of star-forming galaxies emit insufficient lya to bedetected by standard selection criteria. both samples show an anti-correlationof fesc with dust content, and we show that lya- and ha-selection recoverspopulations that differ substantially in dust content and fesc.

1005.0629	the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/4039) revisited: acs and nicmos  observations of a prototypical merger	the acs and nicmos have been used to obtain new hst images of ngc 4038/4039("the antennae"). these new observations allow us to better differentiatecompact star clusters from individual stars, based on both size and color. weuse this ability to extend the cluster luminosity function by approximately twomagnitudes over our previous wfpc2 results, and find that it continues as asingle power law, dn/dl propto l^alpha with alpha=-2.13+/-0.07, down to theobservational limit of mv~-7. similarly, the mass function is a single powerlaw dn/dm propto m^beta with beta=-2.10+/-0.20 for clusters with ages t&lt;3x10^8yr, corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 10^4 to 10^5 msun,depending on the age range of the subsample. hence the power law indices forthe luminosity and mass functions are essentially the same. the luminosityfunction for intermediate-age clusters (i.e., ~100-300 myr old objects found inthe loops, tails, and outer areas) shows no bend or turnover down to mv~-6,consistent with relaxation-driven cluster disruption models which predict theturnover should not be observed until mv~-4. an analysis of individual ~0.5-kpcsized areas over diverse environments shows good agreement between values ofalpha and beta, similar to the results for the total population of clusters inthe system. several of the areas studied show evidence for age gradients, withsomewhat older clusters appearing to have triggered the formation of youngerclusters. the area around knot b is a particularly interesting example, with an~10-50 myr old cluster of estimated mass ~10^6 msun having apparently triggeredthe formation of several younger, more massive (up to 5x10^6 msun) clustersalong a dust lane.

1101.4219	extreme feedback and the epoch of reionization: clues in the local  universe	the source responsible for reionizing the universe at z &gt; 6 remainsuncertain. while an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxiesmay be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of theirionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. attempts tomeasure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lowerredshifts have largely yielded upper limits. in this paper we present new hstcos and archival fuse far-uv spectroscopy of a sample of eleven lyman breakanalogs (lbas), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble thehigh-z lyman break galaxies. we combine these data with sdss optical spectraand spitzer photometry. we also analyze archival fuse observations of fifteentypical uv-bright local starbursts. we find evidence of small covering factorsfor optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. this is based on two independentpieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of thestrongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratioof extinction-corrected h-alpha to uv plus far-ir luminosities. these objectsrepresent three of the four lbas that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),and highly massive (~10^9 mo) dominant central object (dco). these threeobjects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount ofblueshifted ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factorof neutral gas. all four lbas with dcos in our sample show extremely highvelocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s. we show thatthese properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburstthat is exceptionally compact. we speculate that such extreme feedback may berequired to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies.

0710.2622	the escape of lyman photons from a young starburst: the case of haro 11	(abridged) lyman-alpha (lya) is a dominant probe of the galaxy population athigh-z. however, interpretation of data drawn from lya alone hinges on the lyaescape fraction which, due to the complex radiative transport, may varygreatly. here we map the lya emission from local starburst haro 11, a lyaemitter and the only known candidate for low-z lyman continuum emission (lyc).to aid in the interpretation we perform a detailed multi-wavelength analysisand model the stellar population, dust distribution, ionising photon budget,and star-cluster population. we use archival x-ray observations to furtherconstrain properties of the starburst and estimate the hi column density.  the lya morphology is found to be strongly decoupled from stellar and nebular(h-alpha) morphologies. general surface photometry finds only very slightcorrelation between lya and h-halpha, e(b-v), and stellar age. only around thecentral lya-bright cluster do we find the lya/ha ratio at values predicted byrecombination theory. the total lya escape fraction is found to be just 3%. wecompute that ~90% of the lya photons that escape do so after undergoingmultiple resonance scattering events, masking their point of origin. this leadsto a largely symmetric distribution and, by increasing the distance thatphotons must travel to escape, decreases the escape probability significantly.while dust must ultimately be responsible for the destruction of lya, it playslittle role in governing the observed morphology, which is regulated more byism kinematics and geometry. we find tentative evidence for local lyaequivalent width in the immediate vicinity of star-clusters being a function ofcluster age, consistent with hydrodynamic studies. we estimate the ionisingphoton production and further constrain the escape fraction at 900 aa to &lt;~9% .

(2) the relative amount of blue-shifted lyman alpha lineemission, and (3) the relative weakness of the [sii] optical emission lines. weuse these diagnostics to rank-order our sample in terms of likely leakiness,noting that a direct measure of escaping lyman continuum has recently been madefor one of the leakiest members of our sample. we then examine the correlationsbetween our ranking and other proposed diagnostics of leakiness and find acorrelation with the equivalent width of the lyman alpha emission-line. turningto galaxy properties, we find the strongest correlations with leakiness arewith the compactness of the star-forming region and the speed of the galacticoutflow. this suggests that extreme feedback- a high intensity of ionizingradiation and strong pressure from both radiation and a hot galactic wind-combines to create significant holes in the neutral gas. these results not onlyshed new light on the physical mechanisms that can allow ionizing radiation toescape from intensely star-forming galaxies, they also provide indirectobservational indicators that can be used at high-redshift where directmeasurements of escaping lyman continuum radiation are impossible.

1507.00346	supernova-driven outflows in ngc 7552: a comparison of h-alpha and uv  tracers	we investigate the supernova-driven galactic wind of the barred spiral galaxyngc 7552, using both ground-based optical nebular emission lines andfar-ultraviolet absorption lines measured with the hubble space telescopecosmic origins spectrograph. we detect broad (~300 km/s) blueshifted (-40 km/s)optical emission lines associated with the galaxy's kpc-scale star-formingring. the broad line kinematics and diagnostic line ratios suggest that theh-alpha emission comes from clouds of high density gas entrained in a turbulentoutflow. we compare the h-alpha emission line profile to the uv absorption lineprofile measured along a coincident sight line and find significantdifferences. the maximum blueshift of the h-alpha-emitting gas is ~290 km/s,whereas the uv line profile extends to blueshifts upwards of 1000 km/s. themass outflow rate estimated from the uv is roughly nine times greater than thatestimated from h-alpha. we argue that the h-alpha emission traces acluster-scale outflow of dense, low velocity gas at the base of the large-scalewind. we suggest that uv absorption line measurements are therefore morereliable tracers of warm gas in starburst-driven outflows.

1507.05622	the systematic properties of the warm phase of starburst-driven galactic  winds	using ultra-violet absorption-lines, we analyze the systematic properties ofthe warm ionized phase of starburst-driven winds in a sample of 39 low-redshiftobjects that spans broad ranges in starburst and galaxy properties. totalcolumn densities for the outflows are $\sim$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. the outflowvelocity (v$_{out}$) correlates only weakly with the galaxy stellar mass(m$_*$), or circular velocity (v$_{cir}$), but strongly with both sfr andsfr/area. the normalized outflow velocity (v$_{out}/v_{cir}$) correlates wellwith both sfr/area and sfr/m$_*$. the estimated outflow rates of warm ionizedgas ($\dot{m}$) are $\sim$ 1 to 4 times the sfr, and the ratio $\dot{m}/sfr$does not correlate with v$_{out}$.  we show that a model of a population of clouds accelerated by the combinedforces of gravity and the momentum flux from the starburst matches the data. wefind a threshold value for the ratio of the momentum flux supplied by thestarburst to the critical momentum flux needed for the wind to overcome gravityacting on the clouds ($r_{crit}$). for $r_{crit} &gt;$ 10 (strong-outflows) theoutflow momentum flux is similar to the total momentum flux from the starburstand the outflow velocity exceeds the galaxy escape velocity. neither is thecase for the weak-outflows ($r_{crit} &lt;$ 10). for the weak-outflows, the dataseverely disagree with many prescriptions in numerical simulations orsemi-analytic models of galaxy evolution. the agreement is better for thestrong-outflows, and we advocate the use of $r_{crit}$ to guide futureprescriptions.

astro-ph;0012358	ultraviolet line spectra of metal-poor star-forming galaxies	we present synthetic ultraviolet spectra of metal-poor star-forming galaxieswhich were calculated with the starburst99 package. a new spectral library wasgenerated from hst observations of o stars in the large and small magellanicclouds. the corresponding mean metallicity of the synthetic spectra isapproximately 1/4\zs. the spectra have a resolution of 1\aa and cover thespectral range 1200-1600\aa. a set of model spectra was calculated for astandard initial mass function and star-formation history and is compared tosynthetic spectra at solar metallicity. we find that the spectral lines aregenerally weaker at lower metallicity, as expected from the lower elementalabundances. stellar-wind lines, however, show a more complex behavior: themetallicity dependence of the ionization balance can be important in traceions, like n$^{4+}$ and si$^{3+}$. therefore the strength of \nv and \siiv doesnot scale monotonically with metallicity. we compare our new models toultraviolet spectra of ngc 5253 and \cb, two star-forming galaxies with 1/4solar metallicity at low and high redshift, respectively. the new libraryprovides significantly better fits to the observations than earlier modelsusing the \zs library. we discuss the potential of utilizing stellarphotospheric and wind lines to estimate the chemical composition ofstar-forming galaxies. the new metal-poor synthetic spectra are available viathe starburst99 website.

astro-ph;0101327	multiwavelength study of the starburst galaxy ngc 7714. ii: the balance  between young, intermediate age and old stars	we combine existing multiwavelength data (incl. an hst/ghrs uv spectrum, anoptical spectrum, far-ir, xray and radio fluxes) with new hst/wfpc2 images,near-ir photometry and k band spectroscopy. we use these data to constrain theyoung, the intermediate age and the old stellar populations in the central 330pc of the starburst galaxy ngc 7714. [...]  we find that the young burst responsible for the uv light is only a smallpart of an extended episode of enhanced star formation (sf) [...]. the mass ofyoung and intermediate age stars thus formed equals at least 10% of the masslocked in pre-existing stars of the underlying galaxy nucleus [...]. thespectrophotometric sf timescale is long compared to the ~110 myr elapsed sinceclosest contact with ngc 7715. the trigger of the starburst remains elusive.  ngc 7714 owes its brightness in the uv to a few low extinction lines of sighttowards young stars. [...] the different extinction estimates obtained fromdifferent indicators result naturally from the coexistence of populations withvarious ages and obscurations. the near-ir continuum image looks smoothest, asa consequence of lower sensitivity to extinction and of a larger contributionof old stars. we compare the nuclear properties of ngc 7714 with results fromstudies in larger apertures. we emphasize that the global properties ofstarburst galaxies are the result of the averaging over many lines of sightwith diverse properties in terms of obscuration and stellar ages.

astro-ph;0102228	the evolution of emission lines in hii galaxies	we constructed diagnostic diagrams using emission line ratios and equivalentwidths observed in several samples of hii galaxies. the diagrams are comparedto predictions from new photoionization models for evolving starbursts. we findthat hii galaxies from objective-prism surveys are not reproduced by models ofinstantaneous starbursts surrounded by constant density, ionization bounded hiiregions. the observed relations between emission line ratios and hb equivalentwidth (w(hb)) can be understood if older stellar populations are not negligiblein hii galaxies. also, different dust obscuration for stars and gas and leakageof lyman continuum photons from the observed hii regions can be important. as aresult, hii galaxies selected from objective-prism surveys are unlikely tocontain many objects in which the most recent starburst is older than about5~myr. the observed increase of [oi]/hb with decreasing w(hb) can result fromthe dynamical effects of winds and supernovae. this interpretation providesalso a natural explanation of the small range of ionization parameters in gianthii regions. the [oiii]/hb vs [oii]/hb diagnostic diagram cannot be fullyunderstood in terms of pure photoionization models and indicate the need foradditional heating sources. the [nii]/[oii] ratio is shown to increase as w(hb)decreases. a possible explanation is an n/o increase due to gradual enrichmentby winds from wolf-rayet stars on a time scale of 5 myr.

astro-ph;0207091	detection of a super star cluster as the ionizing source in the low  luminosity agn ngc 4303	hst uv stis imaging and spectroscopy of the low luminosity agn (llagn) ngc4303 have identified the previously detected uv-bright nucleus of this galaxy,as a compact, massive and luminous stellar cluster. the cluster with a size(fwhm) of 3.1 pc, and an ultraviolet luminosity log l (1500 a}(erg/s/a)= 38.33is identified as a nuclear super star cluster (ssc) like those detected in thecircumnuclear regions of spirals and starburst galaxies. the uv spectrumshowing the characteristic broad p cygni lines produced by the winds of massiveyoung stars, is best fitted by the spectral energy distribution of a massivecluster of 1e5 msol generated in an instantaneous burst 4 myr ago. no evidencefor an additional non-thermal ionizing source associated with an accretingblack hole is detected in the ultraviolet. we hypothesize that at least somellagns in spirals could be understood as the result of the combined ionizingradiation emitted by an evolving ssc and a black hole (bh) accreting with lowradiative efficiency, coexisting in the inner few parsecs region.

astro-ph;0209067	the massive stellar content in the starburst ngc3049: a test for  hot-star mode	we have obtained high-spatial resolution ultraviolet and optical stisspectroscopy and imaging of the metal-rich nuclear starburst in ngc3049. thestellar continuum and the absorption line spectrum in the ultraviolet are usedto constrain the massive stellar population. the strong, blueshifted stellarlines of civ and siiv detected in the uv spectra indicate a metal-rich,compact, massive (1e6 msol) cluster of age 3--4 myr emitting the uv-opticalcontinuum. we find strong evidence against a depletion of massive stars in thismetal-rich cluster. the derived age and the upper mass-limit cut-off of theinitial mass function are also consistent with the detection of wolf-rayet (wr)features at optical wavelengths. as a second independentconstraint on themassive stellar content, the nebular emission-line spectrum is modeled withphotoionization codes using stellar spectra from evolutionary synthesis models.however, the nebular lines are badly reproduced by 3--4 myr instantaneousbursts, as required by the uv line spectrum, when unblanketed wr and/or kuruczstellar atmospheres are used. the corresponding number of photons above 24 and54 ev in the synthetic models is too high in comparison with values suggestedby the observed line ratios. since the ionizing spectrum in this regime isdominated by emission from wr stars, this discrepancy between observations andmodels is most likely the result of incorrect assumptions about the wr stars.thus we conclude that the nebular spectrum of high-metallicity starbursts ispoorly reproduced by models for wr dominated populations. however, the newmodel set of smith et al. (2002) with blanketed wr and o atmospheres andadjusted wr temperatures predicts a softer far-uv radiation field, providing abetter match to the data.

astro-ph;0209481	synthetic high-resolution line spectra of star-forming galaxies below  1200a	we have generated a set of far-ultraviolet stellar libraries using spectra ofob and wolf-rayet stars in the galaxy and the large and small magellanic cloud.the spectra were collected with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer andcover a wavelength range from 1003.1 to 1182.7a at a resolution of 0.127a. thelibraries extend from the earliest o- to late-o and early-b stars for themagellanic cloud and galactic libraries, respectively. attention is paid to thecomplex blending of stellar and interstellar lines, which can be significant,especially in models using galactic stars. the most severe contamination is dueto molecular hydrogen. using a simple model for the h$_2$ line strength, wewere able to remove the molecular hydrogen lines in a subset of magellaniccloud stars. variations of the photospheric and wind features of ciii 1176, ovi1032, 1038, pv 1118, 1128, and siv 1063, 1073, 1074 are discussed as a functionof temperature and luminosity class. the spectral libraries were implementedinto the lavalsb and starburst99 packages and used to compute a standard set ofsynthetic spectra of star-forming galaxies. representative spectra arepresented for various initial mass functions and star formation histories. thevalid parameter space is confined to the youngest ages of less than 10 myr foran instantaneous burst, prior to the age when incompleteness of spectral typesin the libraries sets in. for a continuous burst at solar metallicity, theparameter space is not limited. the suite of models is useful for interpretingthe restframe far-ultraviolet in local and high-redshift galaxies.

(2) young stars contribute very little to theoptical continuum in the ground-based aperture. however, the fraction of lightprovided by these stars is higher than 10% in most of the weak-[oi] llagn stisspectra. (3) intermediate age stars contribute significantly to the opticalcontinuum of these nuclei. this population is more frequent in objects withweak than with strong [oi]. weak-[oi] llagn that have young stars stand out fortheir intermediate age population. (4) most of the strong-[oi] llagn havepredominantly old stellar population. a few of these objects also show afeature-less continuum that contributes significantly to the optical continuum.these results suggest that young and intermediate age stars do not play asignificant role in the ionization of llagn with strong [oi]. however, theionization in weak-[oi] llagn with young and/or intermediate age populationcould be due to stellar processes.

astro-ph;0401416	stellar population in llagn.i: ground-based observations	(abridge): we present a spectroscopic study of the stellar populations of lowluminosity agn (llagn). our main goal is to determine whether the stars wholive in the innermost (100 pc-scale) regions of these galaxies are in some wayrelated to the emission line properties, which would imply a link between thestellar population and the ionization mechanism. high signal to noise, groundbased long-slit spectra in the 3500--5500 a interval were collected for 60galaxies.our main findings are: (1) few llagn have a detectable young (&lt; 10myr) starburst component, indicating that very massive stars do not contributesignificantly to the optical continuum. in particular, no features due towolf-rayet stars were convincingly detected. (2) high order balmer absorptionlines of hi (hobls), on the other hand, are detected in 40% of llagn.  these features, which are strongest in 100 myr--1 gyr intermediate agestellar populations, are accompanied by diluted metal absorption lines andbluer colors than other objects in the sample. (3) these intermediate agepopulations are very common (50 %) in llagn with relatively weak [oi] emission,but rare (10 %) in llagn with stronger [oi]. this is intriguing since llagnwith weak [oi] have been previously hypothesized to be ``transition objects''in which both an agn and young stars contribute to the emission-lineexcitation. massive stars, if present, are completely outshone by intermediateage and old stars in the optical. this happens in at least a couple of objectswhere independent uv spectroscopy detects young starbursts not seen in theoptical. (4) objects with predominantly old stars span the whole range of[oi]/halpha values, but (5) sources with significant young and/or intermediateage populations are nearly all (90%) weak [oi] emitters.

astro-ph;0407296	spectral modelling of star-forming regions in the ultraviolet: stellar  metallicity diagnostics for high redshift galaxies	the chemical composition of high redshift galaxies is an important propertywhich gives clues to their past history and future evolution and yet isdifficult to measure with current techniques. in this paper we investigate newmetallicity indicators, based upon the strengths of stellar photosphericfeatures at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths. by combining the evolutionaryspectral synthesis code starburst99 with the output from the non-lte modelatmosphere code wm-basic, we have developed a code that can model theintegrated ultraviolet stellar spectra of star-forming regions at metallicitiesbetween 1/20 and twice solar. we use our models to explore a number of spectralregions that are sensitive to metallicity and clean of other spectral features.the most promising metallicity indicator is an absorption feature between 1935a and 2020 a, which arises from the blending of numerous fe iii transitions. wecompare our model spectra to observations of two well studied high redshiftstar-forming galaxies, ms1512-cb58 (a lyman break galaxy at z = 2.7276), andq1307-bm1163 (a uv-bright galaxy at z = 1.411). the profiles of thephotospheric absorption features observed in these galaxies are well reproducedby the models. in addition, the metallicities inferred from their equivalentwidths are in good agreement with previous determinations based on interstellarabsorption and nebular emission lines. our new technique appears to be apromising alternative, or complement, to established methods which have only alimited applicability at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0604604	warm dust and spatially variable pah emission in the dwarf starburst  galaxy ngc 1705	we present spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705obtained as part of sings. the galaxy morphology is very different shortwardand longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying redstellar population, with the central super star cluster (ssc) dominating theluminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from twooff-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the ssc. these regions show littleextinction at optical wavelengths. the galaxy has a relatively low global dustmass (~2e5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 timeslower than the milky way average). the off-nuclear dust emission appears to bepowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for theexcitation of the observed h alpha emission; these photons are unassociatedwith the ssc (though a contribution from embedded sources to the ir luminosityof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). low-resolution irsspectroscopy shows moderate-strength pah emission in the 11.3 micron band inthe eastern peak; no pah emission is detected in the ssc or the western dustemission complex. there is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scalingand subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable pah emissionstrengths revealed by the irs data suggest caution in the interpretation ofdiffuse 8 micron emission as arising from pah carriers alone. the metallicityof ngc 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by engelbracht andcollaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatiallyvariable pah emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8micron emission. a radio continuum non-detection, ngc 1705 deviatessignificantly from the canonical far-ir vs. radio correlation.

astro-ph;0606544	modelling the pan-spectral energy distribution of starburst galaxies:  ii. control of the \hii region parameters	we examine, from a theoretical viewpoint, how the physical parameters of hiiregions are controlled in both normal galaxies and in starburst environments.these parameters are the hii region luminosity function, the time-dependentsize, the covering fraction of molecular clouds, the pressure in the ionizedgas and the ionization parameter. the factors which control them are theinitial mass function of the exciting stars, the cluster mass function, themetallicity and the mean pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. weinvestigate the sensitivity of the h$\alpha$ luminosity to the imf, and findthat this can translate to more than a factor two variation in derived starformation rates. the molecular cloud dissipation timescale is estimated from acase study of m17 to be $\sim1$ myr for this object. based upon hii luminosityfunction fitting for nearby galaxies, we suggest that the \hii region clustermass function is fitted by a log-normal form peaking at $\sim 100 m_{\odot}$.the cluster mass function continues the stellar imf to higher mass. thepressure in the hii regions is controlled by the mechanical luminosity fluxfrom the central cluster. since this is closely related to the ionizing photonflux, we show that the ionization parameter is not a free variable, and thatthe diffuse ionized medium may be composed of many large, faint and old hiiregions. finally, we derive theoretical probability distributions for theionization parameter as a function of metallicity and compare these to thosederived for sdss galaxies.

astro-ph;0608062	modelling the pan-spectral energy distribution of starburst galaxies:  iii. emission line diagnostics of ensembles of evolving hii regions	we build, as far as theory will permit, self consistent model hii regionsaround central clusters of aging stars. these produce strong emission linediagnostics applicable to either individual hii regions in galaxies, or to theintegrated emission line spectra of disk or starburst galaxies. the modelsassume that the expansion and internal pressure of individual hii regions isdriven by the net input of mechanical energy from the central cluster, be itthrough winds or supernova events. this eliminates the ionization parameter asa free variable, replacing it with a parameter which depends on the ratio ofthe cluster mass to the pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. thesemodels explain why hii regions with low abundances have high excitation, anddemonstrate that at least part of the warm ionized medium is the result ofoverlapping faint, old, large, and low pressure hii regions. we present lineratios (at both optical and ir wavelengths) which provide reliable abundancediagnostics for both single hii regions or for integrated galaxy spectra, andwe find a number that can be used to estimate the mean age of the cluster starsexciting individual hii regions.

astro-ph;0608249	the nature of infrared emission in the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822  as revealed by spitzer	we present spitzer imaging of the metal-deficient (z ~30% z_sun) local groupdwarf galaxy ngc 6822. on spatial scales of ~130 pc, we study the nature of ir,h alpha, hi, and radio continuum emission. nebular emission strength correlateswith ir surface brightness; however, roughly half of the ir emission isassociated with diffuse regions not luminous at h alpha (as found in previousstudies). the global ratio of dust to hi gas in the ism, while uncertain at thefactor of ~2 level, is ~25 times lower than the global values derived forspiral galaxies using similar modeling techniques; localized ratios of dust tohi gas are about a factor of five higher than the global value in ngc 6822.there are strong variations (factors of ~10) in the relative ratios of h alphaand ir flux throughout the central disk; the low dust content of ngc 6822 islikely responsible for the different h alpha/ir ratios compared to those foundin more metal-rich environments. the h alpha and ir emission is associated withhigh-column density (&gt; ~1e21 cm^-2) neutral gas. increases in ir surfacebrightness appear to be affected by both increased radiation field strength andincreased local gas density. individual regions and the galaxy as a whole fallwithin the observed scatter of recent high-resolution studies of the radio-farir correlation in nearby spiral galaxies; this is likely the result of depletedradio and far-ir emission strengths in the ism of this dwarf galaxy.

astro-ph;0703699	models for massive stellar populations with rotation	we present and discuss evolutionary synthesis models for massive stellarpopulations generated with the starburst99 code in combination with a new setof stellar evolution models accounting for rotation. the new stellar evolutionmodels were compiled from several data releases of the geneva group and coverheavy-element abundances ranging from twice solar to one fifth solar. theevolution models were computed for rotation velocities on the zero-agemain-sequence of 0 and 300 km/s and with the latest revision of stellarmass-loss rates. since the mass coverage is incomplete, in particular atnon-solar chemical composition, our parameter study is still preliminary andmust be viewed as exploratory. stellar population properties computed withstarburst99 and the new evolution models show some marked differences incomparison with models obtained using earlier tracks. since individual starsnow tend to be more luminous and bluer when on the blue side of thehertzsprung-russell diagram, the populations mirror this trend. for instance,increases by factors of two or more are found for the light-to-mass ratios atultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, as well as for the output of hydrogenionizing photons. if these results are confirmed once the evolution models havematured, recalibrations of certain star-formation and initial mass functionindicators will be required.

astro-ph;9602084	hst ultraviolet spectroscopy of ngc 1741- a nearby template for distant  energetic starbursts	we have obtained a hubble space telescope ultraviolet image and spectrum ofthe nearby wolf-rayet galaxy ngc 1741. the spatial morphology from the faintobject camera image is dominated by two main starburst centers, each beingabout 100 times as luminous as 30 doradus. both starburst centers are composedof several intense knots of recent star formation. a goddard high resolutionspectrograph spectrum of a portion of the southern starburst center isconsistent with a population of young stars following a salpeter imf for massesabove approx 15 msun (lower mass stars may also be present), and extending upto approx 100 msun; about 10^4 o-type stars are inferred from the uvluminosity. numerous strong interstellar lines are detected. although notresolved, their strength suggests that they are formed in individual bubblesand shells with velocities up to a few hundred kms. the red wing of thelyman-alpha absorption profile indicates the presence of several neutralhydrogen components, one in our own galaxy and the others at or close to thedistance of ngc 1741. overall, the stellar and interstellar line spectrum, aswell as the continuum shape of ngc 1741, strongly resembles star-forminggalaxies recently discovered at high redshift.

astro-ph;9704077	the panchromatic starburst intensity limit at low and high redshift	the integrated bolometric effective surface brightness s_e distributions ofstarbursts are investigated for samples observed in 1. the rest frameultraviolet (uv), 2. the far-infrared and h-alpha, and 3. 21cm radio continuumemission. for the uv sample we exploit a tight empirical relationship betweenuv reddening and extinction to recover the bolometric flux. parameterizing thes_e upper limit by the 90th percentile of the distribution, we find a means_{e,90} = 2.0e11 l_{sun}/kpc^2 for the three samples, with a factor of threedifference between the samples. this is consistent with what is expected fromthe calibration uncertainties alone. we find little variation in s_{e,90} witheffective radii for r_e ~ 0.1 - 10 kpc, and little evolution out to redshifts z~ 3. the lack of a strong dependence of s_{e,90} on wavelength, and itsconsistency with the pressure measured in strong galactic winds, argue that itcorresponds to a global star formation intensity limit (\dot\sigma_{e,90} ~ 45m_{sun}/kpc^2/yr) rather than being an opacity effect. there are severalimportant implications of these results: 1. there is a robust physicalmechanism limiting starburst intensity. we note that starbursts have s_econsistent with the expectations of gravitational instability models applied tothe solid body rotation portion of galaxies. 2. elliptical galaxies and spiralbulges can plausibly be built with maximum intensity bursts, while normalspiral disks can not. 3. the uv extinction of high-z galaxies is significant,implying that star formation in the early universe is moderately obscured.after correcting for extinction, the observed metal production rate at z ~ 3agrees well with independent estimates made for the epoch of elliptical galaxyformation.

astro-ph;9803185	the ultraviolet spectroscopic properties of local starbursts:  implications at high-redshift	we report the results of a systematic study of the vacuum-ultraviolet spectraof 45 starburst and related galaxies observed with the iue satellite. thesespan broad ranges in metallicity, bolometric luminosity, and galaxy properties.the projected size of the iue spectroscopic aperture is typically one toseveral kpc and therefore usually encompasses the entire starburst and issimilar to the aperture-sizes used for spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies.our principal conclusion is that local starbursts occupy a very smallfractional volume in the multi-dimensional manifold defined by such fundamentalparameters as the extinction, metallicity, and vacuum-uv line strengths (bothstellar and interstellar) of the starburst and the rotation speed (mass) andabsolute magnitude of the starburst's `host' galaxy. more metal-rich starburstsare redder and more heavily extinguished in the uv, more luminous, havestronger vacuum-uv lines, and occur in more massive and optically-brighter hostgalaxies. the results on local starbursts suggest that the high-redshift `lymandrop-out' galaxies are typically highly reddened and extinguished by dust(average factor of 5 to 10 in the uv), may have moderately high metallicities(0.1 to 1 times solar?), are probably building galaxies with stellar surface-mass-densities similar to present-day ellipticals, and may be sufferingsubstantial losses of metal-enriched gas that can `pollute' the igm.
