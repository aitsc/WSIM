0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0901.0519	swift grbs and the blast wave model	the complex structure of the light curves of swift grbs has made theirinterpretation and that of the blast wave caused by the burst, more difficultthan in the pre-swift era. we aim to constrain the blast wave parameters:electron energy distribution, p, density profile of the circumburst medium, k,and the continued energy injection index, q. we do so by comparing the observedmulti-wavelength light curves and x-ray spectra of a swift sample to thepredictions of the blast wave model.  we can successfully interpret all of the bursts in our sample of 10, excepttwo, within the framework of the blast wave model, and we can estimate withconfidence the electron energy distribution index for 6 of the sample.furthermore we identify jet breaks in half of the bursts. a statisticalanalysis of the distribution of p reveals that, even in the most conservativecase of least scatter, the values are not consistent with a single, universalvalue. the values of k suggest that the circumburst density profiles are notdrawn from only one of the constant density or wind-like media populations.

0704.1297	the exceptionally extended flaring activity in the x-ray afterglow of  grb 050730 observed with swift and xmm-newton	we present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of swiftand xmm-newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) grb 050730. thex-ray afterglow of grb 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposedintense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitudein time. seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ksafter the burst were observed. the underlying decay of the afterglow was welldescribed by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 sand t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. the temporal decay slopes before, between andafter these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. the spectrum of the x-rayafterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with anabsorbing column density n_h=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.strong x-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. in themajority of the flares (6/7) the ratio delta_t/t_p between the duration of theevent and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.we showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first threeflares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, asexpected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshedshocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slowmoving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. theevent fully satisfies the e_p-e_iso amati relation while is not consistent withthe e_p-e_jet ghirlanda relation.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0908.3798	can x-ray emission powered by a spinning-down magnetar explain some grb  light curve features?	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are thought to be produced by thecore-collapse of a rapidly-rotating massive star. this event generates a highlyrelativistic jet and prompt gamma-ray and x-ray emission arises from internalshocks in the jet or magnetised outflows. if the stellar core does notimmediately collapse to a black hole, it may form an unstable, highlymagnetised millisecond pulsar, or magnetar. as it spins down, the magnetarwould inject energy into the jet causing a distinctive bump in the grb lightcurve where the emission becomes fairly constant followed by a steep decay whenthe magnetar collapses. we assume that the collapse of a massive star to amagnetar can launch the initial jet. by automatically fitting the x-raylightcurves of all grbs observed by the swift satellite we identified a subsetof bursts which have a feature in their light curves which we call an internalplateau -- unusually constant emission followed by a steep decay -- which maybe powered by a magnetar. we use the duration and luminosity of this internalplateau to place limits on the magnetar spin period and magnetic field strengthand find that they are consistent with the most extreme predicted values formagnetars.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1207.1444	a search for thermal x-ray signatures in gamma-ray bursts i: swift  bursts with optical supernovae	the x-ray spectra of gamma-ray bursts can generally be described by anabsorbed power law. the landmark discovery of thermal x-ray emission inaddition to the power law in the unusual grb 060218, followed by a similardiscovery in grb 100316d, showed that during the first thousand seconds aftertrigger the soft x-ray spectra can be complex. both the origin and prevalenceof such spectral components still evade understanding, particularly after thediscovery of thermal x-ray emission in the classical grb 090618. possibly mostimportantly, these three objects are all associated with optical supernovae,begging the question of whether the thermal x-ray components could be a resultof the grb-sn connection, possibly in the shock breakout. we thereforeperformed a search for blackbody components in the early swift x-ray spectra of11 grbs that have or may have associated optical supernovae, accuratelyrecovering the thermal components reported in the literature for grbs 060218,090618 and 100316d. we present the discovery of a cooling blackbody in grb101219b/sn2010ma, and in four further grb-sne we find an improvement in the fitwith a blackbody which we deem possible blackbody candidates due tocase-specific caveats. all the possible new blackbody components we report lieat the high end of the luminosity and radius distribution. grb 101219b appearsto bridge the gap between the low-luminosity and the classical grb-sne withthermal emission, and following the blackbody evolution we derive an expansionvelocity for this source of order 0.4c. we discuss potential origins for thethermal x-ray emission in our sample, including a cocoon model which we findcan accommodate the more extreme physical parameters implied by many of ourmodel fits.

0711.3753	swift captures the spectrally evolving prompt emission of grb 070616	the origins of gamma-ray burst prompt emission are currently not wellunderstood and in this context long, well-observed events are particularlyimportant to study. we present the case of grb 070616, analysing theexceptionally long-duration multipeaked prompt emission, and later afterglow,captured by all the instruments on-board swift and by suzaku wam. the highenergy light curve remained generally flat for several hundred seconds beforegoing into a steep decline. spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearlytaking place throughout the prompt emission, beginning at 285 s after thetrigger and extending to 1200 s. we track the movement of the spectral peakenergy, whilst observing a softening of the low energy spectral slope. thesteep decline in flux may be caused by a combination of this strong spectralevolution and the curvature effect. we investigate origins for the spectralevolution, ruling out a superposition of two power laws and considering insteadan additional component dominant during the late prompt emission. we alsodiscuss origins for the early optical emission and the physics of theafterglow. the case of grb 070616 clearly demonstrates that both broadbandcoverage and good time resolution are crucial to pin down the origins of thecomplex prompt emission in grbs.

0704.3718	gamma-ray burst afterglows as probes of environment and blastwave  physics ii: the distribution of p and structure of the circumburst medium	we constrain blastwave parameters and the circumburst media of a subsample often bepposax gamma-ray bursts. for this sample we derive the values of theinjected electron energy distribution index, p, and the density structure indexof the circumburst medium, k, from simultaneous spectral fits to their x-ray,optical and nir afterglow data. the spectral fits have been done in count spaceand include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previouslyreported optical and x-ray temporal behaviour. using the blastwave model andsome assumptions which include on-axis viewing and standard jet structure,constant blastwave energy and no evolution of the microphysical parameters, wefind a mean value of p for the sample as a whole of 2.04 +0.02/-0.03. astatistical analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the p values in thissample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3-sigmalevel or greater, which has significant implications for particle accelerationmodels. this approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburstdensity structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous)and k=2 (wind-like). we find five grbs for which k can be well constrained, andin four of these cases the circumburst medium is clearly wind-like. the fifthsource has a value of 0&lt;k&lt;1, consistent with a homogeneous circumburst medium.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1303.0843	calibration of x-ray absorption in our galaxy	prediction of the soft x-ray absorption along lines of sight through ourgalaxy is crucial for understanding the spectra of extragalactic sources, butrequires a good estimate of the foreground column density of photoelectricabsorbing species. assuming uniform elemental abundances this reduces to havinga good estimate of the total hydrogen column density, n(htot)=n(hi)+2n(h2). theatomic component, n(hi), is reliably provided using the mapped 21 cm radioemission but estimating the molecular hydrogen column density, n(h2), expectedfor any particular direction, is difficult. the x-ray afterglows of grbs areideal sources to probe x-ray absorption in our galaxy because they areextragalactic, numerous, bright, have simple spectra and occur randomly acrossthe entire sky. we describe an empirical method, utilizing 493 afterglowsdetected by the swift xrt, to determine n(htot) through the milky way whichprovides an improved estimate of the x-ray absorption in our galaxy and therebyleads to more reliable measurements of the intrinsic x-ray absorption and,potentially, other spectral parameters, for extragalactic x-ray sources. wederive a simple function, dependent on the product of the atomic hydrogencolumn density, n(hi), and dust extinction, e(b-v), which describes thevariation of the molecular hydrogen column density, n(h2), of our galaxy, overthe sky. using the resulting n(htot) we show that the dust-to-hydrogen ratio iscorrelated with the carbon monoxide emission and use this ratio to estimate thefraction of material which forms interstellar dust grains. our resulting reciperepresents a significant revision in galactic absorption compared to previousstandard methods, particularly at low galactic latitudes.

1303.0844	x-ray absorption evolution in gamma-ray bursts: intergalactic medium or  evolutionary signature of their host galaxies?	the intrinsic x-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is often found to beabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. the extracomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the hostgalaxy of the grb itself. there is an apparent correlation between theequivalent column density of hydrogen, n(h,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at thegrb redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z&gt;6 grbs showing the greatestintrinsic column densities. we investigate the n(h,intrinsic) - z relationusing a large sample of swift grbs, as well as active galactic nuclei (agn) andquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energydistributions of the two highest redshift grbs. various possible sample biasesand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and weconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. this may indicateeither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contributionfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm) orintervening absorbing clouds. employing a more realistic model for igmabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of theobserved opacity at z&gt;~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 k and10^6.5 k, and moderately metal enriched, z~0.2 z_sun. this material couldtherefore constitute the warm hot intergalactic medium. however, a comparablelevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of interveningcold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to saywhich, if either, dominates. at lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in thehost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed x-rayabsorption.

0801.1449	the hidden x-ray breaks in afterglow light curves	gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow observations in the swift era have aperceived lack of achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax, or pre-swiftera. specifically, relatively few breaks, consistent with jet breaks, areobserved in the x-ray light curves of these bursts. if these breaks are trulymissing, it has serious consequences for the interpretation of grb jetcollimation and energy requirements, and the use of grbs as standard candles.  here we address the issue of x-ray breaks which are possibly 'hidden' andhence the light curves are misinterpreted as being single power-laws. we showhow a number of precedents, including grb 990510 &amp; grb 060206, exist for suchhidden breaks and how, even with the well sampled light curves of the swiftera, these breaks may be left misidentified. we do so by synthesising x-raylight curves and finding general trends via monte carlo analysis. furthermore,in light of these simulations, we discuss how to best identify achromaticbreaks in afterglow light curves via multi-wavelength analysis.

1403.4079	grb 130925a: an ultra-long gamma ray burst with a dust-echo afterglow,  and implications for the origin of the ultra-long grbs	grb 130925a was an unusual grb, consisting of 3 distinct episodes ofhigh-energy emission spanning $\sim$20 ks, making it a member of the proposedcategory of `ultra-long' bursts. it was also unusual in that its late-timex-ray emission observed by swift was very soft, and showed a stronghard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. this evolution, rarely seen in grbafterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the promptemission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow(i.e. external shock) emission. we consider and reject the possibility that grb130925a was some form of tidal disruption event, and instead show that if thecircumburst density around grb 130925a is low, the long duration of the burstand faint external shock emission are naturally explained. indeed, we suggestthat the ultra-long grbs as a class can be explained as those with lowcircumburst densities, such that the deceleration time (at which point thematerial ejected from the nascent black hole is decelerated by the circumburstmedium) is $\sim$20 ks, as opposed to a few hundred seconds for the normal longgrbs. the increased deceleration radius means that more of the ejected shellscan interact before reaching the external shock, naturally explaining both theincreased duration of grb 130925a, the duration of its prompt pulses, and thefainter-than-normal afterglow.

0802.3803	on the nature of late x-ray flares in swift gamma-ray bursts	previously detected in only a few gamma-ray bursts (grbs), x-ray flares arenow observed in ~50% of swift grbs, though their origins remain unclear. mostflares are seen early on in the afterglow decay, while some bursts exhibitflares at late times of 10^4 to 10^5 seconds, which may have implications forflare models.we investigate whether a sample of late time (&gt; 10^4s) flares aredifferent from previous samples of early time flares, or whether they aremerely examples on the tail of the early flare distribution. we examine thex-ray light curves of swift bursts for late flares and compare the flare andunderlying temporal power-law properties with those of early flares, and thevalues of these properties predicted by the blast wave model. the burst sampleshows late flare properties consistent with those of early flares, where themajority of the flares can be explained by either internal or external shock,though in a few cases one origin is favoured over the other. the underlyingpower laws are mainly consistent with the normal decay phases of the afterglow.if confirmed by the ever growing sample of late time flares, this would implythat, in some cases, prolonged activity out to a day or a restarting of thecentral engine is required.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1410.0489	circular polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 121024a	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are most probably powered by collimated relativisticoutflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. brightafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, whenmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet andthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. high values ofoptical polarization detected minutes after burst in grb 120308a indicate thepresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the centralengine (the power source of the grb). theoretical models predict low degrees oflinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, whenthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient mediumand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. here we report thedetection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of grb121024a, measured 0.15 days after the burst. we show that the circularpolarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dustscattering or plasma propagation effects. a possible explanation is to invokeanisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angledistributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce thecomplex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

astro-ph;0301027	x-ray emission line gas in the liner galaxy m81	we present the soft x-ray spectrum of the liner galaxy m81 derived from along observation with the xmm rgs. the spectrum is dominated by continuumemission from the active nucleus, but also contains emission lines from fe l,and h-like and he-like n, o, and ne. the emission lines are significantlybroader than the rgs point-source spectral resolution; in the cross dispersiondirection the emission lines are detected adjacent to, as well as coincidentwith, the active nucleus. this implies that they originate in a region of a fewarc-minutes spatial extent (1 arc-minute ~ 1 kpc in m81). the flux ratios ofthe ovii triplet suggest that collisional processes are responsible for theline emission. a good fit to the whole rgs spectrum is obtained using a modelconsisting of an absorbed power law from the active nucleus and a 3 temperatureoptically thin thermal plasma. two of the thermal plasma components havetemperatures of 0.18+-0.04 kev and 0.64+-0.04 kev, characteristic of the hotinterstellar medium produced by supernovae; the combined luminosity of theplasma at these two temperatures accounts for all the unresolved bulge x-rayemission seen in the chandra observation by tennant et al.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

astro-ph;0510776	multiwavelength xmm-newton observations of the laor et al. sample of pg  quasars	we present xmm-newton/epic spectra for the laor et al. sample of palomargreen quasars. we find that a power-law provides a reasonable fit to the 2-5kev region of the spectra. excess soft x-ray emission below 2 kev is presentfor all objects, with the exception of those known to contain a warm absorber.a single power-law is, however, a poor fit to the 0.3-10.0 kev spectrum andinstead we find that a simple model, consisting of a broken power-law (plus aniron line), provides a reasonable fit in most cases. the equivalent width ofthe emission line is constrained in just twelve objects but with low (&lt;2 sigma)significance in most cases. for the sources whose spectra are well-fit by thebroken power-law model, we find that various optical and x-ray line andcontinuum parameters are well-correlated; in particular, the power-law photonindex is well-correlated with the fwhm of the hbeta line and the photon indicesof the low and high energy components of the broken power-law arewell-correlated with each other. these results suggest that the 0.3-10 kevx-ray emission shares a common (presumably non-thermal) origin, as opposed tosuggestions that the soft excess is directly produced by thermal disc emissionor via an additional spectral component. we present xmm-newton/om data which wecombine with the x-ray spectra so as to produce broad-band spectral energydistributions, free from uncertainties due to long-term variability innon-simultaneous data. fitting these optical-uv spectra with a comptonized discmodel indicates that the soft x-ray excess is independent of the accretiondisc, confirming our interpretation of the tight correlation between the hardand soft x-ray spectra.

astro-ph;0602444	probing cosmic chemical evolution with gamma-ray bursts: grb060206 at  z=4.048	aim: we present early optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-rayburst grb 060206 with the aim of determining the metallicity of the grbabsorber and the physical conditions in the circumburst medium. we also discusshow grbs may be important complementary probes of cosmic chemical evolution.method: absorption line study of the grb afterglow spectrum. results: wedetermine the redshift of the grb to be z=4.04795+/-0.00020. based on themeasurement of the neutral hydrogen column density from the damped lyman-alphaline and the metal content from weak, unsaturated sii lines we derive ametallicity of [s/h] =-0.84+/-0.10. this is one of the highest metallicitiesmeasured from absorption lines at z~4. from the very high column densities forthe forbidden siii*, oi*, and oi** lines we infer very high densities and lowtemperatures in the system. there is evidence for the presence of h$_2$molecules with logn(h_2) ~ 17.0, translating into a molecular fraction of logf\~ -3.5 with f=2n(h_2)/(2n(h_2)+ n(hi)). even if grbs are only formed by singlemassive stars with metallicities below ~0.3z(solar), they could still be fairlyunbiased tracers of the bulk of the star formation at z&gt;2. hence, metallicitiesas derived for grb060206 here for a complete sample of grb afterglows willdirectly show the distribution of metallicities for representative star-forminggalaxies at these redshifts.

0809.1559	robust photometric redshift determinations of gamma-ray burst afterglows  at z &gt; 2	theory suggests that about 10% of swift-detected gamma-ray bursts (grbs) willoriginate at redshifts greater than 5 yet a number of high redshift candidatesmay be left unconfirmed due to the lack of measured redshifts. here weintroduce our code, grbz, a method of simultaneous multi-parameter fitting ofgrb afterglow optical and near infrared, spectral energy distributions. itallows for early determinations of the photometric redshift, spectral index andhost extinction to be made. we assume that grb afterglow spectra are wellrepresented by a power-law decay and model the effects of absorption due to thelyman forest and host extinction. we use a genetic algorithm-based routine tosimultaneously fit the parameters of interest, and a monte carlo erroranalysis. we use grbs of previously determined spectroscopic redshifts to proveour method, while also introducing new near infrared data of grb 990510 whichfurther constrains the value of the host extinction. our method is effective inestimating the photometric redshift of grbs, relatively unbiased by assumptionsof the afterglow spectral index or the host galaxy extinction. monte carloerror analysis is required as the method of error estimate based on the optimumpopulation of the genetic algorithm underestimates errors significantly.

astro-ph;0610899	gamma-ray burst afterglows as probes of environment and blastwave  physics i: absorption by host galaxy gas and dust	we use a new approach to obtain limits on the absorbing columns towards aninitial sample of 10 long gamma-ray bursts observed with bepposax and selectedon the basis of their good optical and nir coverage, from simultaneous fits tonir, optical and x-ray afterglow data, in count space and including the effectsof metallicity. in no cases is a mw-like extinction preferred, when testing mw,lmc and smc extinction laws. the 2175a bump would in principle be detectable inall these afterglows, but is not present in the data. an smc-like gas-to-dustratio or lower value can be ruled out for 4 of the hosts analysed here(assuming smc metallicity and extinction law) whilst the remainder of thesample have too large an error to discriminate. we provide a more accurateestimate of the line-of-sight extinction and improve upon the uncertainties forthe majority of the extinction measurements made in previous studies of thissample. we discuss this method to determine extinction values in comparisonwith the most commonly employed existing methods.

astro-ph;0701034	the nature of the dwarf starforming galaxy associated with grb 060218 /  sn2006aj	we present high resolution vlt uves and low resolution fors opticalspectroscopy of supernova 2006aj and its host galaxy, associated with thenearby (z = 0.03342) gamma-ray burst grb 060218. this host galaxy is a uniquecase, as it is one of the few nearby grb host galaxies known, and it is onlythe second time high resolution spectra have been taken of a nearby grb hostgalaxy (after grb 980425). the resolution, wavelength range and s/n of the uvesspectrum combined with low resolution fors spectra allow a detailed analysis ofthe circumburst and host galaxy environments. we analyse the emission andabsorption lines in the spectrum, combining the high resolution uves spectrumwith low resolution fors spectra and find the metallicity and chemicalabundances in the host. we probe the geometry of the host by studying theemission line profiles. our spectral analysis shows that the star formingregion in the host is metal poor with 12 + log(o/h) = 7.54 (+0.17, -0.10)(~0.07 z_sun), placing it among the most metal deficient subset ofemission-line galaxies. it is also the lowest metallicity found so far for agrb host from an emission-line analysis. given the stellar mass of the galaxyof ~10^7 m_sun and the sfr (h alpha) = 0.065 +/- 0.005 m_sun/yr, the highspecific star formation rate indicates an age for the galaxy of less than ~200myr. the brightest emission lines are clearly asymmetric and are well fit bytwo gaussian components separated by ~22$ km/s. we detect two discrete na i andca ii absorption components at the same redshifts as the emission components.we tentatively interpret the two components as arising from two differentstarforming regions in the host, but high resolution imaging is necessary toconfirm this.

0812.0979	in search of progenitors for supernova-less grbs 060505 and 060614:  re-examination of their afterglows	grb060505 and grb060614 are nearby long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)without accompanying supernovae (sne) down to very strict limits. they therebychallenge the conventional lgrb-sn connection and naturally give rise to thequestion: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which wouldhelp shed light on their progenitors? to answer this question, we combine newobservational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporaland spectral properties of the two afterglows. we find that both afterglows canbe well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shockwave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well withinthe range observed for other lgrbs. hence, from the properties of theafterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have anotherprogenitor than other lgrbs. recently, swift-discovered grb080503 also has thespike + tail structure during its prompt gamma-ray emission seemingly similarto grb060614. we analyse the prompt emission of this burst and find that thisgrb is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of0.8$\pm$0.4 s during its tail emission. thus, the properties of the promptemission of grb060614 and grb080503 are clearly different, motivating furtherthinking of grb classification. finally we note that, whereas the progenitor ofthe two sn-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for thesn-less bursts would be quite certain if a wind-like environment can beobservationally established, e.g, from an optical decay faster than the x-raydecay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.

0812.2813	testing the blast wave model with swift grbs	the complex structure of the light curves of swift grbs has made theidentification of breaks, and the interpretation of the blast wave caused bythe burst, more difficult than in the pre-swift era. we aim to identify breaks,which are possibly hidden, and to constrain the blast wave parameters; electronenergy distribution, p, density profile of the circumburst medium, k, and thecontinued energy injection index, q. we do so by comparing the observedmulti-wavelength light curves and x-ray spectra of our sample to thepredictions of the blast wave model.  we can successfully interpret all of the bursts in our sample of 10, excepttwo, within this framework and we can estimate, with confidence, the electronenergy distribution index for 6 of the sample. furthermore we identify jetbreaks in a number of the bursts. a statistical analysis of the distribution ofp reveals that, even in the most conservative case of least scatter, the valuesare not consistent with a single, universal value. the values of k suggest thatthe circumburst density profiles are not drawn from only one of the constantdensity or wind-like media populations.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.
