0901.1693	an ultra compact dwarf around the sombrero galaxy (m104): the nearest  massive ucd	we report the discovery of an ultra compact dwarf (ucd) associated with thesombrero galaxy (m104). this is the closest massive ucd known and the firstspectroscopically verified massive ucd which is located in a low densityenvironment.  the object, we name sucd1, was identified in hst/acs imaging and confirmed tobe associated with the sombrero galaxy by its recession velocity obtained fromkeck spectra. the light profile is well fitted by a wilson model. we measure ahalf light size of 14.7 +/- 1.4 pc, an absolute magnitude of m_v = -12.3 mag(m_k = -15.1 mag) and an internal velocity dispersion of 25.0 +/- 5.6 km/s.such values are typical of ucds. from lick spectral indices we measure aluminosity-weighted central age of 12.6 +/- 0.9 gyrs, [fe/h] of -0.08 +/- 0.08dex and [alpha/fe] of 0.06 +/- 0.07 dex. the lack of colour gradients suggeststhese values are representative of the entire ucd. the derived stellar andvirial masses are the same, within errors, at ~3.3 x 10e7 msun. thus we find nostrong evidence for dark matter or the need to invoke a non-standard imf.  we also report arguably the first x-ray detection of a bona fide ucd, whichwe attribute to the presence of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). the x-rayluminosity of l_x = 0.56 x 10e38 erg/s is consistent with the values observedfor gcs of the same metallicity. overall we find sucd1 has properties similarto other known ucds and massive gcs.

0901.2302	stochastic self-enrichment, pre-enrichment, and the formation of  globular clusters	we develop a model for stochastic pre-enrichment and self-enrichment inglobular clusters (gcs) during their formation process. gcs beginning theirformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of theirsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment duringformation. stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finitenumbers of supernova. we construct an analytic formulation of the combinedeffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use monte carlo models toverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity andmetallicity spread among real gcs. the predicted metallicity spread due toself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller thanthe observed spread among real gcs. this result rules out self-enrichment as asignificant contributor to the metal content in most gcs, leavingpre-enrichment as the viable alternative. self-enrichment can, however, beimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 msun, which are massiveenough to hold in a significant fraction of their sn ejecta even without anyexternal pressure confinement. this transition point corresponds well to themass at which a mass-metallicity relationship ("blue tilt") appears in themetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies. we therefore suggest thatself-enrichment is the primary driver for the mass-metallicity relation. otherpredictions from our model are that the cluster-to-cluster metallicity spreaddecreases amongst the highest mass clusters; and that the red gc sequenceshould also display a more modest mass-metallicity trend if it can be traced tosimilarly high mass.

0704.1189	the kinematics and dynamics of the globular clusters and the planetary  nebulae of ngc 5128	a new kinematic and dynamic study of the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy,ngc 5128, is presented. from a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotationaxis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for thehalo of ngc 5128. the globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radialdependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular clustersample into 158 metal-rich ([fe/h] &gt; -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -1.0)globular clusters. our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich andmetal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. the kinematics are compared to theplanetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regionsof the halo. the total mass of ngc 5128 is found using the tracer massestimator (evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internalrandom motions, and the spherical component of the jeans equation to determinethe mass supported by rotation. we find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and(1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radiusof 50 kpc. lastly, we present a new and homogeneous catalog of known globularclusters in ngc 5128. this catalog combines all previous definitive clusteridentifications from radial velocity studies and hst imaging studies, as wellas 80 new globular clusters from a study of m.a. beasley et al.

0906.2008	further definition of the mass-metallicity relation in globular cluster  systems around brightest cluster galaxies	we combine the globular cluster data for fifteen brightest cluster galaxiesand use this material to trace the mass-metallicity relations (mmr) in theirglobular cluster systems (gcss). this work extends previous studies whichcorrelate the properties of the mmr with those of the host galaxy. our combineddata sets show a mean trend for the metal-poor (mp) subpopulation whichcorresponds to a scaling of heavy-element abundance with cluster mass z ~m^(0.30+/-0.05). no trend is seen for the metal-rich (mr) subpopulation whichhas a scaling relation that is consistent with zero. we also find that thescaling exponent is independent of the gcs specific frequency and host galaxyluminosity, except perhaps for dwarf galaxies.  we present new photometry in (g',i') obtained with gemini/gmos for theglobular cluster populations around the southern giant ellipticals ngc 5193 andic 4329. both galaxies have rich cluster populations which show up as normal,bimodal sequences in the colour-magnitude diagram.  we test the observed mmrs and argue that they are statistically real, and notan artifact caused by the method we used. we also argue against asymmetriccontamination causing the observed mmr as our mean results are no differentfrom other contamination-free studies. finally, we compare our method to thestandard bimodal fitting method (kmm or rmix) and find our results areconsistent.  interpretation of these results is consistent with recent models for globularcluster formation in which the mmr is determined by gc self-enrichment duringtheir brief formation period.

0907.2524	the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor globular clusters in m87:  confirmation from deep hst/acs imaging	metal-poor globular clusters (gcs) are our local link to the earliest epochsof star formation and galaxy building. studies of extragalactic gc systemsusing deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope tothe color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs in a number of galaxies. wepresent a study of the m87 gc system using deep, archival hst/acs imaging withthe f606w and f814w filters, in which we find a significant color-magnituderelation for the metal-poor gcs. the slope of this relation in the i vs. v-icolor-magnitude diagram ($\gamma_i=-0.024\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistentwith expectations based on previously published results using data from the acsvirgo cluster survey. the relation is driven by the most luminous gcs, thosewith $m_i&lt;-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor gcsbrighter than $m_i=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fittedgaussian mean for the luminosity function (lf) of blue, metal-poor gcs (~0.8mag fainter than the mean for all gcs). these results indicate that there is amass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenariowhere self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. we show thatpreviously measured half-light radii of m87 gcs from best-fit psf-convolvedking models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study,and we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs is realand cannot be an artifact of the photometry. we fit gaussian and evolvedschechter functions to the luminosity distribution of gcs across all colors, aswell as divided into blue and red subpopulations, finding that the blue gcshave a brighter mean luminosity and a narrower distribution than the red gcs.finally, we present a catalog of astrometry and photometry for 2250 m87 gcs.

0908.0938	statistical tools for classifying galaxy group dynamics	the dynamical state of galaxy groups at intermediate redshifts can provideinformation about the growth of structure in the universe. we examine threegoodness-of-fit tests, the anderson--darling (a-d), kolmogorov and chi-squaredtests, in order to determine which statistical tool is best able to distinguishbetween groups that are relaxed and those that are dynamically complex. weperform monte carlo simulations of these three tests and show that thechi-squared test is profoundly unreliable for groups with fewer than 30members. power studies of the kolmogorov and a-d tests are conducted to testtheir robustness for various sample sizes. we then apply these tests to asample of the second canadian network for observational cosmology redshiftsurvey (cnoc2) galaxy groups and find that the a-d test is far more reliableand powerful at detecting real departures from an underlying gaussiandistribution than the more commonly used chi-squared and kolmogorov tests. weuse this statistic to classify a sample of the cnoc2 groups and find that 34 of106 groups are inconsistent with an underlying gaussian velocity distribution,and thus do not appear relaxed. in addition, we compute velocity dispersionprofiles (vdps) for all groups with more than 20 members and compare theoverall features of the gaussian and non-gaussian groups, finding that the vdpsof the non-gaussian groups are distinct from those classified as gaussian.

1002.3555	consequences of cosmic microwave background-regulated star formation	it has been hypothesized that the cosmic microwave background (cmb) providesa temperature floor for collapsing protostars that can regulate the process ofstar formation and result in a top-heavy initial mass function at highmetallicity and high redshift. we examine whether this hypothesis has anytestable observational consequences. first we determine, using a set ofhydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations, that the cmb temperature floor wouldhave influenced the majority of stars formed at redshifts between z=3 and 6,and probably even to higher redshift. five signatures of cmb-regulated starformation are: (1) a higher supernova rate than currently predicted at highredshift; (2) a systematic discrepancy between direct and indirect measurementsof the high redshift star formation rate; (3) a lack of surviving globularclusters that formed at high metallicity and high redshift; (4) a more rapidrise in the metallicity of cosmic gas than is predicted by current simulations;and (5) an enhancement in the abundances of alpha elements such as o and mg atmetallicities -2 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.5. observations are not presently able to eitherconfirm or rule out the presence of these signatures. however, if correct, thetop-heavy imf of high-redshift high-metallicity globular clusters could providean explanation for the observed bimodality of their metallicity distribution.

1008.4748	the globular cluster/central black hole connection in galaxies	we explore the relation between the total globular cluster population in agalaxy (n_gc) and the the mass of its central black hole (m_bh). using a sampleof 33 galaxies, twice as large as the original sample discussed by burkert &amp;tremaine (2010), we find that n_gc for elliptical and spiral galaxies increasesin almost precisely direct proportion to m_bh. the s0-type galaxies by contrastdo not follow a clear trend, showing large scatter in m_bh at a given n_gc.after accounting for observational measurement uncertainty, we find that themean relation defined by the e and s galaxies must also have an intrinsic or"cosmic" scatter of +-0.2 in either logn_gc or logm_bh. the residuals from thiscorrelation show no trend with globular cluster specific frequency. we suggestthat these two types of galaxy subsystems (central black hole and globularcluster system) may be closely correlated because they both originated at highredshift during the main epoch of hierarchical merging, and both requireextremely high-density conditions for formation. lastly, we note that roughly10% of the galaxies in our sample (one e, one s, and two s0) deviate stronglyfrom the main trend, all in the sense that their m_bh is at least 10x smallerthan would be predicted by the mean relation.

1201.3676	substructure in the most massive geec groups: field-like populations in  dynamically active groups	the presence of substructure in galaxy groups and clusters is believed to bea sign of recent galaxy accretion and can be used not only to probe theassembly history of these structures, but also the evolution of their membergalaxies. using the dressler-shectman (ds) test, we study substructure in asample of intermediate redshift (z ~ 0.4) galaxy groups from the groupenvironment and evolution collaboration (geec) group catalog. we find that 4 ofthe 15 rich geec groups, with an average velocity dispersion of ~525 km s-1,are identified as having significant substructure. the identified regions oflocalized substructure lie on the group outskirts and in some cases appear tobe infalling. in a comparison of galaxy properties for the members of groupswith and without substructure, we find that the groups with substructure have asignificantly higher fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies and a parentcolour distribution that resembles that of the field population rather than theoverall group population. in addition, we observe correlations between thedetection of substructure and other dynamical measures, such as velocitydistributions and velocity dispersion profiles. based on this analysis, weconclude that some galaxy groups contain significant substructure and thatthese groups have properties and galaxy populations that differ from groupswith no detected substructure. these results indicate that the substructuregalaxies, which lie preferentially on the group outskirts and could beinfalling, do not exhibit signs of environmental effects, since little or nostar-formation quenching is observed in these systems.

1301.0626	the influence of orbital eccentricity on tidal radii of star clusters	we have performed n-body simulations of star clusters orbiting in aspherically symmetric smooth galactic potential. the model clusters cover arange of initial half-mass radii and orbital eccentricities in order to testthe historical assumption that the tidal radius of a cluster is imposed atperigalacticon. the traditional assumption for globular clusters is that sincethe internal relaxation time is larger than its orbital period, the cluster istidally stripped at perigalacticon. instead, our simulations show that acluster with an eccentric orbit does not need to fully relax in order toexpand. after a perigalactic pass, a cluster re-captures previously unboundstars, and the tidal shock at perigalacticon has the effect of energizing innerregion stars to larger orbits. therefore, instead of the limiting radius beingimposed at perigalacticon, it more nearly traces the instantaneous tidal radiusof the cluster at any point in the orbit. we present a numerical correctionfactor to theoretical tidal radii calculated at perigalacticon which takes intoconsideration both the orbital eccentricity and current orbital phase of thecluster.

1306.2247	a catalog of globular cluster systems: what determines the size of a  galaxy's globular cluster population?	we present a catalog of 422 galaxies with published measurements of theirglobular cluster (gc) populations. of these, 248 are e galaxies, 93 are s0galaxies, and 81 are spirals or irregulars. among various correlations of thetotal number of gcs with other global galaxy properties, we find that n_gccorrelates well though nonlinearly with the dynamical mass of the galaxy bulgem_dyn = 4 \sigma_e^2 r_e /g, where \sigma_e is the central velocity dispersionand r_e the effective radius of the galaxy light profile. we also presentupdated versions of the gc specific frequency s_n and specific mass s_m versushost galaxy luminosity and baryonic mass. these graphs exhibit the previouslyknown u-shape: highest s_n or s_m values occur for either dwarfs orsupergiants, but in the midrange of galaxy size (10^9 - 10^10 l_sun) the gcnumbers fall along a well defined baseline value of s_n ~ 1 or s_m ~ 0.1,similar among all galaxy types. along with other recent discussions, we suggestthat this trend may represent the effects of feedback, which systematicallyinhibited early star formation at either very low or very high galaxy mass, butwhich had its minimum effect for intermediate masses. our results stronglyreinforce recent proposals that gc formation efficiency appears to be mostnearly proportional to the galaxy halo mass m_halo. the mean "absolute"efficiency ratio for gc formation that we derive from the catalog data ism_gcs/m_halo = 6 \times 10^-5. we suggest that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatteraround this mean value may arise in part because of differences in the relativetiming of gc formation versus field-star formation. finally, we find that anexcellent empirical predictor of total gc population for galaxies of allluminosities is n_gc \sim (r_e \sigma_e)^1.3$, a result consistent withfundamental plane scaling relations.

0801.1640	globular clusters and x-ray point sources in centaurus a (ngc 5128)	we detect 353 x-ray point sources, mostly low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), infour chandra observations of centaurus a (ngc 5128), the nearest giantearly-type galaxy, and correlate this point source population with the largestavailable ensemble of confirmed and likely globular clusters associated withthis galaxy. of the x-ray sources, 31 are coincident with 30 globular clustersthat are confirmed members of the galaxy by radial velocity measurement (2x-ray sources match one globular cluster within our search radius), while 1x-ray source coincides with a globular cluster resolved by hst images. another36 x-ray point sources match probable, but spectroscopically unconfirmed,globular cluster candidates. the color distribution of globular clusters andcluster candidates in cen a is bimodal, and the probability that a red, metalrich gc candidate contains an lmxb is at least 1.7 times that of a blue, metalpoor one. if we consider only spectroscopically confirmed gcs, this ratioincreases to ~3. we find that lmxbs appear preferentially in more luminous(massive) gcs. these two effects are independent, and the latter is likely aconsequence of enhanced dynamical encounter rates in more massive clusterswhich have on average denser cores. the x-ray luminosity functions of the lmxbsfound in gcs and of those that are unmatched with gcs reveal similar underlyingpopulations, though there is some indication that fewer x-ray faint lmxbs arefound in globular clusters than x-ray bright ones. our results agree withprevious observations of the connection of gcs and lmxbs in early-type galaxiesand extend previous work on centaurus a.

0801.2774	galaxy concentrations are trimodal	we have analysed the distribution of inclination-corrected galaxyconcentrations in the sloan digital sky survey. we find that unlike most galaxyproperties, which are distributed bimodally, the distribution of concentrationsis trimodal: it exhibits three distinct peaks. the newly-discoveredintermediate peak, which consists of early-type spirals and lenticulars, maycontain ~60% of the number density and ~50% of the luminosity density of m_r &lt;-17 galaxies in the local universe. these galaxies are generally red andquiescent, although the distribution contains a tail of blue star-forminggalaxies and also shows evidence of dust. the intermediate-type galaxies havehigher apparent ellipticities than either disc or elliptical galaxies, mostlikely because some of the face-on intermediate types are misidentified asellipticals. their physical half-light radii are smaller than the radii ofeither the disc or elliptical galaxies, which may be evidence that they formfrom disc fading. the existence of a distinct peak in parameter spaceassociated with early-type spiral galaxies and lenticulars implies that theyhave a distinct formation mechanism and are not simply the smooth transitionbetween disc-dominated and spheroid-dominated galaxies.

1308.1406	do group dynamics play a role in the evolution of member galaxies?	we examine galaxy groups from the present epoch to z = 1 to explore theimpact of group dynamics on galaxy evolution. we use group catalagues from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss), the group environment and evolutioncollaboration (geec) and the high redshift geec2 sample to study how theobserved member properties depend on galaxy stellar mass, group dynamical massand dynamical state of the host group. we find a strong correlation between thefraction of non-star-forming (quiescent) galaxies and galaxy stellar mass, butdo not detect a significant difference in the quiescent fraction with groupdynamical mass, within our sample halo mass range of 10^13-10^14.5 m_sun, orwith dynamical sate. however, at a redshift of approximately 0.4 we do see someevidence that the quiescent fraction in low mass galaxies (log(m_star/m_sun) &lt;10.5) is lower in groups with substructure. additionally, our results show thatthe fraction of groups with non-gaussian velocity distributions increases withredshift to roughly z = 0.4, while the amount of detected substructure remainsconstant to z = 1. based on these results, we conclude that for massivegalaxies (log(m_star/m_sun_ &gt; 10.5), evolution is most strongly correlated tothe stellar mass of a galaxy with little or no additional effect related toeither the group dynamical mass or dynamical state. for low mass galaxies, wedo see some evidence of a correlation between the quiescent fraction and theamount of detected substructure, highlighting the need to probe further downthe stellar mass function to elucidate the role of the environment in galaxyevolution.

1310.4834	globular cluster scale sizes in giant galaxies: the case of m87 and the  role of orbital anisotropy and tidal filling	we present new hubble space telescope imaging of the outer regions of m87 inorder to study its globular cluster (gc) population out to large galactocentricdistances. we discuss particularly the relationship between gc effective radii$r_h$ and projected galactocentric distance $r_{gc}$. the observations suggesta shallow trend $r_h \propto r_{gc}^{0.14}$ out to $r_{gc} \sim 100$ kpc, inagreement with studies of other giant elliptical galaxies. to theoreticallyreproduce this relationship we simulate gc populations with variousdistributions of orbits. for an isotropic distribution of cluster orbits wefind a steeper trend of $r_h \propto r_{gc}^{0.4}$. instead we suggest that (a)if the cluster system has an orbital anisotropy profile, where orbits becomepreferentially radial with increasing galactocentric distance, and (b) ifclusters become more tidally under-filling with galactocentric distance, theobserved relationship can be recovered. we also apply this approach to the redand blue gc populations separately and predict that red clusters arepreferentially under-filling at large $r_{gc}$ and have a more isotropicdistribution of orbits than blue clusters.

1312.0635	cluster formation in molecular clouds: i. stellar populations, star  formation rates, and ionizing radiation	we present a model for the radiative output of star clusters in the processof star formation suitable for use in hydrodynamical simulations of radiativefeedback. gas in a clump, defined as a region whose density exceeds 10^4 cm^-3,is converted to stars via the random sampling of the chabrier imf. a starformation efficiency controls the rate of star formation. we have completed asuite of simulations which follow the evolution of accretion-fed clumps withinitial masses ranging from 0 to 10^5 m_sol and accretion rates ranging from10^-5 to 10^-1 m_sol yr^-1. the stellar content is tracked over time whichallows the aggregate luminosity, ionizing photon rate, number of stars, andstar formation rate (sfr) to be determined. for a fiducial clump of 10^4 m_sol,the luminosity is ~4x10^6 l_sol with a sfr of roughly 3x10^-3 m_sol yr^-1. weidentify two regimes in our model. the accretion-dominated regime obtains themajority of its gas through accretion and is characterized by an increasing sfrwhile the reservoir-dominated regime has the majority of its mass present inthe initial clump with a decreasing sfr. we show that our model can reproducethe expected number of o stars, which dominate the radiative output of thecluster. we find a nearly linear relationship between sfr and mass as seen inobservations. we conclude that our model is an accurate and straightforward wayto represent the output of clusters in hydrodynamical simulations withradiative feedback.

1312.5187	globular clusters and supermassive black holes in galaxies: further  analysis and a larger sample	we explore several correlations between various large-scale galaxyproperties, particularly total globular cluster population (n_gcs), the centralblack hole mass (m_bh), velocity dispersion (nominally sigma_e), and bulge mass(m_dyn). our data sample of 49 galaxies, for which both n_gc and m_bh areknown, is larger than used in previous discussions of these two parameters andwe employ the same sample to explore all pairs of correlations. further, withinthis galaxy sample we investigate the scatter in each quantity, with emphasison the range of published values for sigma_e and effective radius (r_e). wefind that these two quantities in particular are difficult to measureconsistently and caution that precise intercomparison of galaxy propertiesinvolving r_e and sigma_e is particularly difficult.  using both chi^2 and monte carlo markov chain (mcmc) fitting techniques, weshow that quoted observational uncertainties for all parameters are too smallto represent the true scatter in the data. we find that the correlation betweenm_dyn and n_gc is stronger than either the m_bh-sigma_e or m_bh-n_gc relations.we suggest that this is because both the galaxy bulge population ans n_gc werefundamentally established at an early epoch during the same series ofstar-forming events. by contrast, although the seed for m_bh was likely formedat a similar epoch, its growth over time is less similar from galaxy to galaxyand thus less predictable.

1404.1920	dark matter halos in galaxies and globular cluster populations	we combine a new, comprehensive database for globular cluster populations inall types of galaxies with a new calibration of galaxy halo masses basedentirely on weak lensing. correlating these two sets of data, we find that themass ratio $\eta \equiv m_{gcs}/m_{h}$ (total mass in globular clusters,divided by halo mass) is essentially constant at $\langle \eta \rangle \sim 4\times 10^{-5}$, strongly confirming earlier suggestions in the literature.globular clusters are the only known stellar population that formed inessentially direct proportion to host galaxy halo mass. the intrinsic scatterin $\eta$ appears to be at most 0.2 dex; we argue that some of this scatter isdue to differing degrees of tidal stripping of the globular cluster systemsbetween central and satellite galaxies. we suggest that this correlation can beunderstood if most globular clusters form at very early stages in galaxyevolution, largely avoiding the feedback processes that inhibited the bulk offield-star formation in their host galaxies. the actual mean value of $\eta$also suggests that about $1/4$ of the \emph{initial} gas mass present inprotogalaxies collected into gmcs large enough to form massive, dense starclusters. finally, our calibration of $\langle \eta \rangle$ indicates that thehalo masses of the milky way and m31 are $(1.2\pm0.5)\times 10^{12} m_{\odot}$and $(3.9\pm1.8)\times 10^{12} m_{\odot}$ respectively.

1405.3285	the effect of orbital eccentricity on the dynamical evolution of star  clusters	we use n-body simulations to explore the influence of orbital eccentricity onthe dynamical evolution of star clusters. specifically we compare the mass lossrate, velocity dispersion, relaxation time, and the mass function of starclusters on circular and eccentric orbits. for a given perigalactic distance,increasing orbital eccentricity slows the dynamical evolution of a cluster dueto a weaker mean tidal field. however, we find that perigalactic passes andtidal heating due to an eccentric orbit can partially compensate for thedecreased mean tidal field by energizing stars to higher velocities andstripping additional stars from the cluster, accelerating the relaxationprocess. we find that the corresponding circular orbit which best describes theevolution of a cluster on an eccentric orbit is much less than its semi-majoraxis or time averaged galactocentric distance. since clusters spend themajority of their lifetimes near apogalacticon, the properties of clusterswhich appear very dynamically evolved for a given galactocentric distance canbe explained by an eccentric orbit. additionally we find that the evolution ofthe slope of the mass function within the core radius is roughlyorbit-independent, so it could place additional constraints on the initial massand initial size of globular clusters with solved orbits. we use our results todemonstrate how the orbit of milky way globular clusters can be constrainedgiven standard observable parameters like galactocentric distance and the slopeof the mass function. we then place constraints on the unsolved orbits of ngc1261,ngc 6352, ngc 6496, and ngc 6304 based on their positions and massfunctions.

0803.1274	inclination-independent galaxy classification	we present a new method to classify galaxies from large surveys like thesloan digital sky survey using inclination-corrected concentration,inclination-corrected location on the color-magnitude diagram, and apparentaxis ratio. explicitly accounting for inclination tightens the distribution ofeach of these parameters and enables simple boundaries to be drawn thatdelineate three different galaxy populations: early-type galaxies, which arered, highly concentrated, and round; late-type galaxies, which are blue, havelow concentrations, and are disk dominated; and intermediate-type galaxies,which are red, have intermediate concentrations, and have disks. we havevalidated our method by comparing to visual classifications of high-qualityimaging data from the millennium galaxy catalogue. the inclination correctionis crucial to unveiling the previously unrecognized intermediate class.intermediate-type galaxies, roughly corresponding to lenticulars and earlyspirals, lie on the red sequence. the red sequence is therefore composed of twodistinct morphological types, suggesting that there are two distinct mechanismsfor transiting to the red sequence. we propose that intermediate-type galaxiesare those that have lost their cold gas via strangulation, while early-typegalaxies are those that have experienced a major merger that either consumedtheir cold gas, or whose merger progenitors were already devoid of cold gas(the ``dry merger'' scenario).

1409.0879	the effects of orbital inclination on the scale size and evolution of  tidally filling star clusters	we have performed n-body simulations of tidally filling star clusters with arange of orbits in a milky way-like potential to study the effects of orbitalinclination and eccentricity on their structure and evolution. at smallgalactocentric distances rgc, a non-zero inclination results in increased massloss rates. tidal heating and disk shocking, the latter sometimes consisting oftwo shocking events as the cluster moves towards and away from the disk, helpremove stars from the cluster. clusters with inclined orbits at large rgc havedecreased mass loss rates than the non-inclined case, since the strength thedisk potential decreases with rgc. clusters with inclined and eccentric orbitsexperience increased tidal heating due to a constantly changing potential,weaker disk shocks since passages occur at higher rgc, and an additional tidalshock at perigalacticon. the effects of orbital inclination decrease withorbital eccentricity, as a highly eccentric cluster spends the majority of itslifetime at a large rgc. the limiting radii of clusters with inclined orbitsare best represented by the rt of the cluster when at its maximum height abovethe disk, where the cluster spends the majority of its lifetime and the rate ofchange in rt is a minimum. conversely, the effective radius is independent ofinclination in all cases.

1503.07176	estimating the galactic mass profile in the presence of incomplete data	a powerful method to measure the mass profile of a galaxy is through thevelocities of tracer particles distributed through its halo. transforming thiskind of data accurately to a mass profile m(r), however, is not a trivialproblem. in particular, limited or incomplete data may substantially affect theanalysis. in this paper we develop a bayesian method to deal with incompletedata effectively; we have a hybrid-gibbs sampler that treats the unknownvelocity components of tracers as parameters in the model. we explore theeffectiveness of our model using simulated data, and then apply our method tothe milky way using velocity and position data from globular clusters and dwarfgalaxies. we find that in general, missing velocity components have littleeffect on the total mass estimate. however, the results are quite sensitive tothe outer globular cluster pal 3. using a basic hernquist model with anisotropic velocity dispersion, we obtain credible regions for the cumulativemass profile m(r) of the milky way, and provide estimates for the modelparameters with 95 percent bayesian credible intervals. the mass containedwithin 260 kpc is 1.37x10^12 solar masses, with a 95 percent credible intervalof (1.27,1.51)x10^12 solar masses. the hernquist parameters for the total massand scale radius are 1.55 (+0.18/-0.13)x10^12 solar masses and 16.9 (+4.8/-4.1)kpc, where the uncertainties span the 95 percent credible intervals. the codewe developed for this work, galactic mass estimator (gme), will be available asan open source package in the r project for statistical computing.

astro-ph;0101436	photometry and the metallicity distribution of the outer halo of m31	we have conducted a wide-field ccd-mosaic study of the resolved red-giantbranch (rgb) stars of m31, in a field located 20 kpc from the nucleus along these minor axis. in our (i, v-i) color-magnitude diagram, rgb stars in the topthree magnitudes of the m31 halo are strongly present. photometry of a moredistant control field to subtract field contamination is used to derive the`cleaned' luminosity function and metallicity distribution function (mdf) ofthe m31 halo field. from the color distribution of the foreground milky wayhalo stars, we find a reddening e(v-i)= 0.10 +/- 0.02 for this field, and fromthe luminosity of the rgb tip, we determine a distance modulus (m-m)_o = 24.47+/- 0.12 (= 783 +/- 43 kpc). the mdf is derived from interpolation within anextensive new grid of rgb models (vandenberg et al. 2000). the mdf is dominatedby a moderately high-metallicity population ([m/h]~ -0.5) found previously inmore interior m31 halo/bulge fields, and is much more metal-rich than the[m/h]~ -1.5 level in the milky way halo. a significant (~30% - 40%, dependingon agb star contribution) metal-poor population is also present. to firstorder, the shape of the mdf resembles that predicted by a simple,single-component model of chemical evolution starting from primordial gas withan effective yield y=0.0055. it strongly resembles the mdf recently found forthe outer halo of the giant elliptical ngc 5128 (harris et al. 2000), thoughngc 5128 has an even lower fraction of low-metallicity stars. intriguingly, inboth ngc 5128 and m31, the metallicity distribution of the globular clusters inm31 does not match the halo stars; the clusters are far more heavily weightedto metal-poor objects. we suggest similarities in the formation and earlyevolution of massive, spheroidal stellar systems.

astro-ph;0211586	simultaneous modelling of the stellar halo and globular cluster system  of ngc 5128	an important test for models of galaxy formation lies in the metallicitydistribution functions (mdfs) of spheroid stars and their globular clusters(gcs).we have compared the mdfs obtained from spectroscopy of the gcs and thestar-by-star photometry of red giants in the nearby elliptical ngc 5128, withthe predictions of a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. we have selectedmodel ellipticals comparable in luminosity and environment to ngc 5128, andderived their mdfs. a direct comparison between models and data shows that themdfs are qualitatively similar, both have stellar components which arepredominantly metal-rich (0.8z), with a small fraction of metal-poor starsextending down to 0.002z. the model mdfs show only small variations, whetherthey are brightest cluster galaxies or low luminosity group ellipticals. ourcomparison also reveals that these model mdfs harbour a greater fraction ofstars above solar metallicity than the observations, producing generally moremetal-rich (by 0.1 dex) mdfs. one possibility is that the outer-bulgeobservations are missing some of the highest metallicity stars. we find goodagreement between the model and observed gc mdfs, provided that the metal-poorgc formation is halted early in the model. under this proviso, both the modelsand data are bimodal with peaks at 0.1z and z, and cover similar metallicityranges. this broad agreement for the stars and gcs suggests that the bulk ofthe stellar population in ngc 5128 may have been built up in a hierarchicalfashion, involving both quiescent and merger-induced star formation. theexistence of age structure amongst the metal-rich gcs needs to be testedagainst high-quality data for this galaxy.

astro-ph;0212545	origin of the metallicity distribution of the ngc 5128 stellar halo	recent {\it hubble space telescope} photometry in the nearby ellipticalgalaxy ngc 5128 shows that its halo field star population is dominated bymoderately metal-rich stars, with a peak at [m/h] $\simeq$ -0.4 and with a verysmall fraction of metal-poor ([m/h] $&lt;$ -1.0) stars. in order to investigatethe physical processes which may have produced this metallicity distributionfunction (mdf), we consider a model in which ngc 5128 is formed by merging oftwo major spiral galaxies. we find that the halo of an elliptical formed thisway is predominantly populated by moderately metal-rich stars with [m/h] $\sim$-0.4 which were initially within the outer parts of the two merging discs andwere tidally stripped during the merger. to match the ngc 5128 data, we findthat the progenitor spiral discs must have rather steep metallicity gradientssimilar to the one defined by the milky way open clusters, as well as sparsemetal-poor haloes (5% or less of the disc mass). very few stars from thecentral bulges of the spiral galaxies end up in the halo, so the results arenot sensitive to the relative sizes (bulge-to-disc ratios) or metallicities ofthe initial bulges. finally, we discuss the effects on the globular clustersystem (gcs). the emergent elliptical will end up with metal-poor halo clustersfrom the original spiral haloes, but with moderately metal-rich halo stars fromthe progenitor discs, thus creating a mean offset between the mdfs of the halostars and the gcs.

astro-ph;0405403	photometry and the metallicity distribution of the outer halo of m31.  ii. the 30 kpc field	we present the results of a wide-field (v,i) photometric study of thered-giant branch (rgb) stars in the outer halo of m31, in a field located 30 to35 kpc from the center of the galaxy along the southeast minor axis. at thisremote location, we find that rgb stars belonging to m31 are sparsely butdefinitely present, after statistical subtraction of field contamination. wederive the metallicity distribution (mdf) for the halo stars usinginterpolation within a standard (i,v-i) grid of rgb evolutionary tracks. thehalo mdf is quite broad but dominated by a moderately high-metallicitypopulation peaking at [m/h] ~ -0.5, strikingly different from the [m/h] ~ -1.3level which characterizes the outer halo of the milky way. however,the shapeand peak metallicity for this region are entirely similar to those found inother studies for the inner regions of the m31 halo, particularly our previousstudy of a 20-kpc region (durrell, harris, &amp; pritchet 2001) employing similardata. in summary, we find no evidence for a metallicity gradient or systematicchange in the mdf out to quite large distances in the m31 halo: it appears tobe a homogeneous and moderately metal-rich subsystem of the galaxy at alllocations. the star counts in the 30-kpc field are also consistent with ther^1/4 law that fits the interior regions of the m31 spheroid surface brightnessprofile. the metal-rich mdf and the r^1/4 spheroid suggests m31 more stronglyresembles a giant elliptical galaxy than other, milky-way-like, spirals.

astro-ph;0406273	the metallicity distribution in the outer halo of m33	we present the results of deep i and v-band photometry of the halo stars nearthe southeast minor axis of the local group spiral galaxy m33. an (i,v-i)color-magnitude diagram distinctly reveals the red giant branch stars at thebright end of the color-magnitude diagram. a luminosity function in the i-bandwhich utilizes a background field to remove the contaminating effects ofgalactic foreground stars and distant, unresolved galaxies reveals the presenceof the tip of the red giant branch at (m-m)_{i}=20.70. assuming an absolutemagnitude of the tip of the red giant branch of m_{i,trgb}=-4.1 and aforeground reddening of e(v-i)=0.054, the distance modulus of m33 is determinedto be (m-m)=24.72 (880 kpc). the metallicity distribution function derived byinterpolating between evolutionary tracks of red giant branch models isdominated by a relatively metal poor stellar population, with a meanmetallicity of [m/h]=-0.94 or [fe/h]=-1.24. we fit a leaky-box chemicalenrichment model to the halo data, which shows that the halo is wellrepresented by a single-component model with an effective yield ofy_{eff}=0.0024.

astro-ph;0512383	two populations of young massive star clusters in arp 220	we present new optical observations of young massive star clusters in arp220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy, taken in ubvi with the hubblespace telescope acs/hrc camera. we find a total of 206 probable clusters whosespatial distribution is centrally concentrated toward the nucleus of arp 220.we use model star cluster tracks to determine ages, luminosities, and massesfor 14 clusters with complete ubvi indices or previously publishednear-infrared data. we estimate rough masses for 24 additional clusters with i&lt; 24 mag from bvi indices alone. the clusters with useful ages fall into twodistinct groups: a ``young'' population (&lt; 10 myr) and an intermediate-agepopulation (~300 myr). there are many clusters with masses clearly above 10^6msun and possibly even above 10^7 msun in the most extreme instances. thesemasses are high enough that the clusters being formed in the arp 220 starburstcan be considered as genuine young globular clusters. in addition, this studyallows us to extend the observed correlation between global star formation rateand maximum cluster luminosity by more than an order of magnitude in starformation rate.

astro-ph;0607269	structural parameters for globular clusters in ngc 5128. ii: hst/acs  imaging and new clusters	we report the first results from an imaging program with the acs camera onhst designed to measure the structural characteristics of a wide range ofglobular clusters in ngc 5128, the nearest giant elliptical galaxy. from 12acs/wfc fields, we have measured a total of 62 previously known globularclusters and have discovered 69 new high-probability cluster candidates notfound in any previous work. we present magnitudes and color indices for all ofthese, along with rough measurements of their effective diameters andellipticities. the luminosity distribution of this nearly-uncontaminated sampleof clusters matches well with the normal gclf for giant elliptical galaxies,and the cluster scale size and ellipticity distributions are similar to thosein the milky way system. the indication from this survey is that many hundredsof individual clusters remain to be found with carefully designed searchtechniques in the future. a very rough estimate of the total cluster populationfrom our data suggests n_gc = 1500 in ngc 5128, over all magnitudes and withina projected radius r = 25' from the galaxy center.

astro-ph;9411090	a $bvi$ photometric study of the near-galactic center globular cluster  ngc 6517 (c1759-089)	we present the results of a $bvi$ photometric study of the globular clusterngc 6517 using ccd images obtained at the prime focus of the cfht. from theresultant color-magnitude diagram, we infer that the cluster is differentiallyreddened and develop a method for determining the amplitude of this effect,which amounts to \( \sim 0.4 \) mag in \( (v-i) \) across our $\sim 4$ arc-minfield. from the corrected $v_0,$ $(v-i)_0$ color-magnitude diagram, we derivethe metallicity and distance modulus of the cluster. our values for the meanforeground reddening ($e(b-v) = 1.10 \pm 0.10$) and metallicity (\feh\ = -1.58$\pm$ 0.05) agree to within uncertainties with previous determinations. ourapparent distance modulus of 18.3 $\pm$ 0.2, however, is larger than the soleprevious determination. when the distance modulus is corrected for absorption,assuming that $r_v = 3.8 $ for this line of sight, we find that ngc 6517 iswithin 3 kpc of the galactic center, making it a bulge member. this makes ngc6517 only the fourth metal poor cluster in the bulge for which an accurate cmdis available.

astro-ph;9507109	hubble space telescope observations of white dwarfs in the globular  cluster m4	with the wide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2) on the hubble space telescope,we have discovered in m4 (ngc 6121, c 1620-264) the first extensive sequence ofcooling white dwarfs seen in a globular cluster. adopting a distance modulus of(m-m)_v = 12.65 and a reddening of e(b-v) = 0.37, we show that the sequence,which extends over 9 &lt; m_u &lt; 13, is comprised of white dwarfs of mass \sim 0.5m_{\odot}. the total mass loss from the present turnoff to the white dwarfsequence is 0.31 m_{\odot} and the intrinsic dispersion in the mean massappears to be &lt; 0.05 m_{\odot}. both the location of the white dwarf coolingsequence in the cluster color-magnitude diagram and the cumulative luminosityfunction attest to the basic correctness and completeness of the physics intheoretical models for the upper three magnitudes of the observed white dwarfcooling sequence. to test the theory in globular clusters at cooling agesbeyond \sim 3 \times 10^8 years will require deeper and more complete data.

astro-ph;9601072	age gradient and the second parameter problem in the galactic halo	we establish a framework for determing absolute ages of galactic globularclusters and then use these ages to investigate the age-metallicity andage-galactocentric distance relations for the 36 clusters with the mostreliable age data. the clusters span galactocentric distances from 4 through100 kpc and cover a metallicity range from $[fe/h] = -0.6$ to $-2.3$. adoptingcurrently plausible choices for the relation between cluster metallicity andhorizontal-branch luminosity, and alpha-enhancement ratios, we find that themajority of the globular clusters form an age distribution with a dispersion$\sigma(t)$ about $10^9$ years, and a total age spread smaller than 4 gyr.clusters in the lowest metallicity group ($[fe/h] &lt; -1.8$) appear to be thesame age to well within 1 gyr at all locations in the milky way halo,suggesting that star formation began throughout the halo nearly simultaneouslyin its earliest stages. we find no statistically significant correlationbetween mean cluster age and galactocentric distance (no age gradient) from 4to 100 kpc. the correlation between cluster age and horizontal-branch typesuggests that causes in addition to metallicity and age are required tounderstand the distribution of stars along the horizontal branches in globularcluster color-magnitude diagrams.

astro-ph;9702169	white dwarfs in globular clusters: hst observations of m4	using wfpc2 on the hubble space telescope, we have isolated a sample of 258white dwarfs (wds) in the galactic globular cluster m4. fields at three radialdistances from the cluster center were observed and sizeable wd populationswere found in all three. the location of these wds in the color-magnitudediagram, their mean mass of 0.51($ \pm 0.03$)m$_{\odot}$, and their luminosityfunction confirm basic tenets of stellar evolution theory and support theresults from current wd cooling theory. the wds are used to extend the clustermain-sequence mass function upward to stars that have already completed theirnuclear evolution. the wd/red dwarf binary frequency in m4 is investigated andfound to be at most a few percent of all the main-sequence stars. the mostancient wds found are about 9 gyr old, a level which is set solely by thephotometric limits of our data. even though this is less than the age of m4, wediscuss how these cooling wds can eventually be used to check the turnoff agesof globular clusters and hence constrain the age of the universe.

astro-ph;9709053	photometry and spectroscopy of coma dwarf ellipticals	we have used deep r- and b-band ccd images (with ~1.2 arcsec seeing) of thecentral ~700 arcmin^2 of the coma cluster core (and an associated ~270 arcmin^2control field) to study the early-type dwarf elliptical (de) galaxy population.analysis of the color-restricted control-field-corrected color-magnitudediagram (cmd) shows that the de galaxy sequence is linear over the range 15.5&lt;= r &lt;= 22.5 mag, with a slope delta (b-r)/delta r = -0.056+/-0.002. thefaintest des in this sample have a color (b-r) = 1.15 mag, which is within thecolor range measured for the diffuse intracluster light. analysis of thecompleteness-corrected background-subtracted radial number density profilesreveals that the faint des are deficient in the cluster core, consistent withtheir destruction in this dense environment. to determine ages and abundancesfor a subsample of these coma des, we used the keck i telescope and thelow-resolution imaging spectrograph (lris) in ~1.0 arcsec seeing. we obtained2x1800 sec exposures of four fields, with ~22 objects per field. our wavelengthcoverage is 3800 &lt; \lambda &lt; 6200 \aa, with 8 \aa resolution and s/n~50 for thedes. preliminary analysis of an lris field located ~3.8 arcmin west of ngc 4874reveals that only four of the 17 target objects have coma velocities, comparedto 9-10 expected from analysis of the control-field cmd.

astro-ph;9709073	dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster. i. detection, measurement and  classification techniques	deep b- and r-band ccd images of the central ~700 arcmin^2 of the comacluster core have been used to measure the dwarf-galaxy population in coma. inthis paper, we describe a newly developed code for automated detection,photometry and classification of faint objects of arbitrary shape and size ondigital images. intensity-weighted moments are used to compute the positions,radial structures, ellipticities, and integrated magnitudes of detectedobjects. we demonstrate that kron-type 2r_1 aperture aperture magnitudes andsurface brightnesses are well suited to faint-galaxy photometry of the typedescribed here. discrimination between starlike and extended (galaxy) objectsis performed interactively through parameter-space culling in several possibleparameters, including the radial moments, surface brightness, and integratedcolor versus magnitude. our code is tested and characterized with artificialccd images of star and galaxy fields; it is demonstrated to be accurate, robustand versatile. using these analysis techniques, we detect a large population ofde galaxies in the coma cluster core. these des stand out as a tight sequencein the r, (b-r) color-magnitude diagram.

astro-ph;9709074	dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster. ii. photometry and analysis	we study the dwarf galaxy population in the central ~700 arcmin^2 of the comacluster, the majority of which are early-type dwarf elliptical (de) galaxies.analysis of the statistically-decontaminated de galaxy sequence in thecolor-magnitude diagram reveals a highly significant trend of color withmagnitude (\delta (b-r)/\delta r = -0.056\pm0.002 mag), in the sense thatfainter des are bluer and thus presumably more metal-poor. the mean color ofthe faintest des in our sample is (b-r)~1.15 mag, consistent with a colormeasurement of the diffuse intracluster light in the coma core. thisintracluster light could then have originated from the tidal disruption offaint des in the cluster core. the total galaxy luminosity function (lf) iswell modeled as the sum of a log-normal distribution for the giant galaxies,and a schechter function for the de galaxies with a faint-end slope \alpha =-1.41\pm0.05. this value of \alpha is consistent with those measured for thevirgo and fornax clusters. the spatial distribution of the faint de galaxies(19.0 &lt; r \le 22.5 mag) has r_c = 22.15 arcmin (~0.46h^{-1} mpc), significantlylarger than the r_c = 13.71 arcmin (~0.29h^{-1} mpc) found for the clustergiants and the brighter des (r \le 19.0 mag), consistent with tidal disruptionof the faint des. finally, we find that most des belong to the general comacluster potential rather than as satellites of individual giant galaxies: ananalysis of the number counts around 10 cluster giants reveals that they eachhave on average 4\pm 1 de companions within a projected radius of 13.9h^{-1}kpc.

astro-ph;9809176	ages for globular clusters in the outer galactic halo: the second  parameter clusters palomar~3, palomar~4 and eridanus	we have used the wfpc2 camera on the hubble space telescope to obtainphotometry of the outer-halo globular clusters palomar 3, palomar 4, anderidanus. these three are classic examples of the "second parameter" anomalybecause of their red horizontal-branch morphologies in combination with theirlow-to-intermediate metallicities. our color-magnitude diagrams in (v, v-i)reach $v_{lim} \simeq 27.0$, clearly delineating the subgiant and turnoffregions and about three magnitudes of the unevolved main sequences. the slopesand dereddened colors of the giant branches are consistent with published[fe/h] estimates that rank the clusters (pal 3, eridanus, pal 4) in order ofincreasing metallicity, with all three falling near or between the abundancevalues of the classic nearby halo clusters m3 and m5. differential fits oftheir color-magnitude diagrams are made to each other and to m3 and m5 forrelative age determinations. we find that the three outer-halo cluster cmdsdiffer from the nearby clusters in a way that is consistent with their beingyounger by $\sim 1.5 - 2 $gyr, if we have correctly estimated the clusters'chemical-abundance ratios. conversely, the inferred age difference could besmaller ($\ltsim 1 $gyr) if either [fe/h] or [$\alpha$/fe] for the outer-haloclusters is significantly lower than we have assumed. possible age spreads oforder 1$ $gyr among both the nearby and outer-halo clusters may also bepresent.
