0904.2020	clues to the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge: abundances  in moa-2008-blg310 and moa-2008-blg311	we present abundance analyses based on high dispersion and highsignal-to-noise ratio magellan spectra of two highly microlensed galactic bulgestars in the region of the main sequence turnoff with teff ~ 5650 k. we findthat moa-2008-blg310 has [fe/h]= +0.41 (+,- 0.09 dex) and moa-2008-blg311 has+0.26 (+, - 0.09 dex). the abundance ratios for the ~20 elements for whichfeatures could be detected in the spectra of each of the two stars follow thetrends with [fe/h] found among samples of bulge giants. combining these twobulge dwarfs with the results from previous abundance analysis of four othergalactic bulge turnoff region stars, all highly magnified by microlensing,gives a mean [fe/h] of +0.29dex. this implies that there there is aninconsistency between the fe-metallicity distribution of the microlensed bulgedwarfs and that derived by the many previous estimates based on surveys ofcool, luminous bulge giants, which have mean [fe/h] ~ -0.1 dex. a number ofpossible mechanisms for producing this difference are discussed. if oneascribes this inconsistency to systematic errors in the abundance analyses, weprovide statistical arguments suggesting that a substantial systematic error inthe fe-metallicity for one or both of the two cases, bulge dwarfs vs bulgegiants, is required which is probably larger than can realistically beaccommodated.

0905.3743	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. ii.  test of theoretical stellar isochrones	we perform an extensive test of theoretical stellar models for main-sequencestars in ugriz, using cluster fiducial sequences obtained in the previous paperof this series. we generate a set of isochrones using the yale rotatingevolutionary code (yrec) with updated input physics, and derive magnitudes andcolors in ugriz from marcs model atmospheres. these models match cluster mainsequences over a wide range of metallicity within the errors of the adoptedcluster parameters. however, we find a large discrepancy of model colors at thelower main sequence (teff &lt; ~4500 k) for clusters at and above solarmetallicity. we also reach similar conclusions using the theoretical isochronesof girardi et al. and dotter et al., but our new models are generally in betteragreement with the data. using our theoretical isochrones, we also derivemain-sequence fitting distances and turn-off ages for five key globularclusters, and demonstrate the ability to derive these quantities fromphotometric data in the sloan digital sky survey. in particular, we exploitmultiple color indices (g - r, g - i, and g - z) in the parameter estimation,which allows us to evaluate internal systematic errors. our distance estimates,with an error of sigma(m - m) = 0.03-0.11 mag for individual clusters, areconsistent with hipparcos-based subdwarf fitting distances derived in thejohnson-cousins or stromgren photometric systems.

0905.4502	tracing sagittarius structure with sdss and segue imaging and  spectroscopy	we show that the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very redk/m-giant stars selected from sdss photometry. a subset of these stars arespectroscopically confirmed with segue and sdss spectra, and the distance scaleof 2mass and sdss m giants is calibrated to the rr lyrae distance scale. theabsolute g band magnitude of the k/m-giant stars at the tip of the giant branchis m_g=-1.0. the line-of-sight velocities of the m giant and bhb stars that arespatially coincident with the sgr dwarf tidal stream are consistent with thoseof previous authors, reinforcing the need for new models that can explain allof the sgr tidal debris stream observations. we estimate stellar densitiesalong the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. thek/m-giant, bhb, and f-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness tidalstream that is adjacent to the main leading sgr dwarf tidal tail havevelocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars in theleading tidal tail. the ratio of k/m giants to bhbs and bhbs to f-turnoff starsare also similar for both branches of the leading tidal tail. we show thatthere is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream near the sgr trailing tidaltail.

0910.3670	the effect of differential limb magnification on abundance analysis of  microlensed dwarf stars	finite source effects can be important in observations of gravitationalmicrolensing of stars. near caustic crossings, for example, some parts of thesource star will be more highly magnified than other parts. the spectrum of thestar is then no longer the same as when it is unmagnified, and measurements ofthe atmospheric parameters and abundances will be affected. the accuracy ofabundances measured from spectra taken during microlensing events has becomeimportant recently because of the use of highly magnified dwarf stars to probeabundance ratios and the abundance distribution in the galactic bulge. in thispaper, we investigate the effect of finite source effects on spectra by usingmagnification profiles motivated by two events to synthesize spectra for dwarfsbetween 5000k to 6200k at solar metallicity. we adopt the usual techniques foranalyzing the microlensed dwarfs, namely, spectroscopic determination oftemperature, gravity, and microturbulent velocity, relying on equivalentwidths. we find that ignoring the finite source effects for the more extremecase results in errors in teff &lt; 45k, in log g of &lt;0.1 dex and inmicroturbulent velocity of &lt;0.1 km/s. in total, changes in equivalent widthslead to small changes in atmospheric parameters and changes in abundances of&lt;0.06 dex, with changes in [fei/h] of &lt;0.03 dex. for the case with a largersource-lens separation, the error in [fei/h] is &lt;0.01 dex. this latter caserepresents the maximum effect seen in events whose lightcurves are consistentwith a point-source lens, which includes the majority of microlensed bulgedwarfs published so far.

0910.4731	metallicity mapping with gri photometry: the virgo overdensity and the  halos of the galaxy	we describe the methodology required for estimation of photometric estimatesof metallicity based on the sdss gri passbands, which can be used to probe theproperties of main-sequence stars beyond ~ 10 kpc, complementing studies ofnearby stars from more metallicity-sensitive color indices that involve the upassband. as a first application of this approach, we determine photometricmetal abundance estimates for individual main-sequence stars in the virgooverdensity, which covers almost 1000 square degrees on the sky, based on acalibration of the metallicity sensitivity of stellar isochrones in the grifilter passbands using field stars with well-determined spectroscopic metalabundances. despite the low precision of the method for individual stars,internal errors of in [fe/h] ~ +/- 0.1 dex can be achieved for bulk stellarpopulations. the global metal abundance of the virgo overdensity determined inthis way is &lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -2.0 +/- 0.1 (internal) +/- 0.5 (systematic), fromphotometric measurements of 0.7 million stars with heliocentric distances from~ 10 kpc to ~ 20 kpc. a preliminary metallicity map, based on results for 2.9million stars in the northern sdss dr-7 footprint, exhibits a shift to lowermetallicities as one proceeds from the inner- to the outer-halo population,consistent with recent interpretation of the kinematics of local samples ofstars with spectroscopically available metallicity estimates and full spacemotions.

1002.0001	binary contamination in the segue sample: effects on sspp determinations  of stellar atmospheric parameters	using numerical modeling and a grid of synthetic spectra, we examine theeffects that unresolved binaries have on the determination of various stellaratmospheric parameters for segue targets measured using the segue stellarparameter pipeline (sspp). to model undetected binaries that may be in thesegue sample, we use a variety of mass distributions for the primary andsecondary stars in conjunction with empirically determined relationships fororbital parameters to determine the fraction of g-k dwarf stars, as defined bysdss color cuts, that will be blended with a secondary companion. we focus onthe g-k dwarf sample in segue as it records the history of chemical enrichmentin our galaxy. to determine the effect of the secondary on the spectroscopicparameters, we synthesize a grid of model spectra from 3275 to 7850 k (~0.1 to1.0 \msun) and [fe/h]=-0.5 to -2.5 from marcs model atmospheres usingturbospectrum. we analyze both "infinite" signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) modelsand degraded versions, at median s/n of 50, 25 and 10. by running individualand combined spectra (representing the binaries) through the sspp, we determinethat ~10% of the blended g-k dwarf pairs with s/n&gt;=25 will have theiratmospheric parameter determinations, in particular temperature andmetallicity, noticeably affected by the presence of an undetected secondary. toaccount for the additional uncertainty from binary contamination at a s/n~10,uncertainties of ~140 k and ~0.17 dex in [fe/h] must be added in quadrature tothe published uncertainties of the sspp. (abridged)

1010.2934	the segue stellar parameter pipeline. v. estimation of alpha-element  abundance ratios from low-resolution sdss/segue stellar spectra	we present a method for the determination of [alpha/fe] ratios fromlow-resolution (r = 2000) sdss/segue stellar spectra. by means of astar-by-star comparison with degraded spectra from the elodie spectral libraryand with a set of moderately high-resolution (r = 15,000) and medium-resolution(r = 6000) spectra of sdss/segue stars, we demonstrate that we are able tomeasure [alpha/fe] from sdss/segue spectra (with s/n &gt; 20/1) to a precision ofbetter than 0.1 dex, for stars with atmospheric parameters in the range teff =[4500, 7000] k, log g = [1.5, 5.0], and [fe/h] = [-1.4, +0.3], over the range[alpha/fe] = [-0.1, +0.6]. for stars with [fe/h] &lt; -1.4, our method requiresspectra with slightly higher signal-to-noise to achieve this precision (s/n &gt;25/1). over the full temperature range considered, the lowest metallicity starfor which a confident estimate of [alpha/fe] can be obtained from our approachis [fe/h] ~ -2.5; preliminary tests indicate that a metallicity limit as low as[fe/h] ~ -3.0 may apply to cooler stars. as a further validation of thisapproach, weighted averages of [alpha/fe] obtained for segue spectra of likelymember stars of galactic globular clusters (m15, m13, and m71) and openclusters (ngc 2420, m67, and ngc 6791) exhibit good agreement with the valuesof [alpha/fe] from previous studies. the results of the comparison with ngc6791 imply that the metallicity range for the method may extend to ~ +0.5.

1012.2800	fluorine and sodium in c-rich low-metallicity stars	we present the n, o, f and na abundance and 12c/13c isotopic ratiomeasurements or upper limits for a sample of 10 c-rich, metal-poor giant stars,eight enhanced in s-process (cemp-s) elements and two poor in n-captureelements (cemp-no). the abundances are derived from ir, k-band, high-resolutioncrires@vlt spectra obtained.  the metallicity of our sample ranges from [fe/h]=-3.4 to -1.3. f abundancecould be measured only in two cemp-s stars. with [f/fe]=0.64, one is mildlyf-overabundant, while the other is f-rich, at [f/fe]=1.44. for the remainingeight objects, including both cemp-no in our sample, only upper limits on fabundance could be placed. our measurements and upper limits show that there isa spread in [f/c+n] ratio in cemp-s stars as predicted by theory. predictionsfrom nucleosynthetic models for low-mass, low-metallicity asymptotic giantbranch stars, account for the derived f abundances, while the upper limits on fcontent derived for most of the stars are lower than the predicted values. themeasured na content is accounted for by agb models in the 1.25 to 1.7 msunrange, confirming that the stars responsible for the peculiar abundance patternobserved in cemp-s stars are low-mass, low-metallicity agb stars, in agreementwith the most accepted astrophysical scenario. we conclude that the mechanismof f production in current state-of-the-art low-metallicity low-mass agb modelsneeds further scrutiny and that f measurements in a larger number of metal-poorstars are needed to better constraint the models.

1101.0832	chemical abundances for evolved stars in m5: lithium through thorium	we present analysis of high-resolution spectra of a sample of stars in theglobular cluster m5 (ngc 5904). the sample includes stars from the red giantbranch (seven stars), the red horizontal branch (two stars), and the asymptoticgiant branch (eight stars), with effective temperatures ranging from 4000 k to6100 k. spectra were obtained with the hires spectrometer on the keck itelescope, with a wavelength coverage from 3700 to 7950 angstroms for the hband agb sample, and 5300 to 7600 angstroms for the majority of the rgb sample.we find offsets of some abundance ratios between the agb and the rgb branches.however, these discrepancies appear to be due to analysis effects, and indicatethat caution must be exerted when directly comparing abundance ratios betweendifferent evolutionary branches. we find the expected signatures of pollutionfrom material enriched in the products of the hot hydrogen burning cycles suchas the cno, ne-na, and mg-al cycles, but no significant differences withinthese signatures among the three stellar evolutionary branches especially whenconsidering the analysis offsets. we are also able to measure an assortment ofneutron-capture element abundances, from sr to th, in the cluster. we find thatthe neutron-capture signature for all stars is the same, and shows apredominately r-process origin. however, we also see evidence of a small butconsistent extra s-process signature that is not tied to the light-elementvariations, pointing to a pre-enrichment of this material in the protoclustergas.

1101.1529	sdss-iii: massive spectroscopic surveys of the distant universe, the  milky way galaxy, and extra-solar planetary systems	building on the legacy of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-i and ii),sdss-iii is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the milkyway, and the population of giant planets around other stars. in keeping withsdss tradition, sdss-iii will provide regular public releases of all its data,beginning with sdss dr8 (which occurred in jan 2011). this paper presents anoverview of the four sdss-iii surveys. boss will measure redshifts of 1.5million massive galaxies and lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using thebao feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations ofthe distance scale and hubble expansion rate at z&lt;0.7 and at z~2.5. segue-2,which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (r=1800) optical spectra of118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matterhalo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. apogee will obtainhigh-resolution (r~30,000), high signal-to-noise (s/n&gt;100 per resolutionelement), h-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the firsthigh-precision spectroscopic survey of all galactic stellar populations (bulge,bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectraldiagnostics. marvels will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 fgk starswith the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed todetect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedenteddata set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giantplanet systems.

1104.3114	formation and evolution of the disk system of the milky way: [alpha/fe]  ratios and kinematics of the segue g-dwarf sample	we employ measurements of the [alpha/fe] ratio derived from low-resolution(r~2000) spectra of 17,277 g-type dwarfs from the segue survey to separate theminto likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples. both subsamples exhibit stronggradients of orbital rotational velocity with metallicity, of opposite signs,-20 to -30 km/s/dex for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km/s/dex for thethick-disk population. the rotational velocity is uncorrelated withgalactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample, and exhibits a small trendfor the thick-disk subsample. the rotational velocity decreases with distancefrom the plane for both disk components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\pm} 1.0km/s/kpc). thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital eccentricity withmetallicity (about -0.2/dex), while the eccentricity does not change withmetallicity for the thin-disk subsample. the eccentricity is almost independentof galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginalgradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population.both subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity withdistance from the galactic plane. the shapes of the eccentricity distributionsfor the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent of distance from theplane, and include no significant numbers of stars with eccentricity above 0.6.among several contemporary models of disk evolution we consider, radialmigration appears to have played an important role in the evolution of thethin-disk population, but possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to thegas-rich merger or disk heating scenarios. we emphasize that more physicallyrealistic models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry outthe detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.

1106.2168	the [fe/h], [c/fe], and [alpha/fe] distributions of the bootes i dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	we present the results of a low-resolution spectral abundance study of 25stars in the bootes i dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. the data were obtainedwith the lris instrument at keck observatory, and allow us to measure [fe/h],[c/fe], and [alpha/fe] for each star. we find both a large spread inmetallicity (2.1 dex in [fe/h]) as well as the low average metallicity in thissystem, &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-2.59, matching previous estimates. this sample includes anewly discovered extremely metal-poor star, with [fe/h]=-3.8, that is one ofthe most metal-poor stars yet found in a dsph. we compare the metallicitydistribution function of bootes i to analytic chemical evolution models. whilethe metallicity distribution function of bootes i is best fit by an extra gaschemical evolution model, leaky-box models also provide reasonable fits. wealso find that the [alpha/fe] distribution and the carbon-enhanced metal-poorfraction of our sample (12%) are reasonable matches to galactic halo starsamples in the same metallicity range, indicating that at these lowmetallicities, systems like the bootes i ultra-faint dsph could have beencontributors to the galactic halo.

1205.4715	principal component abundance analysis of microlensed bulge dwarf and  subgiant stars	elemental abundance patterns can provide vital clues to the formation andenrichment history of a stellar population. here we present an investigation ofthe galactic bulge, where we apply principal component abundance analysis(pcaa)---a principal component decomposition of relative abundances [x/fe]---toa sample of 35 microlensed bulge dwarf and subgiant stars, characterizing theirdistribution in the 12-dimensional space defined by their measured elementalabundances. the first principal component pc1, which suffices to describe theabundance patterns of most stars in the sample, shows a strong contributionfrom alpha-elements, reflecting the relative contributions of type ii and typeia supernovae. the second principal component pc2 is characterized by a na--nicorrelation, the likely product of metallicity-dependent type ii supernovayields. the distribution in pc1 is bimodal, showing that the bimodalitypreviously found in the [fe/h] values of these stars is robustly andindependently recovered by looking at only their relative abundance patterns.the two metal-rich stars that are alpha-enhanced have outlier values of pc2 andpc3, respectively, further evidence that they have distinctive enrichmenthistories. applying pcaa to a sample of local thin and thick disk dwarfs yieldsa nearly identical pc1; in pc1, the metal-rich and metal-poor bulge dwarfstrack kinematically selected thin and thick disk dwarfs, respectively,suggesting broadly similar alpha-enrichment histories. however, the disk pc2 isdominated by a y--ba correlation, likely indicating a greater contribution ofs-process enrichment from long-lived asymptotic giant branch stars that isabsent from the bulge pc2 because of its rapid formation.

1301.1367	very metal-poor stars in the outer galactic bulge found by the apogee  survey	despite its importance for understanding the nature of early stellargenerations and for constraining galactic bulge formation models, at presentlittle is known about the metal-poor stellar content of the central milky way.this is a consequence of the great distances involved and intervening dustobscuration, which challenge optical studies. however, the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee), a wide-area, multifiber,high-resolution spectroscopic survey within sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii), is exploring the chemistry of all galactic stellar populations atinfrared wavelengths, with particular emphasis on the disk and the bulge. anautomated spectral analysis of data on 2,403 giant stars in twelve fields inthe bulge obtained during apogee commissioning yielded five stars with lowmetallicity([fe/h]$\le-1.7$), including two that are very metal-poor[fe/h]$\sim-2.1$ by bulge standards.  luminosity-based distance estimates place the five stars within the outerbulge, where other 1,246 of the analyzed stars may reside. a manual reanalysisof the spectra verifies the low metallicities, and finds these stars to beenhanced in the $\alpha$-elements o, mg, and si without significant$\alpha$-pattern differences with other local halo or metal-weak thick-diskstars of similar metallicity, or even with other more metal-rich bulge stars.while neither the kinematics nor chemistry of these stars can yet definitivelydetermine which, if any, are truly bulge members, rather than denizens of otherpopulations co-located with the bulge, the newly-identified stars reveal thatthe chemistry of metal-poor stars in the central galaxy resembles that ofmetal-weak thick-disk stars at similar metallicity.

0801.2159	a high-resolution spectrum of the highly magnified bulge g-dwarf  moa-2006-blg-099s	we analyze a high-resolution spectrum of a microlensed g-dwarf in thegalactic bulge, acquired when the star was magnified by a factor of 110. wemeasure a spectroscopic temperature, derived from the wings of the balmerlines, that is the same as the photometric temperature, derived using the colordetermined by standard microlensing techniques. we measure [fe/h]=0.36 +/-0.18,which places this star at the upper end of the bulge giant metallicitydistribution. in particular, this star is more metal-rich than any bulge mgiant with high-resolution abundances. we find that the abundance ratios ofalpha and iron-peak elements are similar to those of bulge giants with the samemetallicity. for the first time, we measure the abundances of k and zn for astar in the bulge. the [k/mg] ratio is similar to the value measured in thehalo and the disk, suggesting that k production closely tracks alphaproduction. the [cu/fe] and [zn/fe] ratios support the theory that thoseelements are produced in type ii sne, rather than type ia sne. we also measuredthe first c and n abundances in the bulge that have not been affected by firstdredge-up. the [c/fe] and [n/fe] ratios are close to solar, in agreement withthe hypothesis that giants experience only canonical mixing.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1308.0351	target selection for the apache point observatory galactic evolution  experiment (apogee)	the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) is ahigh-resolution infrared spectroscopic survey spanning all galacticenvironments (i.e., bulge, disk, and halo), with the principal goal ofconstraining dynamical and chemical evolution models of the milky way. apogeetakes advantage of the reduced effects of extinction at infrared wavelengths toobserve the inner galaxy and bulge at an unprecedented level of detail. thesurvey's broad spatial and wavelength coverage enables users of apogee data toaddress numerous galactic structure and stellar populations issues. in thispaper we describe the apogee targeting scheme and document its various targetclasses to provide the necessary background and reference information toanalyze samples of apogee data with awareness of the imposed selection criteriaand resulting sample properties. apogee's primary sample consists of ~100,000red giant stars, selected to minimize observational biases in age andmetallicity. we present the methodology and considerations that drive theselection of this sample and evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and caveats ofthe selection and sampling algorithms. we also describe additional targetclasses that contribute to the apogee sample, including numerous ancillaryscience programs, and we outline the targeting data that will be included inthe public data releases.

1308.4195	the open cluster chemical analysis and mapping survey: local galactic  metallicity gradient with apogee using sdss dr10	the open cluster chemical analysis and mapping (occam) survey aims to producea comprehensive, uniform, infrared-based dataset for hundreds of open clusters,and constrain key galactic dynamical and chemical parameters from this sample.this first contribution from the occam survey presents analysis of 141 membersstars in 28 open clusters with high-resolution metallicities derived from alarge uniform sample collected as part of the sdss-iii/apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee). this sample includes the firsthigh-resolution metallicity measurements for 22 open clusters. with thislargest ever uniformly observed sample of open cluster stars we investigate thegalactic disk gradients of both [m/h] and [alpha/m]. we find basically nogradient across this range in [alpha/m], but [m/h] does show a gradient forr_{gc} &lt; 10 kpc and a significant flattening beyond r_{gc} = 10 kpc. inparticular, whereas fitting a single linear trend yields an [m/h] gradient of-0.09 +/- 0.03$ dex/kpc --- similar to previously measure gradients inside 13kpc --- by independently fitting inside and outside 10 kpc separately we find asignificantly steeper gradient near the sun (7.9 &lt;= r_{gc} &lt;= 10) thanpreviously found (-0.20 +/- 0.08 dex/kpc) and a nearly flat trend beyond 10 kpc(-0.02 +/- 0.09 dex/kpc).

1309.5535	discovery of a dynamical cold point in the heart of the sagittarius dsph  galaxy with observations from the apogee project	the dynamics of the core of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dsph)galaxy are explored using high-resolution (r~22,500), h-band, near-infraredspectra of over 1,000 giant stars in the central 3 deg^2 of the system, ofwhich 328 are identified as sgr members. these data, among some of the earliestobservations from the sdss-iii/apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment (apogee) and the largest published sample of high resolution sgrdsph spectra to date, reveal a distinct gradient in the velocity dispersion ofsgr from 11-14 km/s for radii &gt;0.8 degrees from center to a dynamical coldpoint of 8 km/s in the sgr center --- a trend differing from that found inprevious kinematical analyses of sgr over larger scales that suggest a more orless flat dispersion profile at these radii. well-fitting mass models witheither cored and cusped dark matter distributions can be found to match thekinematical results, although the cored profile succeeds with significantlymore isotropic stellar orbits than required for a cusped profile. it isunlikely that the cold point reflects an unusual mass distribution. thedispersion gradient may arise from variations in the mixture of populationswith distinct kinematics within the dsph; this explanation is suggested (e.g.,by detection of a metallicity gradient across similar radii), but notconfirmed, by the present data. despite these remaining uncertainties abouttheir interpretation, these early test data (including some from instrumentcommissioning) demonstrate apogee's usefulness for precision dynamical studies,even for fields observed at extreme airmasses.

1311.4569	chemical cartography with apogee: large-scale mean metallicity maps of  the milky way	we present galactic mean metallicity maps derived from the first year of thesdss-iii apogee experiment. mean abundances in different zones ofgalactocentric radius (0 &lt; r &lt; 15 kpc) at a range of heights above the plane (0&lt; |z| &lt; 3 kpc), are derived from a sample of nearly 20,000 stars withunprecedented coverage, including stars in the galactic mid-plane at largedistances. we also split the sample into subsamples of stars with low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] abundance ratios. we assess possible biases in deriving themean abundances, and find they are likely to be small except in the innerregions of the galaxy. a negative radial gradient exists over much of thegalaxy; however, the gradient appears to flatten for r &lt; 6 kpc, in particularnear the galactic mid-plane and for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. at r &gt; 6 kpc, thegradient flattens as one moves off of the plane, and is flatter at all heightsfor high-[{\alpha}/m] stars than for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. alternatively,these gradients can be described as vertical gradients that flatten at largergalactocentric radius; these vertical gradients are similar for both low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] populations. stars with higher [{\alpha}/m] appear to have aflatter radial gradient than stars with lower [{\alpha}/m]. this could suggestthat the metallicity gradient has grown steeper with time or, alternatively,that gradients are washed out over time by migration of stars.

1401.1217	new red jewels in coma berenices	we have used sloan digital sky survey-iii (sdss-iii) apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee) radial velocity observations in thenear-infrared $h$-band to explore the membership of the nearby ($86.7 \pm 0.9$pc) open cluster coma berenices (melotte 111), concentrating on thepoorly-populated low-mass end of the main sequence. using sdss-iii apogeeradial velocity measurements, we confirm the membership of eight k/m dwarfmembers, providing the first confirmed low-mass members of the coma berenicescluster. using $r\sim2000$ spectra from irtf-spex, we confirm the independentlyluminosity classes of these targets, and find their metallicities to beconsistent with the known solar mean metallicity of coma berenices and of mdwarfs in the solar neighborhood. in addition, the apogee spectra have enabledmeasurement of $v\sin i$ for each target and detection for the first time ofthe low-mass secondary components of the known binary systems melotte 111 102and melotte 111 120, as well as identification of the previously unknown binarysystem 2mass j12214070+2707510. finally, we use kilodegree extremely littletelescope (kelt) photometry to measure photometric variability and rotationperiods for a subset of the coma berenices members.

1403.1872	testing the asteroseismic mass scale using metal-poor stars  characterized with apogee and kepler	fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can beinferred using asteroseismology. cool stars with convective envelopes haveturbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp pulsations. theproperties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass andradius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. stellar properties derivedusing these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities.because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysicalpriors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic massestimates in the low-metallicity regime. we identify nine metal-poor red giants(including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from asample observed by both the kepler space telescope and the sloan digital skysurvey-iii apogee spectroscopic survey. we compare masses inferred usingasteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. although oursample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismicparameters from the apokasc catalog, produce masses that are systematicallyhigher (&lt;{\delta}m&gt;=0.17+/-0.05 msun) than astrophysical expectations. themagnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical correctionsto the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. usingalternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematicshifts at the 0.04 msun level. we also compare published asteroseismic analyseswith scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the frequencyof maximum power as a constraint. upcoming apokasc observations will provide alarger sample of ~100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismiccharacterization of galactic stellar populations.

1405.1032	the apogee red-clump catalog: precise distances, velocities, and  high-resolution elemental abundances over a large area of the milky way's  disk	the sloan digital sky survey iii's apache point observatory galacticevolution experiment (apogee) is a high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopicsurvey covering all of the major components of the galaxy, including thedust-obscured regions of the inner milky way disk and bulge. here we present asample of 10,341 likely red-clump stars (rc) from the first two years of apogeeoperations, selected based on their position incolor-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature space using a newmethod calibrated using stellar-evolution models and high-qualityasteroseismology data. the narrowness of the rc locus incolor-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the starswith an accuracy of 5 to 10%. the sample extends to typical distances of about3 kpc from the sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and spans a volume ofapproximately 100 kpc^3 over 5 kpc &lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc, |z| &lt;~ 2 kpc, and -15 deg &lt;~galactocentric azimuth &lt;~ 30 deg. the apogee red-clump (apogee-rc) catalogcontains photometry from 2mass, reddening estimates, distances, line-of-sightvelocities, stellar parameters and elemental abundances determined from thehigh-resolution apogee spectra, and matches to major proper motion catalogs. wedetermine the survey selection function for this data set and discuss how therc selection samples the underlying stellar populations. we use this sample tolimit any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the ~45degree-wide azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be &lt;= 0.02 dex,which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the radial metallicitygradient. this result constrains coherent non-axisymmetric flows within a fewkpc from the sun.

1405.6724	the vertical metallicity gradient of the milky way disk: transitions in  [a/fe] populations	using g dwarfs from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey, we have determined a vertical metallicity gradientover a large volume of the milky way's disk, and examined how this gradientvaries for different [a/fe] subsamples. this sample contains over 40,000 starswith low-resolution spectroscopy over 144 lines of sight. we employ the seguestellar parameter pipeline (sspp) to obtain estimates of effective temperature,surface gravity, [fe/h], and [a/fe] for each star and extract multiplevolume-complete subsamples of approximately 1000 stars each. based on thesurvey's consistent target-selection algorithm, we adjust each subsample todetermine an unbiased picture of the disk in [fe/h] and [a/fe]; consequently,each individual star represents the properties of many. the segue sample allowsus to constrain the vertical metallicity gradient for a large number of starsover a significant volume of the disk, between ~0.3 and 1.6 kpc from thegalactic plane, and examine the in situ structure, in contrast to previousanalyses which are more limited in scope. this work does not pre-suppose a diskstructure, whether composed of a single complex population or a distinct thinand thick disk component. the metallicity gradient is -0.243 +0.039 -0.053dex/kpc for the sample as a whole, which we compare to various literatureresults. each [a/fe] subsample dominates at a different range of heights abovethe plane of the galaxy, which is exhibited in the gradient found in the sampleas a whole. stars over a limited range in [a/fe] show little change in median[fe/h] with height. if we associate [a/fe] with age, our consistent verticalmetallicity gradients with [a/fe] suggest that stars formed in different epochsexhibit comparable vertical structure, implying similar star-formationprocesses and evolution.

1409.3566	tracing chemical evolution over the extent of the milky way's disk with  apogee red clump stars	we employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolutionsdss-iii/apogee spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution ofmetallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of themilky way disk. using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clumpstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h]distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/fe] at intermediatemetallicities, -0.9&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([fe/h]=+0.2) thetwo sequences smoothly merge. we investigate the effects of the apogeeselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have littlequalitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. the describedabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5&lt;r&lt;11 kpc and 0&lt;|z|&lt;2 kpcacross the galaxy. the [alpha/fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence issurprisingly constant throughout the galaxy, with little variation from regionto region (~10%). using simple galactic chemical evolution models we derive anaverage star formation efficiency (sfe) in the high-alpha sequence of ~4.5e-101/yr, which is quite close to the nearly-constant value found inmolecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. this result suggests thatthe early evolution of the milky way disk was characterized by stars thatshared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,turbulent, and molecular-dominated ism with a gas consumption timescale (1/sfe)of ~2 gyr. finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner galaxycan be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold inthe outer galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations withdistinct enrichment histories.

1410.1350	bayesian distances and extinctions for giants observed by kepler and  apogee	we present a first determination of distances and extinctions for individualstars in the first release of the apokasc catalogue, built from the jointefforts of the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee)and the kepler asteroseismic science consortium (kasc). our method takes intoaccount the spectroscopic constraints derived from the apogee stellarparameters and chemical abundances pipeline, together with the asteroseismicparameters from kasc. these parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsicstellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the bayesian toolparam. we then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observedphotometry in sdss, 2mass, and wise passbands. the first 1989 giants targetedby apokasc are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, withindividual uncertainties of just ~1.8 per cent. our extinction estimates aresystematically smaller than provided in the kepler input catalogue and by theschlegel, finkbeiner and davis maps. distances to individual stars in the ngc6791 and ngc 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals.comparison with the apogee red clump and saga catalogues provide another usefulcheck, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few percent.overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinctiondeterminations for the bulk of the apokasc sample. approximately one third ofthe stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions andhence increased uncertainties. uncertainties are expected to be reduced infuture releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will haveseismically-determined evolutionary status classifications.

1410.2503	the apokasc catalog: an asteroseismic and spectroscopic joint survey of  targets in the kepler fields	we present the first apokasc catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismicproperties of 1916 red giants observed in the kepler fields. the spectroscopicparameters provided from the apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the keplerasteroseismology science consortium. we assess both random and systematicsources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in thekepler fields. total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order80 k in teff , 0.06 dex in [m/h], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in massand radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and randomerrors. asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise andaccurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their meanvalues and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. there are, however,systematic underlying trends with teff and log g. our effective temperaturescale is between 0-200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared fluxmethod, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for alower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog (kic).we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic andspectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in kicmetallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in teffand log g consistent with those derived in the literature. we present meanfitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss futureprospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

1503.02110	chemical cartography with apogee: metallicity distribution functions and  the chemical structure of the milky way disk	using a sample of 69,919 red giants from the sdss-iii/apogee data release 12,we measure the distribution of stars in the [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane andthe metallicity distribution functions (mdf) across an unprecedented volume ofthe milky way disk, with radius $3&lt;r&lt;15$ kpc and height $|z|&lt;2$ kpc. stars inthe inner disk ($r&lt;5$ kpc) lie along a single track in [$\alpha$/fe] vs.[fe/h], starting with $\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at[$\alpha$/fe]$\sim0$ and [fe/h]$\sim+0.4$. at larger radii we find two distinctsequences in [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] space, with a roughly solar-$\alpha$sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-$\alpha$ sequence thatmerges with the low-$\alpha$ sequence at super-solar [fe/h]. the location ofthe high-$\alpha$ sequence is nearly constant across the disk, however thereare very few high-$\alpha$ stars at $r&gt;11$ kpc. the peak of the midplane mdfshifts to lower metallicity at larger $r$, reflecting the galactic metallicitygradient. most strikingly, the shape of the midplane mdf changes systematicallywith radius, with a negatively skewed distribution at $3&lt;r&lt;7$ kpc, to a roughlygaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in theouter galaxy. for stars with $|z|&gt;1$ kpc or [$\alpha$/fe]$&gt;0.18$, the mdf showslittle dependence on $r$. the positive skewness of the outer disk mdf may be asignature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations byorbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of mdf shape but asimple model of radial migration can do so.

1505.03536	rapid rotation of low-mass red giants using apokasc: a measure of  interaction rates on the post-main-sequence	we investigate the occurrence rate of rapidly rotating ($v\sin i$$&gt;$10 kms$^{-1}$), low-mass giant stars in the apogee-kepler (apokasc) fields withasteroseismic mass and surface gravity measurements. such stars are likelymerger products and their frequency places interesting constraints on stellarpopulation models. we also identify anomalous rotators, i.e. stars with 5 kms$^{-1}$$&lt;$$v\sin i$$&lt;$10 km s$^{-1}$ that are rotating significantly fasterthan both angular momentum evolution predictions and the measured rates ofsimilar stars. our data set contains fewer rapid rotators than one would expectgiven measurements of the galactic field star population, which likelyindicates that asteroseismic detections are less common in rapidly rotating redgiants. the number of low-mass moderate (5-10 km s$^{-1}$) rotators in oursample gives a lower limit of 7% for the rate at which low-mass stars interacton the upper red giant branch because single stars in this mass range areexpected to rotate slowly. finally, we classify the likely origin of the rapidor anomalous rotation where possible. kic 10293335 is identified as a mergerproduct and kic 6501237 is a possible binary system of two oscillating redgiants.

1509.05420	the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee)	the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee), one ofthe programs in the sloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii), has now completedits systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all major populationsof the milky way. after a three year observing campaign on the sloan 2.5-mtelescope, apogee has collected a half million high resolution (r~22,500), highs/n (&gt;100), infrared (1.51-1.70 microns) spectra for 146,000 stars, with timeseries information via repeat visits to most of these stars. this paperdescribes the motivations for the survey and its overall design---hardware,field placement, target selection, operations---and gives an overview of theseaspects as well as the data reduction, analysis and products. an index is alsogiven to the complement of technical papers that describe various criticalsurvey components in detail. finally, we discuss the achieved surveyperformance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data productsby way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time seriesanalysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations fromstellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity and abundancepatterns across the galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of theinterstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rarestellar species. as part of sdss-iii data release 12, all of the apogee dataproducts are now publicly available.

1510.07635	aspcap: the apogee stellar parameter and chemical abundances pipeline	the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) has builtthe largest moderately high-resolution (r=22, 500) spectroscopic map of thestars across the milky way, and including dust-obscured areas. the apogeestellar parameter and chemical abundances pipeline (aspcap) is the softwaredeveloped for the automated analysis of these spectra. aspcap determinesatmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra bycomparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using chi-2minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. the package consists of afortran90 code that does the actual minimization, and a wrapper idl code forbook-keeping and data handling. this paper explains in detail the aspcapcomponents and functionality, and presents results from a number of testsdesigned to check its performance. aspcap provides stellar effectivetemperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2%, 0.1 dex, and0.05 dex, respectively, for most apogee stars, which are predominantly giants.it also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levelsof precision, typically under 0.1 dex. the final data release (dr12) of thesloan digital sky survey iii contains an apogee database of more than 150,000stars. aspcap development continues in the sdss-iv apogee-2 survey.

0808.0001	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  crowded field photometry and cluster fiducial sequences in ugriz	we present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to exploit over 100 million stellarobjects with r &lt; 22.5 mag observed by sdss, we need to understand thecharacteristics of stars in the sdss ugriz filters. while star clusters provideimportant calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globularclusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded forthe standard sdss photometric pipeline to process. to complement the sdssimaging survey, we reduce the sdss imaging data for crowded cluster fieldsusing the daophot/allframe suite of programs and present photometry for 17globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a sdss value-added catalog. ourphotometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native sdss 2.5-meterugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied tothe sdss photometry without relying upon any transformations. model photometryfor red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by girardi et al. cannotbe matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by~0.02-0.05 mag. good agreement (&lt; ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with clem etal. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformationequations in tucker et al.

astro-ph;0111181	abundances of 30 elements in 23 metal-poor stars	we report the abundances of 30 elements in 23 metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt;-1.7)giants. these are based on 7774 equivalent widths and spectral synthesis of 229additional lines. hyperfine splitting is taken into account when appropriate.our choice of model atmospheres has the most influence on the accuracy of ourabundances. we consider the effect of different model atmospheres on ourresults. in addition to the random errors in teff, log g, and microturbulentvelocity, there are several sources of systematic error. these include usingteff determined from fei lines rather than colors, ignoring nlte effects on thefei/feii ionization balance, using models with solar [alpha/fe] ratios andusing kurucz models with overshooting. of these, only the use of models withsolar [alpha/fe] ratios had a negligible effect. however, while the absoluteabundances can change by &gt; 0.10 dex, the relative abundances, especiallybetween closely allied atoms such as the rare earth group, often show onlysmall (&lt;0.03 dex) changes. we found that some strong lines of fei, mni and criconsistently gave lower abundances by ~0.2 dex, a number larger than the quotederrors in the gf values. after considering a model with depth-dependentmicroturbulent velocity and a model with hotter temperatures in the upperlayers, we conclude that the latter did a better job of resolving the problemand agreeing with observational evidence for the structure of stars. the erroranalysis includes the effects of correlation of teff, log g, and microturbulentvelocity errors, which is crucial for certain element ratios, such as [mg/fe].the abundances presented here are being analyzed and discussed in a separateseries of papers.

astro-ph;0307063	oxygen abundances in metal-poor stars	we present oxygen abundances derived from both the permitted and forbiddenoxygen lines for 55 subgiants and giants with [fe/h] values between -2.7 andsolar with the goal of understanding the discrepancy in the derived abundances.a first attempt, using \teff{} values from photometric calibrations and surfacegravities from luminosities, obtained agreement between the indicators forturn-off stars, but the disagreement was large for evolved stars. we find thatthe difference in the oxygen abundances derived from the permitted andforbidden lines is most strongly affected by \teff{}, and we derive a new\teff{} scale based on forcing the two sets of lines to give the same oxygenabundances. these new parameters, however, do not agree with other observables,such as theoretical isochrones or balmer-line profile based \teff{}determinations. our analysis finds that one-dimensional, lte analyses (withpublished nlte corrections for the permitted lines) cannot fully resolve thedisagreement in the two indicators without adopting a temperature scaleincompatible with other temperature indicators. we also find no evidence ofcircumstellar emission in the forbidden lines, removing such emission as apossible cause for the discrepancy.

astro-ph;0402003	the s-process in metal-poor stars: abundances for 22 neutron-capture  elements in cs 31062-050	the ch star cs 31062-050 ([fe/h]=-2.42) is one of the most useful stars yetdiscovered for evaluating the s-process in metal-poor stars. it is veryabundant in heavy elements (e.g., [la/fe]=2.2), and its relatively cooltemperature and low gravity mean that there are many lines of interestingelements present in the spectrum. we measured the abundances of 22 elementswith z&gt;29, including the rarely measured lu and pd. we derive an upper limit onthe th abundance as well. the abundances in cs 31062-050 show a similar patternto many other metal-poor ch stars: high [pb/fe] and [pb/la] ratios, low [y/la]ratios and high [eu/la] values compared to the solar system s-process. however,the th limit, with additional assumptions, is not consistent with the idea thatthe excess eu in cs 31062-050 is contributed by the r-process. in addition, theobserved [eu/tb] cannot be explained by any ratio of solar-system s-process andr-process abundances. we therefore argue that the abundance pattern in cs31062-050 is most likely the result of the s-process, and we discuss possiblemodifications that could explain the non-solar-system pattern observed.

astro-ph;0512132	chemical compositions of red giant stars in old large magellanic cloud  globular clusters	we have observed ten red giant stars in four old large magellanic cloudglobular clusters with the high-resolution spectrograph mike on the magellanlandon clay 6.5-m telescope. the stars in our sample have up to 20 elementalabundance determinations for the alpha-, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elementgroups. we have also derived abundances for the light odd-z elements na and al.we find ngc 2005 and ngc 2019 to be more metal-rich than previous estimatesfrom the ca ii triplet, and we derive [fe/h] values closer to those obtainedfrom the slope of the red giant branch. however, we confirm previousdeterminations for hodge 11 and ngc 1898 to within 0.2 dex. the lmc cluster[mg/fe] and [si/fe] ratios are comparable to the values observed in oldgalactic globular cluster stars, as are the abundances [y/fe], [ba/fe], and[eu/fe]. the lmc clusters do not share the low-y behavior observed in somedwarf spheroidal galaxies. [ca/fe], [ti/fe], and [v/fe] in the lmc, however,are significantly lower than what is seen in the galactic globular clustersystem. neither does the behavior of [cu/fe] as a function of [fe/h] in our lmcclusters match the trend seen in the galaxy, staying instead at a constantvalue of ~0.8. because not all [alpha/fe] ratios are suppressed, theseabundance ratios cannot be attributed solely to the injection of type ia snematerial, and instead reflect the differences in star formation history of thelmc vs. the milky way. we conclude that many of the abundances in the lmcglobular clusters we observed are distinct from those observed in the milkyway, and these differences are intrinsic to the stars in those systems.

astro-ph;0608666	a search for nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor stars	theoretical models of very metal-poor intermediate-mass asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars predict a large overabundance of primary nitrogen. the verymetal-poor, carbon-enhanced, s-process-rich stars, which are thought to be thepolluted companions of now-extinct agb stars, provide direct tests of thepredictions of these models. recent studies of the carbon and nitrogenabundances in metal-poor stars have focused on the most carbon-rich stars,leading to a potential selection bias against stars that have been polluted byagb stars that produced large amounts of nitrogen, and hence have small [c/n]ratios. we call these stars nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (nemp) stars, anddefine them as having [n/fe] &gt; +0.5 and [c/n] &lt; -0.5. in this paper, we reporton the [c/n] abundances of a sample of 21 carbon-enhanced stars, all but threeof which have [c/fe] &lt; +2.0. if nemp stars were made as easily ascarbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars, then we expected to find between twoand seven nemp stars. instead, we found no nemp stars in our sample. therefore,this observational bias is not an important contributor to the apparent dearthof n-rich stars. our [c/n] values are in the same range as values reportedpreviously in the literature (-0.5 to +2.0), and all stars are in disagreementwith the predicted [c/n] ratios for both low-mass and high-mass agb stars. wesuggest that the decrease in [c/n] from the low-mass agb models is due toenhanced extra-mixing, while the lack of nemp stars may be caused byunfavorable mass ratios in binaries or the difficulty of mass transfer inbinary systems with large mass ratios.

astro-ph;9809176	ages for globular clusters in the outer galactic halo: the second  parameter clusters palomar~3, palomar~4 and eridanus	we have used the wfpc2 camera on the hubble space telescope to obtainphotometry of the outer-halo globular clusters palomar 3, palomar 4, anderidanus. these three are classic examples of the "second parameter" anomalybecause of their red horizontal-branch morphologies in combination with theirlow-to-intermediate metallicities. our color-magnitude diagrams in (v, v-i)reach $v_{lim} \simeq 27.0$, clearly delineating the subgiant and turnoffregions and about three magnitudes of the unevolved main sequences. the slopesand dereddened colors of the giant branches are consistent with published[fe/h] estimates that rank the clusters (pal 3, eridanus, pal 4) in order ofincreasing metallicity, with all three falling near or between the abundancevalues of the classic nearby halo clusters m3 and m5. differential fits oftheir color-magnitude diagrams are made to each other and to m3 and m5 forrelative age determinations. we find that the three outer-halo cluster cmdsdiffer from the nearby clusters in a way that is consistent with their beingyounger by $\sim 1.5 - 2 $gyr, if we have correctly estimated the clusters'chemical-abundance ratios. conversely, the inferred age difference could besmaller ($\ltsim 1 $gyr) if either [fe/h] or [$\alpha$/fe] for the outer-haloclusters is significantly lower than we have assumed. possible age spreads oforder 1$ $gyr among both the nearby and outer-halo clusters may also bepresent.
