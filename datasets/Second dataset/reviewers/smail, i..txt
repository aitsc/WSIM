0812.4405	abell 851 and the role of starbursts in cluster galaxy evolution	we use extensive new observations of the very rich z ~ 0.4 cluster ofgalaxies a851 to examine the nature and origin of starburst galaxies inintermediate-redshift clusters. new hst observations, spitzer photometry andground-based spectroscopy cover most of a region of the cluster about 10 arcminacross, corresponding to a clustercentric radial distance of about 1.6 mpc.this spatial coverage allows us to confirm the existence of amorphology-density relation within this cluster, and to identify several large,presumably infalling, subsystems. we confirm our previous conclusion that avery large fraction of the starforming galaxies in a851 have recently undergonestarbursts. we argue that starbursts are mostly confined to two kinds of sites:infalling groups and the cluster center. at the cluster center it appears thatinfalling galaxies are undergoing major mergers, resulting in starbursts whoseoptical emission lines are completely buried beneath dust. the aftermath ofthis process appears to be proto-s0 galaxies devoid of star formation. incontrast, major mergers do not appear to be the cause of most of the starburstsin infalling groups, and fewer of these events result in the transformation ofthe galaxy into an s0. some recent theoretical work provides possibleexplanations for these two distinct processes, but it is not clear whether theycan operate with the very high efficiency needed to account for the very largestarburst rate observed.

0904.0028	a laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south - submillimeter  properties of near-ir selected galaxies	using the 330hr eso-mpg 870-micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdf-s) obtained with the large apex bolometer camera (laboca) on theatacama pathfinder experiment (apex), we have carried out a stacking analysisat submillimeter (submm) wavelengths of a sample of 8266 near-infra-red(near-ir) selected (k_vega &lt;= 20) galaxies, including 893 bzk galaxies, 1253extremely red objects (eros) and 737 distant red galaxies (drgs), selected fromthe multi-wavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc). we measure average870-micron fluxes of 0.20+-0.01mjy (20.0sigma), 0.45+-0.04mjy (11.3sigma),0.42+-0.03mjy (14.0sigma), and 0.41+-0.04mjy (10.3sigma) for the k_vega &lt;= 20,bzk, ero and drg samples, respectively. for the bzk, ero and drg subsamples,which overlap to some degree and are like to be at z ~ 1-2, this implies anaverage far-ir luminosity of ~2-6x10^{11} lsolar and star formation rate of~40-100msolar. splitting the bzk galaxies up into star-forming (sbzk) andpassive (pbzk) galaxies, the former is significantly detected (0.48+-0.04mjy,12.0sigma) while the latter is only marginally detected (0.27+-0.10mjy,2.7sigma), thus confirming that the sbzk/pbzk criteria do isolate obscured,star forming and truly passive galaxies. the k_vega &lt;= 20 galaxies are found tocontribute with 6.6+-0.3jy deg^{-2} (~15%) to the 870-micron extragalacticbackground light (ebl). sbzk and pbzk galaxies contribute 1.7+-0.2jy deg^{-2}(~4%) and 0.2+-0.1 jy deg^{-2} (&lt; 0.5%) to the ebl.

0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

1002.0071	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: two modes of  star formation in agn hosts?	we study the co-existence of star formation and agn activity in x-rayselected agn by analyzing stacked 870um submm emission from a deep and wide mapof the extended chandra deep field south, obtained with laboca at the apextelescope. the total x-ray sample of 895 sources with median redshift z~1 isdetected at a mean submm flux of 0.49+-0.04mjy, corresponding to a typical starformation rate around 30msun/yr for a t=35k, beta=1.5 greybody far-infraredsed. the good s/n permits stacking analyses for subgroups. we observe a trendof star formation rate increasing with redshift. an increase of star formationrate with agn luminosity is indicated at the highest l_2-10&gt;~1e44erg/sluminosities only. increasing trends with x-ray obscuration as expected in someagn evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the x-ray agnsample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects. thissuggests a transition between two modes in the coexistence of agn activity andstar formation. for the bulk of the sample, the x-ray luminosity andobscuration of the agn are not intimately linked to the global star formationrate of their hosts. the hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly,at rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxieswithout an agn at similar redshifts. the change indicated towards more intensestar formation, and a more pronounced increase in star formation rates betweenunobscured and obscured agn at highest luminosities suggests that luminous agnfollow an evolutionary path on which obscured agn activity and intense starformation are linked, possibly via merging. comparison to local hard x-rayselected agn supports this interpretation.

1201.2908	a bright z=5.2 lensed submillimeter galaxy in the field of abell 773:  hlsj091828.6+514223	during our herschel lensing survey (hls) of massive galaxy clusters, we havediscovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster abell 773,which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (smg) at z=5.2429.this source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered byherschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mjy at 500\micron)and its high redshift. the dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not thecluster itself. the source has a far-infrared (fir) luminosity of l_fir= 1.110^{14}/\mu lo, where \mu is the magnification factor, likely \sim 11. wereport here the redshift identification through co lines with the iram-30m, andthe analysis of the gas excitation, based on co(7-6), co(6-5), co(5-4) detectedat iram and the co(2-1) at the evla. all lines decompose into a wide and strongred component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540\kms apart.assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ulirg) co-to-h2 conversion ratio, the h2mass is 5.8 10^{11}/\mu mo, of which one third is in a cool component. from theci line we derive a ci/h2 number abundance of 6 10^{-5} similar to that inother ulirgs. the h2o line is strong only in the red velocity component, withan intensity ratio i(h_2o)/i(co) \sim 0.5, suggesting a strong local firradiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (agn) component. we detect the[nii]205\mics line for the first time at high-z. it shows comparable blue andred components, with a strikingly broad blue one, suggesting strong ionized gasflows.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1205.2370	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields - ii.  identifications, redshifts, and evidence for large-scale structure	the aztec 1.1 mm survey of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) fields is the largest (0.7 deg2) blank-field millimetre-wavelengthsurvey undertaken to date at a resolution of ~18" and a depth of ~1 mjy. wehave used the deep optical-to-radio multi-wavelength data in the shades lockmanhole east and sxdf/uds fields to obtain galaxy identifications for ~64% (~80%with tentative identifications) of the 148 aztec-shades 1.1 mm sources,exploiting deep radio and 24 um data complemented by methods based on 8 umflux-density and red optical-infrared (i-k) colour. this unusually highidentification rate can be attributed to the relatively brightmillimetre-wavelength flux-density threshold, combined with the relatively deepsupporting multi-frequency data. we have further exploited theoptical-mid-infrared-radio data to derive a ~60% (~75% with tentativeidentifications) complete redshift distribution for the aztec-shades sources,yielding a median redshift of z~2.2, with a high-redshift tail extending to atleast z~4. despite the larger area probed by the aztec survey relative to theoriginal scuba shades imaging, the redshift distribution of the aztec sourcesis consistent with that displayed by the scuba sources, and reinforcestentative evidence that the redshift distribution of mm/sub-mm sources in thelockman hole field is significantly different from that found in the sxdf/udsfield. comparison with simulated surveys of similar scale extracted fromsemi-analytic models based on the millennium simulation indicates that this isas expected if the mm/sub-mm sources are massive (m&gt;10^11 mo) star-forminggalaxies tracing large-scale structures over scales of 10-20 mpc. this confirmsthe importance of surveys covering several square degrees (as now underway withscuba2) to obtain representative samples of bright (sub)mm-selected galaxies.

1206.4263	the vista deep extragalactic observations (video) survey	in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible andinfrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) deep extragalactic observations(video) survey. video is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared z,y,j,h andk_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and largestructures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from thepresent day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (agn) and the most massivegalaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. with its depth and area,video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn andstarburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters werebeginning to virialize. video therefore offers a unique data set with which toinvestigate the interplay between agn, starbursts and environment, and the roleof feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.  we provide data over the video-xmm3 tile, which also covers thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey deep-1 field (cfhtls-d1). thereleased video data reach a 5-sigma ab-magnitude depth of z=25.7, y=24.5,j=24.4, h=24.1 and k_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth ofy=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find goodastrometric agreement with the two-micron all sky survey, and source counts inagreement with the recently released ultravista survey data. the addition ofthe video data to the cfhtls-d1 optical data increases the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophicoutliers over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absenceof an i-band luminosity prior.

1207.2174	discovery of "warm dust" galaxies in clusters at z~0.3: evidence for  stripping of cool dust in the dense environment?	using far-infrared imaging from the "herschel lensing survey", we derive dustproperties of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster member galaxies within twomassive systems at z~0.3: the merging bullet cluster and the more relaxedms2137.3-2353. most star-forming cluster sources (~90%) have characteristicdust temperatures similar to local field galaxies of comparable infrared (ir)luminosity (t_dust ~ 30k). several sub-lirg (l_ir &lt; 10^11 l_sun) bullet clustermembers are much warmer (t_dust &gt; 37k) with far-infrared spectral energydistribution (sed) shapes resembling lirg-type local templates. x-ray andmid-infrared data suggest that obscured active galactic nuclei do notcontribute significantly to the infrared flux of these "warm dust" galaxies.sources of comparable ir-luminosity and dust temperature are not observed inthe relaxed cluster ms2137, although the significance is too low to speculateon an origin involving recent cluster merging. "warm dust" galaxies are,however, statistically rarer in field samples (&gt; 3sigma), indicating that theresponsible mechanism may relate to the dense environment. the spatialdistribution of these sources is similar to the whole far-infrared brightpopulation, i.e. preferentially located in the cluster periphery, although thegalaxy hosts tend towards lower stellar masses (m_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun). we proposedust stripping and heating processes which could be responsible for theunusually warm characteristic dust temperatures. a normal star-forming galaxywould need 30-50% of its dust removed (preferentially stripped from the outerreaches, where dust is typically cooler) to recover a sed similar to a "warmdust" galaxy. these progenitors would not require a higher ir-luminosity ordust mass than the currently observed normal star-forming population.

0712.3613	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - ix: the  environment, mass and redshift dependence of star formation	we present a comparison between the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) at 450 and 850 microns in the lockman hole east with a deep spitzerspace telescope survey at 3.6-24 microns conducted in guaranteed time. usingstacking analyses we demonstrate a striking correspondence between the galaxiescontributing the submm extragalactic background light, with those likely todominate the backgrounds at spitzer wavelengths. using a combination brizk plusspitzer photometric redshifts, we show that at least a third of thespitzer-identified submm galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 appear to reside in overdensitieswhen the density field is smoothed at 0.5-2 mpc comoving diameters, supportingthe high-redshift reversal of the local star formation - galaxy densityrelation. we derive the dust-shrouded cosmic star formation history of galaxiesas a function of assembled stellar masses. for model stellar masses &lt;10^11msun, this peaks at lower redshifts than the ostensible z~2.2 maximum for submmpoint sources, adding to the growing consensus for ``downsizing'' in starformation. our surveys are also consistent with ``downsizing'' in massassembly. both the mean star formation rates &lt;dm/dt&gt; and specific starformation rates &lt;(1/m)dm/dt&gt; are in striking disagreement with somesemi-analytic predictions from the millenium simulation. the discrepancy couldeither be resolved with a top-heavy initial mass function, or a significantcomponent of the submm flux heated by the interstellar radiation field.

1310.6364	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the agn fraction and x-ray properties of submillimeter galaxies	the large gas and dust reservoirs of submm galaxies (smgs) could potentiallyprovide ample fuel to trigger an active galactic nucleus (agn), but previousstudies of the agn fraction in smgs have been controversial largely due to theinhomogeneity and limited angular resolution of the available submillimetersurveys. here we set improved constraints on the agn fraction and x-rayproperties of the smgs with alma and chandra observations in the extendedchandra deep field-south (e-cdf-s). this study is the first among similar worksto have unambiguously identified the x-ray counterparts of smgs; this isaccomplished using the fully submm-identified, statistically reliable smgcatalog with 99 smgs from the alma laboca e-cdf-s submillimeter survey (aless).we found 10 x-ray sources associated with smgs (median redshift z = 2.3), ofwhich 8 were identified as agns using several techniques that enablecross-checking. the other 2 x-ray detected smgs have levels of x-ray emissionthat can be plausibly explained by their star-formation activity. 6 of the 8smg-agns are moderately/highly absorbed, with n_h &gt; 10e23 cm-2. an analysis ofthe agn fraction, taking into account the spatial variation of x-raysensitivity, yields an agn fraction of 17+16-6% for agns with rest-frame 0.5-8kev absorption-corrected luminosity &gt;7.8x10e42 erg s-1; we provide estimatedagn fractions as a function of x-ray flux and luminosity. alma's high angularresolution also enables direct x-ray stacking at the precise positions of smgsfor the first time, and we found 4 potential smg-agns in our stacking sample.

1403.2994	herschel-atlas: properties of dusty massive galaxies at low and high  redshifts	we present a comparison of the physical properties of a rest-frame $250\mu$mselected sample of massive, dusty galaxies from $0&lt;z&lt;5.3$. our sample comprises29 high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs) from the literature, and 843dusty galaxies at $z&lt;0.5$ from the herschel-atlas, selected to have a similarstellar mass to the smgs. the $z&gt;1$ smgs have an average sfr of$390^{+80}_{-70}\,$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ which is 120 times that of thelow-redshift sample matched in stellar mass to the smgs (sfr$=3.3\pm{0.2}$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). the smgs harbour a substantial mass of dust($1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times{10}^9\,$m$_\odot$), compared to$(1.6\pm0.1)\times{10}^8\,$m$_\odot$ for low-redshift dusty galaxies. at lowredshifts the dust luminosity is dominated by the diffuse ism, whereas a largefraction of the dust luminosity in smgs originates from star-forming regions.at the same dust mass smgs are offset towards a higher sfr compared to thelow-redshift h-atlas galaxies. this is not only due to the higher gas fractionin smgs but also because they are undergoing a more efficient mode of starformation, which is consistent with their bursty star-formation histories. theoffset in sfr between smgs and low-redshift galaxies is similar to that foundin co studies, suggesting that dust mass is as good a tracer of molecular gasas co.

0803.0634	weighing the black holes in z~2 submillimeter-emitting galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we place direct observational constraints on the black-hole masses of thecosmologically important z~2 submillimeter-emitting galaxy (smg; f850&gt;4mjy)population, and use measured host-galaxy masses to explore their evolutionarystatus. we employ the well-established virial black-hole mass estimator to'weigh' the black holes of a sample of z~2 smgs with broad halpha or hbetaemission. the average black-hole mass and eddington ratio (eta) of thelower-luminosity broad-line smgs (l_x~10^44 erg/s} are log(m_bh/m_sol)~8.0 andeta~0.2, respectively. these lower-luminosity broad-line smgs lie in the samelocation of the l_x-l_fir plane as more typical smgs hosting x-ray obscured agnand may be intrinsically similar systems, but orientated so that the rest-frameoptical nucleus is visible. under this hypothesis, we conclude that smgs hostblack holes with log(m_bh/m_odot)~7.8; we find supporting evidence fromobservations of local ulirgs. combining these black-hole mass constraints withmeasured host-galaxy masses, we find that the black holes in smgs are &gt;3 timessmaller than those found in comparably massive normal galaxies in the localuniverse, albeit with considerable uncertainty, and &gt;10 times smaller thanthose predicted for z~2 luminous quasars and radio galaxies. these resultsimply that the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in smgs,in stark contrast with that previously suggested for radio galaxies andluminous quasars at z~2. on the basis of current host-galaxy mass constraints,we show that smgs and their descendants cannot lie significantly above thelocally defined m_bh-m_gal relationship. we argue that the black holes in thez~0 descendents of smgs will have log(m_bh/m_odot)~8.6, indicating that theyonly need to grow by a factor of ~6 by the present day (abridged).

1508.05099	almacal i: first dual-band number counts from a deep and wide alma submm  survey, free from cosmic variance	we have exploited alma calibration observations to carry out a novel, wideand deep submm survey, almacal. these calibration data comprise a large numberof observations of calibrator fields in a variety of frequency bands and arrayconfigurations. gathering together data acquired during multiple visits to manyalma calibrators, it is possible to reach noise levels which allow thedetection of faint dusty, star-forming galaxies (dsfgs) over a significantarea. in this paper we outline our survey strategy and report the firstresults. we have analysed data for 69 calibrators, reaching depths of $\sim 25\, {\rm \mu jy \, beam^{-1}}$ at sub-arcsec resolution. adopting a conservativeapproach based on $\geq 5 \sigma$ detections, we have found eight and 11 dsfgsin alma bands 6 and 7, respectively, with flux densities $s_{\rm 1.2 mm} \geq0.2 \, {\rm mjy}$. the faintest galaxies would have been missed by even thedeepest \emph{herschel} surveys. our cumulative number counts have beendetermined independently at 870 $\mu$m and 1.2 mm, from a sparse sampling ofthe astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. thecounts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least $2\times$.future analyses will yield large, secure samples of dsfgs, with redshiftsdetermined via detection of submm spectral lines. uniquely, our strategy thenallows morphological studies of very faint dsfgs - representative of morenormal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies (smgs) - infields where self-calibration is feasible, yielding milliarcsecond spatialresolution.

astro-ph;0303267	a wide field hubble space telescope study of the cluster cl0024+16 at  z=0.4. i: morphological distributions to 5 mpc radius	we describe a new wide field hubble space telescope survey of the galaxycluster cl0024+16 (z~0.4) consisting of a sparse-sampled mosaic of 39 widefield and planetary camera 2 images which extends to a cluster radius of 5 mpc.[abridged] we examine both the morphology-radius (t-r) and morphology-density(t-sigma) relations and demonstrate sensitivities adequate for measures fromthe core to a radius of 5 mpc, spanning over 3 decades in local projecteddensity. the fraction of early-type galaxies declines steeply from the clustercenter to 1 mpc radius and more gradually thereafter, asymptoting towards thefield value at the periphery. we discuss our results in the context of threedistinct cluster zones, defined according to different physical processes thatmay be effective in transforming galaxy morphology in each. by treatinginfalling galaxies as isolated test particles, we deduce that the most likelyprocesses responsible for the mild gradient in the morphological mix outsidethe virial radius are harassment and starvation. although more data are neededto pin down the exact mechanisms, starvation seems more promising in that itwould naturally explain the stellar and dynamical homogeneity of cluster e/s0s.however, we find significant scatter in the local density at any given radiusoutside 0.5 mpc, and that the same t-sigma relation holds in subregions of thecluster, independent of location. in this hitherto unprobed region, where thepotential of the cluster is weak, galaxies apparently retain their identitiesas members of infalling sub-groups whose characteristic morphologicalproperties remain intact. only upon arrival in the central regions is thesubstructure erased, as indicated by the tight correlation between clusterradius and sigma.

astro-ph;0306314	extended x-ray emission around 4c 41.17 at z=3.8	we present sensitive, high-resolution, x-ray imaging from chandra of thehigh-redshift radio galaxy 4c 41.17 (z=3.8). our 150-ks chandra exposuredetects strong x-ray emission from a point source coincident with the nucleusof the radio galaxy. in addition we identify extended x-ray emission with aluminosity ~1e45 erg/s covering a 100kpc (15'') diameter region around theradio galaxy. the extended x-ray emission follows the general distribution ofradio emission in the radio lobes of this source, and the distribution of agiant lyman-alpha emission line halo, while the spectrum of the x-ray emissionis non-thermal and has a power law index consistent with that of the radiosynchrotron. we conclude that the x-ray emission is most likely inverse-comptonscattering of far-infrared photons from a relativistic electron populationprobably associated with past and current activity from the central object.assuming an equipartition magnetic field the cmb energy density at z=3.8 canonly account for at most 40% of the inverse-compton emission. publishedsubmillimeter maps of 4c 41.17 have detected an apparently extended andextremely luminous far-infrared emission around the radio galaxy. wedemonstrate that this photon component and its spatial distribution, incombination with the cmb can reproduce the observed x-ray luminosity. wepropose that photo-ionization by these inverse-compton x-ray photons plays asignificant role in this system, and provides a new physical feedback mechanismto preferentially affect the gas within the most massive halos at highredshift. this is the highest redshift example of extended x-ray emissionaround a radio galaxy currently known.

astro-ph;0503453	rapid growth of black holes in massive star-forming galaxies	the tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroidsin nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these twocomponents. optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting blackholes in the universe and can account for &gt;30% of the total cosmologicalblack-hole growth. as typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense starformation and already host massive black holes [&gt;10^(8) m(sun)], there musthave been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew [mass range  ~10^(6)-10^(8) m(sun)]. the likely signature of this earlier stage issimultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z&gt;1; &gt;8billion light years away) luminous galaxies. here we report ultra-deep x-rayobservations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetrewavelengths. we find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almostcontinuously throughout periods of intense star formation. this activityappears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coevalgalaxy populations. we show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies isconsistent with that expected for the pre-quasar phase.

astro-ph;0506608	the x-ray spectral properties of scuba galaxies	deep scuba surveys have uncovered a large population of massive submmgalaxies (smgs) at z&gt;~1. although it is generally believed that these galaxieshost intense star-formation activity, there is growing evidence that asubstantial fraction also harbor an agn. we present here possibly the strongestevidence for this viewpoint to date: the combination of ultra-deep x-rayobservations (the 2 ms cdf-n) and deep keck spectroscopic data. we find thatthe majority (~75%) of the spectroscopically identified smgs host agn activity;the other ~25% have x-ray properties consistent with star formation (x-rayderived sfrs of ~1300-2700 solars/yr). the agns have properties generallyconsistent with those of nearby luminous agns (l_x~1e43-3e44) and the majority(~80%) are heavily obscured. we construct composite rest-frame 2-20 kev spectrafor three different obscuration classes. an ~1 kev equivalent width fek-alphaemission line is seen in the composite x-ray spectrum of the most heavilyobscured agns (n_h&gt;5x10^{23}), suggesting compton-thick or near compton-thickabsorption. even taking into account the effects of absorption, we find thatthe average x-ray-fir ratio of the agn-classified smgs is approximately oneorder of magnitude below that found for typical quasars. this result suggeststhat intense star-formation activity dominates the bolometric output; however,we also explore whether the x-ray-fir ratio is intrinsically less than thatfound for typical quasars and postulate that some smgs may be agn dominated. weinvestigate the growth of massive black holes, discuss prospects for deeperobservations, and explore the potential of the next generation of x-rayobservatories.

astro-ph;0612165	combining strong and weak gravitational lensing in abell 1689	we present a reconstruction of the mass distribution of galaxy cluster abell1689 at z = 0.18 using detected strong lensing features from deep hst/acsobservations and extensive ground based spectroscopy. earlier analyses havereported up to 32 multiply imaged systems in this cluster, of which only 3 werespectroscopically confirmed. in this work, we present a parametric stronglensing mass reconstruction using 24 multiply imaged systems with newlydetermined spectroscopic redshifts, which is a major step forward in building arobust mass model. in turn, the new spectroscopic data allows a more secureidentification of multiply imaged systems. the resultant mass model enables usto reliably predict the redshifts of additional multiply imaged systems forwhich no spectra are currently available, and to use the location of thesesystems to further constrain the mass model. in particular, we have detected 5strong galaxy-galaxy lensing systems just outside the einstein ring region,further constraining the mass profile. our strong lensing mass model isconsistent with that inferred from our large scale weak lensing analysisderived using cfh12k wide field images. thanks to a new method for reliablyselecting a well defined background lensed galaxy population, we resolve thediscrepancy found between the strong and weak lensing mass models reported inearlier work.

astro-ph;0703395	a lensing survey of x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at redshift z ~ 0.2:  ii: cfh12k weak lensing analysis and global correlations	aims: we present a wide-field multi-color survey of a homogeneous sample ofeleven clusters of galaxies for which we measure total masses and massdistributions from weak lensing.  methods: the eleven clusters in our sample are all x-ray luminous and span anarrow redshift range at z=0.21 +/- 0.04. the weak lensing analysis of thesample is based on ground-based wide-field imaging obtained with the cfh12kcamera on cfht. we use the methodology developed and applied previously on themassive cluster abell 1689. a bayesian method, implemented in the im2shapesoftware, is used to fit the shape parameters of the faint background galaxiesand to correct for psf smearing. with the present data, shear profiles aremeasured in all clusters out to at least 2 mpc (more than 15arcmin from thecenter) with high confidence. the radial shear profiles are fitted withdifferent parametric mass profiles and the virial mass m_200 is estimated foreach cluster and then compared to other physical properties.  results: scaling relations between mass and optical luminosity indicate anincrease of the m/l ratio with luminosity and a l_x-m_200 relation scaling asl_x \propto m_200^(0.83 +/- 0.11) while the normalization of the m_200 \proptot_x^{3/2} relation is close to the one expected from hydrodynamical simulationsof cluster formation as well as previous x-ray analyses. we suggest that thedispersion in the m_200-t_x and m_200-l_x relations reflects the differentmerging and dynamical histories for clusters of similar x-ray luminosities andintrinsic variations in their measured masses. improved statistics of clustersover a wider mass range are required for a better control of the intrinsicscatter in scaling relations.

astro-ph;9509157	the life-cycle of star formation in distant clusters	we analyse the detailed distribution of star-forming and post-starburstmembers in three distant (z = 0.31) galaxy clusters in terms of evolutionarysequences that incorporate secondary bursts of star formation on pre-existingstellar populations. using the number density of spectroscopically-confirmedmembers on the ew(h\delta) versus b-r plane from existing data, and for alarger k'-limited sample on the u-i versus i-k' plane from newly-acquiredinfrared images, we demonstrate that the proportion of cluster membersundergoing secondary bursts of star formation during the last ~2 gyr prior tothe epoch of observation is probably as high as 30 per cent of the membergalaxies. a key observation leading to this conclusion is the high proportionof h\delta strong galaxies in all three clusters. the evolutionary modelling,whilst necessarily approximate, returns the correct proportions of galaxies invarious stages of the star formation cycle both in terms of spectral and colourproperties. hst images for the three clusters indicate a high proportion of theactive members show signs of interaction, whereas the h\delta strong galaxiesappear mainly to be regular spheroidals. we examine results from recent mergersimulations in the context of the populations in these clusters and confirmthat the merging of individual galaxies, triggered perhaps by the hierarchicalassembly of rich clusters at this epoch, is consistent with the star formationcycle identified in our data. the implications of such a high fraction ofactive objects in cluster cores is briefly discussed.

astro-ph;9511015	hubble space telescope observations of the lensing cluster abell 2218	we present a striking new hubble space telescope (hst) observation of therich cluster abell 2218 taken with the wide-field and planetary camera (wfpc2).hst's restored image quality reveals a sizeable number ofgravitationally-lensed features in this cluster, significantly more than hadbeen identified using ground-based telescopes. the brightest arcs are resolvedby hst and show internal features enabling us to identify multiply-imagedexamples, confirming and improving the mass models of the cluster determinedfrom ground-based observations. although weak lensing has been detectedstatistically in this and other clusters from ground-based data, thesuperlative resolution of hst enables us to individually identify weaklydistorted images more reliably than hitherto, with important consequences fortheir redshift determination. using an improved mass model for the clustercalibrated with available spectroscopy for the brightest arcs, we demonstratehow inversion of the lensing model can be used to yield the redshiftdistribution of $\sim$80 faint arclets to $r\simeq25$. we present a newformalism for estimating the uncertainties in this inversion method and reviewprospects for interpreting our results and verifying the predicted redshifts.

0809.2677	the clustering and abundance of star-forming and passive galaxies at $z  \sim 2$	we use the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), currently the deepest panoramicnear infra-red survey, together with deep subaru optical imaging to measure theclustering, number counts and luminosity function of galaxies at $z\sim 2$selected using the bzk selection technique. we find that both star-forming(sbzk) and passive (pbzk) galaxies, to a magnitude limit of $k_{ab} &lt; 23$, arestrongly clustered. the passive galaxies are the most strongly clusteredpopulation, with scale lengths of $r_0 = 15.0^{+1.9}_{-2.2}$h$^{-1}$mpccompared with $r_0 = 6.75^{+0.34}_{-0.37}$h$^{-1}$mpc for star-forminggalaxies. the direct implication is that passive galaxies inhabit the mostmassive dark-matter halos, and are thus identified as the progenitors of themost massive galaxies at the present day. in addition, the pbzks exhibit asharp flattening and potential turn-over in their number counts, in agreementwith other recent studies. this plateau cannot be explained by the effects ofincompleteness. we conclude that only very massive galaxies are undergoingpassive evolution at this early epoch, consistent with the downsizing scenariofor galaxy evolution. assuming a purely passive evolution for the pbzks fromtheir median redshift to the present day, their luminosity function suggeststhat only $\sim 2.5 %$ of present day massive ellipticals had a pbzk as a mainprogenitor.

astro-ph;9810390	two multiple-imaged z=4.05 galaxies in the cluster-lens abell 2390	we present the first results on the identification and study of very distantfield galaxies in the core of cluster-lenses, using a selection criterium basedon both lens modelling and photometric redshifts. we concentrate on twomultiple-imaged sources at z=4.05 in the cluster a2390. the 2 objects presentedin this paper, namely h3 and h5, were identified through lens modelling asmultiple images of high-redshift sources at z&gt;3.5. we confirm the excellentagreement between this identification and both their photometric redshifts andmorphologies. our cfht/wht program for a systematic redshift survey of arcs inclusters has allowed to obtain a set of spectra on 3 different images at z~4:the brightest image of h3, which redshift was already confirmed by frye &amp;broadhurst (1998), and the two brightest images of h5. the later is thenconfirmed spectroscopically as a multiple image, giving a strong support to thelens model. the main feature in each of these spectra is a strong emissionline, identified as ly-alpha, leading to z=4.05 for both h3 and h5. thespectrophotometric properties of these galaxies are studied, in particular thedegeneracy in the parameter-space defined by the sfr type, age, metallicity andreddening. h3 and h5 are intrinsically bright and clumpy sources located ~100kpc part on the source plane, with mean metallicities compatible with afraction of solar or even solar values. all these results seem to favour ahierarchical merging scenario, where we are actually seeing a relativelyadvanced step for these 2 z~4 objects, with stars forming locally andefficiently from a preenriched gas.

astro-ph;9902044	observations of a z=1.44 dusty, ultraluminous galaxy and implications  for deep sub-mm surveys	we present new near-ir and optical spectroscopic observations which confirmthe redshift of the z=1.44 extremely red object ero j164502+4626.4 (object 10of hu &amp; ridgway 1994) and a hst image which reveals a reflected-s-shapedmorphology at (rest-frame) near-uv wavelengths. the contrast between therest-frame far-red (8200-9800a) and near-uv (2900-3900a) morphologies suggeststhat the central regions of the galaxy are heavily obscured by dust and thatthe galaxy is most likely an interacting or disturbed system. we also presentnew photometry of this object at 450, 850 and 1350 microns obtained using scubaon the jcmt. the rest-frame sed of this ero is best understood in terms of ahighly reddened stellar population with ongoing star formation, as originallysuggested by graham &amp; dey (1996). the new sub-mm data presented here indicatethat the remarkable similarity to ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) suchas arp220 extends into the rest-frame far-ir which bears the signature ofthermal emission from dust. ero j164502+4626.4 is extremely luminous (7e12lsun) and dusty (m[dust] = 7e8 msun). if its luminosity is powered by young hotstars, then ero j164502+4626.4 is forming stars at the prodigious rate of1000-2000 msun/yr. we conclude that it is a distant analogue of the nearbyulirg population, the more distant or less luminous counterparts of which maybe missed by even the deepest existing optical surveys. the sub-mm emittersrecently discovered by deep scuba surveys may be galaxies similar to eroj164502+4626.4 (but perhaps more distant). this population of extremely dustygalaxies may also contribute significantly to the cosmic sub-mm backgroundemission.
