0706.3194	phase resolved spectroscopy of the vela pulsar with xmm-newton	the ~10^4 y old vela pulsar represents the bridge between the young crab-likeand the middle-aged rotation powered pulsars. its multiwavelength behaviour isdue to the superposition of different spectral components. we take advantage ofthe unprecedented harvest of photons collected by xmm-newton to assess the velapulsar spectral shape and to study the pulsar spectrum as a function of itsrotational phase. as for the middle-aged pulsars geminga, psr b0656+14 and psrb1055-52 (the "three musketeers"), the phase-integrated spectrum of vela iswell described by a three-component model, consisting of two blackbodies(t_bb1=(1.06+/-0.03)x10^6 k, r_bb1=5.1+/-0.3 km, t_bb2=(2.16+/-0.06)x10^6 k,r_bb2=0.73+/-0.08 km) plus a power-law (gamma=2.2+/-0.3). the relativecontributions of the three components are seen to vary as a function of thepulsar rotational phase. the two blackbodies have a shallow 7-9% modulation.the cooler blackbody, possibly related to the bulk of the neutron star surface,has a complex modulation, with two peaks per period, separated by ~0.35 inphase, the radio pulse occurring exactly in between. the hotter blackbody,possibly originating from a hot polar region, has a nearly sinusoidalmodulation, with a single, broad maximum aligned with the second peak of thecooler blackbody, trailing the radio pulse by ~0.15 in phase. the non thermalcomponent, magnetospheric in origin, is present only during 20% of the pulsarphase and appears to be opposite to the radio pulse. xmm-newton phase-resolvedspectroscopy unveils the link between the thermally emitting surface of theneutron star and its charge-filled magnetosphere, probing emission geometry asa function of the pulsar rotation. this is a fundamental piece of informationfor future 3-dimensional modeling of the pulsar magnetosphere.

0904.3825	a deep xmm-newton serendipitous survey of a middle-latitude area. ii.  new deeper x-ray and optical observations	the radio-quiet neutron star 1e1207.4-5209 has been the target of severalxmm-newton observations, with a total exposure of ~350 ks. the source islocated at intermediate galactic latitude (b~10 degrees), i.e. in a sky regionwith an extremely interesting mix of both galactic and extra-galactic x-raysources. the aim of our work is to investigate the properties of both theintermediate-latitude galactic and extra-galactic x-ray source populations inthe 1e1207.4-5209 field. we performed a coherent analysis of the wholexmm-newton observation data set to build a catalogue of serendipitous x-raysources detected with high confidence and to derive information on the sourceflux, spectra, and time variability. in addition, we performed a completemulti-band (ubvri) optical coverage of the field with the wide field imager(wfi) of the eso/mpg 2.2m telescope (la silla) to search for candidate opticalcounterparts to the x-ray sources, down to a v-band limiting magnitude of~24.5. we detected a total of 144 serendipitous x-ray sources. thanks to therefined x-ray positions and to the wfi observations, we found candidate opticalcounterparts for most of the x-ray sources in our compilation. for most of thebrightest ones we proposed a likely classification based on both the x-rayspectra and the optical colours. our results indicate that at intermediategalactic latitude the x-ray source population is dominated by theextra-galactic component, but with a significant contribution from the galacticcomponent in the soft energy band, below 2 kev.

0904.4776	deep optical observations of the central x-ray source in the puppis a  supernova remnant	x-ray observations reveiled a group of radio-silent isolated neutron stars(inss) at the centre of young supernova remnants (snrs), dubbed central compactobjects or ccos, with properties different from those of classicalrotation-powered pulsars. in at least three cases, evidence points towards ccosbeing low-magnetized inss, born with slow rotation periods, and possiblyaccreting from a debris disc of material formed out of the supernova event.understanding the origin of the diversity of the ccos can shed light onsupernova explosion and neutron star formation models. optical/infrared (ir)observations are crucial to test different cco interpretations. the aim of ourwork is to perform a deep optical investigation of the cco rx j0822.0-4300 inthe puppis a snr, one of the most poorly understood in the cco family. by usingas a reference the chandra x-ray coordinates of rx j0822.0-4300, we performeddeep optical observations in the b, v and i bands with the very large telescope(vlt). we found no candidate optical counterpart within 3 sigma of the computedchandra x-ray position down to 5 sigma limits of b~27.2, v~26.9, and i~25.6,the deepest obtained in the optical band for this source. these limits confirmthe non-detection of a companion brighter than an m5 dwarf. at the same time,they do not constrain optical emission from the neutron star surface, whileemission from the magnetosphere would require a spectral break in theoptical/ir.

0911.1659	xmm-newton and swift observations prove grb 090709a to be a distant,  standard, long grb	grb 090709a is a long gamma-ray burst (grb) discovered by swift, featuring abright x-ray afterglow as well as a faint infrared transient with very red andpeculiar colors. the burst attracted a large interest because of a possiblequasi-periodicity at p=8.1 s in the prompt emission, suggesting that it couldhave a different origin with respect to standard, long grbs. in order tounderstand the nature of this burst, we obtained a target of opportunityobservation with xmm-newton. x-ray spectroscopy, based on xmm-newton and swiftdata, allowed us to model the significant excess in photoelectric absorptionwith respect to the galactic value as due to a large column density (about6.5e+22 cm^-2) in the grb host, located at z=4.2. such a picture is alsoconsistent with the infrared transient's properties. re-analysis of the promptemission, based on integral and on swift data, excludes any significantmodulation at p=8.1 s. thus, we conclude that grb 090709a is a distant,standard, long grb.

1003.0786	hst/wfpc2 observations of the lmc pulsar psr b0540-69	the study of the younger, and brighter, pulsars is important to understandthe optical emission properties of isolated neutron stars. psrb0540-69, thesecond brightest (v~22) optical pulsar, is obviously a very interesting targetfor these investigations. the aim of this work is threefold: constraining thepulsar proper motion and its velocity on the plane of the sky through opticalastrometry, obtaining a more precise characterisation of the pulsar opticalspectral energy distribution (sed) through a consistent set of multi-band,high-resolution, imaging photometry observations, measuring the pulsar opticalphase-averaged linear polarisation, for which only a preliminary and uncertainmeasurement was obtained so far from ground-based observations. we performedhigh-resolution observations of psrb0540-69 with the wfpc2 aboard the hst, inboth direct imaging and polarimetry modes. from multi-epoch astrometry we set a3sigma upper limit of 1 mas/yr on the pulsar proper motion, implying atransverse velocity &lt;250 km/s at the 50 kpc lmc distance. moreover, wedetermined the pulsar absolute position with an unprecedented accuracy of 70mas. from multi-band photometry we characterised the pulsar power-law spectrumand we derived the most accurate measurement of the spectral index(0.70+/-0.07) which indicates a spectral turnover between the optical and x-raybands. finally, from polarimetry we obtained a new measurement of the pulsarphase-averaged polarisation degree (16+/-4%),consistent with magnetospheremodels depending on the actual intrinsic polarisation degree and depolarisationfactor, and we found that the polarisation vector (22+/-12deg position angle)is possibly aligned with the semi-major axis of the pulsar-wind nebula and withthe apparent proper motion direction of its bright emission knot.

1007.3623	hst and vlt observations of the neutron star 1e 1207.4-5209	1e 1207.4-5209, the peculiar central compact object in the g296.5+10.0supernova remnant, has been proposed to be an "anti-magnetar" - a young neutronstar born with a weak dipole field. accretion, possibly of supernova fallbackmaterial, has also been invoked to explain a large surface temperatureanisotropy as well as the generation of peculiar cyclotron absorption featuressuperimposed to its thermal spectrum. interestingly enough, a faintoptical/infrared source was proposed as a possible counterpart to 1e1207.4-5209, but later questioned, based on coarse positional coincidence.considering the large offset of 1e 1207.4-5209 with respect to the center ofits host supernova remnant, the source should move at ~70 mas/yr. thus, wetested the association by measuring the proper motion of the proposed opticalcounterpart. using hst observations spanning 3.75 years, we computed a 3 sigmaupper limit of 7 mas/yr. absolute astrometry on the same hst data set alsoplaces the optical source significantly off the 99% confidence chandraposition. this allows us to safely rule out the association. using the hst dataset, coupled to ground-based observations collected at the eso/vlt, we set thedeepest limits ever obtained to the optical/infrared emission from 1e1207.4-5209. by combining such limits to the constraints derived from x-raytiming, we rule out accretion as the source of the thermal anisotropy of theneutron star.

1009.0021	agile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58	we present the results of new agile observations of psr b1509-58 performedover a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset ofthe present data. the modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 mev isat a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those foundearlier by comptel up to 30 mev: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching itsmaximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94+/- 0.03. the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed fluxdetected by comptel and agile is well described by a power-law (photon indexalpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at e_c=81 +/- 20 mev, representingthe softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. the pulsarluminosity at e &gt; 1 mev is $l_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiencyto gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. the unusual soft break in the spectrum of psrb1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as asignature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic fieldof this pulsar. in this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magneticaltitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggestedbecause pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of themagnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photonsplitting. in the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from theradio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the modelsto reproduce agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

1112.4602	a time-variable, phase-dependent emission line in the x-ray spectrum of  the isolated neutron star rx j0822-4300	rx j0822-4300 is the central compact object associated with the puppis asupernova remnant. previous x-ray observations suggested rx j0822-4300 to be ayoung neutron star with a weak dipole field and a peculiar surface temperaturedistribution dominated by two antipodal spots with different temperatures andsizes. an emission line at 0.8 kev was also detected. we performed a very deep(130 ks) observation with xmm-newton, which allowed us to study in detail thephase-resolved properties of rx j0822-4300. our new data confirm the existenceof a narrow spectral feature, best modelled as an emission line, only seen inthe `soft' phase interval - when the cooler region is best aligned to the lineof sight. surprisingly, comparison of our recent observations to the older onesyields evidence for a variation in the emission line component, which can bemodelled as a decrease in the central energy from ~0.80 kev in 2001 to ~0.73kev in 2009--2010. the line could be generated via cyclotron scattering ofthermal photons in an optically thin layer of gas, or - alternatively - itcould originate in low-rate accretion by a debris disk. in any case, avariation in energy, pointing to a variation of the magnetic field in the lineemitting region, cannot be easily accounted for.

1204.6655	the near-infrared detection of psr b0540-69 and its nebula	the ~1700 year old psr b0540-69 in the lmc is considered the twin of the crabpulsar because of its similar spin parameters, magnetic field, and energetics.its optical spectrum is fit by a power-law, ascribed to synchrotron radiation,like for the young crab and vela pulsars. nir observations, never performed forpsr b0540-69, are crucial to determine whether the optical power-law spectrumextends to longer wavelengths or a new break occurs, like it happens for boththe crab and vela pulsars in the mir, hinting at an even more complex particleenergy and density distribution in the pulsar magnetosphere. we observed psrb0540-69 in the j, h, and ks bands with the vlt to detect it, for the firsttime, in the nir and characterise its optical-to-nir spectrum. to disentanglethe pulsar emission from that of its pulsar wind nebula (pwn), we obtainedhigh-spatial resolution adaptive optics images with naco. we could clearlyidentify psr b0540-69 in our j, h, and ks-band images and measure its flux(j=20.14, h=19.33, ks=18.55, with an overall error of +/- 0.1 magnitudes ineach band). the joint fit to the available optical and nir photometry with apower-law spectrum gives a spectral index alpha=0.70 +/-0.04. the comparisonbetween our naco images and hst optical ones does not reveal any apparentdifference in the pwn morphology as a function of wavelength. the pwnoptical-to-nir spectrum is also fit by a single power-law, with spectral indexalpha=0.56+/- 0.03, slightly flatter than the pulsar's. using naco at the vlt,we obtained the first detection of psr b0540-69 and its pwn in the nir. due tothe small angular scale of the pwn (~4") only the spatial resolution of thejwst will make it possible to extend the study of the pulsar and pwn spectrumtowards the mid-ir.

1205.1905	vlt suzaku observations of the fermi pulsar psr j1028-5819	we used optical images taken with the very large telescope (vlt) in the b andv bands to search for the optical counterpart of psr j1028-5819 or constrainits optical brightness. at the same time, we used an archival suzakuobservation to confirm the preliminary identification of the pulsar's x-raycounterpart obtained by swift. due to the large uncertainty on the pulsar'sradio position and the presence of a bright (v = 13.2) early f-type star at &lt;4", we could not detect its counterpart down to flux limits of b~25.4 and v~25.3, the deepest obtained so far for psr j1028-5819. from the suzakuobservations, we found that the x-ray spectrum of the pulsar's candidatecounterpart is best-fit by a power-law with spectral index 1.7 +/- 0.2 and anabsorption column density nh &lt; 10^21 cm-2, which would support the proposedx-ray identification. moreover, we found possible evidence for the presence ofdiffuse emission around the pulsar. if real, and associated with a pulsar windnebula (pwn), its surface brightness and angular extent would be compatiblewith the expectations for a ~100 kyr old pulsar at the psr j1028-5819 distance.

1206.3978	a study of the long term variability of rx j1856.5-3754 with xmm-newton	we report on a detailed spectral analysis of all the available xmm-newtondata of rx j1856.5-3754, the brightest and most extensively observed nearby,thermally emitting neutron star. very small variations (~1-2%) in thesingle-blackbody temperature are detected, but are probably due to aninstrumental effect, since they correlate with the position of the source onthe detector. restricting the analysis to a homogeneous subset of observations,with the source at the same detector position, we place strong limits onpossible spectral or flux variations from march 2005 to present-day. a slightlyhigher temperature (kt~61.5 ev, compared to the average value kt~61 ev) wasinstead measured in april 2002. if this difference is not of instrumentalorigin, it implies a rate of variation of about 0.15 ev/yr between april 2002and march 2005. the high-statistics spectrum from the selected observations iswell fit by the sum of two blackbody models, which extrapolate to an opticalflux level in agreement with the observed value.

1206.6614	optical and x-ray observations of candidate isolated neutron stars in  the g315.4-2.3 snr	g315.4-2.3 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr), whose identificationas the remains of a type-ii supernova (sn) explosion has been debated for along time. in particular, recent multi-wavelength observations suggest that itis the result of a type ia sn, based on spectroscopy of the snr shell and thelack of a compact stellar remnant.however, two x-ray sources, one detected byeinstein and rosat (source v) and the other by chandra (source n) have beenproposed as possible isolated neutron star candidates. in both cases, no clearoptical identification was available and, therefore, we performed an opticaland x-ray study to determine the nature of these two sources. based on chandraastrometry, source v is associated with a bright v~14 star, which had beensuggested based on the less accurate rosat position. similarly, from vltarchival observations, we found that source n is associated with a relativelybright star ($v=20.14 $). these likely identifications suggest that both x-raysources cannot be isolated neutron stars.

1210.7730	new vlt observations of the fermi pulsar psr j1048-5832	psr j1048-5832 is a vela-like (p=123.6 ms; tau~20.3 kyr) gamma-ray pulsardetected by fermi, at a distance of ~2.7 kpc and with a rotational energy lossrate dot{e}_{sd} ~2 x 10^{36} erg/s. the psr j1048-5832 field has been observedwith the vlt in the v and r bands. we used these data to determine the colourof the object detected closest to the chandra position (star d) and confirmthat it is not associated with the pulsar. for the estimated extinction alongthe line of sight, inferred from a re-analysis of the chandra and xmm-newtonspectra, the fluxes of star d (v~26.7; r~25.8) imply a -0.13 &lt; (v-r)_0 &lt; 0.6.this means that the psr j1048-5832 spectrum would be unusually red compared tothe vela pulsar.moreover, the ratio between the unabsorbed optical and x-rayflux of psr j1048-5832 would be much higher than for other young pulsars. thus,we conclude that star d is not the psr j1048-5832 counterpart. we compared thederived r and v-band upper limits (r&gt;26.4; v&gt;27.6) with the extrapolation ofthe x and gamma-ray spectra and constrained the pulsar spectrum atlow-energies. in particular, the vlt upper limits suggest that the pulsarspectrum could be consistent with a single power-law, stretching from thegamma-rays to the optical.

1212.6532	psr j0357+3205: a fast moving pulsar with a very unusual x-ray trail	the middle-aged psr j0357+3205 is a nearby, radio-quiet, bright gamma-raypulsar discovered by the fermi mission. our previous chandra observationrevealed a huge, very peculiar structure of diffuse x-ray emission, originatingat the pulsar position and extending for &gt; 9' on the plane of the sky. tobetter understand the nature of such a nebula, we have studied the propermotion of the parent pulsar. we performed relative astrometry on chandra imagesof the field spanning a time baseline of 2.2 yr, unveiling a significantangular displacement of the pulsar counterpart, corresponding to a propermotion of 0.165"+/-0.030" yr^(-1). at a distance of ~500 pc, the space velocityof the pulsar would be of ~390 km s^(-1) assuming no inclination with respectto the plane of the sky. the direction of the pulsar proper motion is perfectlyaligned with the main axis of the x-ray nebula, pointing to a physical, yetelusive link between the nebula and the pulsar space velocity. no opticalemission in the h_alpha line is seen in a deep image collected at the geminitelescope, which implies that the interstellar medium into which the pulsar ismoving is fully ionized.

1301.0245	deep optical observations of the gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 in the  cta 1 supernova remnant	the fermi large area telescope (lat) discovered the time signature of aradio-silent pulsar coincident with rx j0007.0+7302, a plerion-like x-raysource at the centre of the cta 1 supernova remnant. the inferred timingparameters of the gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 (p=315.8 ms; dot{p}\sim3.610^{-13} s s^{-1}) point to a vela-like neutron star, with an age comparable tothat of cta 1. the psr j0007+7303 low distance (\sim 1.4 kpc), interstellarabsorption (a_v\sim 1.6), and relatively high energy loss rate (dot{e} \sim4.510^{35} erg s^{-1}), make it a suitable candidate for an optical follow-up.here, we present deep optical observations of psr j0007+7303. the pulsar is notdetected in the gran telescopio canarias (gtc) images down to a limit of r'\sim27.6 (3 sigma), the deepest ever obtained for this pulsar, while williamherschel telescope (wht) images yield a limit of v \sim 26.9. our r'-band limitcorresponds to an optical emission efficiency \eta_{opt}= l_{opt}/dot{e} &lt; 9.410^{-8}. this limit is more constraining than those derived for other vela-likepulsars, but is still above the measured optical efficiency of the vela pulsar.we compared the optical upper limits with the extrapolation of the xmm-newtonx-ray spectrum and found that the optical emission is compatible with theextrapolation of the x-ray power-law component, at variance with what isobserved, e.g. in the vela pulsar.

1307.4962	the dual-mirror small size telescope for the cherenkov telescope array	in this paper, the development of the dual mirror small size telescopes (sst)for the cherenkov telescope array (cta) is reviewed. up to 70 sst, with aprimary mirror diameter of 4 m, will be produced and installed at the ctasouthern site. these will allow investigation of the gamma-ray sky at thehighest energies accessible to cta, in the range from about 1 tev to 300 tev.the telescope presented in this contribution is characterized by two majorinnovations: the use of a dual mirror schwarzschild-couder configuration and ofan innovative camera using as sensors either multi-anode photomultipliers(mapm) or silicon photomultipliers (sipm). the reduced plate-scale of thetelescope, achieved with the dual-mirror optics, allows the camera to becompact (40 cm in diameter), and low-cost. the camera, which has about 2000pixels of size 6x6 mm^2, covers a field of view of 10{\deg}. the dual mirrortelescopes and their cameras are being developed by three consortia, astri(astrofisica con specchi a tecnologia replicante italiana, italy/inaf), gate(gamma-ray telescope elements, france/paris observ.) and chec (compact highenergy camera, universities in uk, us and japan) which are merging theirefforts in order to finalize an end-to-end design that will be constructed forcta. a number of prototype structures and cameras are being developed in orderto investigate various alternative designs. in this contribution, these designsare presented, along with the technological solutions under study.

1308.4533	optical observations of psr j0205+6449 - the next optical pulsar?	psr j0205+6449 is a young ({\approx} 5400 years), crab-like pulsar detectedin radio and at x and {\gamma}-ray energies and has the third largest spin-downflux among known rotation powered pulsars. it also powers a bright synchrotronnebula detected in the optical and x-rays. at a distance of {\approx} 3.2 kpcand with an extinction comparable to the crab, psr j0205+6449 is an obvioustarget for optical observations. we observed psr j0205+6449 with severaloptical facilities, including 8m class ground-based telescopes, such as thegemini and the gran telescopio canarias. we detected a point source, at asignificance of 5.5{\sigma}, of magnitude i {\approx} 25.5, at the centre ofthe optical synchrotron nebula, coincident with the very accurate chandra andradio positions of the pulsar. thus, we discovered a candidate opticalcounterpart to psr j0205+6449. the pulsar candidate counterpart is alsodetected in the g ({\approx}27.4) band and weakly in the r ({\approx}26.2)band. its optical spectrum is fit by a power law with photon index {\gamma}0 =1.9{\pm}0.5, proving that the optical emission if of non-thermal origin, is asexpected for a young pulsar. the optical photon index is similar to the x-rayone ({\gamma}x = 1.77{\pm}0.03), although the optical fluxes are below theextrapolation of the x-ray power spectrum. this would indicate the presence ofa double spectral break between the x-ray and optical energy range, at variancewith what is observed for the crab and vela pulsars, but similar to the largemagellanic cloud pulsar psr b0540-69.

1406.1183	stellar-encounter driven red-giant star mass-loss in globular clusters	globular cluster (gc) color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) are reasonably wellunderstood in terms of standard stellar-evolution. however, there are stillsome open issues, such as fully accounting for the horizontal branch (hb)morphology in terms of chemical and dynamical parameters. mass-loss on the redgiant branch (rgb) shapes the mass-distribution of the hb stars, and the colordistribution in turn. the physical mechanisms driving mass-loss are stillunclear, as direct observations fail to reveal a clear correlation betweenmass-loss rate and stellar properties. the horizontal-branch mass-distributionis further complicated by helium-enhanced multiple stellar populations, becauseof differences in the evolving mass along the hb. we present a simpleanalytical mass-loss model, based on tidal stripping through roche-lobeoverflow (rlof) during stellar encounters. our model naturally results in anon-gaussian mass-loss distribution, with high skewness, and contains only twofree parameters. we fit it to the hb mass distribution of four galactic gcs, asobtained from fitting the cmd with zero age hb (zahb) models. the best-fitmodel accurately reproduces the observed mass-distribution. if confirmed on awider sample of gcs, our results would account for the effects of dynamics inrgb mass-loss processes and provide a physically motivated procedure forsynthetic cmds of gcs. our physical modeling of mass-loss may result in theability to disentangle the effects of dynamics and helium-enhancedmultiple-populations on the hb morphology and is instrumental in making hbmorphology a probe of the dynamical state of gcs, leading to an improvedunderstanding of their evolution.

1512.00467	extras discovery of an 1.2-s x-ray pulsar in m 31	during a search for coherent signals in the x-ray archival data ofxmm-newton, we discovered a modulation at 1.2 s in 3xmm j004301.4+413017 (3xj0043), a source lying in the direction of an external arm of m 31. this shortperiod indicates a neutron star (ns). between 2000 and 2013, the position of 3xj0043 was imaged by public xmm-newton observations 35 times. the analysis ofthese data allowed us to detect an orbital modulation at 1.27 d and study thelong-term properties of the source. the emission of the pulsar was rather hard(most spectra are described by a power law with $\gamma &lt; 1$) and, assuming thedistance to m 31, the 0.3-10 kev luminosity was variable, from$\sim$$3\times10^{37}$ to $2\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the analysis ofoptical data shows that, while 3x j0043 is likely associated to a globularcluster in m 31, a counterpart with $v\gtrsim22$ outside the cluster cannot beexcluded. considering our findings, there are two main viable scenarios for 3xj0043: a peculiar low-mass x-ray binary, similar to 4u 1822-37 or 4u 1626-67,or an intermediate-mass x-ray binary resembling her x-1. regardless of theexact nature of the system, 3x j0043 is the first accreting ns in m 31 in whichthe spin period has been detected.

1512.03241	long term study of the double pulsar j0737-3039 with xmm-newton: pulsar  timing	the relativistic double neutron star binary psr j0737-3039 shows clearevidence of orbital phase-dependent wind-companion interaction, both in radioand x-rays. in this paper we present the results of timing analysis of psrj0737-3039 performed during 2006 and 2011 xmm-newton large programs thatcollected ~20,000 x-ray counts from the system. we detected pulsations from psrj0737-3039a (psr a) through the most accurate timing measurement obtained byxmm-newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. psr a's pulseprofile in x-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spinprecession that occurred within the time span of observations. this yields aconstraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentumaxis delta_a ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radiodata. we confirmed pulsed emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) in x-rays evenafter its disappearance in radio. the unusual phenomenology of psr b's x-rayemission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a lossof pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. we hypothesize that this isdue to the interaction of psr a's wind with psr b's magnetosphere andorbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto psr b closed field lines.finally, the analysis of the full xmm-newton dataset provided evidences oforbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shockscenario between psr a's wind and psr b's magnetosphere.

astro-ph;0107282	the distance to the vela pulsar gauged with hst parallax oservations	the distance to the vela pulsar (psr b0833-45) has been traditionally assumedto be 500 pc. although affected by a significant uncertainty, this value stuckto both the pulsar and the snr. in an effort to obtain a model free distancemeasurement, we have applied high resolution astrometry to the pulsar v~23.6optical counterpart. using a set of five hst/wfpc2 observations, we haveobtained the first optical measurement of the annual parallax of the velapulsar. the parallax turns out to be 3.4 +/- 0.7 mas, implying a distance of294(-50;+76) pc, i.e. a value significantly lower than previously believed.this affects the estimate of the pulsar absolute luminosity and of its emissionefficiency at various wavelengths and confirms the exceptionally high value ofthe n_e towards the vela pulsar. finally, the complete parallax data baseallows for a better measurement of the vela pulsar proper motion(mu_alpha(cos(delta))=-37.2 +/- 1.2 mas/yr; mu_delta=28.2 +/- 1.3 mas/yr aftercorrecting for the peculiar motion of the sun) which, at the parallax distance,implies a transverse velocity of ~65 km/s. moreover, the proper motion positionangle appears specially well aligned with the axis of symmetry of the x-raynebula as seen by chandra. such an alignment allows to assess the spacevelocity of the vela pulsar to be ~81 km/s.

astro-ph;0202268	hst observations rule out the association between cir x-1 and snr  g321.9-0.3	cir x-1 is one of the most intriguing galactic x-ray sources. it is a ~16.6days variable x/radio source, a type-i x-ray burster and a qpo emitter. inspite of an uncertain optical counterpart classification, all these propertiesidentify the source as an lmxb. the morphology of the surrounding radio nebulahas suggested an association with the nearby (~25 arcmin) snr g321.9-0.3,implying that cir x-1 is a runaway binary originated from the supernovaexplosion 10^5 years ago. to investigate this hypothesis, we carried out aproper motion measurement of the cir x-1 m ~19 optical counterpart using a setof hst/wfc and wfpc2 observations taken ~8.6 years apart. we obtained a 3 sigmaupper limit of ~5 mas/yr on the source proper motion. since the runawayhypothesis would have implied a proper motion due north ranging between 15 and75 mas/yr, depending on the actual age of the snr, our result definitivelyrules out the association between cir x-1 and snr g321.9-0.3.

astro-ph;0207296	pulse phase variations of the x-ray spectral features in the radio-quiet  neutron star 1e 1207-5209	we present the results of an xmm-newton observation of the radio-quiet x-raypulsar 1e 1207-5209 located at the center of the shell-like supernova remnantg296.5+10.0. the x-ray spectrum is characterized by the presence of twophase-dependent absorption lines at energies ~0.7 kev and ~1.4 kev. moreover,these broad spectral features have significant substructure, suggesting thatthey are due to the blending of several narrower lines. we interpret suchfeatures as evidence for an atmosphere containing metals and a magnetic fieldvalue of a few 10^12 g, consistent with the observed spin-down ratep_dot=(1.98+/-0.83)*10^(-14) s/s. since 1e 1207-5209 is the only x-ray emittingpulsar showing evidence of such features, we tentatively link them to theunique combination of age and energetics that characterize this object. wesuggest that a young age and a low level of magnetospheric activity arefavorable conditions for the detection of atomic spectral features from metalsin neutron star atmospheres, which would be either blanketed by a thin layer ofaccreted hydrogen in older objects or masked by non-thermal processes in youngenergetic pulsars.

astro-ph;0305540	search for the optical counterpart of the vela pulsar x-ray nebula	observations of the vela pulsar region with the chandra x-ray observatoryhave revealed the fine structure of its synchrotron pulsar-wind nebula (pwn),which showed an overall similarity with the crab pwn. however, contrary to thecrab, no firm detection of the vela pwn in optical has been reported yet. tosearch for the optical counterpart of the x-ray pwn, we analyzed deep opticalobservations performed with different telescopes. we compared the opticalimages with those obtained with the chandra acis to search for extendedemission patterns which could be identified as counterparts of the x-ray nebulaelements. although some features are seen in the optical images, we find nocorrelation with the x-ray structure. thus, we conclude that the diffuseoptical emission is more likely associated with filaments in the host vela snr.the derived upper limits on the optical flux from the pwn are compatibile,within the uncertainties, with the values expected on the basis of theextrapolations of the x-ray data.

astro-ph;0306189	discovery of x-ray cyclotron absorption lines measures the magnetic  field of an isolated neutron star	isolated neutron stars are higly magnetized, fast rotating end points ofstellar evolution. they are now becoming directly observable through x-rayastronomy, owing to their high surface temperatures. in particular, features intheir x-ray spectra could reveal the presence of atmospheres, or gauge theirunknown magnetic fields through the cyclotron process, as in the classic caseof x-ray binaries. all isolated neutron stars spectra observed so far, however,appear as featureless thermal continua. the unique exception is 1e 1207.4-5209.in its spectrum, previous observations had detected two deep absorptionfeatures, still too undefined for any unambiguous interpretation. here wereport on a much longer x-ray observation, in which the star's spectrum showsthree distinct features, regularly spaced at 0.7, 1.4 and 2.1 kev, plus afourth, lower significance one, at 2.8 kev. such features vary in phase withthe star rotation. cyclotron resonant absorption is their logicalinterpretation, yielding a magnetic field strenght of 8x10^10 gauss in the caseof electrons. this is the first direct measure of an isolated neutron starmagnetic field.

astro-ph;0402233	the epic/mos view of the 2-8 kev cosmic x-ray background spectrum	we have measured the spectrum of the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) in the 2-8kev range with the high throughput epic/mos instrument onboard xmm-newton. alarge sample of high galactic latitude observations was used, covering a totalsolid angle of 5.5 square degrees. our study is based on a very carefulcharacterization and subtraction of the instrumental background, which iscrucial for a robust measurement of the faintest diffuse source of the x-raysky. the cxb spectrum is consistent with a power law having a photon indexgamma=1.41+/-0.06, with a 2-10 kev flux of (2.24+/-0.16)x10^(-11) erg/(cm^2 sdeg) (90% confidence level, including the absolute flux calibrationuncertainty). our results are in excellent agreement with two of the mostrecent cxb measurements, performed with bepposax lecs/mecs data (vecchi et al.1999) and with an independent analysis of xmm-newton epic/mos data (lumb et al.2002), providing a very strong constrain to the absolute sky surface brightnessin this energy range, so far affected by a ~40% uncertainty. our measurementimmediately implies that the fraction of cxb resolved by the recent deep x-rayobservations in the 2-10 kev band is of 80+/-7% (1 sigma), suggesting theexistence of a new population of faint sources, largely undetected within thecurrent sensitivity limits of the deepest x-ray surveys.

astro-ph;0412662	on the polar caps of the 3 musketeers	xmm-newton observations of psr b0656+14, psr b1055-52 and geminga havesubstantially increased the statistics available for these three isolatedneutron stars, so apparently similar to deserve the nickname of "threemusketeers" (becker &amp; truemper, 1997). here we shall take advantage of the epicstatistics to perform phase resolved spectroscopy for all three objects. thephase-averaged spectrum of the three musketeers is best described by a threecomponent model. this includes two blackbody components, a cooler one, possiblyoriginating from the bulk of the star surface, and a hotter one, coming from asmaller portion of the star surface (a "hot spot"), plus a power law. therelative contributions of the three components are seen to vary as a functionof phase, as the stars' rotation bring into view different emitting regions.the hot spots, which have very different apparent dimensions (in spite of thesimilarity of the three neutron stars polar cap radii) are responsible for thebulk of the phase variation. the amplitude of the observed phase modulation isalso markedly different for the three sources. another striking aspect of ourphase-resolved phenomenology is the apparent lack of any common phasealignement between the observed modulation patterns for the two blackbodycomponents. they are seen to vary in phase in the case of psr b1055-52, but inanti-phase in the case of psr b0656+14. these findings do not support standardand simplistic models of neutron star magnetic field configuration and surfacetemperature distribution.
