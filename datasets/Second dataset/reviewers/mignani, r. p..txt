0901.1559	optical pulsations from the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e 1048.1-5937	we present high-speed optical photometry of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e1048.1-5937 obtained with ultracam on the 8.2-m very large telescope in june2007. we detect 1e 1048.1-5937 at a magnitude of i'=25.3+/-0.2, consistent withthe values found by wang et al. (2008) and hence confirming their conclusionthat the source was approximately 1 mag brighter than in 2003-2006 due to anon-going x-ray flare that started in march 2007. the increased sourcebrightness enabled us to detect optical pulsations with an identical period(6.458 s) to the x-ray pulsations. the rms pulsed fraction in our data is21+/-7%, approximately the same as the 2-10 kev x-ray rms pulsed fraction. theoptical and x-ray pulse profiles show similar morphologies and appear to beapproximately in phase with each other, the latter lagging the former by only0.06+/-0.02 cycles. the optical pulsations in 1e 1048.1-5937 are very similarin nature to those observed in 4u 0142+61. the implications of our observationsfor models of anomalous x-ray pulsars are discussed.

0901.3576	vlt/naco near-infrared observations of the transient radio magnetar 1e  1547.0-5408	despite about a decade of observations, very little is known about theoptical and infrared (ir) emission properties of the soft gamma-ray repeaters(sgrs) and of the anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps), the magnetar candidates, andabout the physical processes which drive their emission at these wavelengths.this is mainly due to the limited number of identifications achieved so far,five in total, and to the sparse spectral coverage obtained from multi-bandoptical/ir photometry. aim of this work is to search for a likely candidatecounterpart to the recently discovered transient radio axp 1e 1547.0-5408. weperformed the first deep near-ir (nir) observations (ks band) of 1e 1547.0-5408with the vlt on three nights (july 8th, 12th, and august 17th), after the x-raysource rebrightening and during the subsequent decay reported around june 2007.we detected four objects within, or close to, the 3sigma radio position of 1e1547.0-5408. the faintest of them (object 1) has a brightness k = 20.27 +/-0.05, which would yield an unabsorbed x-ray to nir flux ratio fx/fks ~ 800 for1e 1547.0-5408, i.e. on average lower than those derived for other magnetars.the non-detection of object 1 on the nights of july 8th and august 17th onlyallowed us to set an upper limit of delta ks ~ 0.2 on its nir variability,which prevented us to search for correlations with the radio or x-ray flux. wedetected no other object at the radio position down to a limit of ks ~ 21.7 (at5sigma), computed in our deepest vlt image (july 12th). from our observationswe can not confidently propose a nir counterpart to 1e 1547.0-5408. more nirobservations of object 1, e.g. to determine its colors and to monitorvariability, would be conclusive to determine whether or not it can beconsidered a plausible candidate.

0902.0631	the crab optical and ultraviolet polarimetry	polarisation measurements of pulsars and of their pulsar wind nebulae (pwne)are uniquely able to provide deep insights into the highly magnetisedrelativistic environment of young, rotation-powered isolated neutron stars(inss). besides the radio band, optical observations are primarily suited toproviding such insights. the first ins for which optical polarisationobservations were performed is the crab pulsar which is also the brightest one(v=16.5). for this reason, the crab pulsar is also the only ins for whichrepeated, phase-resolved polarisation measurements have been performed throughthe years. moreover, it is the only case, together with the much fainter anddistant psr b0540-69 in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), of an optical pulsarembedded in an optical pwn. thus, the crab is a perfect test case to study theoptical polarisation properties of pulsars and of their pwne. in this paper, wereview the polarisation properties of the crab pulsar and of its pwn in theoptical and ultraviolet domains, we summarise the state of the art of thepolarisation observations of other inss, and we outline perspectives for inspolarisation studies with present and future generations of optical telescopes

0902.0634	multi-wavelength identification of high-energy sources	the nature of most of the ~300 high-energy gamma-ray sources discovered bythe egret instrument aboard the gamma-ray observatory (gro) between 1991 and1999 is one of the greatest enigmas in high-energy astrophysics. while abouthalf of the extragalactic sources have been optically identified with activegalactic nuclei (agn), only a meagre 10% of the galactic sources have areliable identification. this low success rate has mainly to be ascribed to thelocal crowding of potential optical counterparts and to the large gamma-rayerror boxes (of the order of one degree in radius) which prevented astraightforward optical identification. indeed, a multi-wavelengthidentification strategy, based on a systematic coverage of the gamma-ray errorboxes, has been the only do-able approach. the situation is now greatlyimproving thanks to the observations performed by the fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope which, thanks to the lat instrument, provides a factor of 50improvement in sensitivity and a factor of 10 improvement in positionalaccuracy. however, while the smaller error boxes will make the multi-wavelengthfollow-ups easier, the larger sensitivity will enormously increase the numberof detected gamma-ray sources, requiring an even larger effort in themulti-wavelength follow-ups. this effort can not be obviously sustained bytargeted observations only and it would greatly benefit from multi-wavelengthdata and advanced data products available world wide through the science datacentres and interfaced by the virtual observatory (vo) tools. in thiscontribution, i outline the science case, the multi-wavelength observationsynergies, and the requirements for both the the science data centres and thevo.

0706.2573	vlt/naco observations of the high-magnetic field radio pulsar psr  j1119-6127	recent radio observations have unveiled the existence of a number of radiopulsars with spin-down derived magnetic fields in the magnetar range. however,their observational properties appears to be more similar to classical radiopulsars than to magnetars. to shed light on this puzzle we first have todetermine whether the spin-down derived magnetic field values for these radiopulsars are indeed representative of the actual neutron star magnetic field orif they are polluted, e.g. by the effects of a torque from a fallback disk. toinvestigate this possibility, we have performed deep ir observations of one ofthese high magnetic field radio pulsars (psr j1119-6127) with the eso vlt tosearch for ir emission which can be associated with a disk. no ir emission isdetected from the pulsar position down to j=24, h=23, ks=22. by comparing ourflux upper limits with the predictions of fallback disk models, we have foundthat we can only exclude the presence of a disk with accretion rate dot m&gt;3x10^16 g/s. this lower limit cannot rule out the presence of a substantialdisk torque on the pulsar, which would then lead to overestimate the value ofthe magnetic field inferred from p and dot p.

0906.5480	vlt optical observations of the isolated neutron star rx j0420.0-5022	x-ray observations performed with rosat led to the discovery of 7radio-silent isolated neutron stars (inss) which are detected only through therelatively dim and purely thermal x-ray emission from the cooling star surface.a few of these inss (a.k.a. x-ray dim inss, or xdinss) have been also detectedat optical wavelengths where they seem to feature thermal spectra. opticalstudies of xdinss thus play a crucial role in mapping the temperaturedistribution on the neutron star surface and in investigating the existence ofan atmosphere around the neutron star. the aim of this work is to investigatethe optical identification of the xdins rx j0420.0-5022, tentatively proposedby haberl et al. (2004) based on vlt observations. we re-analysed the originalobservations of haberl et al. to assess the detection significance of theproposed counterpart and we performed deeper vlt observations aiming at ahigher confidence detection. with a ~2 sigma detection significance and are-computed flux of b=27.52+/-0.61, we can not rule out that the proposedcounterpart was spurious and produced by the halo of a very bright nearby star.while we could not detect the proposed counterpart in our deeper vltobservations, we found evidence for a marginally significant (~3.9 sigma)detection of a similarly faint object (b= 27.5+/-0.3), ~ 0.5" north of it andcoincident with the updated chandra position of rx j0420.0-5022. interestingly,the angular separation is consistent with the upper limit on the rxj0420.0-5022 proper motion (motch et al. 2009), which suggests that we mighthave actually detected the haberl et al. proposed counterpart. from the flux ofthe putative rx j0420.0-5022 counterpart we can rule out a &gt; 7 optical excesswith respect to the extrapolation of the xmm-newton spectrum.

1101.5100	x-ray and optical observations of the closest isolated radio pulsar	with a parallactic distance of 170 pc, psr j2144-3933 is the closest isolatedradio pulsar currently known. it is also the slowest (p = 8.51 s) and leastenergetic (edot = 2.6e28 erg/s) radio pulsar; its radio emission is difficultto account for with standard pulsar models, since the position of psrj2144-3933 in the period-period derivative diagram is far beyond the typicalradio `death lines'. here we present the first deep x-ray and opticalobservations of psr j2144-3933, performed in 2009 with xmm-newton and europeansouthern observatory (eso)/very large telescope (vlt), from which we derive,assuming a blackbody emission spectrum, a surface temperature upper limit of2.3e5 k for a 13 km radius neutron star, 4.4e5 k for a 500 m radius hot spotand 1.9e6 k for a 10 m radius polar cap. in addition, our non-detection of psrj2144-3933 constrains its non-thermal luminosity to be &lt;30 per cent and &lt;2 percent of the pulsar rotational energy loss in the 0.5-2 kev x-ray band and inthe b optical band, respectively.

1102.3278	discovery of a faint x-ray counterpart and of a parsec-long x-ray tail  for the middle-aged, gamma-ray only pulsar psr j0357+3205	the large area telescope (lat) onboard the fermi satellite opened a new erafor pulsar astronomy, detecting gamma-ray pulsations from more than 60 pulsars,~40% of which are not seen at radio wavelengths. one of the most interestingsources discovered by lat is psr j0357+3205, a radio-quiet, middle-aged (tau_c~0.5 myr) pulsar standing out for its very low spin-down luminosity (erot~6x10^33 erg/s), indeed the lowest among non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars. a deepx-ray observation with chandra (0.5-10 kev), coupled with sensitiveoptical/infrared ground-based images of the field, allowed us to identify psrj0357+3205 as a faint source with a soft spectrum, consistent with a purelynon-thermal emission (photon index gamma=2.53+/-0.25). the absorbing column(nh=8+/-4x10^20 cm^-2) is consistent with a distance of a few hundred parsecs.moreover, the chandra data unveiled a huge (9 arcmin long) extended featureapparently protruding from the pulsar. its non-thermal x-ray spectrum points tosynchrotron emission from energetic particles from the pulsar wind, possiblysimilar to other elongated x-ray tails associated with rotation-powered pulsarsand explained as bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (pwne). however, energeticarguments, as well as the peculiar morphology of the diffuse feature associatedwith psr j0357+3205 make the bow-shock pwn interpretation rather challenging.

1103.4099	vlt/fors2 observations of the optical counterpart of the isolated  neutron star rbs 1774	x-ray observations performed with rosat led to the discovery of a group(seven to date) of x-ray dim and radio-silent middle-aged isolated neutronstars (a.k.a. xdinss), which are characterised by pure blackbody spectra(kt~40-100 ev), long x-ray pulsations (p=3-12 s), and appear to be endowed withrelatively high magnetic fields, (b~10d13-14 g). rbs 1774 is one of the fewxdinss with a candidate optical counterpart, which we discovered with the vlt.we performed deep observations of rbs 1774 in the r band with the vlt todisentangle a non-thermal power-law spectrum from a rayleigh-jeans, whosecontributions are expected to be very much different in the red part of thespectrum. we did not detect the rbs 1774 candidate counterpart down to a 3sigma limiting magnitude of r~27. the constraint on its colour, (b-r)&lt;0.6,rules out that it is a background object, positionally coincident with thex-ray source. our r-band upper limit is consistent with the extrapolation ofthe b-band flux (assuming a 3 sigma uncertainty) for a set of power-laws f_nu~nu^alpha with spectral indeces alpha&lt;0.07. if the optical spectrum of rbs 1774were non-thermal, its power-law slope would be very much unlike those of allisolated neutron stars with non-thermal optical emission, suggesting that it ismost likely thermal. for instance, a rayleigh-jeans with temperature t_o = 11ev, for an optically emitting radius r_o=15 km and a source distance d=150 pc,would be consistent with the optical measurements. the implied low distance iscompatible with the 0.04 x-ray pulsed fraction if either the star spin axis isnearly aligned with the magnetic axis or with the line of sight, or it isslightly misaligned with respect to both the magnetic axis and the line ofsight by 5-10 degrees

1206.6515	the identification of the optical companion to the binary millisecond  pulsar j0610-2100 in the galactic field	we have used deep v and r images acquired at the eso very large telescope toidentify the optical companion to the binary pulsar psr j0610-2100, one of theblack-widow millisecond pulsars recently detected by the fermi gamma-raytelescope in the galactic plane. we found a faint star (v~26.7) nearlycoincident (\delta r ~0".28) with the pulsar nominal position. this star isvisible only in half of the available images, while it disappears in thedeepest ones (those acquired under the best seeing conditions), thus indicatingthat it is variable. although our observations do not sample the entire orbitalperiod (p=0.28 d) of the pulsar, we found that the optical modulation of thevariable star nicely correlates with the pulsar orbital period and describes awell defined peak (r~25.6) at \phi=0.75, suggesting a modulation due to thepulsar heating. we tentatively conclude that the companion to psr j0610-2100 isa heavily ablated very low mass star (~ 0.02msun) that completely filled itsroche lobe.

1212.3141	the birthplace and age of the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5-3754	x-ray observations unveiled various types of radio-silent isolated neutronstars (inss), phenomenologically very diverse, e.g. the myr old x-ray dim ins(xdinss) and the kyr old magnetars. although their phenomenology is muchdiverse, the similar periods (p=2--10 s) and magnetic fields (~10^{14} g)suggest that xdinss are evolved magnetars, possibly born from similarpopulations of supermassive stars. one way to test this hypothesis is toidentify their parental star clusters by extrapolating backward the neutronstar velocity vector in the galactic potential. by using the information on theage and space velocity of the xdins rx j1856.5-3754, we computed backwards itsorbit in the galactic potential and searched for its parental stellar clusterby means of a closest approach criterion. we found a very likely associationwith the upper scorpius ob association, for a neutron star age of 0.42+/-0.08myr, a radial velocity v_r^ns =67+/- 13$ km s^{-1}, and a present-timeparallactic distance d_\pi^ns = 123^{+11}_{-15} pc. our result confirms thatthe "true" neutron star age is much lower than the spin-down age (tau_{sd}=3.8myrs), and is in good agreement with the cooling age, as computed withinstandard cooling scenarios. the mismatch between the spin-down and thedynamical/cooling age would require either an anomalously large breaking index(n~20) or a decaying magnetic field with initial value b_0 ~ 10^{14} g.unfortunately, owing to the uncertainty on the age of the upper scorpius obassociation and the masses of its members we cannot yet draw firm conclusionson the estimated mass of the rx j1856.5-3754 progenitor.

1409.1743	hst optical polarimetry of the vela pulsar &amp; nebula	polarisation measurements of pulsars offer an unique insight into thegeometry of the emission regions in the neutron star magnetosphere. therefore,they provide observational constraints on the different models proposed for thepulsar emission mechanisms. optical polarisation data of the vela pulsar wasobtained from the {\em hubble space telescope} ({\em hst}) archive. the data,obtained in two filters (f606w; central wavelength = 590.70 nm, and f550m;central wavelength = 558.15 nm), consists of a series of observations of thepulsar taken with the {\em hst}/advanced camera for surveys (acs) and covers atime span of 5 days. this data have been used to carry out the firsthigh-spatial resolution and multi-epoch study of the polarisation of thepulsar. we produced polarisation vector maps of the region surrounding thepulsar and measured the degree of linear polarisation (p.d.) and the positionangle (p.a.) of the pulsar's integrated pulse beam. %this yielded we obtained$\rm p.d.=8.1\%\pm0.7\%$ and $\rm p.a.=146.3\degr\pm2.4\degr$, averaged overthe time span covered by these observations. these results not only confirmthose originally obtained by \citeauthor{wagner00} and \citeauthor{mignani07},both using the very large telescope (vlt), but are of greater precision.furthermore, we confirm that the p.a. of the pulsar polarisation vector isaligned with the direction of the pulsar proper-motion. the pulsar wind nebula(pwn) is undetected in polarised light as is the case in unpolarised light,down to a flux limit of 26.8 magnitudes arcsec$^{-2}$.

1503.01307	the x-ray outburst of the galactic centre magnetar sgr j1745-2900 during  the first 1.5 year	in 2013 april a new magnetar, sgr 1745-2900, was discovered as it entered anoutburst, at only 2.4 arcsec angular distance from the supermassive black holeat the centre of the milky way, sagittarius a*. sgr 1745-2900 has a surfacedipolar magnetic field of ~ 2x10^{14} g, and it is the neutron star closest toa black hole ever observed. the new source was detected both in the radio andx-ray bands, with a peak x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 5x10^{35} erg s^{-1}. here wereport on the long-term chandra (25 observations) and xmm-newton (8observations) x-ray monitoring campaign of sgr 1745-2900, from the onset of theoutburst in april 2013 until september 2014. this unprecedented dataset allowsus to refine the timing properties of the source, as well as to study theoutburst spectral evolution as a function of time and rotational phase. ourtiming analysis confirms the increase in the spin period derivative by a factorof ~2 around june 2013, and reveals that a further increase occurred between2013 oct 30 and 2014 feb 21. we find that the period derivative changed from6.6x10^{-12} s s^{-1} to 3.3x10^{-11} s s^{-1} in 1.5 yr. on the other hand,this magnetar shows a slow flux decay compared to other magnetars and a ratherinefficient surface cooling. in particular, starquake-induced crustal coolingmodels alone have difficulty in explaining the high luminosity of the sourcefor the first ~200 days of its outburst, and additional heating of the starsurface from currents flowing in a twisted magnetic bundle is probably playingan important role in the outburst evolution.

0805.2586	a possible optical counterpart to the old nearby pulsar j0108-1431	the multi-wavelength study of old (&gt;100 myr) radio pulsars holds the key tounderstanding the long-term evolution of neutron stars, including the advancedstages of neutron star cooling and the evolution of the magnetosphere.optical/uv observations are particularly useful for such studies because theyallow one to explore both thermal and non-thermal emission processes. inparticular, studying the optical/uv emission constrains temperature of the bulkof the neutron star surface, too cold to be measured in x-ray observations.aimof this work is to identify the optical counterpart of the very old (166 myr)radio pulsar j0108-1431. we have re-analyzed our original vlt observations(mignani et al. 2003), where a very faint object was tentatively detected closeto the radio position, near the edge of a field galaxy. we found that thebackward extrapolation of the psr j0108-1431 proper motion recently measured bychandra(pavlov et al. 2008) nicely fits the position of this object. based onthat, we propose it as a viable candidate for the optical counterpart to psrj0108-1431. the object fluxes (u =26.4+/-0.3; b =27.9; v &gt;27.8) are consistentwith a thermal spectrum with a brightness temperature of 9x10^4 k (for r = 13km at a distance of 130 pc), emitted from the bulk of the neutron star surface.new optical observations are required to confirm the optical identification ofpsr j0108-1431 and measure its spectrum.

0806.4136	observations of isolated neutron stars with the eso multi-conjugate  adaptive optics demonstrator	high-energy observations have unveiled peculiar classes of isolated neutronstars which, at variance with radio pulsars, are mostly radio silent and notpowered by the star rotation. among these objects are the magnetars,hyper-magnetized neutron stars characterized by transient x-ray/gamma-rayemission, and neutron stars with purely thermal, and in most cases stationary,x-ray emission (a.k.a., x-ray dim isolated neutron stars or xdinss). whileapparently dissimilar in their high-energy behavior and age, both magnetars andxdinss have similar periods and unusually high magnetic fields. this suggests atantalizing scenario where the former evolve into the latter.discovering so faruninvestigated similarities between the multi-wavelength properties of thesetwo classes would be a further step forward to establish an evolutionaryscenario. a most promising channels is the near infrared (nir) one, wheremagnetars are characterized by a distinctive spectral flattening with respectto the extrapolation of the soft x-ray spectrum.we observed the two xdinss rxj0420.0-5022 and rx j1856.5-3754 with the multi-conjugate adaptive opticsdemonstrator (mad) at the very large telescope (vlt) as part of the instrumentguaranteed time observations program, to search for their nir counterparts.both rx j1856.5-3754 and rx j0420.0-5022 were not detected down to k_s ~20 andks ~21.5, respectively. in order to constrain the relation between xdinss andmagnetars it would be of importance to perform deeper nir observations. a goodcandidate is 1rxs j214303.7+065419 which is the xdins with the highest inferredmagnetic field.

astro-ph;0107282	the distance to the vela pulsar gauged with hst parallax oservations	the distance to the vela pulsar (psr b0833-45) has been traditionally assumedto be 500 pc. although affected by a significant uncertainty, this value stuckto both the pulsar and the snr. in an effort to obtain a model free distancemeasurement, we have applied high resolution astrometry to the pulsar v~23.6optical counterpart. using a set of five hst/wfpc2 observations, we haveobtained the first optical measurement of the annual parallax of the velapulsar. the parallax turns out to be 3.4 +/- 0.7 mas, implying a distance of294(-50;+76) pc, i.e. a value significantly lower than previously believed.this affects the estimate of the pulsar absolute luminosity and of its emissionefficiency at various wavelengths and confirms the exceptionally high value ofthe n_e towards the vela pulsar. finally, the complete parallax data baseallows for a better measurement of the vela pulsar proper motion(mu_alpha(cos(delta))=-37.2 +/- 1.2 mas/yr; mu_delta=28.2 +/- 1.3 mas/yr aftercorrecting for the peculiar motion of the sun) which, at the parallax distance,implies a transverse velocity of ~65 km/s. moreover, the proper motion positionangle appears specially well aligned with the axis of symmetry of the x-raynebula as seen by chandra. such an alignment allows to assess the spacevelocity of the vela pulsar to be ~81 km/s.

astro-ph;0305540	search for the optical counterpart of the vela pulsar x-ray nebula	observations of the vela pulsar region with the chandra x-ray observatoryhave revealed the fine structure of its synchrotron pulsar-wind nebula (pwn),which showed an overall similarity with the crab pwn. however, contrary to thecrab, no firm detection of the vela pwn in optical has been reported yet. tosearch for the optical counterpart of the x-ray pwn, we analyzed deep opticalobservations performed with different telescopes. we compared the opticalimages with those obtained with the chandra acis to search for extendedemission patterns which could be identified as counterparts of the x-ray nebulaelements. although some features are seen in the optical images, we find nocorrelation with the x-ray structure. thus, we conclude that the diffuseoptical emission is more likely associated with filaments in the host vela snr.the derived upper limits on the optical flux from the pwn are compatibile,within the uncertainties, with the values expected on the basis of theextrapolations of the x-ray data.

astro-ph;0411047	search for the elusive optical counterpart of psr j0537-6910 with the  hst advanced camera for surveys	we present the results of deep, high-resolution, multi-band opticalobservations of the field of the young (~ 5,000 yrs) 16 ms x-ray pulsar psrj0537$-$6910 performed with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) aboard thehubble space telescope (hst). although a few new potential counterparts havebeen detected within or close to the revised chandra x-ray error circle (~1arcsec) of the pulsar, only two of them (with magnitudes m_{814w} ~ 23.9 andm_{814w} ~ 24.2) show indications of a peculiar spectrum which could be relatedto optical emission from the pulsar. this might be true also for a third,fainter, candidate detected only in one filter (with magnitude m_{814w} ~26.7). if either of the two brighter candidates is indeed the actualcounterpart, the optical output of psr j0537-6910 would make it similar toyoung crab-like pulsars. if not, it would mean that psr j0537-6910 issignificantly underluminous with respect to all pulsars detected in the optical

astro-ph;0607251	xmm-newton and eso observations of the two unidentified gamma-ray  sources 3eg j0616-3310 and 3eg j1249-8330	the limited angular resolution of gamma-ray telescopes prevents a directidentification of the majority of sources detected so far. this is particularlytrue for the low latitude, probably galactic, ones only 10 % of which has beenidentified. most counterparts of the identified low-latitude gamma-ray sourcesare isolated neutron stars (ins), both radio-loud and radio-quiet(geminga-like) objects, which are characterised by an extremely high value ofthe x-ray-to-optical flux ratio f_x/f_opt. therefore, the systematic x-ray andoptical coverage of low-latitude unidentified gamma-ray sources aiming at highf_x/f_opt sources seems one of the most promising ways to spot ins candidatecounterparts. since low latitude sources are heavily affected by theinterstellar absorption at both x-ray and optical wavelengths, we have focussedon two middle-latitude, probably galactic, gro/egret sources: 3eg j0616-3310and 3eg j1249-8330. these two sources, which could belong to a local galacticpopulation, have been selected owing to their relatively good positionalaccuracy, spectral shape and lack of candidate extragalactic radiocounterparts. here we report on x-ray observations of the two gamma-ray errorboxes performed with xmm-newton and on their optical follow-up carried on withthe wide field imager at the eso/mpg 2.2m telescope. less than half of the ~300sources detected by the x-ray coverage have no optical counterparts. amongthose, we have selected few interesting sources with f_x/f_opt &gt; 100, which weconsider promising ins candidates.

astro-ph;0702307	the optical polarisation of the vela pulsar revisited	in this work we present a revised measurement of the phase-averaged opticalpolarisation of the vela pulsar (psr b0833-45), for which only one value hasbeen published so far (wagner &amp; seifert 2000). our measurement has beenobtained through an accurate reanalysis of archival polarisation observationsobtained with the fors instrument at the vlt. we have measured a phase-averagedlinear polarisation degree p=9.4% +/- 4% and a position angle 146 +/- 11 deg,very close to the ones of the axis of symmetry of the x-ray arcs and jetsdetected by chandra and of the pulsar proper motion.we have compared themeasured phase-averaged optical polarisation with the expectations of differentpulsars' magnetosphere models. we have found that all models consistentlypredict too large values of the phase-averaged linear polarization with respectto the observed one. this is probably a consequence of present models'limitations which neglect the contributions of various depolarisation effects.interestingly, for the outer gap model we have found that, assuming synchrotronradiation for the optical emission, the observed polarisation position anglealso implies an alignment between the pulsar rotational axis and the axis ofsymmetry of the x-ray arcs and jets.
