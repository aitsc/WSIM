0706.3421	the cold neutron star in the soft x-ray transient 1h 1905+000	we report on our analysis of 300 ks of chandra observations of the neutronstar soft x-ray transient 1h1905+000 in quiescence. we do not detect the sourcedown to a 95% confidence unabsorbed flux upper limit of 2e-16 erg cm-2 s-1 inthe 0.5-10 kev energy range for an assumed gamma=2 power law spectral model. alimit of 1.4e-16 erg cm-2 s-1 is derived if we assume that the spectrum of1h1905+000 in quiescence is described well with a black body of temperature of0.2 kev. for the upper limit to the source distance of 10 kpc this yields a0.5-10 kev luminosity limit of 2.4e30 / 1.7e30 erg/s for the abovementionedpower law or black body spectrum, respectively. this luminosity limit is lowerthan the luminosity of a0620-00, the weakest black hole soft x-ray transient inquiescence reported so far. together with the uncertainties in relating themass transfer and mass accretion rates we come to the conclusion that the claimthat there is evidence for the presence of a black hole event horizon on thebasis of a lower quiescent luminosity for black holes than for neutron stars isunproven. we also briefly discuss the implications of the low quiescentluminosity of 1h1905+000 for the neutron star equation of state. using deepmagellan images of the field of 1h1905+000 obtained at excellent observingconditions we do not detect the quiescent counterpart at the position of theoutburst optical counterpart down to a magnitude limit of i'&gt;25.3. this can beconverted to a limit on the absolute magnitude of the counterpart of i&gt;9.6which implies that the counterpart can only be a brown or a white dwarf.

0906.1984	discovery of a 693.5 s period in the x-ray binary 4u 1820-30: a  superhump interpretation	the x-ray source 4u1820-30 in the globular cluster ngc 6624 is known as themost compact binary among the identified x-ray binaries. having an orbitalperiod of 685.0 s, the source consists of a neutron star primary and likely0.06--0.08 msun white dwarf secondary. here we report on far-ultraviolet (fuv)observations of this x-ray binary, made with the space telescope imagingspectrograph on board the hubble space telescope. from our fourier spectralanalysis of the fuv timing data, we obtain a period of 693.5+/-1.3 s, which issignificantly different from the orbital period. the light curve folded at thisperiod can be described by a sinusoid, with a fractional semiamplitude of 6.3%and the phase zero (maximum of the sinusoid) at mjd 50886.015384+/-0.000043(tdb). while the discovered fuv period may be consistent with a hierarchicaltriple system model that was previously considered for 4u 1820-30, we suggestthat it could instead be the indication of superhump modulation, which arisesfrom an eccentric accretion disk in the binary. the x-ray and fuv periods wouldbe the orbital and superhump periods, respectively, indicating a 1% superhumpexcess and a white-dwarf/neutron-star mass ratio around 0.06. considering 4u1820-30 as a superhump source, we discuss the implications.

0910.3951	a further drop into quiescence by the eclipsing neutron star 4u 2129+47	the low mass x-ray binary 4u 2129+47 was discovered during a previous x-rayoutburst phase and was classified as an accretion disk corona source. a 1%delay between two mid-eclipse epochs measured ~22 days apart was reported fromtwo xmm-newton observations taken in 2005, providing support to the previoussuggestion that 4u 2129+47 might be in a hierarchical triple system. in thiswork we present timing and spectral analysis of three recent xmm-newtonobservations of 4u 2129+47, carried out between november 2007 and january 2008.we found that absent the two 2005 xmm-newton observations, all otherobservations are consistent with a linear ephemeris with a constant period of18857.63s; however, we confirm the time delay reported for the two 2005xmm-newton observations. compared to a chandra observation taken in 2000, thesenew observations also confirm the disappearance of the sinusoidal modulation ofthe lightcurve as reported from two 2005 xmm-newton observations. we furthershow that, compared to the chandra observation, all of the xmm-newtonobservations have 40% lower 0.5--2 kev absorbed fluxes, and the most recentxmm-newton observations have a combined 2--6 kev flux that is nearly 80% lower.taken as a whole, the timing results support the hypothesis that the system isin a hierarchical triple system (with a third body period of at least 175days). the spectral results raise the question of whether the drop in softx-ray flux is solely attributable to the loss of the hard x-ray tail (whichmight be related to the loss of sinusoidal orbital modulation), or isindicative of further cooling of the quiescent neutron star after cessation ofresidual, low-level accretion.

0910.5546	discovery of a 552 hz burst oscillation in the low-mass x-ray binary exo  0748-676	we report the detection of pulsations at 552 hz in the rising phase of twotype-i (thermonuclear) x-ray bursts observed from the accreting neutron starexo 0748-676 in 2007 january and december, by the rossi x-ray timing explorer.the fractional amplitude was 15% (rms). the dynamic power density spectrum foreach burst revealed an increase in frequency of approx. 1-2 hz while theoscillation was present. the frequency drift, the high significance of thedetections and the almost identical signal frequencies measured in two burstsseparated by 11 months, confirms this signal as a burst oscillation similar tothose found in 13 other sources to date. we thus conclude that the spinfrequency in exo 0748-676 is within a few hz of 552 hz, rather than 45 hz aswas suggested from an earlier signal detection by villarreal &amp; strohmayer(2004). consequently, doppler broadening must significantly affect spectralfeatures arising from the neutron star surface, so that the narrow absorptionfeatures previously reported from an xmm-newton spectrum could not have arisenthere. the origin of both the previously reported 45 hz oscillation and thex-ray absorption lines is now uncertain.

0708.0211	the long-term evolution of the spin, pulse shape, and orbit of the  accretion-powered millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658	we present a 7 yr timing study of the 2.5 ms x-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658,an x-ray transient with a recurrence time of ~2 yr, using data from the rossix-ray timing explorer covering 4 transient outbursts (1998-2005). we verifythat the 401 hz pulsation traces the spin frequency fundamental and not aharmonic. substantial pulse shape variability, both stochastic and systematic,was observed during each outburst. analysis of the systematic pulse shapechanges suggests that, as an outburst dims, the x-ray "hot spot" on the pulsarsurface drifts longitudinally and a second hot spot may appear. the overallpulse shape variability limits the ability to measure spin frequency evolutionwithin a given x-ray outburst (and calls previous nudot measurements of thissource into question), with typical upper limits of |nudot| &lt; 2.5x10^{-14} hz/s(2 sigma). however, combining data from all the outbursts shows with high (6sigma) significance that the pulsar is undergoing long-term spin down at a ratenudot = (-5.6+/-2.0)x10^{-16} hz/s, with most of the spin evolution occurringduring x-ray quiescence. we discuss the possible contributions of magneticpropeller torques, magnetic dipole radiation, and gravitational radiation tothe measured spin down, setting an upper limit of b &lt; 1.5x10^8 g for thepulsar's surface dipole magnetic field and and q/i &lt; 5x10^{-9} for thefractional mass quadrupole moment. we also measured an orbital periodderivative of pdot = (3.5+/-0.2)x10^{-12} s/s. this surprising large pdot isreminiscent of the large and quasi-cyclic orbital period variation observed inthe so-called "black widow" millisecond radio pulsars, supporting speculationthat sax j1808.4-3658 may turn on as a radio pulsar during quiescence. in anappendix we derive an improved (0.15 arcsec) source position from optical data.

1006.1908	a double outburst from igr j00291+5934: implications for accretion disk  instability theory	the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar igr j00291+5934 underwent two ~10 dlong outbursts during 2008, separated by 30 d in quiescence. such a shortquiescent period between outbursts has never been seen before from a neutronstar x-ray transient. x-ray pulsations at the 599 hz spin frequency aredetected throughout both outbursts. for the first time, we derive a pulse phasemodel that connects two outbursts, providing a long baseline for spin frequencymeasurement. comparison with the frequency measured during the 2004 outburst ofthis source gives a spin-down during quiescence of -4(1)x10^-15 hz/s,approximately an order of magnitude larger than the long-term spin-downobserved in the 401 hz accretion-powered pulsar sax j1808.4-3658. if thisspin-down is due to magnetic dipole radiation, it requires a 2x10^8 g fieldstrength, and its high spin-down luminosity may be detectable with the fermilarge area telescope. alternatively, this large spin-down could be produced bygravitational wave emission from a fractional mass quadrupole moment of q/i =1x10^{-9}. the rapid succession of the outbursts also provides a unique test ofmodels for accretion in low-mass x-ray binaries. disk instability modelsgenerally predict that an outburst will leave the accretion disk too depletedto fuel a second outburst after such a brief quiescence. we suggest amodification in which the outburst is shut off by the onset of a propellereffect before the disk is depleted. this model can explain the short quiescenceand the unusually slow rise of the light curve of the second 2008 outburst.

1311.1571	prospects for measuring neutron-star masses and radii with x-ray pulse  profile modeling	modeling the amplitudes and shapes of the x-ray pulsations observed from hot,rotating neutron stars provides a direct method for measuring neutron-starproperties. this technique constitutes an important part of the science casefor the forthcoming nicer and proposed loft x-ray missions. in this paper, wedetermine the number of distinct observables that can be derived from pulseprofile modeling and show that using only bolometric pulse profiles isinsufficient for breaking the degeneracy between inferred neutron-star radiusand mass. however, we also show that for moderately spinning (300-800 hz)neutron stars, analysis of pulse profiles in two different energy bandsprovides additional constraints that allow a unique determination of theneutron-star properties. using the fractional amplitudes of the fundamental andthe second harmonic of the pulse profile in addition to the amplitude and phasedifference of the spectral color oscillations, we quantify the signal-to-noiseratio necessary to achieve a specified measurement precision for neutron starradius. we find that accumulating 10^6 counts in a pulse profile is sufficientto achieve a &lt;5% uncertainty in the neutron star radius, which is the level ofaccuracy required to determine the equation of state of neutron-star matter.finally, we formally derive the background limits that can be tolerated in themeasurements of the various pulsation amplitudes as a function of the systemparameters.

astro-ph;0103273	anomalous x-ray pulsars and soft gamma-ray repeaters: spectral fits and  the magnetar model	the energy source powering the x-ray emission from anomalous x-ray pulsars(axps) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) is still uncertain. in one scenario,the presence of an ultramagnetized neutron star, or ``magnetar'', with b on theorder of 10^{14} - 10^{15} g is invoked. to investigate this hypothesis, wehave analyzed archival asca data for several known axps and sgrs, and fittedthem with a model in which all or part of the x-ray flux originates as thermalemission from a magnetar. our magnetar spectral model includes the effects ofthe anisotropy of the heat flow through an ultramagnetized neutron starenvelope, reprocessing by a light element atmosphere, and general relativisticcorrections to the observed spectrum. we obtain good fits to the data withradii for the emitting areas which are generally consistent with those expectedfor neutron stars, in contrast to blackbody (bb) fits, which imply much smallerradii. furthermore, the inclusion of atmospheric effects results in inferredtemperatures which are lower than those implied by bb fits, but however stilltoo high to be accounted by thermal cooling alone. an extra source of heating(possibly due to magnetic field decay) is needed. despite the harder tail inthe spectrum produced by reprocessing of the outgoing flux through theatmosphere, spectral fits still require a considerable fraction of the flux tobe in a power-law component.

astro-ph;0105446	the erratic luminosity behavior of sax j1808.4-3658 during its 2000  outburst	we report on the highly variable and erratic long-term x-ray luminositybehavior of the only known accretion-driven millisecond x-ray pulsar saxj1808.4-3658 during its 2000 outburst, as observed with rxte. the maximumobserved luminosity is ~2.5 x 10^35 erg s^-1 (3-25 kev; for a distance of 2.5kpc), which is a factor of ~10 lower than that observed during the 1996 and1998 outbursts. due to solar constraints, the source could not be observed forseveral months with rxte before 21 jan. 2000. therefore, the exact moment ofthe outburst onset is unknown and the peak luminosity could have beensignificantly higher. on some occasions sax j1808.4-3658 was observed withluminosities of ~10^35 erg s^-1, but on other occasions it could not bedetected with rxte resulting in upper limits of a few times 10^33 erg s^-1(3-25 kev). the non-detections of the source during its 2000 outburst obtainedwith bepposax demonstrate that its luminosity was at times &lt;10^32 erg s^-1(0.5-10 kev). however, only a few days after these bepposax observations, wedetected the source again with rxte at high luminosities, giving a factor of&gt;1000 of luminosity swings in this system on time scales of days. the lastdetection of sax j1808.4-3658 with rxte was on 2000 may 13, almost 4 monthsafter the first detection. due to the lack of sensitivity and observationsduring the 1996 and 1998 outbursts, it cannot be excluded that after thoseoutbursts the source remained active for months and that the source behaviorduring the 2000 outburst is not unique. long duration activity at lowluminosities has been observed in other transients (both neutron stars andblack holes), although not with such extreme variability which might point to adifferent origin for this behavior for the pulsar.

astro-ph;0204501	the amplitude evolution and harmonic content of millisecond oscillations  in thermonuclear x-ray bursts	we present a comprehensive observational and theoretical analysis of theamplitudes and profiles of oscillations that occur during thermonuclear x-raybursts from weakly-magnetized neutron stars in low mass x-ray binaries. oursample contains 59 oscillations from six sources observed with the rossi x-raytiming explorer. the oscillations that we examined occurred primarily duringthe decaying portions of bursts, and lasted for several seconds each. we findthat the oscillations are as large as 15% during the declines of the bursts,and they appear and disappear due to intrinsic variations in their fractionalamplitudes. however, the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to theunderlying flux in the burst. we derive folded profiles for each oscillationtrain to study the pulse morphologies. the mean rms amplitudes of theoscillations are 5%, although the eclipsing source mxb 1659-298 routinelyproduces 10% oscillations in weak bursts. we also produce combined profilesfrom all of the oscillations from each source. using these pulse profiles, weplace upper limits on the fractional amplitudes of harmonic and half-frequencysignals of 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively (95% confidence). we then compare thepulse morphologies to theoretical profiles from models with one or twoantipodal bright regions on the surface of a rotating neutron star. we findthat if one bright region is present on the star, it must either lie near therotational pole or cover nearly half the neutron star in order to be consistentwith the observed lack of harmonic signals. if an antipodal pattern is present,the hot regions must form very near the rotational equator. we discuss howthese geometric constraints challenge current models for the production ofbrightness variations on the surface of a neutron star.

astro-ph;0208543	x-ray spectroscopy of the accreting millisecond pulsar xte j0929-314 in  outburst	we present the high-resolution spectrum of the accretion-powered millisecondpulsar xte j0929-314 during its 2002 outburst, measured using the low energytransmission grating spectrometer onboard the chandra x-ray observatory. the1.5-25.3 a (0.5-8.3 kev) chandra spectrum is well fit by a power-law +blackbody model with photon index gamma=1.55+/-0.03, blackbody temperaturekt_bb=0.65+/-0.03 kev, and blackbody normalization r_bb,km/d_10kpc=7.6+/-0.8.no emission or absorption features are found in the high-resolution spectrum,with a 3 sigma equivalent width upper limit of &lt;0.007 a at 1.5 a and &lt;0.12 a at24 a. the neutral absorption edge depths are consistent with the estimatedinterstellar absorption along the line of sight to the source. we found noorbital modulation of the 2-10 kev x-ray flux, to a 3 sigma upper limit of1.1%, which implies an upper limit on the binary inclination angle of i&lt;85degfor a roche-lobe-filling companion. we also present the broadband spectrummeasured over the course of the outburst by the rossi x-ray timing explorer.the xte spectrum of xte j0929-314 is also well fit with a power-law + blackbodymodel, with average values of gamma=1.76+/-0.03, kt_bb=0.66+/-0.06 kev, andr_bb,km/d_10kpc=5.9+/-1.3 in the 2-50 kev energy range. the blackbody fluxremained constant over the course of the outburst, while the power-law flux wasstrongly correlated to the (decreasing) flux of the source. we find that thedifference in power-law photon indices measured from chandra and xte spectracan be explained by a change in the power-law photon index at low energies.

astro-ph;0302611	the energy dependence of millisecond oscillations in thermonuclear x-ray  bursts	we examine the energy-resolved pulse profiles of 51 flux oscillationsobserved during the decline of thermonuclear x-ray bursts from accretingweakly- magnetized neutron stars with the rossi x-ray timing explorer. we findthat the fractional rms amplitudes of the oscillations increase as a functionof energy by 0.25%/kev to 0.9%/kev between 3-20 kev, and are as large as 20% inthe 13-20 kev band. we also show that the pulses observed in the higher energybands generally lag behind those in lower energy bands by 0.002 cycles/kev to0.007 cycles/kev between 3-20 kev. this amounts to total delays of 0.03-0.12cycles between the lowest and highest energy bands, or time delays that rangefrom 100-200 mus. we then model the oscillations as flux variations arisingfrom temperature patterns on the surfaces of rapidly rotating neutron stars. inthis framework, we find that the increase in the pulse amplitude with photonenergy can be explained if the cooler regions on the neutron star emit in thelower energy bands, reducing the flux variations there. on the other hand, thedoppler shifts caused by the rapid rotation of the neutron star should causethe hard pulses to precede the soft pulses by about 0.05 cycles (100 mus), incontrast to the observations. this suggests that the photons originating fromthe stellar surface are reprocessed by a hot corona of electrons before theyreach the observer.

astro-ph;0307029	nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the maximum spin frequency of  neutron stars	millisecond pulsars are neutron stars (nss) that are thought to have beenspun-up by mass accretion from a stellar companion. it is unknown whether thereis a natural brake for this process, or if it continues until the centrifugalbreakup limit is reached at submillisecond periods. many nss that are accretingfrom a companion exhibit thermonuclear x-ray bursts that last tens of seconds,caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. millisecond brightnessoscillations during bursts from ten nss (as distinct from other rapid x-rayvariability that is also observed) are thought to measure the stellar spin, butdirect proof of a rotational origin has been lacking. here, we report thedetection of burst oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accretingmillisecond pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the samerotational phase. this firmly establishes burst oscillations as nuclear-poweredpulsations tracing the spin of accreting nss, corroborating earlier evidence.the distribution of spin frequencies of the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts offwell below the breakup frequency for most ns models, supporting theoreticalpredictions that gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques inspinning up millisecond pulsars.

astro-ph;0307123	quasi-periodic x-ray brightness fluctuations in an accreting millisecond  pulsar	the relativistic plasma flows onto neutron stars that are accreting materialfrom stellar companions can be used to probe strong-field gravity as well asthe physical conditions in the supranuclear-density interiors of neutron stars.plasma inhomogeneities orbiting a few kilometres above the stars are observableas x-ray brightness fluctuations on the millisecond dynamical timescale of theflows. two frequencies in the kilohertz range dominate these fluctuations: thetwin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (khz qpos). competing models for theorigins of these oscillations (based on orbital motions) all predict that theyshould be related to the stellar spin frequency, but tests have been difficultbecause the spins were not unambiguously known. here we report the detection ofkhz qpos from a pulsar whose spin frequency is known. our measurementsestablish a clear link between khz qpos and stellar spin, but one not predictedby any current model. a new approach to understanding khz qpos is now required.we suggest that a resonance between the spin and general relativistic orbitaland epicyclic frequencies could provide the observed relation between qpos andspin.

astro-ph;0310726	the effect of neutron star rotation on the properties of thermonuclear  x-ray bursts	previously, observations with the rossi x-ray timing explorer showed thatmillisecond oscillations occur preferentially in thermonuclear x-ray burstswith photospheric radius expansion from sources rotating near 600 hz, whilethey occur with equal likelihood in x-ray bursts with and without radiusexpansion for sources rotating near 300 hz. with a larger sample of data thanin previous studies, we find that the detectability of the oscillations is notdirectly determined by the properties of the x-ray bursts. instead, we findthat (1) the oscillations are observed almost exclusively when the accretionrate onto the neutron star is high, but that (2) radius expansion is onlyobserved at high accretion rates from the 600 hz sources, whereas it occursonly at low accretion rates in the 300 hz sources. the persistent millisecondpulsars provide the only apparent exceptions to these trends. the first resultmight be explained if the oscillation amplitudes are attenuated at lowaccretion rates by an extended electron corona. the second result indicatesthat the rotation period of the neutron star determines how the burstproperties vary with accretion rate, possibly through the differences in theeffective surface gravity or the strength of the coriolis force.

astro-ph;0408004	millisecond pulsars in x-ray binaries	despite considerable evidence verifying that millisecond pulsars are spun upthrough sustained accretion in low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), it has provensurprisingly difficult to actually detect millisecond x-ray pulsars in lmxbs.there are only 5 accretion-powered millisecond x-ray pulsars known among morethan 80 lmxbs containing neutron stars, but there are another 11 "nuclearpowered" millisecond pulsars which reveal their spin only during brief,thermonuclear x-ray bursts. in addition, 2 of the accretion-powered pulsarsalso exhibit x-ray burst oscillations, and their unusual properties, along withthe absence of persistent pulsations in most lmxbs, suggest that the magneticfields in many lmxbs may be hidden by accreted material. interestingly, thenuclear-powered pulsars offer a statistically unbiased probe of the spindistribution of recycled pulsars and show that this distribution cuts offsharply above 730 hz, well below the breakup spin rate for most neutron starequations of state. this indicates that some mechanism acts to halt or balancespin-up due to accretion and that submillisecond pulsars must be very rare (andare possibly nonexistent). it is unclear what provides the necessary angularmomentum sink, although gravitational radiation is an attractive possibility.

astro-ph;0511380	eddington-limited x-ray bursts as distance indicators. ii. possible  compositional effects in bursts from 4u 1636-536	we analyzed 123 thermonuclear (type-i) x-ray bursts observed by the rossix-ray timing explorer from the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1636-536. all but twoof the 40 radius-exansion bursts in this sample reached peak fluxes which werenormally distributed about a mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standarddeviation of 7.6%. the remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peakfluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a consequence,the overall variation in the peak flux of the radius-expansion bursts was afactor of ~2. this variation is comparable to the range of the eddington limitbetween material with solar h-fraction (x=0.7) and pure he. such a variationmay arise if, for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the accreted h iseliminated either by steady hot cno burning or expelled in a radiatively-drivenwind. however, steady burning cannot exhaust the accreted h for solarcomposition material within the typical ~2 hr burst recurrence time, nor can itresult in sufficient elemental stratification to allow selective ejection ofthe h only. an additional stratification mechanism appears to be required toseparate the accreted elements and thus allow preferential ejection of thehydrogen. we found no evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution betweenthe radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts, previously observed insmaller samples. assuming that the faint radius-expansion bursts reached theeddington limit for h-rich material (x~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limitfor pure he (x=0), we estimate the distance to 4u 1636-536 (for a canonicalneutron star with m_ns=1.4m_sun, r_ns=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5 kpc, or form_ns=2m_sun at most 7.1 kpc.

astro-ph;0604076	a debris disk around an isolated young neutron star	pulsars are rotating, magnetized neutron stars that are born in supernovaexplosions following the collapse of the cores of massive stars. if some of theexplosion ejecta fails to escape, it may fall back onto the neutron star or itmay possess sufficient angular momentum to form a disk. such 'fallback' is botha general prediction of current supernova models and, if the material pushesthe neutron star over its stability limit, a possible mode of black holeformation. fallback disks could dramatically affect the early evolution ofpulsars, yet there are few observational constraints on whether significantfallback occurs or even the actual existence of such disks. here we report thediscovery of mid-infrared emission from a cool disk around an isolated youngx-ray pulsar. the disk does not power the pulsar's x-ray emission but ispassively illuminated by these x-rays. the estimated mass of the disk is oforder 10 earth masses, and its lifetime (at least a million years)significantly exceeds the spin-down age of the pulsar, supporting a supernovafallback origin. the disk resembles protoplanetary disks seen around ordinaryyoung stars, suggesting the possibility of planet formation around youngneutron stars.

astro-ph;9708193	on the dramatic spin-up/spin-down torque reversals in accreting pulsars	dramatic torque reversals between spin up and spin down have been observed inhalf of the persistent x-ray pulsars monitored by the batse all-sky monitor oncgro. theoretical models developed to explain early pulsar timing data canexplain spin down torques via a disk-magnetosphere interaction if the starnearly corotates with the inner accretion disk. to produce the observed batsetorque reversals, however, these equilibrium models require the disk toalternate between two mass accretion rates, with $\dot m_{\pm}$ producingaccretion torques of similar magnitude, but always of opposite sign. moreover,in at least one pulsar (gx 1+4) undergoing secular spin down the neutron starspins down faster during brief ($\sim 20$ day) hard x-ray flares -- this isopposite the correlation expected from standard theory, assuming batse pulsedflux increases with mass accretion rate. the $10$ day to 10 yr intervalsbetween torque reversals in these systems are much longer than anycharacteristic magnetic or viscous time scale near the inner disk boundary andare more suggestive of a global disk phenomenon.  we discuss possible explanations of the observed torque behavior. despite thepreferred sense of rotation defined by the binary orbit, the batse observationsare surprisingly consistent with an earlier suggestion by makishima \etal(1988) for gx~1+4: the disks in these systems somehow alternate betweenepisodes of prograde and retrograde rotation. we are unaware of any mechanismthat could produce a stable retrograde disk in a binary undergoing roche-lobeoverflow, but such flip-flop behavior does occur in numerical simulations ofwind-fed systems. one possibility is that the disks in some of these binariesare fed by an x-ray excited wind.

astro-ph;9802137	infrared spectroscopy of gx 1+4/v2116 oph: evidence for a fast red giant  wind?	we present infrared spectroscopy of the low-mass x-ray binary gx 1+4/v2116oph. this symbiotic binary consists of a 2-min accretion-powered pulsar and anm5 iii red giant. a strong he i 1.083 micron emission line with a pronounced pcygni profile was observed. from the blue edge of this feature, we infer anoutflow velocity of 250(50) km/s. this is an order of magnitude faster than atypical red giant wind, and we suggest that radiation from the accretion diskor the neutron star may contribute to the acceleration of the outflow. we infera wind mass loss rate of around 10^-6 msun/yr. accretion from such a strongstellar wind provides a plausible alternative to roche lobe overflow forsupplying the accretion disk which powers the x-ray source. the h i paschenbeta and he i 1.083 micron lines showed no evidence for the dramatic changespreviously reported in some optical lines, and no evidence for pulsations atthe 2-min pulsar period.

astro-ph;9802162	warped disks as a possible origin of torque reversals in  accretion-powered pulsars	enigmatic transitions between spin-up and spin-down have been observed inseveral x-ray pulsars accreting matter via an accretion disk. in thesetransitions, the torque changes sign but remains at nearly the same magnitude.it has been noted previously that alternating prograde and retrograde diskflows would explain many features of the torque reversals, although it has beenunclear how a stable retrograde disk could be formed. we suggest that thereversals may be related to the disk at times being warped to such an extentthat the inner region becomes tilted by more than 90 degrees. this region wouldthus become retrograde, leading to a negative torque. accretion disk models canshow such behavior, if account is taken of a warping instability due toirradiation. the resulting `flip-overs' of the inner parts of the disk canreproduce most characteristics of the observations, although it remains unclearwhat sets the timescale on which the phenomenon occurs. if this model werecorrect, it would have a number of ramifications, for instance that in thespin-down state the x-ray source would mostly be observed through the accretiondisk.

astro-ph;9802324	discovery of the 198 s x-ray pulsar gro j2058+42	gro j2058+42, a transient 198 second x-ray pulsar, was discovered by theburst and transient source experiment (batse) on the compton gamma-rayobservatory (cgro), during a "giant" outburst in 1995 september-october. thetotal flux peaked at about 300 mcrab (20-50 kev) as measured by earthoccultation. the pulse period decreased from 198 s to 196 s during the 46-dayoutburst. the pulse shape evolved over the course of the outburst and exhibitedenergy dependent variations. batse observed five additional weak outbursts fromgro j2058+42, each with two week duration and peak pulsed flux of about 15mcrab (20-50 kev), that were spaced by about 110 days. an observation of the1996 november outburst by the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) proportionalcounter array (pca) localized the source to within a 4\arcmin radius errorcircle (90 % confidence) centered on r.a. = 20h 59m.0, decl. = 41 deg 43 arcmin(j2000). additional shorter outbursts with peak pulsed fluxes of about 8 mcrabwere detected by batse halfway between the first four 15 mcrab outbursts. therxte all-sky monitor detected all 8 weak outbursts with approximately equaldurations and intensities. gro j2058+42 is most likely a be/x-ray binary thatappears to outburst at periastron and apastron. no optical counterpart has beenidentified to date and no x-ray source was present in the error circle inarchival rosat observations.

astro-ph;9803260	neutron star mass measurements. i. radio pulsars	there are now about fifty known radio pulsars in binary systems, including atleast five in double neutron star binaries. in some cases, the stellar massescan be directly determined from measurements of relativistic orbital effects.in others, only an indirect or statistical estimate of the masses is possible.we review the general problem of mass measurement in radio pulsar binaries, andcritically discuss all current estimates of the masses of radio pulsars andtheir companions. we find that significant constraints exist on the masses oftwenty-one radio pulsars, and on five neutron star companions of radio pulsars.all the measurements are consistent with a remarkably narrow underlyinggaussian mass distribution, m = 1.35 +- 0.04 solar masses. there is no evidencethat extensive mass accretion (delta m &gt;~ 0.1 solar mass) has occurred in thesesystems. we also show that the observed inclinations of millisecond pulsarbinaries are consistent with a random distribution, and thus find no evidencefor either alignment or counteralignment of millisecond pulsar magnetic fields.

astro-ph;9804248	the two-hour orbit of a binary millisecond x-ray pulsar	typical radio pulsars are magnetized neutron stars that are born rapidlyrotating and slow down as they age on time scales of 10 to 100 million years.however, millisecond radio pulsars spin very rapidly even though many arebillions of years old. the most compelling explanation is that they have been"spun up" by the transfer of angular momentum during accretion of material froma companion star in so-called low-mass x-ray binary systems, lmxbs. (lmxbsconsist of a neutron star or black hole accreting from a companion less thanone solar mass.) the recent detection of coherent x-ray pulsations with amillisecond period from a suspected lmxb system appears to confirm this link.here we report observations showing that the orbital period of this binarysystem is two hours, which establishes it as an lmxb. we also find an apparentmodulation of the x-ray flux at the orbital period (at the two per cent level),with a broad minimum when the pulsar is behind this low-mass companion star.this system seems closely related to the "black widow" millisecond radiopulsars, which are evaporating their companions through irradiation. it mayappear as an eclipsing radio pulsar during periods of x-ray quiescence.

astro-ph;9809335	the disk-magnetosphere interaction in the accretion-powered millisecond  pulsar sax j1808.4-3658	the recent discovery of the first known accretion-powered millisecond pulsarwith the rossi x-ray timing explorer provides the first direct probe of theinteraction of an accretion disk with the magnetic field of a weakly magnetic(b&lt;10^10 g) neutron star. we demonstrate that the presence of coherentpulsations from a weakly magnetic neutron star over a wide range of accretionrates places strong constraints on models of the disk-magnetosphereinteraction. we argue that the simple mdot^(3/7) scaling law for the keplerianfrequency at the magnetic interaction radius, widely used to model diskaccretion onto magnetic stars, is not consistent with observations of saxj1808.4-3658 for most proposed equations of state for stable neutron stars. weshow that the usually neglected effects of multipole magnetic moments,radiation drag forces, and general relativity must be considered when modelingsuch weakly magnetic systems. using only very general assumptions, we obtain arobust estimate of mu~(1-10)x10^26 g cm^3 for the dipole magnetic moment of saxj1808.4-3658, implying a surface dipole field of ~10^8-10^9 g at the stellarequator. we therefore infer that after the end of its accretion phase, thissource will become a normal millisecond radio pulsar. finally, we compare thephysical properties of this pulsar to those of the non-pulsing, weakly magneticneutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries and argue that the absence of coherentpulsations from the latter does not necessarily imply that these neutron starshave significantly different magnetic field strengths from sax j1808.4-3658.

astro-ph;9812475	the outbursts and orbit of the accreting pulsar gs 1843-02 = 2s 1845-024	we present observations of a series of 10 outbursts of pulsed hard x-ray fluxfrom the transient 10.6 mhz accreting pulsar gs 1843-02, using the burst andtransient source experiment on the compton gamma ray observatory. theseoutbursts occurred regularly every 242 days, coincident with the ephemeris ofthe periodic transient gro j1849-03 (zhang et al. 1996), which has recentlybeen identified with the sas 3 source 2s 1845-024 (soffitta et al. 1998). ourpulsed detection provides the first clear identification of gs 1843-02 with 2s1845-024. we present a pulse timing analysis which shows that the 2s 1845-024outbursts occur near the periastron passage of the neutron star's highlyeccentric (e = 0.88+-0.01) 242.18+-0.01 day period binary orbit about a highmass (m &gt; 7 solar masses) companion. the orbit and transient outburst patternstrongly suggest the pulsar is in a binary system with a be star. ourobservations show a long-term spin-up trend, with most of the spin-up occurringduring the outbursts. from the measured spin-up rates and inferred luminositieswe conclude that an accretion disk is present during the outbursts.

0810.4382	breaking the amsp mould: the increasingly strange case of hete  j1900.1-2455	we present ongoing rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) monitoring observationsof the 377.3 hz accretion-powered pulsar, hete j1900.1-2455 activity continuesin this system more than 3 years after discovery, at a mean luminosity of4.4e36 erg/s (for d=5 kpc), although pulsations were present only within thefirst 70 days. x-ray variability has increased each year, notably with a briefinterval of nondetection in 2007, during which the luminosity dropped to below1e-3 of the mean level. a deep search of data from the intervals ofnondetection in 2005 revealed evidence for extremely weak pulsations at anamplitude of 0.29% rms, a factor of ten less than the largest amplitude seenearly in the outburst.  x-ray burst activity continued through 2008, with bursts typically featuringstrong radius expansion. spectral analysis of the most intense burst detectedby rxte early in the outburst revealed unusual variations in the inferredphotospheric radius, as well as significant deviations from a blackbody. weobtained much better fits instead with a comptonisation model.
