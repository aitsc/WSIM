0901.3934	transient low-mass x-ray binary populations in elliptical galaxies ngc  3379 and ngc 4278	we propose a physically motivated and self-consistent prescription for themodeling of transient neutron star (ns) low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)properties, such as duty cycle (dc), outburst duration and recurrence time. weapply this prescription to the population synthesis (ps) models of field lmxbspresented by fragos et al. (2008), and compare the transient lmxb population tothe chandra x-ray survey of the two elliptical galaxies ngc 3379 and ngc 4278,which revealed several transient sources (brassington et al., 2008, 2009). weare able to exclude models with a constant dc for all transient systems, whilemodels with a variable dc based on the properties of each system are consistentwith the observed transient populations. we predict that the majority of theobserved transient sources in these two galaxies are lmxbs with red giantdonors. our comparison suggests that lmxbs formed through evolution ofprimordial field binaries are dominant in globular cluster (gc) poor ellipticalgalaxies, while they still have a significant contribution in gc rich ones.

0902.2343	comparing gc and field lmxbs in elliptical galaxies with deep chandra  and hubble data	(abridged) we present a statistical study of the low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)populations of three nearby, old elliptical galaxies: ngc 3379, ngc 4278, andngc 4697. with a cumulative ~1 ms chandra acis observing time, we detect 90-170lmxbs within the d25 ellipse of each galaxy. cross-correlating chandra x-raysources and hst optical sources, we identify 75 globular cluster (gc) lmxbs and112 field lmxbs. in the low luminosity range allowed by our deeper data (lx &lt; 5x 1037 erg s-1), we find a significant relative lack of gc-lmxbs, when comparedwith field sources. using the co-added sample from the three galaxies, we findthat the incompleteness-corrected x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) of gc andfield lmxbs differ at ~4# significance at lx &lt; 5 x 1037 erg s-1. as previouslyreported, these xlfs are consistent at higher luminosities. our observationsmay indicate a potential predominance of gc-lmxbs with donors evolved beyondthe main sequence, when compared to current models, but their efficientformation requires relatively high initial binary fractions in clusters. thefield lmxb xlf can be fitted with either a single power-law model plus alocalized excess at a luminosity of 5-6 x 1037 erg s-1, or a broken power-lawwith a similar low-luminosity break. this xlf may be explained withns-red-giant lmxbs, contributing to ~15% of total lmxbs population at ~5x1037erg s-1. the difference in the gc and field xlfs is consistent with differentorigins and/or evolutionary paths between the two lmxb populations, although afraction of the field sources are likely to have originated in gcs.

0903.0621	interacting binaries with eccentric orbits ii. secular orbital evolution  due to non-conservative mass transfer	we investigate the secular evolution of the orbital semi-major axis andeccentricity due to mass transfer in eccentric binaries, allowing for both massand angular momentum loss from the system. adopting a delta function masstransfer rate at the periastron of the binary orbit, we find that, depending onthe initial binary properties at the onset of mass transfer, the orbitalsemi-major axis and eccentricity can either increase or decrease at a ratelinearly proportional to the magnitude of the mass transfer rate at periastron.the range of initial binary mass ratios and eccentricities that leads toincreasing orbital semi-major axes and eccentricities broadens with increasingdegrees of mass loss from the system and narrows with increasing orbitalangular momentum loss from the binary. comparison with tidal evolutiontimescales shows that the usual assumption of rapid circularization at theonset of mass transfer in eccentric binaries is not justified, irrespective ofthe degree of systemic mass and angular momentum loss. this work extends ourprevious results for conservative mass transfer in eccentric binaries and canbe incorporated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes to modelnon-conservative mass transfer in eccentric binaries.

0904.1953	energy dissipation through quasi-static tides in white dwarf binaries	we study tidal interactions in white dwarf binaries in the limiting case ofquasi-static tides. the formalism is valid for arbitrary orbital eccentricitiesand therefore applicable to white dwarf binaries in the galactic disk as wellas globular clusters. in the quasi-static limit, the total perturbation of thegravitational potential shows a phase shift with respect to the position of thecompanion, the magnitude of which is determined primarily by the efficiency ofenergy dissipation through convective damping. we determine rates of secularevolution of the orbital elements and white dwarf rotational angular velocityfor a 0.3 solar mass helium white dwarf in binaries with orbital frequencies inthe lisa gravitational wave frequency band and companion masses ranging from0.3 to 10^5 solar masses. the resulting tidal evolution time scales for theorbital semi-major axis are longer than a hubble time, so that convectivedamping of quasi-static tides need not be considered in the construction ofgravitational wave templates of white dwarf binaries in the lisa band. spin-upof the white dwarf, on the other hand, can occur on time scales of less than10myr, provided that the white dwarf is initially rotating with a frequencymuch smaller than the orbital frequency. for semi-detached white dwarf binariesspin-up can occur on time scales of less than 1myr. nevertheless, the timescales remain longer than the orbital inspiral time scales due to gravitationalradiation, so that the degree of asynchronism in these binaries increases. as aconsequence, tidal forcing eventually occurs at forcing frequencies beyond thequasi-static tide approximation. for the shortest period binaries, energydissipation is therefore expected to take place through dynamic tides andresonantly excited g-modes.

0706.4139	short gamma-ray bursts and binary mergers in spiral and elliptical  galaxies: redshift distribution and hosts	to test whether the short grb rates, redshift distribution and host galaxiesare consistent with current theoretical predictions, we use avery largedatabase of population synthesis calculations to examine bh-ns and ns-ns mergerrates in the universe, factoring in (i) the star formation history of theuniverse, (ii) a heterogeneous population of star-forming galaxies, includingspirals and ellipticals, and (iii) a simple flux-limited selection model forshort grb detection. when we require our models reproduce the known short grbrates and redshift measurements (and, for ns-ns, the merger rates extrapolatedfrom binary pulsars in the galaxy), a small fraction of models reproduce allobservations, both when we assume a ns-ns and a bh-ns origin for bursts. mostcommonly models produce mergers preferentially in spiral galaxies if short grbsarise from ns-ns mergers alone. model universes where present-day binarymergers occur preferentially in elliptical galaxies necessarily include asignificant fraction of binaries with long delay times between birth and merger(often $o(10{\rm gyr})$). though long delays occur, almost all of our modelspredict that a higher proportion of short grbs should occur at moderate to highredshift (e.g., $z&gt;1$) than has presently been observed, in agreement withrecent observations which suggest a selection bias towards successful follow-upof low-redshift short grbs. finally, if only a fraction of bh-ns mergers havethe right combination of masses and spins to make grbs, then at best only asmall fraction of bh-ns models could be consistent with all {\em current}available data.

0706.4312	interacting binaries with eccentric orbits. secular orbital evolution  due to conservative mass transfer	we investigate the secular evolution of the orbital semi-major axis andeccentricity due to mass transfer in eccentric binaries, assuming conservationof total system mass and orbital angular momentum. assuming a delta functionmass transfer rate centered at periastron, we find rates of secular change ofthe orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity which are linearly proportional tothe magnitude of the mass transfer rate at periastron. the rates can bepositive as well as negative, so that the semi-major axis and eccentricity canincrease as well as decrease in time. adopting a delta-function mass-transferrate of $10^{-9} m_\sun {\rm yr}^{-1}$ at periastron yields orbital evolutiontimescales ranging from a few myr to a hubble time or more, depending on thebinary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity. comparison with orbital evolutiontimescales due to dissipative tides furthermore shows that tides cannot, in allcases, circularize the orbit rapidly enough to justify the often adoptedassumption of instantaneous circularization at the onset of mass transfer. theformalism presented can be incorporated in binary evolution and populationsynthesis codes to create a self-consistent treatment of mass transfer ineccentric binaries.

0908.3635	binary compact object coalescence rates: the role of elliptical galaxies	we estimate binary compact object merger detection rates for ligo, includingthe binaries formed in ellipticals long ago. specifically, we convolve hundredsof model realizations of elliptical- and spiral-galaxy population syntheseswith a model for elliptical- and spiral-galaxy star formation history as afunction of redshift. our results favor local merger rate densities of 4\times10^{-3} {mpc}^{-3}{myr}^{-1} for binary black holes (bh), 3\times 10^{-2}{mpc}^{-3}{myr}^{-1} for binary neutron stars (ns), and 10^{-2}{mpc}^{-3}{myr}^{-1} for bh-ns binaries. mergers in elliptical galaxies are asignificant fraction of our total estimate for bh-bh and bh-ns detection rates;ns-ns detection rates are dominated by the contribution from spiral galaxies.using only models that reproduce current observations of galactic ns-nsbinaries, we find slightly higher rates for ns-ns and largely similar rangesfor bh-ns and bh-bh binaries. assuming a detection signal-to-noise ratiothreshold of 8 for a single detector (as part of a network), corresponding toradii \cv of the effective volume inside of which a single ligo detector couldobserve the inspiral of two 1.4 m_\sun neutron stars of 14 mpc and 197 mpc, forinitial and advanced ligo, we find event rates of any merger type of 2.9*10^{-2} -- 0.46 and 25-400 per year (at 90% confidence level), respectively. wealso find that the probability p_{detect} of detecting one or more mergers withthis single detector can be approximated by (i) p_{detect}\simeq 0.4+0.5\log(t/0.01{yr}), assuming \cv=197 {mpc} and it operates for t years, for t between2 days and 0.1 {yr}); or by (ii) p_{detect}\simeq 0.5 + 1.5 \log \cv/32{mpc},for one year of operation and for $\cv$ between 20 and 70 mpc.

1003.3236	the x-ray spectra of the luminous lmxbs in ngc 3379: field and globular  cluster sources	from a deep multi-epoch chandra observation of the elliptical galaxy ngc 3379we report the spectral properties of eight luminous lmxbs (lx&gt;1.2e38 erg/s). wealso present a set of spectral simulations, produced to aid the interpretationof low-count single-component spectral modeling. these simulations demonstratethat it is possible to infer the spectral states of x-ray binaries from thesesimple models and thereby constrain the properties of the source. of the eightlmxbs studied, three reside within globular clusters, and one is a confirmedfield source. due to the nature of the luminosity cut all sources are eitherneutron star binaries emitting at or above the eddington luminosity or blackhole binaries. the spectra from these sources are well described bysingle-component models, with parameters consistent with galactic lmxbobservations, where hard-state sources have a range in photon index of 1.5-1.9and thermally dominated sources have inner disc temperatures between ~0.7-1.55kev. the large variability observed in the brightest globular cluster source(lx&gt;4e38 erg/s) suggests the presence of a black hole binary. at its mostluminous this source is observed in a thermally dominated state with kt=1.5kev, consistent with a black hole mass of ~4 msol. this observation providesfurther evidence that globular clusters are able to retain such massivebinaries. we also observed a source transitioning from a bright state (lx~1e39erg/s), with prominent thermal and non-thermal components, to a less luminoushard state (lx=3.8e38 erg/s, gamma=1.85). in its high flux emission this sourceexhibits a cool-disc component of ~0.14 kev, similar to spectra observed insome ultraluminous x-ray sources. such a similarity indicates a possible linkbetween `normal' stellar mass black holes in a high accretion state and ulxs.

1005.0625	interacting binaries with eccentric orbits. iii. orbital evolution due  to direct impact and self-accretion	the rapid circularization and synchronization of the stellar components in aneccentric binary system at the onset of roche lobe overflow (rlo) is afundamental assumption common to all binary stellar evolution and populationsynthesis codes, even though the validity of this assumption is questionableboth theoretically and observationally. here we calculate the evolution of theorbital elements of an eccentric binary through the direct three-bodyintegration of a massive particle ejected through the inner lagrangian point ofthe donor star at periastron. the trajectory of this particle leads to threepossible outcomes: direct accretion (da) onto the companion star within asingle orbit, self-accretion (sa) back onto the donor star within a singleorbit, or a quasi-periodic orbit around the companion star. we calculate thesecular evolution of the binary orbit in the first two cases and conclude thatda can increase or decrease the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity, whilesa always decreases the orbital both orbital elements. in cases where massoverflow contributes to circularizing the orbit, circularization can set in ontimescales as short as a few per cent of the mass transfer timescale. in caseswhere mass overflow increases the eccentricity, the orbital evolution isgoverned by competition between mass overflow and tidal torques. in the absenceof tidal torques, mass overflow resulting in di can lead to substantiallysubsynchronously rotating donor stars. contrary to common assumptions, difurthermore does not always provide a strong sink of orbital angular momentumin close mass-transferring binaries; in fact we instead find that a significantpart can be returned to the orbit during the particle orbit. the formulationpresented here can be combined with stellar and binary evolution codes togenerate a better picture of the evolution of eccentric, rlo binary starsystems.

1110.1635	missing black holes unveil the supernova explosion mechanism	it is firmly established that the stellar mass distribution is smooth,covering the range 0.1-100 msun. it is to be expected that the masses of theensuing compact remnants correlate with the masses of their progenitor stars,and thus it is generally thought that the remnant masses should be smoothlydistributed from the lightest white dwarfs to the heaviest black holes.however, this intuitive prediction is not borne out by observed data. in therapidly growing population of remnants with observationally determined masses,a striking mass gap has emerged at the boundary between neutron stars and blackholes. the heaviest neutron stars reach a maximum of two solar masses, whilethe lightest black holes are at least five solar masses. over a decade afterthe discovery, the gap has become a significant challenge to our understandingof compact object formation. we offer new insights into the physical processesthat bifurcate the formation of remnants into lower mass neutron stars andheavier black holes. combining the results of stellar modeling withhydrodynamic simulations of supernovae, we both explain the existence of thegap, and also put stringent constraints on the inner workings of the supernovaexplosion mechanism. in particular, we show that core-collapse supernovae arelaunched within 100-200 milliseconds of the initial stellar collapse, implyingthat the explosions are driven by instabilities with a rapid (10-20 ms) growthtime. alternatively, if future observations fill in the gap, this will be anindication that these instabilities develop over a longer (&gt;200 milliseconds)timescale.

1111.5012	on the rarity of x-ray binaries with naked helium donors	the paucity of known high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxb) with naked he donorstars (hereafter he star) in the galaxy has been noted over the years as asurprising fact, given the significant number of galactic hmxbs containingh-rich donors, which are expected to be their progenitors. this contrast hasfurther sharpened in light of recent observations uncovering a preponderance ofhmxbs hosting loosely bound be donors orbiting neutron stars (ns), which wouldbe expected to naturally evolve into he-hmxbs through dynamical mass transferonto the ns and a common-envelope (ce) phase. hence, reconciling the largepopulation of be-hmxbs with the observation of only one he-hmxb can helpconstrain the dynamics of ce physics. here, we use detailed stellar structureand evolution models and show that binary mergers of hmxbs during ce eventsmust be common in order to resolve the tension between these observedpopulations. we find that, quantitatively, this scenario remains consistentwith the typically adopted energy parameterization of ce evolution, yieldingexpected populations which are not at odds with current observations. however,future observations which better constrain the underlying population of looselybound o/b-ns binaries are likely to place significant constraints on theefficiency of ce ejection.

1201.1195	estimating parameters of coalescing compact binaries with proposed  advanced detector networks	the advanced versions of the ligo and virgo ground-based gravitational-wavedetectors are expected to operate from three sites: hanford, livingston, andcascina. recent proposals have been made to place a fourth site in australia orindia; and there is the possibility of using the large cryogenic gravitationalwave telescope in japan to further extend the network. using bayesianparameter-estimation analyses of simulated gravitational-wave signals from arange of coalescing-binary locations and orientations at fixed distance orsignal-to-noise ratio, we study the improvement in parameter estimation for theproposed networks. we find that a fourth detector site can break degeneraciesin several parameters; in particular, the localization of the source on the skyis improved by a factor of ~ 3--4 for an australian site, or ~ 2.5--3.5 for anindian site, with more modest improvements in distance and binary inclinationestimates. this enhanced ability to localize sources on the sky will be crucialin any search for electromagnetic counterparts to detected gravitational-wavesignals.

0710.5126	the dearth of low-luminosity globular cluster lmxbs in ngc 3379	our campaign of deep monitoring observations with {\it chandra} of the nearbyelliptical galaxy ngc 3379 has lead to the detection of nine globular cluster(gc) and 53 field low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in the joint {\ithubble}/{\it chandra} field of view of this galaxy. comparing thesepopulations, we find a highly significant lack of gc lmxbs at the low (0.3-8kev) x-ray luminosities (in the $\sim 10^{36}$ to $\sim 4\times10^{37}$ ergs$^{-1}$ range) probed with our observations. this result conflicts with theproposition that all lmxbs are formed in gcs. this lack of low-luminositysources in gcs is consistent with continuous lmxb formation due to stellarinteractions and with the transition from persistent to transient lmxbs. theobserved cut-off x-ray luminosity favors a predominance of lmxbs withmain-sequence donors instead of ultra-compact binaries with white-dwarf donors;ultra-compacts could contribute significantly only if their disks are notaffected by x-ray irradiation. our results suggest that current theories ofmagnetic stellar wind braking may work rather better for the unevolvedcompanions of gc lmxbs than for field lmxbs and cataclysmic variables in thegalaxy, where these companions may be somewhat evolved.

1203.5613	the characterization of virgo data and its impact on gravitational-wave  searches	between 2007 and 2010 virgo collected data in coincidence with the ligo andgeo gravitational-wave (gw) detectors. these data have been searched for gwsemitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotatingneutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of thedetectors. the sensitivity of gw searches is limited by noise produced by thedetector or its environment. it is therefore crucial to characterize thevarious noise sources in a gw detector. this paper reviews the virgo detectornoise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which wereidentified in the three first virgo observing runs. in many cases, theseinvestigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or toselectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. we presentexamples from the joint ligo-geo-virgo gw searches to show how well noisetransients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from thevirgo data. we also discuss how detector characterization can improve theastrophysical reach of gravitational-wave searches.

1205.2216	search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts during  ligo science run 6 and virgo science runs 2 and 3	we present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with154 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-based gamma-rayexperiments in 2009-2010, during the sixth ligo science run and the second andthird virgo science runs. we perform two distinct searches: a modeled searchfor coalescences of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole;and a search for generic, unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts. we find noevidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual grb inthis sample or with the population as a whole. for all grbs we place lowerbounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of agravitational-wave emission energy of 10^-2 m c^2 at 150 hz, with a medianlimit of 17 mpc. for short hard grbs we place exclusion distances on binaryneutron star and neutron star-black hole progenitors, using astrophysicallymotivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 mpc and 28mpc respectively. these distance limits, while significantly larger than for asearch that is not aided by grb satellite observations, are not large enough toexpect a coincidence with a grb. however, projecting these exclusions to thesensitivities of advanced ligo and virgo, which should begin operation in 2015,we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with grbs willbecome quite possible.

1210.7185	modeling the redshift evolution of the normal galaxy x-ray luminosity  function	emission from x-ray binaries (xrbs) is a major component of the total x-rayluminosity of normal galaxies, so x-ray studies of high redshift galaxies allowus to probe the formation and evolution of x-ray binaries on very longtimescales. in this paper, we present results from large-scale populationsynthesis models of binary populations in galaxies from z = 0 to 20. we use asinput into our modeling the millennium ii cosmological simulation and theupdated semi-analytic galaxy catalog by guo et al. (2011) to self-consistentlyaccount for the star formation history (sfh) and metallicity evolution of eachgalaxy. we run a grid of 192 models, varying all the parameters known fromprevious studies to affect the evolution of xrbs. we use our models andobservationally derived prescriptions for hot gas emission to createtheoretical galaxy x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) for several redshift bins.models with low ce efficiencies, a 50% twins mass ratio distribution, a steeperimf exponent, and high stellar wind mass loss rates best match observationalresults from tzanavaris &amp; georgantopoulos (2008), though they significantlyunderproduce bright early-type and very bright (lx &gt; 10d41) late-type galaxies.these discrepancies are likely caused by uncertainties in hot gas emission andsfhs, agn contamination, and a lack of dynamically formed low-mass xrbs. in ourhighest likelihood models, we find that hot gas emission dominates the emissionfor most bright galaxies. we also find that the evolution of the normal galaxyx-ray luminosity density out to z = 4 is driven largely by xrbs in galaxieswith x-ray luminosities between 10d40 and 10d41 erg/s.

0712.1036	the lowest-mass stellar black holes: catastrophic death of neutron stars  in gamma-ray bursts	mergers of double neutron stars are considered the most likely progenitorsfor short gamma-ray bursts. indeed such a merger can produce a black hole witha transient accreting torus of nuclear matter (lee &amp; ramirez-ruiz 2007,oechslin &amp; janka 2006), and the conversion of a fraction of the torusmass-energy to radiation can power a gamma-ray burst (nakar 2006). usingavailable binary pulsar observations supported by our extensive evolutionarycalculations of double neutron star formation, we demonstrate that the fractionof mergers that can form a black hole -- torus system depends very sensitivelyon the (largely unknown) maximum neutron star mass. we show that the availableobservations and models put a very stringent constraint on this maximum massunder the assumption that a black hole formation is required to produce a shortgamma-ray burst in a double neutron star merger. specifically, we find that themaximum neutron star mass must be within 2 - 2.5 msun. moreover, a singleunambiguous measurement of a neutron star mass above 2.5 msun would exclude ablack hole -- torus central engine model of short gamma-ray bursts in doubleneutron star mergers. such an observation would also indicate that if in factshort gamma-ray bursts are connected to neutron star mergers, the gamma-rayburst engine is best explained by the lesser known model invoking a highlymagnetized massive neutron star (e.g., usov 1992; kluzniak &amp; ruderman 1998; daiet al. 2006; metzger, quataert &amp; thompson 2007).

1403.6639	search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts detected  by the interplanetary network	we present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with223 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the interplanetary network (ipn) in2005-2010 during ligo's fifth and sixth science runs and virgo's first, secondand third science runs. the ipn satellites provide accurate times of the burstsand sky localizations that vary significantly from degree scale to hundreds ofsquare degrees. we search for both a well-modeled binary coalescence signal,the favored progenitor model for short grbs, and for generic, unmodeledgravitational wave bursts. both searches use the event time and skylocalization to improve the gravitational-wave search sensitivity as comparedto corresponding all-time, all-sky searches. we find no evidence of agravitational-wave signal associated with any of the ipn grbs in the sample,nor do we find evidence for a population of weak gravitational-wave signalsassociated with the grbs. for all ipn-detected grbs, for which a sufficientduration of quality gravitational-wave data is available, we place lower boundson the distance to the source in accordance with an optimistic assumption ofgravitational-wave emission energy of $10^{-2}m_{\odot}c^2$ at 150 hz, and finda median of 13 mpc. for the 27 short-hard grbs we place 90% confidenceexclusion distances to two source models: a binary neutron star coalescence,with a median distance of 12mpc, or the coalescence of a neutron star and blackhole, with a median distance of 22 mpc. finally, we combine this search withpreviously published results to provide a population statement for grb searchesin first-generation ligo and virgo gravitational-wave detectors, and aresulting examination of prospects for the advanced gravitational-wavedetectors.

1404.2199	search for gravitational radiation from intermediate mass black hole  binaries in data from the second ligo-virgo joint science run	this paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational wavesfrom merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (imbhb). the search wasperformed on data from the second joint science run of the ligo and virgodetectors (july 2009 - october 2010) and was sensitive to imbhbs with a rangeup to $\sim 200$ mpc, averaged over the possible sky positions and inclinationsof the binaries with respect to the line of sight. no significant candidate wasfound. upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning imbhbs withtotal masses between 100 and $450 \ \mbox{m}_{\odot}$ and mass ratios between$0.25$ and $1\,$ were placed by combining this analysis with an analogoussearch performed on data from the first ligo-virgo joint science run (november2005 - october 2007). the most stringent limit was set for systems consistingof two $88 \ \mbox{m}_{\odot}$ black holes and is equal to $0.12 \\mbox{mpc}^{-3} \ \mbox{myr}^{-1}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level. this paperalso presents the first estimate, for the case of an unmodeled analysis, of theimpact on the search range of imbhb spin configurations: the visible volume forimbhbs with nonspinning components is roughly doubled for a population ofimbhbs with spins aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum anduniformly distributed in the dimensionless spin parameter up to 0.8, whereas ananalogous population with antialigned spins decreases the visible volume by$\sim 20\%\,$.

1405.2069	the x-ray luminosity functions of field low mass x-ray binaries in  early-type galaxies: evidence for a stellar age dependence	we present direct constraints on how the formation of low-mass x-ray binary(lmxb) populations in galactic fields depends on stellar age. in this pilotstudy, we utilize chandra and hubble space telescope (hst) data to detect andcharacterize the x-ray point source populations of three nearby early-typegalaxies: ngc 3115, 3379, and 3384. the luminosity-weighted stellar ages of oursample span 3-10 gyr. x-ray binary population synthesis models predict that thefield lmxbs associated with younger stellar populations should be more numerousand luminous per unit stellar mass than older populations due to the evolutionof lmxb donor star masses. crucially, the combination of deep chandra and hstobservations allows us to test directly this prediction by identifying andremoving counterparts to x-ray point sources that are unrelated to the fieldlmxb populations, including lmxbs that are formed dynamically in globularclusters, galactic stars, and background agn/galaxies. we find that the "young"early-type galaxy ngc 3384 (~2-5 gyr) has an excess of luminous field lmxbs(l_x &gt; (5-10) x 10^37 erg/s) per unit k-band luminosity (l_k; a proxy forstellar mass) than the "old" early-type galaxies ngc 3115 and 3379 (~8-10 gyr),which results in a factor of ~2-3 excess of lx/lk for ngc 3384. this result isconsistent with the x-ray binary population synthesis model predictions;however, our small galaxy sample size does not allow us to draw definitiveconclusions on the evolution field lmxbs in general. we discuss how futuresurveys of larger galaxy samples that combine deep chandra and hst data couldprovide a powerful new benchmark for calibrating x-ray binary populationsynthesis models.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

astro-ph;0012064	the formation of black-hole x-ray transients	studies of the observed characteristics of black-hole (bh) x-ray binaries canbe provide us with valuable information about the process of bh formation. inthis paper i address some of the aspects of our current understanding of bhformation in binaries and point out some of the existing problems of currenttheoretical models. in particular, the measured orbital periods and donor-starproperties indicate that a common-envelope phase appears to be a necessaryingredient of the evolutionary history of observed bh x-ray transients, andthat it must be associated only with a modest orbital contraction. the timingof this common-envelope phase is crucial in determining the final bh masses andcurrent evolutionary models of mass-losing massive stars place strongconstraints on the possible masses for immediate bh progenitors and wind massloss from helium stars. last, it is interesting that, even in the absence ofany source of mass loss, the highest helium-star masses predicted by currentevolutionary models are still not high enough to account for the measured bhmass in v404 cyg (&gt;10 solar masses). an alternative for the formation ofrelatively massive bh may be provided by the evolutionary sequence proposed byeggleton &amp; verbunt (1986), which invokes hierarchical triples as progenitors ofbh x-ray binaries with low-mass companions.

astro-ph;0012172	a new formation channel for double neutron stars without recycling:  implications for gravitational wave detection	we report on a new evolutionary path leading to the formation of close doubleneutron stars (ns), with the unique characteristic that none of the two ns everhad the chance to be recycled by accretion. the existence of this channel stemsfrom the evolution of helium-rich stars (cores of massive ns progenitors),which has been neglected in most previous studies of double compact objectformation. we find that these non-recycled ns-ns binaries are formed from barecarbon-oxygen cores in tight orbits, with formation rates comparable to ormaybe even higher than those of recycled ns-ns binaries. on the other hand,their detection probability as binary pulsars is greatly reduced (by about1000) relative to recycled pulsars, because of their short lifetimes. weconclude that, in the context of gravitational-wave detection of ns-ns inspiralevents, this new type of binaries calls for an increase of the rate estimatesderived from the observed ns-ns with recycled pulsars, typically by factors of1.5-3 or even higher.

astro-ph;0309035	an observational diagnostic for ultraluminous x-ray sources	we consider observational tests for the nature of ultraluminous x-ray sources(ulxs). these must distinguish between thermal-timescale mass transfer on tostellar-mass black holes leading to anisotropic x-ray emission, and accretionon to intermediate-mass black holes. we suggest that long-term transientbehavior via the thermal-viscous disk instability could discriminate betweenthese two possibilities for ulxs in regions of young stellar populations.thermal-timescale mass transfer generally produces stable disks and persistentx-ray emission. in contrast, mass transfer from massive stars to black holesproduces unstable disks and thus transient behavior, provided that the blackhole mass exceeds some minimum value. this minimum mass depends primarily onthe donor mass and evolutionary state. we show that it exceeds 50 solar massesfor a large fraction (greater than 90%) of the mass-transfer lifetime for themost likely donors in young clusters. thus if long-term monitoring reveals alarge transient fraction among ulxs in a young stellar population, thesesystems would be good candidates for intermediate-mass black holes in astatistical sense; information about the donor star is needed to make thisidentification secure in any individual case. a transient ulx population wouldimply a much larger population of quiescent systems of the same type.

astro-ph;0404423	pulsar kicks and spin tilts in the close double neutron stars psr  j0737-3039, psr b1534+12 and psr b1913+16	in view of the recent measurement of the scintillation velocity for psrj0737-3039, we examine the complete set of constraints imposed on the pulsar bnatal kicks (magnitude and orientation) and predict the most favorable pulsarkick velocity and spin tilt for both isotropic and polar kicks. our analysistakes into account both currently unknown parameters: the orientation of theorbital plane on the sky (omega) and the radial component of the systemicvelocity (v_r). assuming that the system's peculiar velocity is entirely due tothe second supernova explosion, we find that the system may have crossed thegalactic plane multiple times since the birth of the second neutron star andthat the post-supernova peculiar velocity could have been as high as 1200km/s.we also confirm the absolute lower and upper limits on the physical parametersderived in our earlier study. for specific combinations of the two unknownparameters omega and v_r, however, we find much tighter constraints on thepre-supernova binary configuration and natal kicks imparted to pulsar b, aswell as on the age of system. once omega is measured in the coming year, itwill be straightforward to use the results presented here to further constrainthe natal kicks and the spin-tilt predictions. we complete our comprehensivestudy and derive similar constraints and spin-tilt predictions for psrb1534+12, where the only free parameter is v_r. lastly, for psr b1913+16, weupdate the progenitor and kick constraints using the measured pulsar spin tiltand allowing for roche-lobe overflow from the progenitor of the pulsarcompanion.

astro-ph;0404514	the formation of the most relativistic pulsar psr j0737-3039	we present an updated set of constraints for the progenitor of psr j0737-3039and for the natal kicks imparted to pulsar b taking into account both theevolutionary and kinematic history of the double neutron star. for thispurpose, we use recently reported scintillation velocity measurements to tracethe motion of the system in the galaxy backwards in time as a function of theunknown orientation omega of the systemic velocity projected on plane of thesky as well as the unknown radial velocity vr. the absolute limits on theorbital separation and the mass of pulsar b's helium star progenitor justbefore its supernova explosion are 1.2rsun &lt; a0 &lt; 1.7rsun and 2.1msun &lt; m0 &lt;4.7msun. the kick velocity is constrained to be between 60km/s and 1660km/s andto be misaligned from the pre-sn orbital angular axis (which could beassociated with pulsar b's spin axis) by least 25 degrees. we also deriveprobability distribution functions for the kick velocity imparted to pulsar band for the misalignment angle between pulsar a's spin and the post-supernovaorbital angular momentum for both isotropic and polar kicks. the most probablevalues of both quantities depend sensitively on the unknown radial velocity. inparticular, tilt angles lower than 30-50 degrees tend to be favored for currentradial velocities of less than 500km/s in absolute value, while tilt angleshigher than 120 degrees tend to be associated with radial velocities in excessof 1000km/s in absolute value.

astro-ph;0408387	mapping inspiral rates on population synthesis parameters	formation rates of compact-object binaries are often derived from populationsynthesis calculations. however, such calculations depend sensitively on arelatively large number of model input parameters. given considerableuncertainty in those model parameters, the predicted inspiral rates for doublecompact objects relevant to gravitational-wave interferometric detectors havebeen shown to be are uncertain by several orders of magnitude. typically,inspiral rates are estimated for only a small set of models with a remarkablypoor coverage of the highly multi-dimensional parameter space (primarilybecause of limited computer resources). here, using as an example sevenpopulation-synthesis model parameters, we show that it is possible to derivefits of double-compact-object inspiral rates dependent simultaneously on allseven parameters. we find these fits to be accurate to 50% for binary blackholes and to 40% for binary neutron stars. the availability of such fitsimplies that (i) depending on the problem of interest, it is not necessary tocomplete large numbers of computationally demanding population synthesiscalculations; and (ii) for the first time, the sufficient exploration of therelevant phase space and the assessment of the uncertainties involved is notlimited by computational resources and becomes feasible. finally, we have alsoproduced a histogram of the (a priori likely) binary black hole inpsiral rate,assuming our population synthesis models are equally likely. this histogram,effectively an a priori probability distribution for the bh-bh inspiral rate,suggests that merger rate is conservatively bounded below by10^(-8)/yr/milky-way-galaxy.

astro-ph;0503219	bounds on expected black hole spins in inspiraling binaries	as a first step towards understanding the angular momentum evolution historyof black holes in merging black-hole/neutron-star binaries, we performpopulation synthesis calculations to track the distribution of accretionhistories of compact objects in such binaries. we find that there are threedistinct processes which can possibly contribute to the black-hole spinmagnitude: a birth spin for the black hole, imparted at either (i) the collapseof a massive progenitor star to a black hole or (ii) the accretion-inducedcollapse of a neutron star to a black hole; and (iii) an accretion spin-up whenthe already formed black hole [via (i) or (ii)] goes through an accretionepisode (through an accretion disk or a common-envelope phase). our resultsshow that, with regard to accretion-induced spinup in merging bh-ns binaries[method (iii) above], only  {\em accretion episodes associated with common-envelope phases andhypercritical accretion rates} occur in the formation history of merging blackhole/neutron star binaries. lacking unambiguous experimental information aboutbh birth spins [i.e., regarding the results of processes (i) and (ii)], wechoose two fiducial values for the bh birth angular momentum parameter a=j/m^2,consistent with observations of (i) ns birth spins (a roughly 0) and (ii) x-raybinaries (a=0.5). using these two fiducial values and a conservative upperbound on the specific angular momentum of accreted matter, we discuss theexpected range of black hole spins in the binaries of interest. we concludewith comments on the significance of these results for ground-basedgravitational-wave searches of inspiral signals from black hole binaries.

astro-ph;0504479	constraining population synthesis models via the binary neutron star  population	the observed sample of double neutron-star (ns-ns) binaries presents achallenge to population-synthesis models of compact object formation: theparameters entering into these models must be carefully chosen so as to match(i) the observed star formation rate and (ii) the formation rate of ns-nsbinaries, which can be estimated from the observed sample and the selectioneffects related to the discoveries with radio-pulsar surveys. in this paper, weselect from an extremely broad family of possible population synthesis modelsthose few (2%) which are consistent with the observed sample of ns-ns binaries.to further sharpen the constraints the observed ns-ns population places uponour understanding of compact-object formation processes, we separate theobserved ns-ns population into two channels: (i) merging ns-ns binaries, whichwill inspiral and merge through the action of gravitational waves within $10 $gyr, and (ii) wide ns-ns binaries, consisting of all the rest. with the subsetof astrophysically consistent models, we explore the implications for the ratesat which double black hole (bh-bh), black hole-neutron star (bh-ns), and ns-nsbinaries will merge through the emission of gravitational waves.

astro-ph;0506471	the brightest point x-ray sources in elliptical galaxies and the mass  spectrum of accreting black holes	we propose that the shape of the upper-end x-ray luminosity function observedin elliptical galaxies for point sources is a footprint of the black-hole (bh)mass spectrum among old x-ray transients formed in the galaxies. we show thatthis underlying bh mass spectrum is modified by a weighting factor that isrelated to the transient duty cycle and it generally depends on the bh mass andxrb donor type (main-sequence, red-giant, or white-dwarf donors). a duty cyclethat depends on the binary mass-transfer rate relative to the critical rate fortransient behavior is most probably favored. we also find that the derived bhmass spectrum slope depends on the strength of angular momentum loss due tomagnetic braking for main-sequence donors. more specifically, we find that, for``standard'' magnetic braking, bh xrbs with red-giant donors dominate theupper-end xlf; for weaker magnetic braking prescriptions main-sequence donorsare found to be dominant. in both cases the bh mass spectrum has a differentialslope of ~2.5 and an upper bh mass cut-off at ~20 msun is needed to understandthe very brightest of the bh xrbs in elliptical galaxies. we expect that ourresult will help to constrain binary population synthesis models and theadopted relations between black holes and the masses of their progenitors.

astro-ph;0602024	on the formation and progenitor of psr j0737-3039: new constraints on  the supernova explosion forming pulsar b	we revisit the formation of psr j0737-3039, taking into account the mostrecent observational constraints. we show that the most likely kick velocityand progenitor parameters depend strongly on the consideration of the fullfive-dimensional pdf for the magnitude and direction of the kick velocityimparted to pulsar b at birth, the mass of pulsar b's pre-supernova helium starprogenitor, and the pre-supernova orbital separation, and on the adopted priorassumptions. the priors consist of the transverse systemic velocity, the age ofthe system, and the treatment of the unknown radial velocity. since the lattercannot be determined from observation, we adopt a statistical approach and usetheoretical radial-velocity distributions obtained from population synthesiscalculations for coalescing double neutron stars. we find that the priorassumptions about the pre-supernova helium star mass affect the derived mostlikely parameters significantly: when the minimum helium star mass required forneutron star formation is assumed to be 2.1msun, the most likely kick velocityranges from 70-180km/s; when masses lower than 2.1msun are assumed to allowneutron star formation, the most likely kick velocity can be as low as a fewkm/s, although the majority of the considered models still yield most likelykick velocities of 50-170km/s. we also show that the proximity of the doublepulsar to the galactic plane and the small proper motion do not pose stringentconstraints on the kick velocity and progenitor mass of pulsar b. instead, theconstraints imposed by the orbital dynamics of asymmetric supernova explosionsturn out to be much more restrictive. we conclude that the currently availableobservational constraints cannot be used to favor a specific core-collapse andneutron star formation mechanism.

astro-ph;0609465	mapping population synthesis event rates on model parameters ii:  convergence and accuracy of multidimensional fits	binary population synthesis calculations and associated predictions,especially event rates, are known to depend on a significant number of inputmodel parameters with different degrees of sensitivity. at the same time, forsystems with relatively low formation rates, such simulations are heavilycomputationally demanding and therefore the needed explorations of thehigh-dimensional parameter space require major -- often prohibitive --computational resources. in the present study, to better understand several keyevent rates involving binary evolution and binaries with two compact objects inmilky way-like galaxies and to provide ways of reducing the computational costsof complete parameter space explorations: (i) we perform a methodical parameterstudy of the \emph{startrack} population synthesis code ; and (ii) we develop aformalism and methodology for the derivation of {\em multi-dimensional fits}for event rates. we significantly generalize our earlier study, and we focus onways of thoroughly assessing the accuracy of the fits. we anticipate that theefficient tools developed here can be applied in lieu of large-scale populationcalculations and will facilitate the exploration of the dependence of ratepredictions on a wide range binary evolution parameters. such explorations canthen allow the derivation of constraints on these parameters, given empiricalrate constraints and accounting for fitting errors. here we describe in detailthe principles and practice behind constructing these fits, estimating theiraccuracy, and comparing them with observations in a manner that accounts fortheir errors.

astro-ph;0610076	constraining population synthesis models via empirical binary compact  object merger and supernovae rates	the observed samples of supernovae (sn) and double compact objects (dcos)provide several critical constraints on population-synthesis models: theparameters of these models must be carefully chosen to reproduce, among otherfactors, (i) the formation rates of double neutron star (ns-ns) binaries and ofwhite dwarf-neutron star (wd-ns) binaries, estimated from binary samples, and(ii) the type ii and ib/c supernova rates. even allowing for extremelyconservative accounting of the uncertainties in observational and theoreticalpredictions, we find only a few plausible population synthesis models  (roughly 9%) are consistent with dco and sn rates empirically determined fromobservations. as a proof of concept, we describe the information that can beextracted about population synthesis models given such stringent observationaltests, including surprisingly good agreement with the neutron star kickdistributions inferred from pulsar proper-motion measurements. in the presentstudy, we find that the current observational constraints favor: kicksdescribed by a single maxwellian with a typical velocity of about 300km/s;mass-loss fractions during non-conservative, but stable, mass transfer episodesof about 90%; and common envelope parameters of about 0.2-0.5. finally, we usethe subset of astrophysically consistent models to predict the rates at whichblack hole-neutron star (bh-ns) and ns-ns binaries merge in the milky way andthe nearby universe, assuming milky-way-like galaxies dominate.

gr-qc;0207062	searching for gravitational waves from the inspiral of precessing binary  systems: problems with current waveforms	we consider the problem of searching for gravitational waves emitted duringthe inspiral phase of binary systems when the orbital plane precesses due torelativistic spin-orbit coupling. such effect takes place when the spins of thebinary members are misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum. asa first step we assess the importance of precession specifically for thefirst-generation of ligo detectors. we investigate the extent of thesignal-to-noise ratio reduction and, hence, detection rate that occurs whenprecession effects are not accounted for in the template waveforms. we restrictour analysis to binary systems that undergo the so-called simple precession andhave a total mass close to 10 solar mass. we find that for binary systems withrather high mass ratios (e.g., a 1.4 solar mass neutron star and a 10 solarmass black hole) the detection rate can decrease by almost an order ofmagnitude. current astrophysical estimates of the rate of binary inspiralevents suggest that ligo could detect at most a few events per year, andtherefore the reduction of the detection rate even by a factor of a few iscritical. in the second part of our analysis, we examine whether the effect ofprecession could be included in the templates by capturing the main features ofthe phase modulation through a small number of extra parameters. specificallywe examine and tested for the first time the 3-parameter family suggested byapostolatos. we find that, even though these ``mimic'' templates improve thedetection rate, they are still inadequate in recovering the signal-to-noiseratio at the desired level. we conclude that a more complex template family isneeded in the near future, still maintaining the number of additionalparameters as small as possible in order to reduce the computational costs.
