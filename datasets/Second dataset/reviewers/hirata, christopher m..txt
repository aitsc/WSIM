0903.4925	lyman-alpha transfer in primordial hydrogen recombination	cosmological constraints from the cosmic microwave background (cmb)anisotropies rely on accurate theoretical calculations of the cosmicrecombination history. recent work has emphasized the importance of radiativetransfer calculations due to the high optical depth in the hi lyman lines.transfer in the lyman-alpha line is dominated by true emission and absorption,hubble expansion, and resonant scattering. resonant scattering causes photonsto diffuse in frequency due to random kicks from the thermal velocities ofhydrogen atoms, and also to drift toward lower frequencies due to energy lossvia atomic recoil. past analyses of lyman-alpha transfer during therecombination era have either considered a subset of these processes, ignoredtime dependence, or incorrectly assumed identical emission and absorptionprofiles. we present here a fully time-dependent radiative transfer calculationof the lyman-alpha line including all of these processes, and compare it toprevious results that ignored the resonant scattering. we find a fasterrecombination due to recoil enhancement of the lyman-alpha escape rate, leadingto a reduction in the free electron density of 0.45% at z=900. this results inan increase in the small-scale cmb power spectrum that is negligible for thecurrent data but will be a 0.9 sigma correction for planck. we discuss thereasons why we find a smaller correction than some other recent computations.

0903.4929	tidal alignments as a contaminant of redshift space distortions	we investigate the effect of orientation-dependent selection effects ongalaxy clustering in redshift space. it is found that if galaxies are alignedby large-scale tidal fields, then these selection effects give rise to adependence of the observed galaxy density on the local tidal field, in additionto the well-known dependences on the matter density and radial velocitygradient. this alters the galaxy power spectrum in a way that is different forfourier modes parallel to and perpendicular to the line of sight. these tidalgalaxy alignments can thus mimic redshift space distortions, and thus result ina bias in the measurement of the velocity power spectrum. if galaxyorientations are affected only by the local tidal field, then the tidalalignment effect has exactly the same scale and angular dependence as theredshift space distortions in the linear regime, so it cannot be projected outor removed by masking small scales in the analysis. we consider several toymodels of tidal alignments and orientation-dependent selection, normalize theirfree parameter (an amplitude) to recent observations, and find that they couldbias the velocity amplitude f(z)g(z) by 5--10 per cent in some models, althoughmost models give much smaller contamination. we conclude that tidal alignmentsmay be a significant systematic error in redshift space distortion measurementsthat aim to test general relativity via the growth of large-scale structure. webriefly discuss possible mitigation strategies.

0907.0705	a scale-dependent power asymmetry from isocurvature perturbations	if the hemispherical power asymmetry observed in the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) on large angular scales is attributable to a superhorizoncurvaton fluctuation, then the simplest model predicts that the primordialdensity fluctuations should be similarly asymmetric on all smaller scales. thedistribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the powerasymmetry on scales k ~ 1.5h/mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of theasymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of theasymmetry in the cmb. we show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetrywith this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of theinflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. instead, we considercurvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,thus generating isocurvature perturbations. if there is a superhorizonfluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of theseperturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent onlarge angular scales in the cmb. we find that it is only possible to generatethe observed asymmetry in the cmb while satisfying the quasar constraint if thecurvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.the model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes fromfluctuations in the inflaton field. future observations and analyses of the cmbwill test this model because the power asymmetry generated by this model has aspecific spectrum, and the model requires that the current upper bounds onisocurvature power are nearly saturated.

0910.3786	weak lensing power spectra for precision cosmology: multiple-deflection,  reduced shear and lensing bias corrections	it is usually assumed that the ellipticity power spectrum measured in weaklensing observations can be expressed as an integral over the underlying matterpower spectrum. this is true at second order in the gravitational potential. weextend the standard calculation, constructing all corrections to fourth orderin the gravitational potential. there are four types of corrections:corrections to the lensing shear due to multiple-deflections; corrections dueto the fact that shape distortions probe the reduced shear $\gamma/(1-\kappa)$rather than the shear itself; corrections associated with the non-linearconversion of reduced shear to mean ellipticity; and corrections due to thefact that observational galaxy selection and shear measurement is based ongalaxy brightnesses and sizes which have been (de)magnified by lensing. we showhow the previously considered corrections to the shear power spectrumcorrespond to terms in our analysis, and highlight new terms that were notpreviously identified. all correction terms are given explicitly as integralsover the matter power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum, and arenumerically evaluated for the case of sources at z=1. we find agreement withprevious works for the ${\mathcal o}(\phi^3)$ terms. we find that for ambitiousfuture surveys, the ${\mathcal o}(\phi^4)$ terms affect the power spectrum atthe ~ 1-5 $\sigma$ level; they will thus need to be accounted for, but areunlikely to represent a serious difficulty for weak lensing as a cosmologicalprobe.

0911.1359	cosmological hydrogen recombination: the effect of extremely high-n  states	calculations of cosmological hydrogen recombination are vital for theextraction of cosmological parameters from cosmic microwave background (cmb)observations, and for imposing constraints to inflation and re-ionization. theplanck} mission and future experiments will make high precision measurements ofcmb anisotropies at angular scales as small as l~2500, necessitating acalculation of recombination with fractional accuracy of ~10^{-3}. recent workon recombination includes two-photon transitions from high excitation statesand many radiative transfer effects. modern recombination calculationsseparately follow angular momentum sublevels of the hydrogen atom to accuratelytreat non-equilibrium effects at late times (z&lt;900). the inclusion of extremelyhigh-n (n&gt;100) states of hydrogen is then computationally challenging,preventing until now a determination of the maximum n needed to predict cmbanisotropy spectra with sufficient accuracy for planck. here, results from anew multi-level-atom code (recsparse) are presented. for the first time,`forbidden' quadrupole transitions of hydrogen are included, but shown to benegligible. recsparse is designed to quickly calculate recombination historiesincluding extremely high-n states in hydrogen. histories for a sequence ofvalues as high as n_max=250 are computed, keeping track of all angular momentumsublevels and energy shells of the hydrogen atom separately. use of aninsufficiently high n_max value (e.g., n_max=64) leads to errors (e.g., 1.8sigma for planck) in the predicted cmb power spectrum. extrapolating errors,the resulting cmb anisotropy spectra are converged to 0.5 sigma atfisher-matrix level for n_max=128, in the purely radiative case.

1006.1355	ultrafast effective multi-level atom method for primordial hydrogen  recombination	cosmological hydrogen recombination has recently been the subject of renewedattention because of its importance for predicting the power spectrum of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. it has become clear that it is necessary toaccount for a large number n &gt;~ 100 of energy shells of the hydrogen atom,separately following the angular momentum substates in order to obtainsufficiently accurate recombination histories. however, the multi-level atomcodes that follow the populations of all these levels are computationallyexpensive, limiting recent analyses to only a few points in parameter space. inthis paper, we present a new method for solving the multi-level atomrecombination problem, which splits the problem into a computationallyexpensive atomic physics component that is independent of the cosmology, and anultrafast cosmological evolution component. the atomic physics componentfollows the network of bound-bound and bound-free transitions among excitedstates and computes the resulting effective transition rates for the small setof "interface" states radiatively connected to the ground state. thecosmological evolution component only follows the populations of the interfacestates. by pre-tabulating the effective rates, we can reduce the recurring costof multi-level atom calculations by more than 5 orders of magnitude. theresulting code is fast enough for inclusion in markov chain monte carloparameter estimation algorithms. it does not yet include the radiative transferor high-n two-photon processes considered in some recent papers. further workon analytic treatments for these effects will be required in order to produce arecombination code usable for planck data analysis.

1009.4697	radiative transfer effects in primordial hydrogen recombination	the calculation of a highly accurate cosmological recombination history hasbeen the object of particular attention recently, as it constitutes the majortheoretical uncertainty when predicting the angular power spectrum of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. lyman transitions, in particular thelyman-alpha line, have long been recognized as one of the bottlenecks ofrecombination, due to their very low escape probabilities. the sobolevapproximation does not describe radiative transfer in the vicinity of lymanlines to a sufficient degree of accuracy, and several corrections have alreadybeen computed in other works. in this paper, the impact of some previouslyignored radiative transfer effects is calculated. first, the effect of thomsonscattering in the vicinity of the lyman-alpha line is evaluated, using a fullredistribution kernel incorporated into a radiative transfer code. the effectof feedback of distortions generated by the optically thick deuteriumlyman-alpha line blueward of the hydrogen line is investigated with an analyticapproximation. it is shown that both effects are negligible during cosmologicalhydrogen recombination. secondly, the importance of high-lying, non overlappinglyman transitions is assessed. it is shown that escape from lines abovely-gamma and frequency diffusion in ly-beta and higher lines can be neglectedwithout loss of accuracy. thirdly, a formalism generalizing the sobolevapproximation is developed to account for the overlap of the high-lying lymanlines, which is shown to lead to negligible changes to the recombinationhistory. finally, the possibility of a cosmological hydrogen recombinationmaser is investigated. it is shown that there is no such maser in the purelyradiative treatment presented here.

1010.0759	lindblad resonance torques in relativistic discs: ii. computation of  resonance strengths	we present a fully relativistic computation of the torques due to lindbladresonances from perturbers on circular, equatorial orbits on discs aroundschwarzschild and kerr black holes. the computation proceeds by establishing arelation between the lindblad torques and the gravitational waveforms emittedby the perturber and a test particle in a slightly eccentric orbit at theradius of the lindblad resonance. we show that our result reduces to the usualformula when taking the nonrelativistic limit. discs around a black holepossess an m=1 inner lindblad resonance with no newtonian keplerian analogue;however its strength is very weak even in the moderately relativistic regime(r/m ~ few tens), which is in part due to the partial cancellation of the twoleading contributions to the resonant amplitude (the gravitoelectric octupoleand gravitomagnetic quadrupole). for equatorial orbits around kerr black holes,we find that the m=1 ilr strength is enhanced for retrograde spins andsuppressed for prograde spins. we also find that the torque associated with them&gt;=2 inner lindblad resonances is enhanced relative to the nonrelativisticcase; the enhancement is a factor of 2 for the schwarzschild hole even when theperturber is at a radius of 25m.

1012.2378	molecular hydrogen in the cosmic recombination epoch	the advent of precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)anisotropies has motivated correspondingly precise calculations of the cosmicrecombination history. cosmic recombination proceeds far out of equilibriumbecause of a "bottleneck" at the $n=2$ level of hydrogen: atoms can only reachthe ground state via slow processes: two-photon decay or lyman-$\alpha$resonance escape. however, even a small primordial abundance of molecules couldhave a large effect on the interline opacity in the recombination epoch andlead to an additional route for hydrogen recombination. therefore, this papercomputes the abundance of the h$_2$ molecule during the cosmic recombinationepoch. hydrogen molecules in the ground electronic levels x$^1\sigma^+_g$ caneither form from the excited h$_2$ electronic levels b$^1\sigma^+_u$ andc$^1\pi_u$ or through the charged particles h$_2^+$, heh$^+$ and h$^-$. wefollow the transitions among all of these species, resolving the rotational andvibrational sub-levels. since the energies of thex$^1\sigma^+_g$--b$^1\sigma^+_u$ (lyman band) and x$^1\sigma^+_g$-c$^1\pi_u$(werner band) transitions are near the lyman-$\alpha$ energy, the distortion ofthe cmb spectrum caused by escaped h lyman-line photons accelerates both theformation and the destruction of h$_2$ due to this channel relative to thethermal rates. this causes the populations of h$_2$ molecules inx$^1\sigma^+_g$ energy levels to deviate from their thermal equilibriumabundances. we find that the resulting h$_2$ abundance is $10^{-17}$ at$z=1200$ and $10^{-13}$ at $z=800$, which is too small to have any significantinfluence on the recombination history.

1102.0004	metals at the surface of last scatter	standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) predicts only a trace abundance oflithium and no heavier elements, but some alternatives predict a nonzeroprimordial metallicity. here we explore whether cmb measurements may set usefulconstraints to the primordial metallicity and/or whether the standard cmbcalculations are robust, within the tolerance of forthcoming cmb maps, to thepossibility of primordial metals. metals would affect the recombination history(and thus cmb power spectra) in three ways: (1) lyman-alpha photons can beremoved (and recombination thus accelerated) by photoionizing metals. (2) thebowen resonance-fluorescence mechanism may degrade lyman-beta photons and thusenhance the lyman-beta escape probability and speed up recombination. (3)metals could affect the low-redshift tail of the cmb visibility function byproviding additional free electrons. the last two of these provide thestrongest cmb signal. however, the effects are detectable in the plancksatellite only if the primordial metal abundance is at least a few hundredthsof solar for (2) and a few tenths of solar for (3). we thus conclude thatplanck will not be able to improve upon current constraints to primordialmetallicity, at the level of a thousandth of solar, from the lyman-alpha forestand ultra-metal-poor halo stars, and that the cmb power-spectrum predictionsfor planck suffer no uncertainty arising from the possibility that there may beprimordial metals.

1107.4629	precision simulation of ground-based lensing data using observations  from space	current and upcoming wide-field, ground-based, broad-band imaging surveyspromise to address a wide range of outstanding problems in galaxy formation andcosmology. several such uses of ground-based data, especially weakgravitational lensing, require highly precise measurements of galaxy imagestatistics with careful correction for the effects of the point-spread function(psf). in this paper, we introduce the shera (shear reconvolution analysis)software to simulate ground-based imaging data with realistic galaxymorphologies and observing conditions, starting from space-based data (fromcosmos, the cosmological evolution survey) and accounting for the effects ofthe space-based psf. this code simulates ground-based data, optionally with aweak lensing shear applied, in a model-independent way using a general fourierspace formalism. the utility of this pipeline is that it allows for a precise,realistic assessment of systematic errors due to the method of data processing,for example in extracting weak lensing galaxy shape measurements or galaxyradial profiles, given user-supplied observational conditions and real galaxymorphologies. moreover, the simulations allow for the empirical test of errorestimates and determination of parameter degeneracies, via generation of manynoise maps. the public release of this software, along with a large sample ofcleaned cosmos galaxy images (corrected for charge transfer inefficiency),should enable upcoming ground-based imaging surveys to achieve their potentialin the areas of precision weak lensing analysis, galaxy profile measurement,and other applications involving detailed image analysis.

1107.5427	large-scale clustering of galaxies in general relativity	several recent studies have shown how to properly calculate the observedclustering of galaxies in a relativistic context, and uncovered corrections tothe newtonian calculation that become significant on scales near the horizon.here, we retrace these calculations and show that, on scales approaching thehorizon, the observed galaxy power spectrum depends strongly on which gauge isassumed to relate the intrinsic fluctuations in galaxy density to matterperturbations through a linear bias relation. starting from simple physicalassumptions, we derive a gauge-invariant expression relating galaxy densityperturbations to matter density perturbations on large scales, and show that itreduces to a linear bias relation in synchronous-comoving gauge, corroboratingan assumption made in several recent papers. we evaluate the resulting observedgalaxy power spectrum, and show that it leads to corrections similar to aneffective non-gaussian bias corresponding to a local (effective) fnl &lt; 0.5.this number can serve as a guideline as to which surveys need to take intoaccount relativistic effects. we also discuss the scale-dependent bias inducedby primordial non-gaussianity in the relativistic context, which again issimplest in synchronous-comoving gauge.

1110.2111	impact of the relative motion between the dark matter and baryons on the  first stars	recently the initial supersonic relative velocity between the dark matter andbaryons was shown to have an important effect on galaxy formation at highredshift. we study the impact of this relative motion on the distribution ofthe star-forming halos and on the formation redshift of the very first star. weinclude a new aspect of the relative velocity effect found in recentsimulations by fitting their results to obtain the spatially-varying minimumhalo mass needed for molecular cooling. thus, the relative velocities havethree separate effects: suppression of the halo abundance, suppression of thegas content within each halo, and boosting of the minimum cooling mass. we showthat the two suppressions (of gas content and of halo abundance) are theprimary effects on the small minihalos that cannot form stars, while thecooling mass boost combines with the abundance suppression to produce orderunity fluctuations in stellar density. we quantify the large-scaleinhomogeneity of galaxies, finding that 68% of the star formation (averaged ona 3 mpc scale) is confined to 35% of the volume at z=20 (and just 18% at z=40).in addition, we estimate the redshift of the first star to be z ~ 65, whichincludes a delay of dz ~ 5 due to the relative velocity.

1201.5374	how to detect gravitational waves through the cross-correlation of the  galaxy distribution with the cmb polarization	thompson scattering of cosmic microwave background (cmb) photons off of freeelectrons during the reionization epoch induces a correlation between thedistribution of galaxies and the polarization pattern of the cmb, the magnitudeof which is proportional to the quadrupole moment of radiation at the time ofscattering. since the quadrupole moment generated by gravitational waves (gws)gives rise to a different polarization pattern than that produced by scalarmodes, one can put interesting constraints on the strength of gws on largescales by cross-correlating the small scale galaxy distribution and cmbpolarization. we use this method together with fisher analysis to predict howwell future surveys can measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. we find thatwith a future cmb experiment with detector noise delta_p = 2 mu k-arcmin and abeam width theta_fwhm = 2' and a future galaxy survey with limiting magnitudei&lt;25.6 one can measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio with an error sigma_r \simeq0.09. to measure r \approx 0.01, however, one needs delta_p \simeq 0.5 muk-radian and theta_fwhm \simeq 1'. we also investigate a few systematiceffects, none of which turn out to add any biases to our estimators, but theyincrease the error bars by adding to the cosmic variance. the incomplete skycoverage has the most dramatic effect on our constraints on r for large skycuts, with a reduction in signal-to-noise smaller than one would expect fromthe naive estimate (s/n)^2 \propto f_sky. specifically, we find a degradationfactor of f_deg=0.32 \pm 0.01 for a sky cut of |b|&gt;10^\circ (f_sky=0.83) andf_deg=0.056 \pm 0.004 for a sky cut of |b|&gt;20^\circ (f_sky=0.66). nonetheless,given that our method has different systematics than the more conventionalmethod of observing the large scale b modes directly, it may be used as animportant check in the case of a detection.

1207.1120	cosmological parameter constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy  clustering with the sdss dr7	recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient betweengalaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virialradii of galaxy halos, independent of the details of how galaxies populate darkmatter halos. this finding makes it possible to determine the dark matterclustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxyclustering. we present new cosmological parameter constraints based onlarge-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7). we generalise the approach of baldaufet al. (2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 mpc/h forlensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlationcoefficient differs from unity. we derive constraints for three galaxy samplescovering 7131 sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and 35088 galaxies with meanredshifts of 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. we clearly detect scale-dependent galaxybias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent withtheoretical expectations. when we vary both \sigma_8 and \omega_m (andmarginalise over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat lcdm model, thebest-constrained quantity is \sigma_8 (\omega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05(1-sigma, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors havecomparable contributions, and we fixed n_s=0.96 and h=0.7. these strongconstraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitivewith cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in someways less serious systematics. we therefore expect that this method will play aprominent role in future weak lensing surveys. when we combine these data withwmap7 cmb data, constraints on \sigma_8, \omega_m, h_0, w_{de} and \sum m_{\nu}become 30--80 per cent tighter than with cmb data alone, since our data breakseveral parameter degeneracies.

0801.0642	correlation of cmb with large-scale structure: i. isw tomography and  cosmological implications	we cross-correlate large scale structure (lss) observations from a number ofsurveys with cmb anisotropies from wmap to investigate the integratedsachs-wolfe (isw) effect as a function of redshift, covering z~0.1-2.5. ourmain goal is to go beyond reporting detections towards developing a reliablelikelihood analysis that allows one to determine cosmological constraints fromisw observations. with this in mind we spend a considerable amount of effort indetermining the redshift-dependent bias and redshift distribution b(z)*dn/dz ofthese samples by matching with spectroscopic observations where available, andanalyzing auto-power spectra and cross-power spectra between the samples. thedata sets we use are 2-micron all sky survey (2mass) samples, sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) photometric luminous red galaxies, sdss photometric quasars andnrao vla sky survey (nvss) radio sources. we make a joint analysis of allsamples constructing a full covariance matrix, which we subsequently use forcosmological parameter fitting. we report a 3.7 sigma detection of iswcombining all the datasets. we combine the isw likelihood function with weaklensing of cmb and cmb power spectrum to constrain the equation of state ofdark energy and the curvature of the universe. while isw does not significantlyimprove the constraints in the simplest 6-parameter flat lambda cdm model, itimproves constraints on 7-parameter models with curvature by a factor of 3.2(relative to wmap alone) to omega_k=-0.004^{+0.014}_{-0.020}, and with darkenergy equation of state by 15% to w=-1.01^{+0.30}_{-0.40}.

1307.2638	determining the hubble constant from gravitational wave observations of  merging compact binaries	recent observations have accumulated compelling evidence that some shortgamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are associated with the mergers of neutron star (ns)binaries. this would indicate that the sgrb event is associated with agravitational-wave (gw) signal corresponding to the final inspiral of thecompact binary. in addition, the radioactive decay of elements produced in nsbinary mergers may result in transients visible in the optical and infraredwith peak luminosities on hours-days timescales. simultaneous observations ofthe inspiral gws and signatures in the electromagnetic band may allow us todirectly and independently determine both the luminosity distance and redshiftto a binary. these standard sirens (the gw analog of standard candles) have thepotential to provide an accurate measurement of the low-redshift hubble flow.in addition, these systems are absolutely calibrated by general relativity, andtherefore do not experience the same set of astrophysical systematics found intraditional standard candles, nor do the measurements rely on a distanceladder. we show that 15 observable gw and em events should allow the hubbleconstant to be measured with 5% precision using a network of detectors thatincludes advanced ligo and virgo. measuring 30 beamed gw-sgrb events couldconstrain h_0 to better than 1%. when comparing to standard gaussian likelihoodanalysis, we find that each event's non-gaussian posterior in h_0 helps reducethe overall measurement errors in h_0 for an ensemble of ns binary mergers.

1307.2890	the stability of tidally deformed neutron stars to three- and four-mode  coupling	it has recently been suggested that the tidal deformation of a neutron starexcites daughter p- and g-modes to large amplitudes via a quasi-staticinstability. this would remove energy from the tidal bulge, resulting indissipation and possibly affecting the phase evolution of inspiralling binaryneutron stars and hence the extraction of binary parameters from gravitationalwave observations. this instability appears to arise because of a largethree-mode interaction among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes ofsimilar radial wavenumber. we show that additional four-mode interactions enterinto the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previouslyconsidered. we compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preservingcoordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star tothat of a radially perturbed spherical star. using this method, we relate thefour-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exactcancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactionsand the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. we then show that theequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- andg-modes to leading order. the leading deviation from the quasi-staticapproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it mayslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is atleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. we conclude that thep-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does notimpact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars.

1307.6859	lyman-alpha heating of inhomogeneous high-redshift intergalactic medium	the intergalactic medium (igm) prior to the epoch of reionization consistsmostly of neutral hydrogen gas. ly-alpha photons produced by early starsresonantly scatter off hydrogen atoms, causing energy exchange between theradiation field and the gas. this interaction results in moderate heating ofthe gas due to the recoil of the atoms upon scattering, which is of greatinterest for future studies of the pre-reionization igm in the hi 21 cm line.we investigate the effect of this ly-alpha heating in the igm with lineardensity, temperature, and velocity perturbations. perturbations smaller thanthe diffusion length of photons could be damped due to heat conduction byly-alpha photons. the scale at which damping occurs and the strength of thiseffect depend on various properties of the gas, the flux of ly-alpha photonsand the way in which photon frequencies are redistributed upon scattering. tofind the relevant length scale and the extent to which ly-alpha heating affectsperturbations, we calculate the gas heating rates by numerically solvinglinearized boltzmann equations in which scattering is treated by thefokker-planck approximation. we find that (1) perturbations add a smallcorrection to the gas heating rate, and (2) the damping of temperatureperturbations occurs at scales with comoving wavenumber k&gt;10^4 mpc^{-1}, whichare much smaller than the jeans scale and thus unlikely to substantially affectthe observed 21 cm signal.

1308.3875	initial results from a laboratory emulation of weak gravitational  lensing measurements	weak gravitational lensing observations are a key science driver for the nasawide field infrared survey telescope (wfirst). to validate the performance ofthe wfirst infrared detectors, we have performed a laboratory emulation of weakgravitational lensing measurements. our experiments used a custom precisionprojector system to image a target mask composed of a grid of pinholes,emulating stellar point sources, onto a 1.7 micron cut-off teledyne hgcdte/h2rgdetector. we used a 880nm led illumination source and f/22 pupil stop toproduce undersampled point spread functions similar to those expected fromwfirst. we also emulated the wfirst image reconstruction strategy, using theimage combination (imcom) algorithm to derive oversampled images from dithered,undersampled input images. we created shear maps for this data and computedshear correlation functions to mimic a real weak lensing analysis. afterremoving only 2nd order polynomial fits to the shear maps, we found that thecorrelation functions could be reduced to o(10^-6). this places a conservativeupper limit on the detector-induced bias to the correlation function (under ourtest conditions). this bias is two orders of magnitude lower than the expectedweak lensing signal. restricted to scales relevant to dark energy analyses (skyseparations &gt; 0.5 arcmin), the bias is o(10^-7): comparable to the requirementfor future weak lensing missions to avoid biasing cosmological parameterestimates. our experiment will need to be upgraded and repeated under differentconfigurations to fully characterize the shape measurement performance ofwfirst ir detectors.

1310.3339	weak gravitational lensing systematics from image combination	extremely accurate shape measurements of galaxy images are needed to probedark energy properties with weak gravitational lensing surveys. to increasesurvey area with a fixed observing time and pixel count, images from surveyssuch as the wide field infrared survey telescope (wfirst) or euclid willnecessarily be undersampled and therefore distorted by aliasing. oversampled,unaliased images can be obtained by combining multiple, dithered exposures ofthe same source with a suitable reconstruction algorithm. any suchreconstruction must minimally distort the reconstructed images for weak lensinganalyses to be unbiased. in this paper, we use the image combination (imcom)algorithm of rowe, hirata, and rhodes to investigate the effect of imagecombination on shape measurements (size and ellipticity). we simulate ditheredimages of sources with varying amounts of ellipticity and undersampling,reconstruct oversampled output images from them using imcom, and measure shapedistortions in the output. our simulations show that imcom creates nosignificant distortions when the relative offsets between dithered images areprecisely known. distortions increase with the uncertainty in those offsets butbecome problematic only with relatively poor astrometric precision. e.g. forimages similar to those from the astrophysics focused telescope asset (afta)implementation of wfirst, combining eight undersampled images (sampling ratioq=1) with highly pessimistic uncertainty in astrometric registration(\sigma_d~10^{-3} pixels) yields an rms shear error of o(10^{-4}). our analysispipeline is adapted from that of the precision projector laboratory -- a jointproject between nasa jet propulsion laboratory and caltech which characterizesimage sensors using laboratory emulations of astronomical data.

1312.3704	inference of dispersion measure from incoherent time-steady sources	several recent papers have proposed schemes by which a dispersion measure,and hence electron column, could be obtained from a time-steady, incoherentradio source at a cosmological distance (such as an active galactic nucleus).if correct, this would open a new window on the distribution of intergalacticbaryons. these schemes are based on the statistical properties of the receivedradiation, such as the 2- or 4-point correlation function of the receivedelectric field, and in one case on the quantum nature of the electromagneticfield. we show, on the basis of general principles, that these schemes are notsensitive to dispersion measure (or have an extremely small signal-to-noiseratio), because (i) the classical 2-point correlation function is unaffected bydispersion; (ii) for a source with a large number of incoherently emittingelectrons, the central limit theorem obliterates additional information inhigher-order functions; and (iii) such an emitter produces a radiation densitymatrix that is equivalent to a statistical distribution of coherent states,which contains no information that is not already in the statistics of theclassical waveforms. why the proposed observables do not depend on dispersionmeasure (or have extremely tiny dependences) is discussed in detail.

0802.2365	improved optical mass tracer for galaxy clusters calibrated using weak  lensing measurements	we develop an improved mass tracer for clusters of galaxies from opticallyobserved parameters, and calibrate the mass relation using weak gravitationallensing measurements. we employ a sample of ~ 13,000 optically-selectedclusters from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) maxbcg catalog, withphotometric redshifts in the range 0.1-0.3. the optical tracers we consider arecluster richness, cluster luminosity, luminosity of the brightest clustergalaxy (bcg), and combinations of these parameters. we measure the weak lensingsignal around stacked clusters as a function of the various tracers, and use itto determine the tracer with the least amount of scatter. we further use theweak lensing data to calibrate the mass normalization. we find that the bestmass estimator for massive clusters is a combination of cluster richness,n_{200}, and the luminosity of the brightest cluster galaxy, l_{bcg}:m_{200\bar{\rho}} = (1.27 +/- 0.08) (n_{200}/20)^{1.20 +/- 0.09}(l_{bcg}/\bar{l}_{bcg}(n_{200}))^{0.71 +/- 0.14} \times 10^{14} h^{-1} m_sun,where $\bar{l}_{bcg}(n_{200})$ is the observed mean bcg luminosity at a givenrichness. this improved mass tracer will enable the use of galaxy clusters as amore powerful tool for constraining cosmological parameters.

0803.0808	two-photon transitions in primordial hydrogen recombination	the subject of cosmological hydrogen recombination has received muchattention recently because of its importance to predictions for andcosmological constraints from cmb observations. while the central role of thetwo-photon decay 2s-&gt;1s has been recognized for many decades, high-precisioncalculations require us to consider two-photon decays from the higher statesns,nd-&gt;1s (n&gt;=3). simple attempts to include these processes in recombinationcalculations have suffered from physical problems associated with sequences ofone-photon decays, e.g. 3d-&gt;2p-&gt;1s, that technically also produce two photons.these correspond to resonances in the two-photon spectrum that are opticallythick, necessitating a radiative transfer calculation. we derive theappropriate equations, develop a numerical code to solve them, and verify theresults by finding agreement with analytic approximations to the radiativetransfer equation. the related processes of raman scattering and two-photonrecombination are included using similar machinery. our results show that earlyin recombination the two-photon decays act to speed up recombination, reducingthe free electron abundance by 1.3% relative to the standard calculation atz=1300. however we find that some photons between ly-alpha and ly-beta areproduced, mainly by 3d-&gt;1s two-photon decay and 2s-&gt;1s raman scattering. atlater times these photons redshift down to ly-alpha, excite hydrogen atoms, andact to slow recombination. thus the free electron abundance is increased by1.3% relative to the standard calculation at z=900. the implied correction tothe cmb power spectrum is neligible for the recently released wmap and acbardata, but at fisher matrix level will be 7 sigma for planck.

1410.2250	a new probe of magnetic fields in the pre-reionization epoch: i.  formalism	we propose a method of measuring extremely weak magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium prior to and during the epoch of cosmic reionization. themethod utilizes the larmor precession of spin-polarized neutral hydrogen in thetriplet state of the hyperfine transition. the resulting change in thebrightness temperature fluctuations encodes information about the magneticfield the atoms are immersed in. the method is most suited to probing fieldsthat are coherent on large scales. due to the long lifetime of the tripletstate of the 21-cm transition, this technique is naturally sensitive toextremely weak field strengths, of order $10^{-19}$ g (or $10^{-21}$ g ifscaled to the present day). therefore, this might open up the possibility ofprobing primordial magnetic fields just prior to reionization. moreover, suchmeasurements are unaffected by later magnetic fields since 21-cm observationspreserve redshift information. if the magnetic fields are much stronger, it isstill possible to recover information about their orientation. in this paper(paper i in a series on this effect), we perform detailed calculations of themicrophysics behind this effect, and take into account all the processes thataffect the hyperfine transition, including radiative decays, collisions, andoptical pumping by lyman-$\alpha$ photons. we conclude with an analytic formulafor the brightness temperature of linear-regime fluctuations in the presence ofa magnetic field, and discuss its limiting behavior for weak and strong fields.

1410.6484	the effects of rayleigh scattering on the cmb and cosmic structure	during and after recombination, in addition to thomson scattering with freeelectrons, photons also coupled to neutral hydrogen and helium atoms throughrayleigh scattering. this coupling influences both cmb anisotropies and thedistribution of matter in the universe. the frequency-dependence of therayleigh cross section breaks the thermal nature of cmb temperature andpolarization anisotropies and effectively doubles the number of variablesneeded to describe cmb intensity and polarization statistics, while theadditional atomic coupling changes the matter distribution and the lensing ofthe cmb. we introduce a new method to capture the effects of rayleighscattering on cosmological power spectra. rayleigh scattering modifies cmbtemperature and polarization anisotropies at the $\sim\!1 \%$ level at $353{\rm ghz}$ (scaling $\propto \nu^4$), and modifies matter correlations by asmuch as $\sim\!0.3\%$. we show the rayleigh signal, especially thecross-spectra between the thermal (rayleigh) e-polarization and rayleigh(thermal) intensity signal, may be detectable with future cmb missions even inthe presence of foregrounds, and how this new information might help to betterconstrain the cosmological parameters.

0805.2552	halo mass - concentration relation from weak lensing	we perform a statistical weak lensing analysis of dark matter profiles aroundtracers of halo mass from galactic- to cluster-size halos. in this analysis weuse 170,640 isolated ~l* galaxies split into ellipticals and spirals, 38,236groups traced by isolated spectroscopic luminous red galaxies (lrgs) and 13,823maxbcg clusters from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) covering a wide rangeof richness. together these three samples allow a determination of the densityprofiles of dark matter halos over three orders of magnitude in mass, from10^{12} m_{sun} to 10^{15} m_{sun}. the resulting lensing signal is consistentwith an nfw or einasto profile on scales outside the central region. we findthat the nfw concentration parameter c_{200b} decreases with halo mass, fromaround 10 for galactic halos to 4 for cluster halos. assuming its dependence onhalo mass in the form of c_{200b} = c_0 [m/(10^{14}m_{sun}/h)]^{\beta}, we findc_0=4.6 +/- 0.7 (at z=0.22) and \beta=0.13 +/- 0.07, with very similar resultsfor the einasto profile. the slope (\beta) is in agreement with theoreticalpredictions, while the amplitude is about two standard deviations below thepredictions for this mass and redshift, but we note that the published valuesin the literature differ at a level of 10-20% and that for a proper comparisonour analysis should be repeated in simulations. we discuss the implications ofour results for the baryonic effects on the shear power spectrum: since theseare expected to increase the halo concentration, the fact that we see noevidence of high concentrations on scales above 20% of the virial radiussuggests that baryonic effects are limited to small scales, and are not asignificant source of uncertainty for the current weak lensing measurements ofthe dark matter power spectrum.

1508.06503	the foreground wedge and 21 cm bao surveys	redshifted h{\sc\,i} 21 cm emission from unresolved low-redshift large scalestructure is a promising window for ground-based baryon acoustic oscillations(bao) observations. a major challenge for this method is separating the cosmicsignal from the foregrounds of galactic and extra-galactic origins that arestronger by many orders of magnitude than the former. the smooth frequencyspectrum expected for the foregrounds would nominally contaminate only verysmall $k_\parallel$ modes; however the chromatic response of the telescopeantenna pattern at this wavelength to the foreground introduces non-smoothstructure, pervasively contaminating the cosmic signal over the physical scalesof our interest. such contamination defines a wedged volume in fourier spacearound the transverse modes that is inaccessible for the cosmic signal. in thispaper, we test the effect of this contaminated wedge on the future 21 cm baosurveys using fisher information matrix calculation. we include the signalimprovement due to the bao reconstruction technique that has been used forgalaxy surveys and test the effect of this wedge on the bao reconstruction as afunction of signal to noises and incorporate the results in the fisher matrixcalculation. we find that the wedge effect expected at $z=1-2$ is verydetrimental to the angular diameter distances: the errors on angular diameterdistances increased by 3-4.4 times, while the errors on h(z) increased by afactor of 1.5-1.6. we conclude that calibration techniques that clean out theforeground "wedge" would be extremely valuable for constraining angulardiameter distances from intensity-mapping 21 cm surveys.

astro-ph;0209489	analyzing weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background using the  likelihood function	future experiments will produce high-resolution temperature maps of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) and are expected to reveal the signature ofgravitational lensing by intervening large-scale structures. we constructall-sky maximum-likelihood estimators that use the lensing effect to estimatethe projected density (convergence) of these structures, its power spectrum,and cross-correlation with other observables. this contrasts with earlierquadratic-estimator approaches that taylor-expanded the observed cmbtemperature to linear order in the lensing deflection angle; these approachesgave estimators for the temperature-convergence correlation in terms of the cmbthree-point correlation function and for the convergence power spectrum interms of the cmb four-point correlation function, which can be biased andnon-optimal due to terms beyond the linear order. we show that for sufficientlyweak lensing, the maximum-likelihood estimator reduces to the computationallyless demanding quadratic estimator. the maximum likelihood and quadraticapproaches are compared by evaluating the root-mean-square (rms) error and biasin the reconstructed convergence map in a numerical simulation; it is foundthat both the rms errors and bias are of order 1 percent for the case of planckand of order 10--20 percent for a 1 arcminute beam experiment. we conclude thatfor recovering lensing information from temperature data acquired by theseexperiments, the quadratic estimator is close to optimal, but further work willbe required to determine whether this is also the case for lensing of the cmbpolarization field.

astro-ph;0405042	spectroscopic source redshifts and parameter constraints from weak  lensing and cmb	weak lensing is a potentially robust and model-independent cosmologicalprobe, but its accuracy is dependent on knowledge of the redshift distributionof the source galaxies used. the most robust way to determine the redshiftdistribution is via spectroscopy of a subsample of the source galaxies. weforecast constraints from combining cmb anisotropies with cosmic shear using aspectroscopically determined redshift distribution, varying the number ofspectra $n_{spec}$ obtained from 64 to $\infty$. the source redshiftdistribution is expanded in a fourier series, and the amplitudes of each modeare considered as parameters to be constrained via both the spectroscopic andweak lensing data. we assume independent source redshifts, and consider in whatcircumstances this is a good approximation (the sources are clustered and fornarrow spectroscopic surveys with many objects this results in the redshiftsbeing correlated). it is found that for the surveys considered and for a priorof 0.04 on the calibration parameters, the addition of redshift informationmake significant improvements on the constraints on the cosmologicalparameters; however, beyond $n_{spec}\sim$few$\times 10^3$ the addition offurther spectra will make only a very small improvement to the cosmologicalparameters. we find that a better calibration makes large $n_{spec}$ moreuseful. using an eigenvector analysis, we find that the improvement continueswith even higher $n_{spec}$, but not in directions that dominate theuncertainties on the standard cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0406275	intrinsic alignment-lensing interference as a contaminant of cosmic  shear	cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, butcan be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticitycorrelations of the source galaxies. the intrinsic alignments are believed tobe small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensingdistortions being uncorrelated. here we show that the gravitational lensingshear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between thetidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearbygalaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distantgalaxies. we estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsicalignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related tothe tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field assuggested by tidal torque theory. the first model predicts agravitational-intrinsic (gi) correlation that can be much greater than theintrinsic-intrinsic (ii) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and thatremains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. the secondmodel, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation.in the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recentlyclaimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the gi correlationterm can exceed the usual ii term by &gt;1 order of magnitude and the intrinsiccorrelation induced b-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. these interference effectscan suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by oforder ~10% at z_s=1 and ~30% at z_s=0.5.

astro-ph;0410360	correlating the cmb with luminous red galaxies : the integrated  sachs-wolfe effect	we present a 2.5 sigma detection of the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effectand discuss the constraints it places on cosmological parameters. wecross-correlate microwave temperature maps from the wmap satellite with a 4000deg^2 luminous red galaxy (lrg) overdensity map measured by the sloan digitalsky survey. accurate photometric redshifts allow us to perform a reliableauto-correlation analysis of the lrgs, eliminating the uncertainty in thegalaxy bias, and combined with cross correlation signal, constrainscosmological parameters -- in particular, the matter density. we find a 2.5sigma signal in the ka, q, v, and w wmap bands, after combining the informationfrom multipoles 2 &lt;= l &lt; 400. this is consistent with the expected amplitude ofthe isw effect, but requires a lower matter density than is usually assumed:the amplitude, parametrized by the galaxy bias assuming \omega_m=0.3,\omega_\lambda=0.7 and \sigma_8=0.9, is b_g = 4.05 \pm 1.54 for v band, withsimilar results for the other bands. this should be compared to b_g = 1.82 \pm0.02 from the auto-correlation analysis. these data provide only a weakconfirmation (2.5 sigma) of dark energy, but provide a significant upper limit:\omega_\lambda=0.80_{-0.06}^{+0.03} (1 sigma)_{-0.19}^{+0.05} (2 sigma),assuming a cosmology with \omega_m+\omega_\lambda=1, \omega_b = 0.05, and\sigma_8=0.9, and w=-1. the weak cross-correlation signal rules out low matterdensity/high dark energy density universes and, in combination with other data,strongly constrains models with w&lt;-1.3. we provide a simple prescription toincorporate these constraints into cosmological parameter estimation methodsfor (\omega_m, \sigma_8,w).

astro-ph;0501167	cmb b-mode polarization from thomson scattering in the local universe	[abridged] the polarization of the cmb is widely recognized as a potentialsource of information about primordial gravitational waves. the gravitationalwave contribution can be separated from the dominant cmb polarization createdby density perturbations because it generates both e and b polarization modes,whereas the density perturbations create only e polarization. the limits of ourability to measure gravitational waves are thus determined by statistical andsystematic errors, foregrounds, and nonlinear evolution effects such as lensingof the cmb. usually it is assumed that most foregrounds can be removed becauseof their frequency dependence, however thomson scattering of the cmb quadrupoleby electrons in the galaxy or nearby structures shares the blackbody frequencydependence of the cmb. if the optical depth from these nearby electrons isanisotropic, the polarization generated can include b modes even without tensorperturbations. we estimate this effect for the galactic disk and nearbyextragalactic structures, and find that it contributes to the b polarization atthe level of ~(1--2)x10^-4\mu k per logarithmic interval in multipole l forl&lt;30. this is well below the detectability level even for a future cmbpolarization satellite. depending on its structure and extent, the galacticcorona may be a source of b-modes comparable to the residual large-scalelensing b-mode after the latter has been cleaned using lensing reconstructiontechniques. for an extremely ambitious post-planck cmb experiment, thomsonscattering in the galactic corona is thus a potential contaminant of thegravitational wave signal; conversely, if the other foregrounds can be cleanedout, such an experiment might be able to constrain models of the corona.

astro-ph;0501201	systematic errors in weak lensing: application to sdss galaxy-galaxy  weak lensing	weak lensing is emerging as a powerful observational tool to constraincosmological models, but is at present limited by an incomplete understandingof many sources of systematic error. many of these errors are multiplicativeand depend on the population of background galaxies. we show how the commonlycited geometric test, which is rather insensitive to cosmology, can be used asa ratio test of systematics in the lensing signal at the 1 per cent level. weapply this test to the galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis of the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), which at present is the sample with the highest weak lensingsignal to noise and has the additional advantage of spectroscopic redshifts forlenses. this allows one to perform meaningful geometric tests of systematicsfor different subsamples of galaxies at different mean redshifts, such asbrighter galaxies, fainter galaxies and high-redshift luminous red galaxies,both with and without photometric redshift estimates. we use overlappingobjects between sdss and the deep2 and 2slaq spectroscopic surveys to establishaccurate calibration of photometric redshifts and to determine the redshiftdistributions for sdss. we use these redshift results to compute the projectedsurface density contrast deltasigma around 259 609 spectroscopic galaxies inthe sdss; by measuring deltasigma with different source samples we establishconsistency of the results at the 10 per cent level (1-sigma). we also use theratio test to constrain shear calibration biases and other systematics in thesdss survey data to determine the overall galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signalcalibration uncertainty. we find no evidence of any inconsistency among manysubsamples of the data.

astro-ph;0503582	can superhorizon cosmological perturbations explain the acceleration of  the universe?	we investigate the recent suggestions by barausse et al. (astro-ph/0501152)and kolb et al. (hep-th/0503117) that the acceleration of the universe could beexplained by large superhorizon fluctuations generated by inflation. we showthat no acceleration can be produced by this mechanism. we begin by showing howthe application of raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies resultsin several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. next we derive anexact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for whichapplication of the kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while theexact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. we show that thediscrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the kolbet al. analysis. we proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation ofgeneral relativity to argue that causality severely limits what observableeffects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. by constructing ariemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrareddivergence terms arise in this coordinate system. thus any divergences foundpreviously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and areunobservable. we perform an explicit analysis of the variance of thedeceleration parameter for the case of single field inflation using usualcoordinates and show that the infrared divergent terms found by barausse et al.and kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in theiranalysis. finally, we argue that introducing isocurvature perturbations doesnot alter our conclusion that the accelerating expansion of the universe cannotbe explained by superhorizon modes.

astro-ph;0507102	wouthuysen-field coupling strength and application to high-redshift 21  cm radiation	the first uv sources in the universe are expected to have coupled the hi spintemperature to the gas kinetic temperature via scattering in the lyman-alpharesonance [the wouthuysen-field (wf) effect]. by establishing an hi spintemperature different from the temperature of the cmb, the wf effect shouldallow observations of hi during the reionization epoch in the redshifted 21 cmline. this paper investigates four mechanisms that can affect the strength ofthe wf effect that were not previously considered: (1) photons redshifting intothe hi lyman resonances may excite an h atom and result in a radiative cascadeterminating in two-photon 2s-&gt;1s emission, rather than always degrading tolyman-alpha as usually assumed. (2) the fine structure of the lyman-alpharesonance alters the photon frequency distribution and leads to a suppressionof the scattering rate. (3) the spin-flip scatterings change the frequency ofthe photon and cause the photon spectrum to relax not to the kinetictemperature of the gas but to a temperature between the kinetic and spintemperatures, effectively reducing the strength of the wouthuysen-fieldcoupling. (4) near line centre, a photon can change its frequency by severaltimes the line width in a single scattering event, thus potentiallyinvalidating the usual calculation of the lyman-alpha spectral distortion basedon the diffusion approximation. it is shown that (1) suppresses the wf couplingstrength by a factor of up to ~2, while (2) and (3) are important only at lowkinetic temperatures. effect (4) has a &lt;=3% effect for kinetic temperaturest_k&gt;=2k. if the pre-reionization igm was efficiently heated by x-rays, onlyeffect (1) is important. fitting formulae are provided for the range of t_k&gt;=2kand gunn-peterson optical depth 10^5--10^7.

astro-ph;0507108	ellipticity of dark matter halos with galaxy-galaxy weak lensing	we present the results of attempts to detect the ellipticity of dark matterhalos using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with sdss data. we use 2,020,256galaxies brighter than r=19 with photometric redshifts (divided into colour andluminosity subsamples) as lenses and 31,697,869 source galaxies. we search forand identify several signal contaminants, which if not removed lead to aspurious detection. these include systematic shear that leads to a slightspurious alignment of lens and source ellipticities, intrinsic alignments (dueto contamination of the source sample by physically-associated lens sourcepairs), and anisotropic magnification bias. we develop methods that allow us toremove these contaminants to the signal. we split the analysis into blue(spiral) and red (elliptical) galaxies. assuming gaussian errors as in previouswork and a power-law profile, we find f_h=e_h/e_g=0.1+/-0.06 for red galaxiesand -0.8+/-0.4 for blue galaxies using 20-300 kpc/h, averaged over luminosity.inclusion of the more realistic non-gaussian error distributions and of the nfwdensity profile (which predicts much smaller ellipticity of the shear forscales above the scale radius) yields 0.60+/-0.38 for ellipticals and-1.4+1.7-2.0 for spirals. while there is no concrete detection of alignment ineither case, there is a suggestion in the data of a positive alignment in thebrightest lens sample of ellipticals. our results appear to be mildlyinconsistent with a previously reported detection by hoekstra et al. (2004),but more data and further tests are needed to clarify whether the discrepancyis real or a consequence of differences in the lens galaxy samples used andanalysis methods.

astro-ph;0509026	detection of large scale intrinsic ellipticity-density correlation from  the sloan digital sky survey and implications for weak lensing surveys	the power spectrum of weak lensing shear caused by large-scale structure isan emerging tool for precision cosmology, in particular for measuring theeffects of dark energy on the growth of structure at low redshift. onepotential source of systematic error is intrinsic alignments of ellipticitiesof neighbouring galaxies (ii correlation) that could mimic the correlations dueto lensing. a related possibility pointed out by hirata and seljak (2004) iscorrelation between the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the densityfield responsible for gravitational lensing shear (gi correlation). we presentconstraints on both the ii and gi correlations using 265 908 spectroscopicgalaxies from the sdss, and using galaxies as tracers of the mass in the caseof the gi analysis. the availability of redshifts in the sdss allows us toselect galaxies at small radial separations, which both reduces noise in theintrinsic alignment measurement and suppresses galaxy- galaxy lensing (whichotherwise swamps the gi correlation). while we find no detection of the iicorrelation, our results are nonetheless statistically consistent with recentdetections found using the supercosmos survey. in contrast, we have a cleardetection of gi correlation in galaxies brighter than l* that persists to thelargest scales probed (60 mpc/h) and with a sign predicted by theoreticalmodels. this correlation could cause the existing lensing surveys at z~1 tounderestimate the linear amplitude of fluctuations by as much as 20% dependingon the source sample used, while for surveys at z~0.5 the underestimation mayreach 30%.

astro-ph;0511164	galaxy halo masses and satellite fractions from galaxy-galaxy lensing in  the sdss: stellar mass, luminosity, morphology, and environment dependencies	the relationship between galaxies and dark matter can be characterized by thehalo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that aresatellites. here we present observational constraints from the sdss on thesequantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass usinggalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351,507 lenses. we use stellarmasses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weakgravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in thehalo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. we find that an l*galaxy with a stellar mass of 6x10^{10} m_{sun} is hosted by a halo with massof 1.4x10^{12} m_{sun}/h, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversionefficiencies of 17_{-5}^{+10} (early types) and 16_{-6}^{+15} (late types) percent at the 95 per cent cl (statistical, not including systematic uncertaintydue to assumption of a universal initial mass function, or imf). we find thatfor a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology belowm_{stellar}=10^{11} m_{sun}, in contrast to typically a factor of twodifference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity.this suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range andshould be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed.for higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function ofstellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early and late typesbecome larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster halos withmasses above 10^{13} m_{sun} host ellipticals at the center, while even thebrightest central spirals are hosted by halos of mass below 10^{13} m_{sun}.(abridged)

astro-ph;0605071	the spin-resolved atomic velocity distribution and 21-cm line profile of  dark-age gas	the 21-cm hyperfine line of atomic hydrogen (hi) is a promising probe of thecosmic dark ages. in past treatments of 21-cm radiation it was assumed thehyperfine level populations of hi could be characterized by avelocity-independent ``spin temperature'' t_s determined by a competitionbetween 21-cm radiative transitions, spin-changing collisions, and (at lowerredshifts) lyman-alpha scattering. however we show here that, if thecollisional time is comparable to the radiative time, the spin temperature willdepend on atomic velocity, t_s=t_s(v), and one must replace the usual hyperfinelevel rate equations with a boltzmann equation describing the spin and velocitydependence of the hi distribution function. we construct here the boltzmannequation relevant to the cosmic dark ages and solve it using a basis-functionmethod. accounting for the actual spin-resolved atomic velocity distributionresults in up to a 2 per cent suppression of the 21-cm emissivity, and aredshift and angular-projection dependent suppression or enhancement of thelinear power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations of up to 5 per cent. the effect onthe 21-cm line profile is more dramatic -- its full-width at half maximum(fwhm) can be enhanced by up to 60 per cent relative to thevelocity-independent calculation. we discuss the implications for 21-cmtomography of the dark ages.
