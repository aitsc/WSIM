0906.3633	bursting behavior of the galactic center faint x-ray transient grs  1741.9-2853	the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary grs 1741.9-2853 is a known type-iburster of the galactic center. it is transient, faint, and located in a verycrowded region, only 10 arcmin from the supermassive black hole sgr a*.therefore, its bursting behavior has been poorly studied so far. in particular,its persistent emission has rarely been detected between consecutive bursts,due to lack of sensitivity or confusion. this is what made grs 1741.9-2853 oneof the nine "burst-only sources" identified by bepposax a few years ago. thephysical properties of grs 1741.9-2853 bursts are yet of great interest sincewe know very little about the nuclear regimes at stake in low accretion ratebursters. we examine here for the first time several bursts in relation withthe persistent emission of the source, using integral, xmm-newton, and swiftobservations. we investigate the source flux variability and bursting behaviorduring its 2005 and 2007 long outbursts. the persistent luminosity of grs1741.9-2853 varied between ~1.7 and 10.5 10^36 erg s^-1, i.e. 0.9-5.3% of theeddington luminosity. the shape of the spectrum as described by an absorbedpower-law remained with a photon index gamma ~ 2 and a column density $n_{\rmh} ~ 12 10^22 cm^-2 throughout the outbursts. we discovered 11 type-i burstswith integral, and inspected 4 additional bursts: 2 recorded by xmm-newton and2 by swift. from the brigthest burst, we derive an upper limit on the sourcedistance of ~7 kpc. the observed bursts characteristics and source accretionrate suggest pure helium explosions igniting at column depths y_{ign} ~ 0.8-4.810^8 g cm^-1, for typical energy releases of ~1.2-7.4 10^39 erg.

0910.3074	discovery of a highly energetic pulsar associated with igr j14003-6326  in a young uncataloged galactic supernova remnant g310.6-1.6	we report the discovery of 31.18 ms pulsations from the integral source igrj14003-6326 using the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). this pulsar is mostlikely associated with the bright chandra x-ray point source lying at thecenter of g310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised galactic composite supernovaremnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and x-ray nebula, taken to bethe pulsar wind nebula (pwn). psr j1400-6325 is amongst the most energeticrotation-powered pulsars in the galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of edot =5.1e+37 erg.s-1. in the rotating dipole model, the surface dipole magneticfield strength is b_s = 1.1e+12 g and the characteristic age tau_c = p/2pdot =12.7 kyr. the high spin-down power is consistent with the hard spectral indicesof the pulsar and the nebula of 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.83 +/- 0.08, respectively,and a 2-10 kev flux ratio f_pwn/f_psr ~ 8. follow-up parkes observationsresulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20 cm from psr j1400-6325at a dispersion measure of ~ 560 cm-3 pc, which implies a relatively largedistance of 10 +/- 3 kpc. however, the resulting location off the galacticplane of ~ 280 pc would be much larger than the typical thickness of themolecular disk, and we argue that g310.6-1.6 lies at a distance of ~ 7 kpc.there is no gamma-ray counterpart to the nebula or pulsar in the fermi datapublished so far. a multi-wavelength study of this new composite supernovaremnant, from radio to very-high energy gamma-rays, suggests a young (&lt; 1000yr) system, formed by a sub-energetic (~ 1e+50 ergs), low ejecta mass (m_ej ~ 3msun) sn explosion that occurred in a low-density environment (n_0 ~ 0.01cm-3).

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1005.4807	fading hard x-ray emission from the galactic centre molecular cloud sgr  b2	the centre of our galaxy harbours a 4 million solar mass black hole that isunusually quiet: its present x-ray luminosity is more than 10 orders ofmagnitude less than its eddington luminosity. the observation of ironfluorescence and hard x-ray emission from some of the massive molecular cloudssurrounding the galactic centre has been interpreted as an echo of a pastflare. alternatively, low-energy cosmic rays propagating inside the cloudsmight account for the observed emission, through inverse bremsstrahlung of lowenergy ions or bremsstrahlung emission of low energy electrons. here we reportthe observation of a clear decay of the hard x-ray emission from the molecularcloud sgr b2 during the past 7 years thanks to more than 20 ms of integralexposure. the measured decay time is compatible with the light crossing time ofthe molecular cloud core . such a short timescale rules out inversebremsstrahlung by cosmic-ray ions as the origin of the x ray emission. we alsoobtained 2-100 kev broadband x-ray spectra by combining integral and xmm-newtondata and compared them with detailed models of x-ray emission due toirradiation of molecular gas by (i) low-energy cosmic-ray electrons and (ii)hard x-rays. both models can reproduce the data equally well, but the timevariability constraints and the huge cosmic ray electron luminosity required toexplain the observed hard x-ray emission strongly favor the scenario in whichthe diffuse emission of sgr b2 is scattered and reprocessed radiation emittedin the past by sgr a*. using recent parallax measurements that place sgr b2 infront of sgr a*, we find that the period of intense activity of sgr a* endedbetween 75 and 155 years ago.

1105.3206	a new snr with tev shell-type morphology: hess j1731-347	the recent discovery of the radio shell-type supernova remnant (snr),g353.6-0.7, in spatial coincidence with the unidentified tev source hessj1731-347 has motivated further observations of the source with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) cherenkov telescope array to test a possibleassociation of the gamma-ray emission with the snr. with a total of 59 hours ofobservation, representing about four times the initial exposure available inthe discovery paper of hess j1731-347, the gamma-ray morphology is investigatedand compared with the radio morphology. an estimate of the distance is derivedby comparing the interstellar absorption derived from x-rays and the oneobtained from 12co and hi observations. the deeper gamma-ray observation of thesource has revealed a large shell-type structure with similar position andextension (r~0.25{\deg}) as the radio snr, thus confirming their association.by accounting for the h.e.s.s. angular resolution and projection effects withina simple shell model, the radial profile is compatible with a thin, spatiallyunresolved, rim. together with rx j1713.7-3946, rx j0852.0-4622 and sn 1006,hess j1731-347 is now the fourth snr with a significant shell morphology at tevenergies. the derived lower limit on the distance of the snr of 3.2 kpc is usedtogether with radio and x-ray data to discuss the possible origin of thegamma-ray emission, either via inverse compton scattering of electrons or thedecay of neutral pions resulting from proton-proton interaction.

1212.4156	a new nearby pulsar wind nebula overlapping the rx j0852.0-4622  supernova remnant	energetic pulsars can be embedded in a nebula of relativistic leptons whichis powered by the dissipation of the rotational energy of the pulsar. theobject psr j0855-4644 is an energetic and fast-spinning pulsar (edot =1.1x10^36 erg/s, p=65 ms) discovered near the south-east rim of the supernovaremnant (snr) rx j0852.0-4622 (aka vela jr) by the parkes multibeam survey. theposition of the pulsar is in spatial coincidence with an enhancement in x-raysand tev gamma-rays, which could be due to its putative pulsar wind nebula(pwn).  the purpose of this study is to search for diffuse non-thermal x-ray emissionaround psr j0855-4644 to test for the presence of a pwn and to estimate thedistance to the pulsar. an x-ray observation was carried out with thexmm-newton satellite to constrain the properties of the pulsar and its nebula.the absorption column density derived in x-rays from the pulsar and fromdifferent regions of the rim of the snr was compared with the absorptionderived from the atomic (hi) and molecular (12co) gas distribution along thecorresponding lines of sight to estimate the distance of the pulsar and of thesnr.  the observation has revealed the x-ray counterpart of the pulsar togetherwith surrounding extended emission thus confirming the existence of a pwn. thecomparison of column densities provided an upper limit to the distance of thepulsar psr j0855-4644 and the snr rx j0852.0-4622 (d&lt;900 pc). although bothobjects are at compatible distances, we rule out that the pulsar and the snrare associated. with this revised distance, psr j0855-4644 is the second mostenergetic pulsar, after the vela pulsar, within a radius of 1 kpc and couldtherefore contribute to the local cosmic-ray e-/e+ spectrum.

1302.2150	acceleration of cosmic rays and gamma-ray emission from supernova  remnants in the galaxy	galactic cosmic rays are believed to be accelerated at supernova remnantshocks. though very popular and robust, this conjecture still needs aconclusive proof. the strongest support to this idea is probably the fact thatsupernova remnants are observed in gamma-rays, which are indeed expected as theresult of the hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays accelerated at theshock and the ambient gas. however, also leptonic processes can, in most cases,explain the observed gamma-ray emission. this implies that the detections ingamma rays do not necessarily mean that supernova remnants accelerate cosmicray protons. to overcome this degeneracy, the multi-wavelength emission (fromradio to gamma rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and ina few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one ofthe two processes (hadronic or leptonic). here we adopt a different approachand, instead of a case-by-case study we aim for a population study and wecompute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in tevgamma rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeedare the sources of cosmic rays. the predictions found here match well withcurrent observational results, thus providing a novel consistency check for thesupernova remnant paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. moreover,hints are presented for the fact that particle spectra significantly steeperthan e^-2 are produced at supernova remnants. finally, we expect that severalof the supernova remnants detected by h.e.s.s. in the survey of the galacticplane should exhibit a gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic processes (i.e.neutral pion decay). the fraction of the detected remnants for which theleptonic emission dominates over the hadronic one depends on the assumed valuesof the physical parameters and can be as high as roughly a half.

(2007). the annihilation diffuse emission componentis extracted simultaneously, leading to the determination of the relatedparameters (positronium flux and fraction). a specific discussion is devoted tothe annihilation line distribution since a significant emission is detectedover a region as large as ~80 degrees by ~10 degrees potentially associatedwith the disk or halo surrounding the central regions of our galaxy.

1307.3954	echoes of multiple outbursts of sagittarius a* revealed by chandra	the relatively rapid spatial and temporal variability of the x-ray radiationfrom some molecular clouds near the galactic center shows that this emissioncomponent is due to the reflection of x-rays generated by a source that wasluminous in the past, most likely the central supermassive black hole,sagittarius a*. studying the evolution of the molecular cloud reflectionfeatures is therefore a key element to reconstruct sgr a*'s past activity. theaim of the present work is to study this emission on small angular scales inorder to characterize the source outburst on short time scales. we use chandrahigh-resolution data collected from 1999 to 2011 to study the most rapidvariations detected so far, those of clouds between 5' and 20' from sgr a*towards positive longitudes. our systematic spectral-imaging analysis of thereflection emission, notably of the fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev and itsassociated 4-8 kev continuum, allows us to characterize the variations down to15" angular scale and 1-year time scale. we reveal for the first time abruptvariations of few years only and in particular a short peaked emission, with afactor of 10 increase followed by a comparable decrease, that propagates alongthe dense filaments of the bridge cloud. this 2-year peaked feature contrastswith the slower 10-year linear variations we reveal in all the other molecularstructures of the region. based on column density constraints, we argue thatthese two different behaviors are unlikely to be due to the same illuminatingevent. the variations are likely due to a highly variable active phase of sgra* sometime within the past few hundred years, characterized by at least twoluminous outbursts of a few-year time scale and during which the sgr a*luminosity went up to at least 10^39 erg/s.

(high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1409.0253	long-term monitoring of pks 2155$-$304 with atom and h.e.s.s.:  investigation of optical/$\gamma$-ray correlations in different spectral  states	in this paper we report on the analysis of all the available optical and veryhigh-energy $\gamma$-ray ($&gt;$200 gev) data for the bl lac object pks2155$-$304, collected simultaneously with the atom and h.e.s.s. telescopes from2007 until 2009. this study also includes x-ray (rxte, swift) and high-energy$\gamma$-ray (fermi-lat) data. during the period analysed, the source wastransitioning from its flaring to quiescent optical states,and wascharacterized by only moderate flux changes at different wavelengths on thetimescales of days and months. a flattening of the optical continuum with anincreasing optical flux can be noted in the collected dataset, but onlyoccasionally and only at higher flux levels. we did not find any universalrelation between the very high-energy $\gamma$-ray and optical flux changes onthe timescales from days and weeks up to several years. on the other hand, wenoted that at higher flux levels the source can follow two distinct tracks inthe optical flux-colour diagrams, which seem to be related to distinct$\gamma$-ray states of the blazar. the obtained results therefore indicate acomplex scaling between the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission of pks2155$-$304, with different correlation patterns holding at different epochs,and a $\gamma$-ray flux depending on the combination of an optical flux andcolour rather than a flux alone.

1510.04518	study of the vhe diffuse emission in the central 200 pc of our galaxy  with h.e.s.s	the very high energy emission from the galactic center ridge was revealed bythe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) in 2006, after subtraction ofthe point sources hess j1745-290, possibly associated with sgr a$^\star$, andhess j1747$-$281, associated with the composite supernova remnant g0.9$+$0.1.the hard spectrum of the ridge emission and its spatial correlation with thelocal gas density suggest that the emission is due to collisions of multi-tevcosmic rays with the dense clouds of interstellar gas present in this region.the much larger h.e.s.s. dataset (250 hrs) that is now available from thisregion and the improved analysis method dedicated to the detection of faintemission allow us to reconsider the characterization of this gamma-ray emissionin the central 200 pc of our galaxy through a detailed morphology study. totest the various contributions to the total gamma-ray emission, we use a 2dmaximum likelihood approach that allows to constrain a phenomenological modelof the signal. we discuss the nature of the various components, and theirimplication on the cosmic-ray distribution in the central region of our galaxy.finally, we will reveal an additional source in this region and will discussits potential nature.

astro-ph;0404097	high-energy emission from the stellar wind collisions in gamma-2 velorum	the binary system gamma-2 velorum (wc8+o7.5) contains the nearest knownwolf-rayet star to the sun, at a distance of 258$_{-31}^{+41}$ pc. its strongradio emission shows evidence for a partially absorbed nonthermal component,which has been interpreted as synchrotron emission from electrons acceleratedin the colliding wind region. inverse compton cooling of these electrons in theintense uv radiation field from the o-type companion star could produce asignificant hard x-ray and gamma-ray emission, whose flux depends on the ratioof the energy densities of magnetic to seed photon fields. the vela region wasobserved with the integral satellite in 2003, as part of the core programme. nosignals from gamma-2 vel are detected in the images obtained with theibis/isgri coded aperture instrument in the energy ranges 20-40 and 40-80 kev.  from the derived 3$\sigma$ upper limits, we show that the average magneticfield near the region of stellar wind collision should be relatively high,greater than about 1 g. the high-energy emission of gamma-2 vel might bedetected with the forthcoming glast experiment.

astro-ph;0407264	the integral view of the galactic nucleus	we present the preliminary results of the observational campaign performed in2003 to study the galactic nucleus with integral. the mosaicked images obtainedwith the ibis/isgri coded aperture instrument in the energy range above 20 kev,give a yet unseen view of the high-energy sources of this region in hard x andgamma-rays, with an angular resolution of 12'. we report on the discovery of asource, igr j17456-2901, compatible with the instrument's point spread functionand coincident with the galactic nucleus sgr a* to within 0.9'. the source isvisible up to 60-80 kev with a 20-100 kev luminosity at 8 kpc of 3 x 10e35erg/s. although we cannot unequivocally associate the new integral source tothe galactic nucleus, this is the first report of significant hard x-rayemission from within the inner 10' of the galaxy and a contribution from thegalactic center supermassive black hole itself cannot be excluded. here wediscuss the results obtained and the perspectives for future observations ofthe galactic nucleus with integral and other observatories

astro-ph;0410688	hard x-ray emission clumps in the gamma-cygni supernova remnant: an  integral-isgri view	spatially resolved images of the galactic supernova remnant g78.2+2.1(gamma-cygni) in hard x-ray energy bands from 25 kev to 120 kev are obtainedwith the ibis-isgri imager aboard the international gamma-ray astrophysicslaboratory integral. the images are dominated by localized clumps of about tenarcmin in size. the flux of the most prominent north-western (nw) clump is (1.7+/- 0.4) 10^{-11} erg/cm^2/s in the 25-40 kev band. the observed x-ray fluxesare in agreement with extrapolations of soft x-ray imaging observations ofgamma-cygni by asca gis and spatially unresolved rxte pca data. the positionsof the hard x-ray clumps correlate with bright patches of optical lineemission, possibly indicating the presence of radiative shock waves in ashocked cloud. the observed spatial structure and spectra are consistent withmodel predictions of hard x-ray emission from nonthermal electrons acceleratedby a radiative shock in a supernova interacting with an interstellar cloud, butthe powerful stellar wind of the o9v star hd 193322 is a plausible candidatefor the nw source as well.

astro-ph;0505191	integral igr j18135-1751=hess j1813-178: a new cosmic high energy  accelerator from kev to tev	we report the discovery of a soft gamma ray source, namely igr j18135-1751,detected with the ibis imager on board the integral satellite. the source ispersistent and has a 20-100 kev luminosity of $\sim$5.7 $\times$ 10$^{34}$ ergs$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 4kpc). this source is coincident with one ofthe eight unidentified objects recently reported by the hess collaboration aspart of the first tev survey of the inner part of the galaxy. two of these newsources found along the galactic plane, hess j1813-178 and hess j1614-518, haveno obvious lower energy counterpart, a fact that motivated the suggestion thatthey might be dark cosmic ray accelerators. hess j1813-178 has a stronglyabsorbed x-ray counterpart, the asca source agps273.4-17.8, showing a power lawspectrum with photon index $\sim$ 1.8 and a total (galactic plus intrinsic)absorption corresponding to n$_h$ $\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. wehypothesize that the source is a pulsar wind nebula embedded in its supernovaremnant. the lack of x/gamma-ray variability, the radio morphology and the ascaspectrum are all compatible with this interpretation. in any case we rule outthe hypothesis that hess j1813-178 belongs to a new class of tev objects orthat it is a cosmic "dark particle" accelerator.

astro-ph;0509290	gamma-ray continuum emission from the inner galactic region as observed  with integral/spi	the diffuse continuum emission from the galactic plane in the energy range18-1000 kev has been studied using 16 ms of data from the spi instrument onintegral. with such an exposure we can exploit the imaging properties of spi toachieve a good separation of point sources from the various diffuse components.using a candidate-source catalogue derived with ibis on integral and a numberof sky distribution models we obtained spectra resolved in galactic longitude.we can identify spectral components of a diffuse continuum of power law shapewith index about 1.7, a positron annihilation component with a continuum frompositronium and the line at 511 kev, and a second, roughly power-law componentfrom detected point sources. our analysis confirms the concentration ofpositron annihilation emission in the inner region (|l|&lt;10), the disk(10&lt;|l|&lt;30) being at least a factor 7 weaker in this emission. the power-lawcomponent in contrast drops by only a factor 2, showing a quite differentlongitude distribution and spatial origin. detectable sources constitute about90% of the total galactic emission between 20 and 60 kev, but have a steeperspectrum than the diffuse emission, their contribution to the total emissiondropping rapidly to a small fraction at higher energies. in the spi energyrange the flux is lower than found by osse, probably due to the more completeaccounting for sources by spi. the power-law emission is difficult to explainas of interstellar origin, inverse compton giving at most 10%, and instead apopulation of unresolved point sources is proposed as a possible origin, axpswith their spectra hardening above 100 kev being plausible candidates. wepresent a broadband spectrum of the emission.

astro-ph;0510084	spi/integral observation of the galactic central radian: contribution of  discrete sources and implication for the diffuse emission	the integral observatory has been performing a deep survey of the galacticcentral radian since 2003, with the goal of both extracting a catalog ofsources and gaining insight into the galactic diffuse emission. this paperconcentrates on the estimation of the total point sources emissioncontribution. it is now clear that unresolved point sources contribute to theobserved diffuse emission; the increasing sensitivity of instruments with timehas lead to a steady decrease in estimates of this ``diffuse emission''.  we have analysed the first year data obtained with the spectrometer andimager spi on board integral. first, a catalog of 63 hard x-ray sourcesdetected, time-averaged, during our 2003 galactic plane survey, is derived.second, after extracting the spectra of the sources detected by spi, theircombined contribution is compared to the total (resolved and unresolved)emission from the galactic ridge. the data analysis is complex: it requires usto split the total emission into several components, as discrete sources anddiffuse emission are superimposed in spi data. the main result is that pointsource emission dominates in the hard x-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray domain, andcontributes around 90 % of the total emission around 100 kev, while above 250kev, diffuse electron-positron annihilation, through its three-photonpositronium continuum with a positronium fraction $\sim$ 0.97 and the 511 kevelectron-positron line, dominates over the sources.

astro-ph;0512627	integral detection of hard x-rays from ngc 6334: nonthermal emission  from colliding winds or an agn?	we report the detection of hard x-ray emission from the field of thestar-forming region ngc 6334 with the the international gamma-ray astrophysicslaboratory integral. the jem-x monitor and isgri imager aboard integral andchandra acis imager were used to construct 3-80 kev images and spectra of ngc6334. the 3-10 kev and 10-35 kev images made with jem-x show a complexstructure of extended emission from ngc 6334. the isgri source detected in theenergy ranges 20-40 kev and 40-80 kev coincides with the ngc 6334 ridge. the20-60 kev flux from the source is (1.8+-0.37)*10(-11) erg cm(-2) s(-1).spectral analysis of the source revealed a hard power-law component with aphoton index about 1. the observed x-ray fluxes are in agreement withextrapolations of x-ray imaging observations of ngc 6334 by chandra acis andasca gis. the x-ray data are consistent with two very different physicalmodels. a probable scenario is emission from a heavily absorbed, compact andhard chandra source that is associated with the agn candidate radio source ngc6334b. another possible model is the extended chandra source of nonthermalemission from ngc 6334 that can also account for the hard x-ray emissionobserved by integral. the origin of the emission in this scenario is due toelectron acceleration in energetic outflows from massive early type stars. thepossibility of emission from a young supernova remnant, as suggested by earlierinfrared observations of ngc 6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44tilines.

astro-ph;0611646	xmm-newton observations of hess j1813-178 reveal a composite supernova  remnant	we present x-ray and 12co(j=1-0) observations of the very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray source hess j1813-178 with the aim of understanding the origin of thegamma-ray emission. using this dataset we are able to undertake spectral andmorphological studies of the x-ray emission from this object with greaterprecision than previous studies. nanten 12co(j=1-0) data are used to search forcorrelations of the gamma-ray emission with molecular clouds which could act astarget material for gamma-ray production in a hadronic scenario. the nanten12co(j=1-0) observations show a giant molecular cloud of mass 2.5 10^5m$_{\sun}$ at a distance of 4 kpc in the vicinity of hess j1813-178. eventhough there is no direct positional coincidence, this giant cloud might haveinfluenced the evolution of the gamma-ray source and its surroundings. thex-ray data show a highly absorbed non-thermal x-ray emitting object coincidentwith the previously known asca source ax j1813-178 showing a compact core andan extended tail towards the north-east, located in the centre of the radioshell-type supernova remnant (snr) g12.82-0.2. this central object showsmorphological and spectral resemblance to a pulsar wind nebula (pwn) and wetherefore consider that the object is very likely to be a composite snr. wediscuss the scenario in which the gamma-rays originate in the shell of the snrand the one in which they originate in the central object. we demonstrate, thatin order to connect the core x-ray emission to the vhe gamma-ray emissionelectrons have to be accelerated to energies of at least 1 pev.
