0902.1101	an outflow origin of the [neii] emission in the t tau triplet	(note: this is a shortened version of the original "structured" (a&amp;a format)abstract.) the 12.81 micrometer [neii] line has recently gained interest as apotential tracer of gas in the tenuous surface layers of circumstellar disks.the line has been detected using the spitzer space telescope in many youngstars, yet these observations neiter spatially nor spectrally resolve the [neiiemission, leaving the nature of the emission mechanism unclear. both an originin an x-ray irradiated disk surface and an origin in strong, dissociativeshocks have been proposed.  we have performed a high spatial and spectral resolution (0.4 arcsec,r=30000) study of the t tau triplet. this system contains three young starswith disks, at least one strong x-ray source (t tau n), and diffuse regions ofshocked gas surrounding the system on a scale of a few arcseconds.  we find that the dominant component of [neii] emission is centered on t tau sand has a spatial extent of approximately 1.1 arcseconds, which is much largerthan the disks in t tau s. we detect spatially extended red-shifted emission nwof the system and fainter blue-shifted emission to the se, which we associatewith the n-s outflow from t tau s. only a small fraction of the [neii] emissionappears to be directly related to the x-ray bright northern component. wepropose [neii] emission in jets as a major factor causing the observed largescatter in the x-ray luminosity vs. [neii] luminosity relation. we argue that ttau s is the driving source of the t tau "nw-blob"

0904.3078	x-ray spectroscopy of stars	(abridged) non-degenerate stars of essentially all spectral classes are softx-ray sources. low-mass stars on the cooler part of the main sequence and theirpre-main sequence predecessors define the dominant stellar population in thegalaxy by number. their x-ray spectra are reminiscent, in the broadest sense,of x-ray spectra from the solar corona. x-ray emission from cool stars isindeed ascribed to magnetically trapped hot gas analogous to the solar coronalplasma. coronal structure, its thermal stratification and geometric extent canbe interpreted based on various spectral diagnostics. new features have beenidentified in pre-main sequence stars; some of these may be related toaccretion shocks on the stellar surface, fluorescence on circumstellar disksdue to x-ray irradiation, or shock heating in stellar outflows. massive, hotstars clearly dominate the interaction with the galactic interstellar medium:they are the main sources of ionizing radiation, mechanical energy and chemicalenrichment in galaxies. high-energy emission permits to probe some of the mostimportant processes at work in these stars, and put constraints on their mostpeculiar feature: the stellar wind. here, we review recent advances in ourunderstanding of cool and hot stars through the study of x-ray spectra, inparticular high-resolution spectra now available from xmm-newton and chandra.we address issues related to coronal structure, flares, the composition ofcoronal plasma, x-ray production in accretion streams and outflows, x-rays fromsingle ob-type stars, massive binaries, magnetic hot objects and evolved wrstars.

0906.2428	chandra and spitzer imaging of the infrared cluster in ngc 2071	we present results of a sensitive chandra x-ray observation and spitzermid-ir observations of the infrared cluster lying north of the ngc 2071reflection nebula in the orion b molecular cloud. we focus on the dense clustercore known as ngc 2071-ir which contains at least nine ir sources within a 40 x40 arcsecond region. this region shows clear signs of active star formationincluding powerful molecular outflows, herbig-haro objects, and both oh and h2omasers. we use spitzer irac images to aid in x-ray source identification and todetermine yso classes using mid-ir colors. spitzer irac colors show that theluminous source irs 1 is a class i protostar. irs 1 is believed to be driving apowerful bipolar molecular outflow and may be an embedded b-type star or itsprogenitor. its x-ray spectrum reveals a fluorescent fe emission line at 6.4kev, arising in cold material near the protostar. the line is present even inthe absence of large flares, raising questions about the nature of the ionizingmechanism responsible for producing the 6.4 kev fluorescent line. chandra alsodetects x-ray sources at or near the positions of irs 2, irs 3, irs 4, and irs6 and a variable x-ray source coincident with the radio source vla 1, locatedjust 2 arcsec north of irs 1. no ir data are yet available to determine a ysoclassification for vla 1, but its high x-ray absorption shows that it is evenmore deeply-embedded than irs 1, suggesting that it could be an even younger,less-evolved protostar.

0910.0058	effects of x-ray irradiation and disk flaring on the [neii] 12.8 micron  emission from young stellar objects	the [ne ii] fine-structure emission line at 12.8 micron has been detected inseveral young stellar objects (yso) spectra. this line is thought to beproduced by x-ray irradiation of the warm protoplanetary disk atmospheres,however the observational correlation between [ne ii] luminosities and measuredx-ray luminosities shows a large scatter. such spread limits the utility ofthis line as a probe of the gaseous phase of disks, as several authors havesuggested pollution by outflows as a probable cause of the observed scatter. inthis work we explore the possibility that the large variations in the observed[ne ii] luminosity may be caused instead by different star-disk parameters. inparticular we study the effects that the hardness of the irradiating source andthe structure (flaring) of the disk have on the luminosity and spectral profileof the [ne ii] 12.8 micron line. we find that varying these parameter canindeed cause up to an order of magnitude variation in the emission luminositieswhich may explain the scatter observed, although our models predict somewhatsmaller luminosities than those recently reported by other authors who observedthe line with the spitzer space telescope. our models also show that thehardness of the spectrum has only a limited (undetectable) effect on the lineprofiles, while changes in the flaring power of the disk significantly affectthe size of the [ne ii] emission region and, as a consequence, its lineprofile. in particular we suggest that broad line profiles centred on thestellar radial velocity may be indicative of flat disks seen at largeinclination angles.

0707.1882	a chandra x-ray detection of the l dwarf binary kelu-1: simultaneous  chandra and very large array observations	magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs, as measured in x-rays and h$\alpha$,shows a steep decline after spectral type m7-m8. so far, no l dwarf has beendetected in x-rays. in contrast, l dwarfs may have higher radio activity than mdwarfs. we observe l and t dwarfs simultaneously in x-rays and radio todetermine their level of magnetic activity in the context of the generaldecline of magnetic activity with cooler effective temperatures. the field ldwarf binary kelu-1 was observed simultaneously with chandra and the very largearray. kelu-1ab was detected in x-rays with $l_{\rm x} = 2.9_{-1.3}^{+1.8}\times 10^{25}$ erg/s, while it remained undetected in the radio down to a $3\sigma$ limit of $l_{\rm r} \leq 1.4 \times 10^{13}$ erg/s/hz. we argue that,whereas the x-ray and h$\alpha$ emissions decline in ultracool dwarfs withdecreasing effective temperature, the radio luminosity stays (more or less)constant across m and early-l dwarfs. the radio surface flux or the luminositymay better trace magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs than the ratio of theluminosity to the bolometric luminosity. deeper radio observations (and atshort frequencies) are required to determine if and when the cut-off in radioactivity occurs in l and t dwarfs, and what kind of emission mechanism takesplace in ultracool dwarfs.

0707.2857	coronal abundances of x-ray bright pre-main sequence stars in the taurus  molecular cloud	we studied the thermal properties and chemical composition of the x-rayemitting plasma of a sample of bright members of the taurus molecular cloud toinvestigate possible differences among classical and weak-lined t tauri starsand possible dependences of the abundances on the stellar activity level and/oron the presence of accretion/circumstellar material. we used medium-resolutionx-ray spectra obtained with the sensitive epic/pn camera in order to analysethe possible sample. the pn spectra of 20 bright (l_x ~ 10^30 - 10^31 erg/s)taurus members, with at least ~ 4500 counts, were fitted using thermal modelsof optically thin plasma with two components and variable abundances of o, ne,mg, si, s, ar, ca, and fe. extensive preliminary investigations were employedto study the performances of the pn detectors regarding abundancedeterminations, and finally to check the results of the fittings. we found thatthe observed x-ray emission of the studied stars can be attributed to coronalplasma having similar thermal properties and chemical composition both in theclassical and in the weak-lined t tauri stars. the results of the fittings didnot show evidence for correlations of the abundance patterns with activity oraccretion/disk presence. the iron abundance of these active stars issignificantly lower than (~ 0.2 of) the solar photospheric value. an indicationof slightly different coronal properties in stars with different spectral typeis found from this study. g-type and early k-type stars have, on average,slightly higher fe abundances (fe ~ 0.24 solar) with respect to stars withlater spectral type (fe ~ 0.15 solar), confirming previous findings fromhigh-resolution x-ray spectroscopy; stars of the former group are also found tohave, on average, hotter coronae.

1005.4459	the disk-bearing young star im lup	classical t tauri stars (ctts) differ in their x-ray signatures from olderpre-main sequence stars, e.g. weak-lined tts (wtts). ctts show a soft excessand deviations from the low-density coronal limit in the he-like triplets. wetest whether these features correlate with accretion or the presence of a diskby observing im lup, a disk-bearing object apparently in transition betweenctts and wtts without obvious accretion. we analyse a chandra grating spectrumand additional xmm-newton data of im lup and accompanying optical spectra, someof them taken simultaneously to the x-ray observations. we fit the x-rayemission lines and decompose the ha emission line in different components. inx-rays im lup has a bright and hot active corona, where elements of lowfirst-ionisation potential are depleted. the he-like ne ix triplet is in thelow-density state, but due to the small number of counts a high-densityscenario cannot be excluded on the 90% confidence level. in all x-rayproperties im lup resembles a main-sequence star, but it is also compatiblewith ctts signatures on the 90% confidence level, thus we cannot decide if thesoft excess and deviations from the low-density coronal limit in the he-liketriplets in ctts require accretion or only the presence of a disk. im lup ischromospherically active, which explains most of the emission in ha. despiteits low equivalent width, the complexity of the ha line profile is reminiscentof ctts. we present an estimate for the mass accretion rate of 10e-11 msun/yr.

1006.2848	on the origin of [neii] 12.81 micron emission from pre-main sequence  stars: disks, jets, and accretion	(abridged) we have conducted a study of [neii] line emission based on asample of 92 pre-main sequence stars mostly belonging to the infrared class ii,including 13 accreting transition disk objects and 14 objects driving jets andoutflows. we find several significant correlations between l[neii] and stellarparameters, in particular lx and the wind mass loss rate, dm/dt. mostcorrelations are, however, strongly dominated by systematic scatter. whilethere is a positive correlation between l[neii] and lx, the stellar massaccretion rate, dmacc/dt, induces a correlation only if we combine the largelydifferent subsets of jet sources and stars without jets. our results suggestthat l[neii] is bi-modally distributed, with separate distributions for the twosubsamples. the jet sources show systematically higher l[neii], by 1-2 ordersof magnitude with respect to objects without jets. jet-driving stars also tendto show higher mass accretion rates. we therefore hypothesize that the trendwith dmacc/dt reflects a trend with dm/dt that is more physically relevant for[neii] emission. l[neii] measured for objects without known outflows and jetsis found to agree with simplified calculations of [neii] emission from disksurface layers if the measured stellar x-rays are responsible for heating andionizing of the gas. the large scatter in l[neii] may be introduced byvariations of disk properties and the irradiation spectrum, as previouslysuggested. the systematically enhanced [neii] flux from jet sources clearlysuggests a role for the jets themselves, as previously demonstrated by aspatially resolved observation of the outflow system in the t tau triple.

1105.5125	chandra evidence for extended x-ray structure in ry tau	we report results of a sensitive chandra acis-s observation of the classicalt tauri star ry tau. previous studies have shown that it drives a spectacularbipolar jet whose blueshifted component is traced optically along p.a.approximately 295 degrees at separations of 1.5 - 31 arcseconds from the star.complex x-ray emission is revealed, including a very soft non-variable spectralcomponent (some of which may originate in shocks), a superhot flaring component(t &gt;= 100 mk), and faint extended structure near the star. the structure isvisible in deconvolved images and extends northwestward out to a separation of1.7 arcseconds, overlapping the inner part of the optical jet. image analysissuggests that most of the extension is real, but some contamination bypsf-induced structure within the central arcsecond may be present. thepredicted temperature for a shock-heated jet based on jet speed and shock speedestimates from optical measurements is too low to explain the extended x-raystructure. either higher speed material within the jet has escaped opticaldetection or other mechanisms besides shock-heating are involved. alternativemechanisms that could produce higher temperature plasma at small offsets to thenorthwest of ry tau include magnetic heating in the jet, hot plasmoids ejectedat high speeds, or x-ray emission from a putative close companion whosepresence has been inferred from hipparcos variations.

1206.4889	estimating the frequency of extremely energetic solar events, based on  solar, stellar, lunar, and terrestrial records	the most powerful explosions on the sun [...] drive the most severespace-weather storms. proxy records of flare energies based on seps inprinciple may offer the longest time base to study infrequent large events. weconclude that one suggested proxy, nitrate concentrations in polar ice cores,does not map reliably to sep events. concentrations of select radionuclidesmeasured in natural archives may prove useful in extending the time interval ofdirect observations up to ten millennia, but as their calibration to solarflare fluences depends on multiple poorly known properties and processes, theseproxies cannot presently be used to help determine the flare energy frequencydistribution. being thus limited to the use of direct flare observations, weevaluate the probabilities of large-energy solar explosions by combining solarflare observations with an ensemble of stellar flare observations. we concludethat solar flare energies form a relatively smooth distribution from smallevents to large flares, while flares on magnetically-active, young sun-likestars have energies and frequencies markedly in excess of strong solar flares,even after an empirical scaling with the mean activity level of these stars. inorder to empirically quantify the frequency of uncommonly large solar flaresextensive surveys of stars of near-solar age need to be obtained, such as isfeasible with the kepler satellite. because the likelihood of flares largerthan approximately x30 remains empirically unconstrained, we present indirectarguments, based on records of sunspots and on statistical arguments, thatsolar flares in the past four centuries have likely not substantially exceededthe level of the largest flares observed in the space era, and that there is atmost about a 10% chance of a flare larger than about x30 in the next 30 years.

0712.1330	discovery of a bipolar x-ray jet from the t tauri star dg tau	we have obtained and analyzed chandra acis-s observations of the stronglyaccreting classical t tauri star dg tau. our principal goals are to map theimmediate environment of the star to characterize possible extended x-raysformed in the jet, and to re-visit the anomalous, doubly absorbed x-rayspectrum of dg tau itself. we combine our new acis-s data with a data setpreviously obtained. the data are superimposed to obtain flux and hardnessimages. separate x-ray spectra are extracted for dg tau and areas outside itspoint spread function. we detect a prominent x-ray jet at a position angle ofpa ~225 deg (tentatively suggested by guedel et al. 2005), coincident with theoptical jet axis. we also identify a counter jet at pa = 45 deg. the x-ray jetsare detected out to a distance of ~5" from the star, their sources beingextended at the acis-s resolution. the jet spectra are soft, with a best-fitelectron temperature of 3.4 mk. we find evidence for excess absorption of thecounter jet. the spectrum of the dg tau point source shows two components withlargely different temperatures and absorption column densities. the similartemperatures and small absorbing gas columns of the jet sources and the softcomponent of the "stellar" source suggest that these sources are related,produced either by shocks or by magnetic heating in the jets. cooling estimatessuggest that the pressure in the hot gas contributes to jet expansion. the hard"stellar" component, on the other hand, is associated with a stellar corona ormagnetosphere. the excessive photoelectric absorption of this componentsuggests the presence of dust-depleted accretion streams above coronal magneticfields.

1308.1578	digit survey of far-infrared lines from protoplanetary disks i	[abridged] we present far-infrared spectroscopic observations of pms starstaken with herschel/pacs as part of the digit key project. the sample includes22 herbig aebe and 8 t tauri sources. multiple atomic fine structure andmolecular lines are detected at the source position: [oi], [cii], co, oh, h_2o,ch^+. the most common feature is the [oi] 63micron line detected in almost allof the sources followed by oh. in contrast with co, oh is detected toward bothherbig aebe groups (flared and non-flared sources). an isothermal lte slabmodel fit to the oh lines indicates column densities of 10^13 &lt; n_oh &lt; 10^16cm^-2, emitting radii 15 &lt; r &lt; 100 au and excitation temperatures 100 &lt; t_ex &lt;400 k. the oh emission thus comes from a warm layer in the disk at intermediatestellar distances. warm h_2o emission is detected through multiple lines towardthe t tauri systems as 205, dg tau, s cra and rno 90 and three herbig aebesystems hd 104237, hd 142527, hd 163296 (through line stacking). overall,herbig aebe sources have higher oh/h_2o abundance ratios across the disk thando t tauri disks, from near- to far-infrared wavelengths. far-infrared ch^+emission is detected toward hd 100546 and hd 97048. the slab model suggestsmoderate excitation (t_ex ~ 100 k) and compact (r ~ 60 au) emission in the caseof hd 100546. the [cii] emission is spatially extended in all sources where theline is detected. this suggests that not all [cii] emission is associated withthe disk and that there is a substantial contribution from diffuse materialaround the young stars. the flux ratios of the atomic fine structure lines areconsistent with a disk origin for the oxygen lines for most of the sources.

1407.8174	astrophysical conditions for planetary habitability	with the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets and a potentially huge number ofearth-like planets waiting to be discovered, the conditions for theirhabitability have become a focal point in exoplanetary research. the classicalpicture of habitable zones primarily relies on the stellar flux allowing liquidwater to exist on the surface of an earth-like planet with a suitableatmosphere. however, numerous further stellar and planetary propertiesconstrain habitability. apart from "geophysical" processes depending on theinternal structure and composition of a planet, a complex array ofastrophysical factors additionally determine habitability. among these,variable stellar uv, euv, and x-ray radiation, stellar and interplanetarymagnetic fields, ionized winds, and energetic particles control theconstitution of upper planetary atmospheres and their physical and chemicalevolution. short- and long-term stellar variability necessitates fulltime-dependent studies to understand planetary habitability at any point intime. furthermore, dynamical effects in planetary systems and transport ofwater to earth-like planets set fundamentally important constraints. we willreview these astrophysical conditions for habitability under the crucialaspects of the long-term evolution of stellar properties, the consequentextreme conditions in the early evolutionary phase of planetary systems, andthe important interplay between properties of the host star and its planets.

astro-ph;0506241	an xmm-newton study of the coronae of $\sigma^2$ coronae borealis	(abridged) we present results of xmm-newton observations of the rs cvn binary$\sigma^2$ coronae borealis. the rgs and epic mos2 spectra were simultaneouslyfitted with collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models to determinecoronal abundances of various elements. contrary to the solar first ionizationpotential (fip) effect in which elements with a low fip are overabundant in thecorona compared to the solar photosphere, and contrary to the ``inverse'' fipeffect observed in several active rs cvn binaries, coronal abundance ratios in$\sigma^2$ crb show a complex pattern as supported by similar findings in thechandra hetgs analysis of $\sigma^2$ crb with a different methodology (osten etal. 2003). low-fip elements ($&lt;10$ ev) have their abundance ratios relative tofe consistent with the solar photospheric ratios, whereas high-fip elementshave their abundance ratios increase with increasing fip. we find that thecoronal fe abundance is consistent with the stellar photospheric value,indicating that there is no metal depletion in $\sigma^2$ crb. however, weobtain a higher fe absolute abundance than in osten et al. (2003). except forar and s, our absolute abundances are about 1.5 times larger than thosereported by osten et al. (2003). however, a comparison of their model with ourxmm-newton data (and vice versa) shows that both models work adequately ingeneral. we find, therefore, no preference for one methodology over the otherto derive coronal abundances. despite the systematic discrepancy in absoluteabundances, our abundance ratios are very close to those obtained by osten etal. (2003). finally, we confirm the measurement of a low density in \ion{o}{7}($&lt; 4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), but could not confirm the higher densitiesmeasured in spectral lines formed at higher temperatures.

astro-ph;0510859	x-ray spectral variability during an outburst in v1118 ori	we present results from a multi-wavelength campaign to monitor the 2005outburst of the low-mass young star v1118 ori. although our campaign covers thex-ray, optical, infrared, and radio regimes, we focus in this letter on theproperties of the x-ray emission in v1118 ori during the first few months afterthe optical outburst. chandra and xmm-newton detected v1118 ori at three epochsin early 2005. the x-ray flux and luminosity stayed similar within a factor oftwo, and at the same level as in a pre-outburst observation in 2002. thehydrogen column density showed no evidence for variation from its modestpre-outburst value of $n_\mathrm{h} \sim 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. however,a spectral change occurred from a dominant hot plasma ($\sim 25$ mk) in 2002and in january 2005 to a cooler plasma ($\sim 8$ mk) in february 2005 and inmarch 2005. we hypothesize that the hot magnetic loops high in the corona weredisrupted by the closing in of the accretion disk due to the increasedaccretion rate during the outburst, whereas the lower cooler loops wereprobably less affected and became the dominant coronal component.

astro-ph;0608651	a statistical analysis of x-ray variability in pre-main sequence objects  of the taurus molecular cloud	this work is part of a systematic x-ray survey of the taurus star formingcomplex with xmm-newton. we study the time series of all x-ray sourcesassociated with taurus members, to statistically characterize their x-rayvariability, and compare the results to those for pre-main sequence stars inthe orion nebula cluster and to expectations arising from a model where all thex-ray emission is the result of a large number of stochastically occurringflares. we find that roughly half of the detected x-ray sources showvariability above our sensitivity limit, and in ~ 26 % of the cases thisvariability is recognized as flares. variability is more frequently detected athard than at soft energies. the variability statistics of ctts and wtts areundistinguishable, suggesting a common (coronal) origin for their x-rayemission. we have for the first time applied a rigorous maximum likelihoodmethod in the analysis of the number distribution of flare energies on pre-mainsequence stars. in its differential form this distribution follows a power-lawwith index alpha = 2.4 +- 0.5, in the range typically observed on late-typestars and the sun. the flare energy distribution is probably steep enough toexplain the heating of stellar coronae by nano-flares (alpha &gt; 2), albeitassociated with a rather large uncertainty that leaves some doubt on thisconclusion.

astro-ph;0608696	x-ray emission from the young brown dwarfs of the taurus molecular cloud	the xmm-newton extended survey of the tmc (xest) is a large program designedto systematically investigate the x-ray properties of young stellar/substellarobjects in the tmc. in particular, the area surveyed by 15 xmm-newton pointings(of which three are archival observations), supplemented with one archivalchandra observation, allows us to study 17 bds with m spectral types. half ofthis sample (9 out of 17 bds) is detected; 7 bds are detected here for thefirst time in x-rays. we observed a flare from one bd. we confirm severalprevious findings on bd x-ray activity: a log-log relation between x-ray andbolometric luminosity for stars (with l*&lt;10 lsun) and bds detected in x-rays; ashallow log-log relation between x-ray fractional luminosity and mass; alog-log relation between x-ray fractional luminosity and effective temperature;a log-log relation between x-ray surface flux and effective temperature. wefind no significant log-log correlation between the x-ray fractional luminosityand ew(halpha). accreting and nonaccreting bds have a similar x-ray fractionalluminosity. the median x-ray fractional luminosity of nonaccreting bds is about4 times lower than the mean saturation value for rapidly rotating low-massfield stars. our tmc bds have higher x-ray fractional luminosity than bds inthe chandra orion ultradeep project. the x-ray fractional luminosity declinesfrom low-mass stars to m-type bds, and as a sample, the bds are less efficientx-ray emitters than low-mass stars. we thus conclude that while the bdatmospheres observed here are mostly warm enough to sustain coronal activity, atrend is seen that may indicate its gradual decline due to the drop inphotospheric ionization degree (abridged).

astro-ph;0609160	the xmm-newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud (xest)	(abridged:) the xmm-newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud(xest) surveys the most populated ~5 square degrees of the taurus starformation region, using the xmm-newton x-ray observatory to study the thermalstructure, variability, and long-term evolution of hot plasma, to investigatethe magnetic dynamo, and to search for new potential members of theassociation. many targets are also studied in the optical, and high-resolutionx-ray grating spectroscopy has been obtained for selected bright sources. thex-ray spectra have been coherently analyzed with two different thermal models(2-component thermal model, and a continuous emission measure distributionmodel). we present overall correlations with fundamental stellar parametersthat were derived from the previous literature. a few detections from chandraobservations have been added. the present overview paper introduces the projectand provides the basic results from the x-ray analysis of all sources detectedin the xest survey.comprehensive tables summarize the stellar properties of alltargets surveyed. the survey goes deeper than previous x-ray surveys of taurusby about an order of magnitude and for the first time systematically accessesvery faint and strongly absorbed tmc objects. we find a detection rate of 85%and 98% for classical and weak-line t tau stars (ctts resp. wtts), and identifyabout half of the surveyed protostars and brown dwarfs. overall, 136 out of 169surveyed stellar systems are detected. we describe an x-ray luminosity vs. masscorrelation, discuss the distribution of x-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratios,and show evidence for lower x-ray luminosities in ctts compared to wtts.detailed analysis (e.g., variability, rotation-activity relations, influence ofaccretion on x-rays) will be discussed in a series of accompanying papers.

astro-ph;0609389	physics of stellar coronae	stellar coronae, defined by the ensemble of magnetic field structures abovestellar photospheres and chromospheres together with their thermal ornon-thermal plasma content, play an important role in our understanding ofstellar magnetic fields, the stellar magnetic dynamo, and interactions betweena star and its environment. the most important wavelength regions from which wehave learned diagnostically on stellar coronae include the radio range and thex-ray domain. the former is sensitive to accelerated electrons in magneticfields, and that has provided the only direct means of imaging stellar coronalstructure, through very long baseline interferometry. the soft x-ray diagnosticpower has been instrumental for our understanding of physical processes in thehot, magnetically trapped coronal plasma, and the recent advent ofhigh-resolution x-ray spectroscopy is now accessing physical parameters ofcoronal plasma directly. the adjacent extreme ultraviolet range containsdiagnostics relevant for the same temperature range as x-rays. the presentchapter provides a ``stellar astronomer's view'' of magnetic coronae,summarizing basic physical processes relevant for our understanding ofradio/x-ray observations of coronal stars.

astro-ph;0610456	the first high-resolution x-ray spectrum of a herbig star: the case of  ab aurigae	we present the first high-resolution x-ray spectrum of a prototypical herbigstar (ab aurigae), measure and interpret various spectral features, and compareour results with model predictions. we use x-ray spectroscopy data fromxmm-newton. the spectra are interpreted using thermal, optically thin emissionmodels with variable element abundances and a photoelectric absorptioncomponent. we interpret line flux ratios in he-like triplet of o vii as afunction of electron density and the uv radiation field. we use the nearbyco-eval classical t tauri star su aur as a comparison. ab aurigae reveals asoft x-ray spectrum, most plasma being concentrated at 1-6 mk. the he-liketriplet reveals no signatures of increased densities and there are no clearindications for strong abundance anomalies. the light curve displays modulatedvariability, with a period of ~ 42 hr. it is unlikely that a nearby, undetectedlower-mass companion is the source of the x-rays. accretion shocks close to thestar should be irradiated by the photosphere, leading to alteration in thehe-like triplet fluxes of o vii, which we do not measure. also, no indicationsfor high densities are found, although the mass accretion rate is presentlyunknown. emission from wind shocks is unlikely, given the weak radiationpressure. a possible explanation would be a solar-like magnetic corona.magnetically confined winds provide a very promising alternative. the x-rayperiod is indeed close to periods previously measured in optical lines from thewind.

astro-ph;0611024	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of t tauri stars in the taurus-auriga  complex	differences have been reported between the x-ray emission of accreting andnon-accreting stars. some observations have suggested that accretion shockscould be responsible for part of the x-ray emission in classical t tauri stars(ctts). we present high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of nine pre-main sequencestars in order to test the proposed spectroscopic differences between accretingand non-accreting pre-main sequence stars. we use x-ray spectroscopy from thexmm-newton reflection grating spectrometers and the epic instruments. weinterpret the spectra using optically thin thermal models with variableabundances, together with an absorption column density. for bp tau and ab aurwe derive electron densities from the o vii triplets. using the o vii/o viiicount ratios as a diagnostic for cool plasma, we find that ctts display a softexcess (with equivalent electron temperatures of ~ 2.5-3 mk) when compared withwtts or zero-age main-sequence stars. although the o vii triplet in bp tau isconsistent with a high electron density (3.4 x 10^11 cm^-3), we find a lowdensity for the accreting herbig star ab aur (n_e &lt; 10^10 cm^-3). the elementabundances of accreting and non-accreting stars are similar. the ne abundanceis found to be high (4-6 times the fe abundance) in all k and m-type stars. incontrast, for the three g-type stars (su aur, hd 283572, and hp tau/g2), wefind an enhanced fe abundance (0.4-0.8 times solar photospheric values)compared to later-type stars. adding the results from our sample to formerhigh-resolution studies of t tauri stars, we find a soft excess in allaccreting stars, but in none of the non-accretors. on the other hand, highelectron density and high ne/fe abundance ratios do not seem to be present inall accreting pre-main sequence stars.

astro-ph;0612338	x-ray emission from t tauri stars and the role of accretion: inferences  from the xmm-newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud	t tau stars display different x-ray properties depending on whether they areaccreting (classical t tau stars; ctts) or not (weak-line t tau stars; wtts).we use data from the xmm-newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud(xest) to study differences in x-ray properties between ctts and wtts. weperform correlation and regression analysis between x-ray parameters andstellar properties. we confirm the existence of a x-ray luminosity (lx) vs.mass (m) relation, lx ~ m^(1.69 +/- 0.11), but this relation is a consequenceof x-ray saturation and a mass vs. bolometric luminosity (l*) relation for thetts with an average age of 2.4 myr. x-ray saturation indicates lx = const l*,although the constant is different for the two subsamples: const = 10^(-3.73+/- 0.05) for ctts and const = 10^(-3.39 +/- 0.06) for wtts. given a similar l*distribution of both samples, the x-ray luminosity function also reflects areal x-ray deficiency in ctts, by a factor of ~ 2 compared to wtts. the averageelectron temperatures tav are correlated with lx in wtts but not in ctts; cttssources are on average hotter than wtts sources. the most fundamentalproperties are the two saturation laws, indicating suppressed lx for ctts. wespeculate that some of the accreting material in ctts is cooling active regionsto temperatures that may not significantly emit in the x-ray band, and if theydo, high-resolution spectroscopy may be required to identify lines formed insuch plasma, while ccd cameras do not detect these components. the similarityof the lx vs. tav dependencies in wtts and main-sequence stars as well as theirsimilar x-ray saturation laws suggests similar physical processes for the hotplasma, i.e., heating and radiation of a magnetic corona.

astro-ph;0612589	x-rays from t tau: a test case for accreting t tauri stars	we test models for the generation of x-rays in accreting t tauri stars (tts),using x-ray data from the classical tts t tau. high-resolution spectroscopyfrom the reflection grating spectrometers on xmm-newton is used to inferelectron densities, element abundances and the thermal structure of the x-raysource. we also discuss the ultraviolet light curve obtained by the opticalmonitor, and complementary ground-based photometry. a high-resolution imagefrom chandra constrains contributions from the two companions of t tau n. thex-ray grating spectrum is rich in emission lines, but shows an unusual mixtureof features from very hot (~30 mk) and very cool (1-3 mk) plasma, both emittedby similar amounts of emission measure. the cool plasma confirms the picture ofa soft excess in the form of an enhanced ovii/oviii lya flux ratio, similar tothat previously reported for other accreting tts. diagnostics from lines formedby this plasma indicate low electron densities (&lt;~ 1e10 cm-3). the ne/feabundance ratio is consistent with a trend in pre-main sequence stars in whichthis ratio depends on spectral type, but not on accretion. on the basis of linedensity diagnostics, we conclude that the density of the cool ``soft-excess''plasma is orders of magnitude below that predicted for an accretion shock,assuming previously determined accretion rates of (3-6)e-8 m_sun/y. we arguethat loading of magnetic field lines with infalling material suppresses theheating process in a part of the corona. we thus suggest that the x-rayproduction of t tau is influenced by the accretion process although the x-raysmay not form in the bulk of the accretion footpoints.

astro-ph;0701251	on the circum(sub)stellar environment of brown dwarfs in taurus	aims : we want to investigate whether brown dwarfs (bds) form like stars orare ejected embryos. we study the presence of disks around bds in the tauruscloud, and discuss implications for substellar formation models. methods : weuse photometric measurements from the visible to the far infrared to determinethe spectral energy distributions (seds) of taurus bds. results: we use spitzercolor indices, halpha as an accretion indicator, and models fit to the seds inorder to estimate physical parameters of the disks around these bds. we studythe spatial distribution of bds with and without disks across the taurusaggregates, and we find that bds with and without disks are not distributedregularly across the taurus cloud. conclusions: we find that 48%+/- 14% oftaurus bds have a circumstellar disk signature, a ratio similar to recentresults from previous authors in other regions. we fit the seds and find thatnone of the disks around bds in taurus can be fitted convincingly with aflaring index beta = 0, indicating that heating by the central object isefficient and that the disks we observe retain a significant amount of gas. wefind that bds with disks are proportionally more numerous in the northerntaurus filament, possibly the youngest filament. we do not find such a clearsegregation for classical t tauri stars (ctts) and weak-lined t tauri stars(wtts), suggesting that, in addition to the effects of evolution, anysegregation effects could be related to the mass of the object. a by-product ofour study is to propose a recalibration of the barrado y navascues &amp; martin(2003) accretion limit in the substellar domain. the global shape of the limitfits our data points if it is raised by a factor 1.25-1.30.
