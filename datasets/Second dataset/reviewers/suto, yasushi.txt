0902.3461	on the spin-orbit misalignment of the xo-3 exoplanetary system	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 feb. 2transit of the exoplanet xo-3b. the new data show that the planetary orbitalaxis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned, as reported earlier by hebrardand coworkers. we find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes tobe 37.3 +/- 3.7 deg, as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15deg. the significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there areindications of systematic effects. xo-3b is the first exoplanet known to have ahighly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star, andas such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration ofmassive planets into close-in orbits. we revisit the statistical analysis ofspin-orbit alignment in hot-jupiter systems. assuming the stellar obliquitiesto be drawn from a single rayleigh distribution, we find the mode of thedistribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg. however, it remains the case that a modelrepresenting two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawnfrom a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropicdistribution--is favored over a single rayleigh distribution.

0910.2365	analytic description of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting  exoplanets: cross-correlation method and comparison with simulated data	we obtain analytical expressions for the velocity anomaly due to therossiter- mclaughlin effect, for the case when the anomalous radial velocity isobtained by cross-correlation with a stellar template spectrum. in the limit ofvanishing width of the stellar absorption lines, our result reduces to theformula derived by ohta et al. (2005), which is based on the first moment ofdistorted stellar lines. our new formula contains a term dependent on thestellar linewidth, which becomes important when rotational line broadening isappreciable. we generate mock transit spectra for four existing exoplanetarysystems (hd17156, tres-2, tres- 4, and hd209458) following the procedure ofwinn et al. (2005), and find that the new formula is in better agreement withthe velocity anomaly extracted from the mock data. thus, our result provides amore reliable analytical description of the velocity anomaly due to therossiter-mclaughlin effect, and explains the previously observed dependence ofthe velocity anomaly on the stellar rotation velocity.

1006.4486	impact of chandra calibration uncertainties on galaxy cluster  temperatures: application to the hubble constant	we perform a uniform, systematic analysis of a sample of 38 x-ray galaxyclusters with three different chandra calibrations. the temperatures changesystematically between calibrations. cluster temperatures change on average byroughly ~6% for the smallest changes and roughly ~13% for the more extremechanges between calibrations. we explore the effects of the changing clusterspectral properties on sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) and x-ray determinationsof the hubble constant. the hubble parameter changes by +10% and -13% betweenthe current calibration and two previous chandra calibrations, indicating thatchanges in the cluster temperature basically explain the entire change in h_0.although this work focuses on the difference in spectral properties andresultant hubble parameters between the calibrations, it is intriguing to notethat the newer calibrations favor a lower value of the hubble constant, h_0 ~60 km s-1 mpc-1, typical of results from sze/x-ray distances. both galaxyclusters themselves and the details of the instruments must be known preciselyto enable reliable precision cosmology with clusters, which will be feasiblewith combined efforts from ongoing observations and planned missions andobservatories covering a wide range of wavelengths.

1006.5492	a comparison of spectroscopic methods for detecting starlight scattered  by transiting hot jupiters, with application to subaru data for hd 209458b  and hd 189733b	the measurement of the light scattered from extrasolar planets informsatmospheric and formation models. with the discovery of many hot jupiterplanets orbiting nearby stars, this motivates the development of robust methodsof characterisation from follow up observations. in this paper we discuss twomethods for determining the planetary albedo in transiting systems. first, themost widely used method for measuring the light scattered by hot jupiters(collier cameron et al.) is investigated for application for typical echellespectra of a transiting planet system, showing that detection requires highsignal-to-noise ratio data of bright planets. secondly a new fourier analysismethod is also presented, which is model-independent and utilises the benefitsof the reduced number of unknown parameters in transiting systems. thisapproach involves solving for the planet and stellar spectra in fourier spaceby least-squares. the sensitivities of the methods are determined via montecarlo simulations for a range of planet-to-star fluxes. we find the fourieranalysis method to be better suited to the ideal case of typical observationsof a well constrained transiting system than the collier cameron et al. method.we apply the fourier analysis method for extracting the light scattered bytransiting hot jupiters from high resolution spectra to echelle spectra of hd209458 and hd 189733. unfortunately we are unable to improve on the previousupper limit of the planet-to-star flux for hd 209458b set by space-basedobservations. a 1{\sigma}upper limit on the planet-to-star flux of hd 189733bis measured in the wavelength range of 558.83-599.56 nm yielding {\epsilon} &lt;4.5 \times 10-4. improvement in the measurement of the upper limit of theplanet-to-star flux of this system, with ground-based capabilities, requiresdata with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and increased stability of thetelescope.

1102.3625	colors of a second earth ii: effects of clouds on photometric  characterization of earth-like exoplanets	as a test-bed for future investigations of directly imaged terrestrialexoplanets, we present the recovery of the surface components of the earth frommulti-band diurnal light curves obtained with the epoxi spacecraft. we findthat the presence and longitudinal distribution of ocean, soil and vegetationare reasonably well reproduced by fitting the observed color variations with asimplified model composed of a priori known albedo spectra of ocean, soil,vegetation, snow and clouds. the effect of atmosphere, including clouds, onlight scattered from surface components is modeled using a radiative transfercode. the required noise levels for future observations of exoplanets are alsodetermined. our model-dependent approach allows us to infer the presence ofmajor elements of the planet (in the case of the earth, clouds and ocean) withobservations having s/n $\gtrsim 10$ in most cases and with high confidence ifs/n $\gtrsim 20$. in addition, s/n $\gtrsim 100$ enables us to detect thepresence of components other than ocean and clouds in a fairlymodel-independent way. degradation of our inversion procedure produced by cloudcover is also quantified. while cloud cover significantly dilutes the magnitudeof color variations compared to the cloudless case, the pattern of colorchanges remains. therefore, the possibility of investigating surface featuresthrough light curve fitting remains even for exoplanets with cloud coversimilar to the earth's.

1108.4430	improved modeling of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting  exoplanets	we present an improved formula for the anomalous radial velocity of the starduring planetary transits due to the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect. theimprovement comes from a more realistic description of the stellar absorptionline profiles, taking into account stellar rotation, macroturbulence, thermalbroadening, pressure broadening, and instrumental broadening. although theformula is derived for the case in which radial velocities are measured bycross-correlation, we show through numerical simulations that the formulaaccurately describes the cases where the radial velocities are measured withthe iodine absorption-cell technique. the formula relies on prior knowledge ofthe parameters describing macroturbulence, instrumental broadening and otherbroadening mechanisms, but even 30% errors in those parameters do notsignificantly change the results in typical circumstances. we show that the newanalytic formula agrees with previous ones that had been computed on acase-by-case basis via numerical simulations. finally, as one application ofthe new formula, we reassess the impact of the differential rotation on the rmvelocity anomaly. we show that differential rotation of a rapidly rotating starmay have a significant impact on future rm observations.

(2009). in addition, an offset of ~22 m/s was observed between thetwo transit datasets. this offset could be a signal of a third body in the xo-3system, a possibility that should be checked with future observations. we alsoattempt to search for a possible signature of the stellar differential rotationin the rm data for the first time, and put weak upper limits on thedifferential rotation parameters.

0704.2949	optimizing future imaging survey of galaxies to confront dark energy and  modified gravity models	we consider the extent to which future imaging surveys of galaxies candistinguish between dark energy and modified gravity models for the origin ofthe cosmic acceleration. dynamical dark energy models may have similarexpansion rates as models of modified gravity, yet predict different growth ofstructure histories. we parameterize the cosmic expansion by the twoparameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, and the linear growth rate of density fluctuationsby linder's $\gamma$, independently. dark energy models generically predict$\gamma \approx 0.55$, while the dgp model $\gamma \approx 0.68$. to determineif future imaging surveys can constrain $\gamma$ within 20 percent (or$\delta\gamma&lt;0.1$), we perform the fisher matrix analysis for a weak lensingsurvey such as the on-going hyper suprime-cam (hsc) project. under thecondition that the total observation time is fixed, we compute the figure ofmerit (fom) as a function of the exposure time $\texp$. we find that thetomography technique effectively improves the fom, which has a broad peakaround $\texp\simeq {\rm several}\sim 10$ minutes; a shallow and wide survey ispreferred to constrain the $\gamma$ parameter. while $\delta\gamma &lt; 0.1$cannot be achieved by the hsc weak-lensing survey alone, one can improve theconstraints by combining with a follow-up spectroscopic survey like wfmosand/or future cmb observations.

1205.3233	measurements of stellar inclinations for kepler planet candidates	we present an investigation of spin-orbit angles for planetary systemcandidates reported by kepler. by combining the rotational period $p_s$inferred from the flux variation due to starspots and the projected rotationalvelocity $v\sin i_s$ and stellar radius obtained by a high resolutionspectroscopy, we attempt to estimate the inclination $i_s$ of the stellar spinaxis with respect to the line-of-sight. for transiting planetary systems, inwhich planetary orbits are edge-on seen from us, the stellar inclination $i_s$can be a useful indicator of a spin-orbit alignment/misalignment. we newlyconducted spectroscopic observations with subaru/hds for 15 koi systems, whoselightcurves show periodic flux variations. after detailed analyses of theirlightcurves and spectra, it turned out that some of them are binaries, or theflux variations are too coherent to be caused by starspots, probablyrepresenting ellipsoidal variations, and consequently we could constrainstellar inclinations $i_s$ for eight systems. among them, koi-262 and 280 arein good agreement with $i_s=90^\circ$ suggesting a spin-orbit alignment, whileat least one system, koi-261, shows a possible spin-orbit misalignment. we alsoobtain a small $i_s$ for koi-1463, but the transiting companion seems to be astar rather than a planet. the results for koi-257, 269, 367, and 974 areambiguous, and can be explained with either misalignments or moderatedifferential rotation. since our method can be applied to any system havingstarspots regardless of the planet size, future observations will allow for theexpansion of the parameter space in which the spin-orbit relations areinvestigated.

0711.2304	a technique for detecting starlight scattered from transiting extrasolar  planets with application to hd 209458b	we present a new technique for detecting scattered starlight from transiting,close-orbiting extrasolar giant planets (cegps) that has the virtues ofsimplicity, robustness, linearity, and model-independence. given a series ofstellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goalis to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative tothe component coming directly from the star. we use two complementarystrategies, both of which rely on the predictable doppler shifts of bothcomponents and on combining the results from many spectral lines and manyexposures. in the first strategy, we identify segments of the stellar spectrumthat are free of direct absorption lines and add them after doppler-shiftinginto the planetary frame. in the second strategy, we compare the distributionof equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. bothstrategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled dopplershifts are applied to the spectral segments. as an illustrative test case, weapply our technique to spectra of hd 209458 taken when the planet was nearopposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\arcdeg$, where0$\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is$(1.4 \pm 2.9)\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm. thiscorresponds to a geometric albedo of $0.8 \pm 1.6$, assuming the phase functionof a lambert sphere. although the result is not statistically significant, theachieved sensitivity and relatively small volume of data upon which it is basedare very encouraging for future ground-based spectroscopic studies of scatteredlight from transiting cegp systems.

1212.0307	detection of far infrared emission from galaxies and quasars in the  galactic extinction map by stacking analysis	we have performed stacking image analyses of galaxies over the galacticextinction map constructed by schlegel, finkbeiner &amp; davis (1998). we select~10^7 galaxies in total from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr7photometric catalog. we detect clear signatures of the enhancement of theextinction in r-band, $\delta a_r$, around galaxies, indicating that theextinction map is contaminated by their fir (far infrared) emission. theaverage amplitude of the contamination per galaxy is well fitted to $\deltaa_r(m_r) = 0.64 \times 10^{0.17(18-m_r)}$ [mmag]. while this value is verysmall, it is directly associated with galaxies and may have a systematic effecton galaxy statistics. indeed this correlated contamination leads to arelatively large anomaly of galaxy surface number densities against the sfdextinction a_sfd discovered by yahata et al. (2007). we model the radialprofiles of stacked galaxy images, and find that the fir signal around eachgalaxy does not originate from the central galaxy alone, but is dominated bythe contributions of nearby galaxies via galaxy angular clustering. theseparation of the single galaxy and the clustering terms enables us to inferthe statistical relation of the fir and r-band fluxes of galaxies and also toprobe the flux-weighted cross-correlation of galaxies, down to the magnitudesthat are difficult to probe directly for individual objects. we repeat the samestacking analysis for sdss dr6 photometric quasars and discovered the similarsignatures but with weaker amplitudes. the implications of the present resultsfor galaxy and quasar statistics and for correction to the galactic extinctionmap are briefly discussed.

1212.6379	variability of water and oxygen absorption bands in the disk-integrated  spectra of the earth	we study the variability of major atmospheric absorption features in thedisk-integrated spectra of the earth with future application to earth-analogsin mind, concentrating on the diurnal timescale. we first analyze observationsof the earth provided by the epoxi mission, and find 5-20% fractional variationof the absorption depths of h2o and o2 bands, two molecules that have majorsignatures in the observed range. from a correlation analysis with the cloudmap data from the earth observing satellite (eos), we find that their variationpattern is primarily due to the uneven cloud cover distribution. in order toaccount for the observed variation quantitatively, we consider a simple opaquecloud model, which assumes that the clouds totally block the spectral influenceof the atmosphere below the cloud layer, equivalent to assuming that theincident light is completely scattered at the cloud top level. the model isreasonably successful, and reproduces the epoxi data from the pixel-level eoscloud/water vapor data. a difference in the diurnal variability patterns of h2oand o2 bands is ascribed to the differing vertical and horizontal distributionof those molecular species in the atmosphere. on the earth, the inhomogeneousdistribution of atmospheric water vapor is due to the existence of its exchangewith liquid and solid phases of h2o on the planet's surface on a timescaleshort compared to atmospheric mixing times. if such differences in variabilitypatterns were detected in spectra of earth-analogs, it would provide theinformation on the inhomogeneous composition of their atmospheres.

1302.5172	validity of hydrostatic equilibrium in galaxy clusters from cosmological  hydrodynamical simulations	we examine the validity of the hydrostatic equilibrium (hse) assumption forgalaxy clusters using one of the highest-resolution cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations. we define and evaluate several effective mass terms correspondingto the euler equations of the gas dynamics, and quantify the degree of thevalidity of hse in terms of the mass estimate. we find that the mass estimatedunder the hse assumption (the hse mass) deviates from the true mass by up to ~30 %. this level of departure from hse is consistent with the previous claims,but our physical interpretation is rather different. we demonstrate that theinertial term in the euler equations makes a negligible contribution to thetotal mass, and the overall gravity of the cluster is balanced by the thermalgas pressure gradient and the gas acceleration term. indeed the deviation fromthe hse mass is well explained by the acceleration term at almost all radii. wealso clarify the confusion of previous work due to the inappropriateapplication of the jeans equations in considering the validity of hse from thegas dynamics extracted from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

1310.5771	characterization of the koi-94 system with transit timing variation  analysis: implication for the planet-planet eclipse	the koi-94 system is a closely-packed, multi-transiting planetary systemdiscovered by the kepler space telescope. it is known as the first system thatexhibited a rare event called a "planet-planet eclipse (ppe)," in which twoplanets partially overlap with each other in their double-transit phase. inthis paper, we constrain the parameters of the koi-94 system with an analysisof the transit timing variations (ttvs). such constraints are independent ofthe radial velocity (rv) analysis recently performed by weiss and coworkers,and valuable in examining the reliability of the parameter estimate using ttvs.we numerically fit the observed ttvs of koi-94c, koi-94d, and koi-94e for theirmasses, eccentricities, and longitudes of periastrons, and obtain the best-fitparameters including $m_{\rm c} = 9.4_{-2.1}^{+2.4} m_{\oplus}$, $m_{\rm d} =52.1_{-7.1}^{+6.9} m_{\oplus}$, $m_{\rm e} = 13.0_{-2.1}^{+2.5} m_{\oplus}$,and $e \lesssim 0.1$ for all the three planets. while these values are mostlyin agreement with the rv result, the mass of koi-94d estimated from the ttv issignificantly smaller than the rv value $m_{\rm d} = 106 \pm 11 m_{\oplus}$. inaddition, we find that the ttv of the outermost planet koi-94e is not wellreproduced in the current modeling. we also present analytic modeling of theppe and derive a simple formula to reconstruct the mutual inclination of thetwo planets from the observed height, central time, and duration of thebrightening caused by the ppe. based on this model, the implication of theresults of ttv analysis for the time of the next ppe is discussed.

0802.1808	simulations of baryon acoustic oscillations i: growth of large-scale  density fluctuations	we critically examine how well the evolution of large-scale densityperturbations is followed in cosmological $n$-body simulations. we first run alarge volume simulation and perform a mode-by-mode analysis inthree-dimensional fourier space. we show that the growth of large-scalefluctuations significantly deviates from linear theory predictions. thedeviations are caused by {\it nonlinear} coupling with a small number of modesat largest scales owing to finiteness of the simulation volume. we then developan analytic model based on second-order perturbation theory to quantify theeffect. our model accurately reproduces the simulation results. for a singlerealization, the second-order effect appears typically as ``zig-zag'' patternsaround the linear-theory prediction, which imprints artificial ``oscillations''that lie on the real baryon-acoustic oscillations. although an ensemble averageof a number of realizations approaches the linear theory prediction, thedispersions of the realizations remain large even for a large simulation volumeof several hundred megaparsecs on a side. for the standard $\lambda$cdm model,the deviations from linear growth rate are as large as 10 percent for asimulation volume with $l = 500h^{-1}$mpc and for a bin width in wavenumber of$\delta k = 0.005h$mpc$^{-1}$, which are comparable to the intrinsic varianceof gaussian random realizations. we find that the dispersions scales as$\propto l^{-3/2} \delta k^{-1/2}$ and that the mean dispersion amplitude canbe made smaller than a percent only if we use a very large volume of $l &gt;2h^{-1}$gpc. the finite box size effect needs to be appropriately taken intoaccount when interpreting results from large-scale structure simulations forfuture dark energy surveys using baryon acoustic oscillations.

1401.5876	tidal evolution of the spin-orbit angle in exoplanetary systems	the angle between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit axes (spin-orbitangle) is supposed to carry valuable information on the initial condition ofthe planet formation and the subsequent migration history. indeed currentobservations of the rossiter- mclaughlin effect have revealed a wide range ofspin-orbit misalignments for transiting exoplanets. we examine in detail thetidal evolution of a simple system comprising a sun-like star and a hot jupiteradopting the equilibrium tide and the inertial wave dissipation effectssimultaneously. we find that the combined tidal model works as a very efficientrealignment mechanism; it predicts three distinct states of the spin-orbitangle (i.e., parallel, polar, and anti-parallel orbits) for a while, but thelatter two states eventually approach the parallel spin-orbit configuration.the intermediate spin-orbit angles as measured in recent observations aredifficult to be achieved. therefore the current model cannot reproduce theobserved broad distribution of the spin-orbit angles, at least in its simpleform. this indicates that the observed diversity of the spin-orbit angles mayemerge from more complicated interactions with outer planets and/or may be theconsequence of the primordial misalignment between the proto-planetary disk andthe stellar spin, which requires future detailed studies.

0705.1311	galaxy clustering constraints on deviations from newtonian gravity at  cosmological scales ii: perturbative and numerical analyses of power spectrum  and bispectrum	we explore observational constraints on possible deviations from newtoniangravity by means of large-scale clustering of galaxies. we measure the powerspectrum and the bispectrum of sloan digital sky survey galaxies and comparethe result with predictions in an empirical model of modified gravity. ourmodel assumes an additional yukawa-like term with two parameters thatcharacterize the amplitude and the length scale of the modified gravity. themodel predictions are calculated using two methods; the second-orderperturbation theory and direct n-body simulations. these methods allow us tostudy non-linear evolution of large-scale structure. using the simulationresults, we find that perturbation theory provides reliable estimates for thepower spectrum and the bispectrum in the modified newtonian model. we alsoconstruct mock galaxy catalogues from the simulations, and derive constraintson the amplitude and the length scale of deviations from newtonian gravity. theresulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained inour earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling ofgravitational nonlinearity in the modified newtonian model. if linear biasingis adopted, the bispectrum of the sdss galaxies yields constraints very similarto those from the power spectrum. if we allow for the nonlinear biasinginstead, we find that the ratio of the quadratic to linear biasingcoefficients, b_2/b_1, should satisfy -0.4 &lt; b_2/b_1&lt;0.3 in the modifiednewtonian model.

1412.0354	modeling the anomaly of surface number densities of galaxies on the  galactic extinction map due to their fir emission contamination	the most widely used galactic extinction map (schlegel, finkbeiner, &amp; davis1998, sfd) is constructed assuming that the observed fir fluxes entirely comefrom the galactic dust. according to the earlier suggestion by yahata et al.(2007), we consider how far-infrared (fir) emission of galaxies affects the sfdmap. we first compute the surface number density of sdss dr7 galaxies as afunction of the $r$-band extinction, $a_{r,\rm sfd}$. we confirm that thesurface densities of those galaxies positively correlate with $a_{r,\rm sfd}$for $a_{r,\rm sfd}&lt;0.1$, as first discovered by yahata et al.

1506.00902	constraining spatial extent and temperature of dust around galaxies from  far-infrared image stacking analysis	we propose a novel method to constrain the spatial extent of dust aroundgalaxies through the measurement of dust temperature. our method combines thedust emission of galaxies from far-infrared (fir) image stacking analysis andthe quasar reddening due to the dust absorption around galaxies. as a specificapplication of our method, we use the stacked fir emission profiles of sdssphotometric galaxies over the iras 100$\mu$m map, and the recent measurement ofthe sdss galaxy-quasar cross-correlation. if we adopt a single-temperature dustmodel, the resulting temperature is around 18k, which is consistent with atypical dust temperature for a central part of galaxies. if we assume anadditional dust component with much lower temperature, the current data implythe temperature of the galactic dust needs to be higher, 20k to 30k. since themodel of the density and temperature distribution of dust adopted in thecurrent paper is very simple, we cannot draw any strong conclusion at thispoint. nevertheless our novel method with the elaborated theoretical model andmulti-band measurement of dust will offer an interesting constraint on thestatistical nature of galactic dust.

1511.06935	confrontation of top-hat spherical collapse against dark halos from  cosmological n-body simulations	the top-hat spherical collapse model (tsc) is one of the most fundamentalanalytical frameworks to describe the non-linear growth of cosmic structure.tsc has motivated, and been widely applied in, various researches even in thecurrent era of precision cosmology. while numerous studies exist to examine itsvalidity against numerical simulations in a statistical fashion, there are fewanalyses to compare the tsc dynamics in an individual object-wise basis, whichis what we attempt in the present paper. we extract 100 halos at z = 0 from acosmological n-body simulation according to the conventional tsc criterion forthe spherical over-density. then we trace back their spherical counter-parts atearlier epochs. just prior to the turn-around epoch of the halos, theirdynamics is well approximated by tsc, but their turn-around epochs aresystematically delayed and the virial radii are larger by ~ 20 percent onaverage relative to the tsc predictions. we find that this systematic deviationis mainly ascribed to the non-uniformity/inhomogeneity of dark matter densityprofiles and the non-zero velocity dispersions, both of which are neglected intsc. in particular, the inside-out-collapse and shell-crossing of dark matterhalos play an important role in generating the significant velocity dispersion.the implications of the present result are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0004288	nonlinear stochastic biasing from the formation epoch distribution of  dark halos	we propose a physical model for nonlinear stochastic biasing of one-pointstatistics resulting from the formation epoch distribution of dark halos. incontrast to previous works on the basis of extensive numerical simulations, ourmodel provides for the first time an analytic expression for the jointprobability function. specifically we derive the joint probability function ofhalo and mass density contrasts from the extended press-schechter theory. sincethis function is derived in the framework of the standard gravitationalinstability theory assuming the random-gaussianity of the primordial densityfield alone, we expect that the basic features of the nonlinear and stochasticbiasing predicted from our model are fairly generic. as representativeexamples, we compute the various biasing parameters in cold dark matter modelsas a function of a redshift and a smoothing length. our major findings are (1)the biasing of the variance evolves strongly as redshift while itsscale-dependence is generally weak and a simple linear biasing model provides areasonable approximation roughly at $r\simgt 2(1+z)\himpc$, and (2) thestochasticity exhibits moderate scale-dependence especially on $r\simlt20\himpc$, but is almost independent of $z$. comparison with the previousnumerical simulations shows good agreement with the above behavior, indicatingthat the nonlinear and stochastic nature of the halo biasing is essentiallyunderstood by taking account of the distribution of the halo mass and theformation epoch.

astro-ph;0104361	nonlinear stochastic biasing of galaxies and dark halos in cosmological  hydrodynamic simulations	we perform an extensive analysis of nonlinear and stochastic biasing ofgalaxies and dark halos in spatially flat low-density cdm universe usingcosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we compare their biasing properties withthe predictions of an analytic halo biasing model. dark halos in oursimulations exhibit reasonable agreement with the predictions only on scaleslarger than 10h^{-1}mpc, and on smaller scales the volume exclusion effect ofhalos due to their finite size becomes substantial. interestingly the biasingproperties of galaxies are better described by extrapolating the halo biasingmodel predictions.  we also find the clear dependence of galaxy biasing on their formation epoch;the distribution of old populations of galaxies tightly correlates with theunderlying mass density field, while that of young populations is slightly morestochastic and anti-biased relative to dark matter. the amplitude of two-pointcorrelation function of old populations is about 3 times larger than that ofthe young populations. furthermore, the old population of galaxies residewithin massive dark halos while the young galaxies are preferentially formed insmaller dark halos. assuming that the observed early and late-type galaxiescorrespond to the simulated old and young populations of galaxies,respectively, all of these segregations of galaxies are consistent withobservational ones for the early and late-type of galaxies such as themorphology--density relation of galaxies.

astro-ph;0105218	probability distribution function of cosmological density fluctuations  from gaussian initial condition: comparison of one- and two-point log-normal  model predictions with n-body simulations	we quantitatively study the probability distribution function (pdf) ofcosmological nonlinear density fluctuations from n-body simulations withgaussian initial condition. in particular, we examine the validity andlimitations of one-point and two-point log-normal pdf models against thosedirectly estimated from the simulations. we find that the one-point log-normalpdf describes very accurately the cosmological density distribution even in thenonlinear regime (the rms variance \sigma_{nl} \simlt 4 and the over-density\delta \simlt 100). furthermore the two-point log-normal pdfs are also in goodagreement with the simulation data from linear to fairly nonlinear regime,while slightly deviate from them for \delta \simlt -0.5. thus the log-normalpdf can be used as a useful empirical model for the cosmological densityfluctuations. while this conclusion is fairly insensitive to the shape of theunderlying power spectrum of density fluctuations p(k), models with substantialpower on large scales, i.e., n\equiv d\ln p(k)/d \ln k \simlt -1, are betterdescribed by the log-normal pdf. on the other hand, we note that the one-to-onemapping of the initial and the evolved density fields consistent with thelog-normal model does not approximate the broad distribution of their mutualcorrelation even on average. thus the origin of the phenomenological log-normalpdf approximation still remains to be understood.

astro-ph;0105248	probing the core structure of dark halos with tangential and radial arc  statistics	we study the arc statistics of gravitational lensing generated by dark matterhalos in order to probe their density profile. we characterize the halo profileby two parameters, the inner slope of the central cusp $\alpha$, and the medianamplitude of the concentration parameter, $c_{\rm norm}$, for a halo of mass$10^{14}h^{-1}m_\odot$ at $z=0$, and compute the numbers of tangential andradial arcs produced by gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters. we find thatthe number of arcs divided by the number of halos is a good statistic which issensitive to both $c_{\rm norm}$ and $\alpha$ with very weak dependence on thecosmological parameters. if the arc samples with well-defined selectioncriteria for the clusters become available, one can strongly constrain both$c_{\rm norm}$ and $\alpha$. while our tentative comparison with the existingobservational data indicates that the inner density profile of dark halos isindeed as steep as predicted by recent simulations ($\alpha \sim 1.5$), thehomogeneous samples of tangential and radial arcs are required for morequantitative discussions.

astro-ph;0111158	reliability of the dark matter clustering in cosmological n-body  simulation on scales below the mean separation length of particles	we critically examine the reliability of the dark matter clustering inhigh-resolution cosmological $n$-body simulations on scales below the meanseparation length of particles. the particle discreteness effect imposes thetwo fundamental limitations on those scales; the lack of the initialfluctuation power and the finite mass resolution. we address this problemapplying the dark halo approach and are able to discuss separately how thosetwo limitations affect the dark matter clustering in $n$-body simulations atearly epochs. we find that limitations of the dark matter clustering areprimarily determined by the mass of particles. by a detailed comparison withthree major cosmological simulations, we also find that in order to reproduce aproper amplitude of the dark matter clustering on small scales, halos with acharacteristic nonlinear mass, $m_{\rm nl}(z)$ defined by $\sigma_r(m_{\rm nl};z)=1$, must be resolved in the simulation. this leads to a critical redshift$z_{\rm crit}$ determined by $m_{\rm nl}(z_{\rm crit})=n_{\rm halo} m_{\rmpart}$ where $n_{\rm halo}$ is the number of particles necessary to resolve thetypical nonlinear mass halo ($\sim 10$). we conclude that, at least as far asthe two-point correlation functions are concerned, the dark matter clusteringin high-resolution $n$-body simulations on scales below the mean particleseparation is reliable down to the gravitational force resolution length onlyfor $z&lt;z_{\rm crit}$, while it is strongly affected by the finite massresolution for $z&gt;z_{\rm crit}$.

astro-ph;0410499	the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and analytic radial velocity curves for  transiting extrasolar planetary systems	a transiting extrasolar planet sequentially blocks off the light coming fromthe different parts of the disk of the host star in a time dependent manner.due to the spin of the star, this produces an asymmetric distortion in the lineprofiles of the stellar spectrum, leading to an apparent anomaly of the radialvelocity curves, known as the rossiter - mclaughlin effect. here, we deriveapproximate but accurate analytic formulae for the anomaly of radial velocitycurves taking account of the stellar limb darkening. the formulae areparticularly useful in extracting information of the projected angle betweenthe planetary orbit axis and the stellar spin axis, \lambda, and the projectedstellar spin velocity, v sin i_s. we create mock samples for the radial curvesfor the transiting extrasolar system hd209458, and demonstrate that constraintson the spin parameters (v sin i_s, \lambda) may be significantly improved bycombining our analytic template formulae and the precision velocity curves fromhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations with 8-10 m class telescopes. thusfuture observational exploration of transiting systems using the rossiter -mclaughlin effect is one of the most important probes to better understandingof the origin of extrasolar planetary systems, especially the origin of theirangular momentum.

astro-ph;0412631	large scale clustering of sloan digital sky survey quasars: impact of  the baryon density and the cosmological constant	we report the first result of the clustering analysis of sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) quasars. we compute the two-point correlation function (2pcf) ofsdss quasars in redshift space at $8h^{-1}{\rm mpc} &lt; s &lt; 500h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$,with particular attention to its baryonic signature. our sample consists of19986 quasars extracted from the sdss data release 4 (dr4). the redshift rangeof the sample is $0.72 \le z \le 2.24$ (the mean redshift is $\bar z = 1.46$)and the reddening-corrected $i$-band apparent magnitude range is $15.0 \lem_{i,{\rm rc}} \le 19.1$. due to the relatively low number density of thequasar sample, the bump in the power spectrum due to the baryon density,$\omega_{\rm b}$, is not clearly visible. the effect of the baryon density is,however, to distort the overall shape of the 2pcf.the degree of distortionmakes it an interesting alternate measure of the baryonic signature. assuming ascale-independent linear bias and the spatially flat universe, i.e.,$\omega_{\rm b} + \omega_{\rm d} + \omega_\lambda =1$, where $\omega_{\rm d}$and $\omega_\lambda$ denote the density parameters of dark matter and thecosmological constant, we combine the observed quasar 2pcf and the predictedmatter 2pcf to put constraints on $\omega_{\rm b}$ and $\omega_\lambda$. ourresult is fitted as $0.80- 2.8\omega_{\rm b} &lt; \omega_\lambda &lt; 0.90 -1.4\omega_{\rm b}$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, which is consistent withresults from other cosmological observations such as wmap.

astro-ph;0501366	galaxy clustering constraints on deviations from newtonian gravity at  cosmological scales	in spite of the growing observational evidence for dark matter and darkenergy in the universe, their physical nature is largely unknown. in fact,several authors have proposed modifications of newton's law of gravity atcosmological scales to account for the apparent acceleration of the cosmicexpansion. inspired by such suggestions, we attempt to constrain possibledeviations from newtonian gravity by means of the clustering of sdss (sloandigital sky survey) galaxies. to be specific, we assume a simple modificationof newton's law with an additional yukawa-type term characterized by theamplitude \alpha and the length scale \lambda. adopting spatially-flatuniverses dominated by cold dark matter and/or dark energy, we solve a linearperturbation equation for the growth of density fluctuations. in particular, wefind an exact analytic solution for the einstein -- de sitter case. followingthe peacock-dodds prescription, we compute the nonlinear power spectra of massfluctuations, perform a statistical comparison with the sdss galaxy data, andderive constraints in the \alpha-\lambda plane; for instance, we obtain theconstraints of -0.5&lt;\alpha &lt;0.6 and -0.8&lt;\alpha&lt;0.9 (99.7% confidence level)for \lambda=5h^{-1}mpc and 10h^{-1}mpc, respectively. we also discuss severalfuture possibilities for improving our analysis.

astro-ph;0504623	an analytic model for the axis-ratio distribution of dark matter halos  from the primordial gaussian density field	we present an analytic expression for the axis ratio distribution of triaxialdark matter halos driven from physical principles. adopting the picture oftriaxial collapse based on the zel'dovich approximation, we derive analyticallyboth the minor-to-major and the conditional intermediate-to-major axis ratiodistributions, and examine how they depend on the halo mass, redshift, andcosmology. our analytic model is tested against the simulation data given byjing &amp; suto in 2002, and found to reproduce the conditionalintermediate-to-major axis ratio distribution successfully and theminor-to-major axis ratio distribution approximately. however, the trends ofour analytic axis-ratio distributions with mass and redshift are opposite towhat is found in n-body simulations. this failure of our analytic model puts alimitation on analytic approaches based on the lagrangian theory to the haloellipticity. given the overall agreement with the simulation results, our modelprovides a new theoretical step toward using the axis-ratio distribution ofdark halos as a cosmological probe. we also discuss several possibilities toimprove the model.

astro-ph;0506194	fourier phase analysis of sdss galaxies	we present a first analysis of the clustering of sdss galaxies using thedistribution function of the sum of fourier phases. this statistic was recentlyproposed by one of authors as a new method to probe phase correlations ofcosmological density fields. since the fourier phases are statisticallyindependent of fourier amplitudes, the phase statistic plays a complementaryrole to the conventional two-point statistics of galaxy clustering. inparticular, we focus on the distribution functions of phase sum over threeclosed wavevectors as a function of the configurations of triangle wavevectors.we find that the observed distribution functions of phase sum are in goodagreement with the lowest-order approximation from perturbation theory. fordirect comparison with observations, we construct mock catalogs from n-bodysimulations taking account of several observational effects such as the surveygeometry, the redshift distortion, and the discreteness due to the limitednumber of data. indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in therange of absolute magnitude -22&lt;mr&lt;-18 agree well with those for lambda cdmpredictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from gaussian initial condition. thisagreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshiftspace. instead, assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadraticdeterministic function at scale larger than 30mpc/h, we can constrain the ratioof the quadratic biasing parameter b2 to the linear biasing parameter b1. wefind that resulting b2/b1 is mainly dependent on sigma8 and that it is wellfitted by b2/b1=0.54(+-0.06)-0.62(+-0.08)sigma8 in cdm models. indeed, b2/b1 isnearly zero when sigma8=0.9.

astro-ph;0602015	systematic bias in the estimate of cluster mass and the fluctuation  amplitude from cluster abundance statistics	we revisit the estimate of the mass fluctuation amplitude, sigma_8, from theobservational x-ray cluster abundance. in particular, we examine the effect ofthe systematic difference between the cluster virial mass estimated from thex-ray spectroscopy, m_{vir, spec}, and the true virial mass of thecorresponding halo, m_{vir}. mazzotta et al. (2004) recently pointed out thepossibility that alpha_m = m_{vir, spec}/m_{vir} is systematically lower thanunity. we perform the statistical analysis combining the latest x-ray clustersample and the improved theoretical models and find that sigma_8 \sim 0.76 +/-0.01 + 0.50 (1-alpha_m) for 0.5 \le alpha_m \le 1, where the quoted errors arestatistical only. thus if alpha_m \sim 0.7, the value of sigma_8 from clusterabundance alone is now in better agreement with other cosmological dataincluding the cosmic microwave background, the galaxy power spectrum and theweak lensing data. the current study also illustrates the importance ofpossible systematic effects in mapping real clusters to underlying dark haloswhich changes the interpretation of cluster abundance statistics.

astro-ph;9602061	the x-ray halo of the local group and its implications for microwave and  soft x-ray background	since recent x-ray observations have revealed that most clusters of galaxiesare surrounded by an x-ray emitting gaseous halo, it is reasonable to expectthat the local group of galaxies has its own x-ray halo. we show that such ahalo, with temperature $\sim 1$kev and column density $\sim o(10^{21}) {\rmcm}^{-2}$, is a possible source for the excess low-energy component in thex-ray background. the halo should also generate temperature anisotropies in themicrowave background via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. assuming an isothermalspherical halo with the above temperature and density, the amplitude of theinduced quadrupole turns out to be comparable to the cobe data withoutviolating the upper limit on the $y$-parameter. the induced dipole isnegligible compared to the peculiar velocity of the local group, and multipoleshigher than quadrupole are generally much smaller than the observed ones.however non-sphericity and/or clumpiness of the halo will produce a strongereffect. therefore the gaseous halo of the local group, if it exists, willaffect the estimate of the primordial spectral index $n$ and the amplitude ofthe density fluctuations deduced from the {\sl cobe} data.

astro-ph;9708121	light-cone effect on higher-order clustering in redshift surveys	we have evaluated a systematic effect on counts-in-cells analysis of deep,wide-field galaxy catalogues induced by the evolution of clustering within thesurvey volume. a multiplicative correction factor is explicitly presented,which can be applied after the higher order correlation functions have beenextracted in the usual way, without taking into account the evolution. thegeneral theory of this effect combined with the ansatz describing thenon-linear evolution of clustering in simulations enables us to estimate themagnitude of the correction factor in different cosmologies. in a series ofnumerical calculations assuming an array of cold dark matter models, it isfound that, as long as galaxies are unbiased tracers of underlying densityfield, the effect is relatively small ($ \simeq 10%$) for the shallow surveys($z &lt;0.2$), while it becomes significant (order of unity) in deep surveys ($z\sim1$). depending on the scales of interest, the required correction iscomparable to or smaller than the expected errors of on-going wide-field galaxysurveys such as the sdss and 2df.  therefore at present, the effect has to be taken into account for highprecision measurements at very small scales only, while in future deep surveysit amounts to a significant correction.

astro-ph;9802250	hydrodynamical simulation of clusters of galaxies in x-ray, mm, and  submm bands: determination of peculiar velocity and the hubble constant	we have performed a series of simulations of clusters of galaxies on thebasis of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique in a spatially-flat colddark matter universe with $\omega=0.3$, $\lambda=0.7$, and h_0=70 km/s/mpc asone of the most successful representative cosmological scenarios. inparticular, we focus on the sunyaev--zel'dovich effect in submm and mm bands,and estimate the reliability of the estimates of the global hubble constant$h_0$ and the peculiar velocity of clusters $v_r$. our simulations indicatethat fractional uncertainties of the estimates of $h_0$ amount to $\sim 20%$mainly due to the departure from the isothermal and spherical gas densitydistribution. we find a systematic underestimate bias of $h_0$ by $\sim 20%$for clusters $z\approx 1$, but not at $z\approx 0$. the gas temperature drop inthe central regions of our simulated clusters leads to the underestimate biasof $v_r$ by $\sim 5%$ at $z\approx 0$ and by $\sim 15%$ at $z\approx 1$ inaddition to the statistical errors of the comparable amount due to thenon-spherical gas profile.

astro-ph;9901179	deciphering cosmological information from redshift surveys of high-z  objects - the cosmological light-cone effect and redshift-space distortion -	the three-dimensional distribution of astronomical objects observed inredshift space significantly differs from the true distribution since thedistance to each object cannot be determined by its redshift $z$ only; for $z\ll 1$ the peculiar velocity field contaminates the true recession velocity ofthe hubble flow, while the true distance for objects at $z &lt; 1$ sensitivelydepends on the (unknown and thus assumed) cosmological parameters. this hampersthe effort to understand the true distribution of large-scale structure of theuniverse. in addition, all cosmological observations are carried out on alight-cone, the null hypersurface of an observer at $z=0$. this implies thattheir intrinsic properties and clustering statistics should change even withinthe survey volume. therefore a proper comparison taking account of thelight-cone effect is important to extract any cosmological information fromredshift catalogues, especially for $z &lt; 1$. we present recent theoreticaldevelopment on the two effects -- the cosmological light-cone effect and thecosmological redshift-space distortion -- which should play key roles inobservational cosmology in the 21st century.

astro-ph;9902351	submillimeter detection of the sunyaev -- zel'dovich effect toward the  most luminous x-ray cluster at z=0.45	we report on the detection of the sunyaev -- zel'dovich (sz) signals towardthe most luminous x-ray cluster rxj1347-1145 at nobeyama radio observatory (21and 43 ghz) and at james clerk maxwell telescope (350 ghz). in particular thelatter is the first successful detection of the sz temperature increment in thesubmillimeter band which resolved the profile of a cluster of galaxies. boththe observed spectral dependence and the radial profile of the sz signals arefully consistent with those expected from the x-ray observation of the cluster.the combined analysis of 21ghz and 350ghz data reproduces the temperature andcore-radius of the cluster determined with the rosat and asca satellites whenwe adopt the slope of the density profile from the x-ray observations.therefore our present data provide the strongest and most convincing case forthe detection of the submillimeter sz signal from the cluster, as well as inthe rayleigh -- jeans regime. we also discuss briefly the cosmologicalimplications of the present results.

0810.0813	modeling nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations:  convergence regime of n-body simulations and analytic models	we use a series of cosmological n-body simulations and various analyticmodels to study the evolution of the matter power spectrum in real space in a\lambda cold dark matter universe. we compare the results of n-body simulationsagainst three analytical model predictions; standard perturbation theory,renormalized perturbation theory, and the closure approximation. we include theeffects from finite simulation box size in the comparison. we determine thevalues of the maximum wavenumbers, k^{lim}_{1%} and k^{lim}_{3%}, below whichthe analytic models and the simulation results agree to within 1 and 3 percent,respectively. we then provide a simple empirical function which describes theconvergence regime determined by comparison between our simulations and theanalytical models. we find that if we use the fourier modes within theconvergence regime alone, the characteristic scale of baryon acousticoscillations can be determined within 1% accuracy from future surveys with avolume of a few h^{-3}gpc^3 at z\sim1 or z\sim3 in the absence of anysystematic distortion of the power spectrum.
