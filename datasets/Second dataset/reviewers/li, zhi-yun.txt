0908.4129	outflow feedback regulated massive star formation in parsec-scale  cluster forming clumps	(abridged) we investigate massive star formation in turbulent, magnetized,parsec-scale clumps of molecular clouds including protostellar outflow feedbackusing enzo-based mhd simulations with accreting sink particles and effectiveresolution $2048^3$. we find that, in the absence of regulation by magneticfields and outflow feedback, massive stars form readily in a turbulent,moderately condensed clump of $\sim 1,600$ solar masses, along with a clusterof hundreds of lower mass stars. the massive stars are fed at high rates by (1)transient dense filaments produced by large-scale turbulent compression atearly times, and (2) by the clump-wide global collapse resulting fromturbulence decay at late times. in both cases, the bulk of the massive star'smass is supplied from outside a 0.1 pc-sized "core" that surrounds the star. inour simulation, the massive star is clump-fed rather than core-fed. the needfor large-scale feeding makes the massive star formation prone to regulation byoutflow feedback, which directly opposes the feeding processes. the outflowsreduce the mass accretion rates onto the massive stars by breaking up the densefilaments that feed the massive star formation at early times, and bycollectively slowing down the global collapse that fuel the massive starformation at late times. the latter is aided by a moderate magnetic field ofstrength in the observed range. we conclude that the massive star formation inour simulated turbulent, magnetized, parsec-scale clump is outflow-regulatedand clump-fed (orcf for short). an important implication is that the formationof low-mass stars in a dense clump can affect the formation of massive stars inthe same clump, through their outflow feedback on the clump dynamics.

1006.0793	disk formation enabled by enhanced resistivity	disk formation in magnetized cloud cores is hindered by magnetic braking.previous work has shown that for realistic levels of core magnetization, themagnetic field suppresses the formation of rotationally supported disks duringthe protostellar mass accretion phase of low-mass star formation both in theideal mhd limit and in the presence of ambipolar diffusion for typical rates ofcosmic ray ionization. additional effects, such as ohmic dissipation, the halleffect, and protostellar outflow, are needed to weaken the magnetic braking andenable the formation of persistent, rotationally supported, protostellar disks.in this paper, we first demonstrate that the classic microscopic resistivity isnot large enough to enable disk formation by itself. we then experiment with aset of enhanced values for the resistivity in the range$\eta=10^{17}$--$10^{22}$ cm^2/s. we find that a value of order $10^{19}$cm^2/s is needed to enable the formation of a 100 au-scale keplerian disk; thevalue depends somewhat on the degree of core magnetization. the requiredresistivity is a few orders of magnitude larger than the classic microscopicvalues. whether it can be achieved naturally during protostellar collapseremains to be determined.

1008.0409	lowering the characteristic mass of cluster stars by magnetic fields and  outflow feedback	magnetic fields are generally expected to increase the characteristic mass ofstars formed in stellar clusters, because they tend to increase the effectivejeans mass. we test this expectation using adaptive mesh refinement (amr)magnetohydrodynamic simulations of cluster formation in turbulent magnetizedclumps of molecular clouds, treating stars as accreting sink particles. we findthat, contrary to the common expectation, a magnetic field of strength in theobserved range decreases, rather than increases, the characteristic stellarmass. it (1) reduces the number of intermediate-mass stars that are formedthrough direct turbulent compression, because sub-regions of the clump withmasses comparable to those of stars are typically magnetically subcritical andcannot be compressed directly into collapse, and (2) increases the number oflow-mass stars that are produced from the fragmentation of dense filaments. thefilaments result from mass accumulation along the field lines. in order tobecome magnetically supercritical and fragment, the filament must accumulate alarge enough column density (proportional to the field strength), which yieldsa high volume density (and thus a small thermal jeans mass) that is conduciveto forming low-mass stars. we find, in addition, that the characteristicstellar mass is reduced further by outflow feedback. the conclusion is thatboth magnetic fields and outflow feedback are important in shaping the stellarinitial mass function (imf).

1008.0959	theory of cluster formation: effects of magnetic fields	stars form predominantly in clusters inside dense clumps of molecular cloudsthat are both turbulent and magnetized. the typical size and mass of thecluster-forming clumps are $\sim 1$ pc and $\sim 10^2 - $ 10$^3$ m$_\odot$,respectively. here, we discuss some recent progress on numerical simulations ofclustered star formation in such parsec-scale dense clumps with emphasis on therole of magnetic fields. the simulations have shown that magnetic fields tendto slow down global gravitational collapse and thus star formation, especiallyin the presence of protostellar outflow feedback. even a relatively weak canretard star formation significantly, because the field is amplified bysupersonic turbulence to an equipartition strength. however, in such a case,the distorted field component dominates the uniform one. in contrast, if thefield is moderately strong, the uniform component remains dominant. such adifference in the magnetic structure is observed in simulated polarization mapsof dust thermal emission. recent polarization measurements show that the fieldlines in nearby cluster-forming clumps are spatially well-ordered, indicativeof a rather strong field. in such strongly-magnetized clumps, star formationshould proceed relatively slowly; it continues for at least several globalfree-fall times of the parent dense clump ($t_{\rm ff}\sim $ a few $\times10^5$ yr).

1011.0017	hot jupiter magnetospheres	(abridged) the upper atmospheres of close-in gas giant exoplanets aresubjected to intense heating/tidal forces from their parent stars.atomic/ionized hydrogen (h) layers are sufficiently rarefied that magneticpressure may dominate gas pressure for expected planetary magnetic fieldstrength. we examine the magnetospheric structure using a 3d isothermalmagnetohydrodynamic model that includes: a static "dead zone" near the magneticequator containing magnetically confined gas; a "wind zone" outside themagnetic equator in which thermal pressure gradients and themagneto-centrifugal-tidal effect give rise to transonic outflow; and a regionnear the poles where sufficiently strong tidal forces may suppress transonicoutflow. using dipole field geometry, we estimate the size of the dead zone tobe ~1-10 planetary radii for a range of parameters. to understand appropriatebase conditions for the 3d isothermal model, we compute a 1d thermal model inwhich photoelectric heating from the stellar lyman continuum is balanced bycollisionally-excited lyman {\alpha} cooling. this 1d model exhibits a h layerwith temperatures t=5000-10000k down to pressures of 10-100 nbar. using the 3disothermal model, we compute h column densities and lyman {\alpha} transmissionspectra for parameters appropriate to hd 209458b. line-integrated transitdepths of 5-10% can be achieved for the above base conditions. strong magneticfields increase the transit signal while decreasing the mass loss, due tohigher covering fraction and density of the dead zone. in our model, most ofthe transit signal arises from magnetically confined gas, some of which may beoutside the l1 equipotential. hence the presence of gas outside the l1equipotential does not directly imply mass loss. lastly, we discuss the domainof applicability for the magnetic wind model described in this paper and in theroche-lobe overflow model.

0709.0445	magnetic braking and protostellar disk formation: the ideal mhd limit	magnetic fields are usually considered dynamically important in starformation when the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio is close to, or less than,unity (lambda&lt;~1). we show that, in disk formation, the requirement is far lessstringent. this conclusion is drawn from a set of 2d (axisymmetric) simulationsof the collapse of rotating, magnetized, singular isothermal cores. we findthat a weak field corresponding to 1ambda~100 can begin to disrupt therotationally supported disk through magnetic braking, by creating regions ofrapid, supersonic collapse in the disk. these regions are separated by one ormore centrifugal barriers, where the rapid infall is temporarily halted. thenumber of centrifugal barriers increases with lambda. when lambda&gt;~100, theymerge together to form a more or less contiguous, rotationally supported disk.even though the magnetic field in such a case is extremely weak on the scale ofdense cores, it is amplified by collapse and differential rotation, to theextent that its pressure dominates the thermal pressure in both the disk andits surrounding region. for relatively strongly magnetized cores withlambda&lt;~10, the disk formation is suppressed completely, as found previously. anew feature is that the mass accretion is highly episodic, due to reconnectionof the accumulated magnetic field lines. for rotationally supported disks toappear during the protostellar mass accretion phase of star formation in densecores with realistic field strengths, the powerful magnetic brake must beweakened, perhaps through nonideal mhd effects and/or protostellar winds. wediscuss the possibility of observing a generic product of the magnetic braking,an extended circumstellar region that is supported by a combination of toroidalmagnetic field and rotation - a "magnetogyrosphere".

1101.3018	disk formation in magnetized clouds enabled by the hall effect	stars form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to besignificantly magnetized. a dynamically important magnetic field presents asignificant obstacle to the formation of protostellar disks. recent studieshave shown that magnetic braking is strong enough to suppress the formation ofrotationally supported disks in the ideal mhd limit. whether non-ideal mhdeffects can enable disk formation remains unsettled. we carry out a first studyon how disk formation in magnetic clouds is modified by the hall effect, theleast explored of the three non-ideal mhd effects in star formation (the othertwo being ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation). for illustrativepurposes, we consider a simplified problem of a non-self-gravitating,magnetized envelope collapsing onto a central protostar of fixed mass. we findthat the hall effect can spin up the inner part of the collapsing flow tokeplerian speed, producing a rotationally supported disk. the disk is generatedthrough a hall-induced magnetic torque. disk formation occurs even when theenvelope is initially non-rotating, provided that the hall coefficient is largeenough. when the magnetic field orientation is flipped, the direction of diskrotation is reversed as well. the implication is that the hall effect can inprinciple produce both regularly rotating and counter-rotating disks aroundprotostars. we conclude that the hall effect is an important factor to considerin studying the angular momentum evolution of magnetized star formation ingeneral and disk formation in particular.

1105.5739	magnetic flux expulsion in star formation	stars form in dense cores of magnetized molecular clouds. if the magneticflux threading the cores is dragged into the stars, the stellar field would beorders of magnitude stronger than observed. this well-known "magnetic fluxproblem" demands that most of the core magnetic flux be decoupled from thematter that enters the star. we carry out the first exploration of what happensto the decoupled magnetic flux in 3d, using an mhd version of the enzo adaptivemesh refinement code. the field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sinkparticle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phaseof star formation. we find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near theaccreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. the high pressure isreleased anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. it drives alow-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled.this decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3d mhdsimulations of star formation. it generates a strong asymmetry in theprotostellar accretion flow, potentially giving a kick to the star. in thepresence of an initial core rotation, the structure presents an obstacle to theformation of a rotationally supported disk, in addition to magnetic braking, byacting as a rigid magnetic wall that prevents the rotating gas from completinga full orbit around the central object. we conclude that the decoupled magneticflux from the stellar matter can strongly affect the protostellar collapsedynamics.

1106.2620	nonideal mhd effects and magnetic braking catastrophe in protostellar  disk formation	dense, star-forming, cores of molecular clouds are observed to besignificantly magnetized. a realistic magnetic field of moderate strength hasbeen shown to suppress, through catastrophic magnetic braking, the formation ofa rotationally supported disk during the protostellar accretion phase oflow-mass star formation in the ideal mhd limit. we address, through 2d(axisymmetric) simulations, the question of whether realistic levels ofnonideal effects, computed with a simplified chemical network including dustgrains, can weaken the magnetic braking enough to enable a rotationallysupported disk to form. we find that ambipolar diffusion, the dominant nonidealmhd effect over most of the density range relevant to disk formation, does notenable disk formation, at least in 2d. the reason is that ambipolar diffusionallows the magnetic flux that would be dragged into the central stellar objectin the ideal mhd limit to pile up instead in a small circumstellar region,where the magnetic field strength (and thus the braking efficiency) is greatlyenhanced. we also find that, on the scale of tens of au or more, a realisticlevel of ohmic dissipation does not weaken the magnetic braking enough for arotationally supported disk to form, either by itself or in combination withambipolar diffusion. the hall effect, the least explored of these threenonideal mhd effects, can spin up the material close to the central object to asignificant, supersonic rotation speed, even when the core is initiallynon-rotating, although the spun-up material remains too sub-keplerian to form arotationally supported disk. the problem of catastrophic magnetic braking thatprevents disk formation in dense cores magnetized to realistic levels remainsunresolved. possible resolutions of this problem are discussed.

1107.3616	clustered star formation in magnetic clouds: properties of dense cores  formed in outflow-driven turbulence	we investigate the physical properties of dense cores formed in turbulent,magnetized, parsec-scale clumps of molecular clouds, using three-dimensionalnumerical simulations that include protostellar outflow feedback. the densecores are identified in the simulated density data cube through a clumpfindalgorithm. we find that the core velocity dispersion does not show any cleardependence on the core size, in contrast to larson's linewidth-size relation,but consistent with recent observations. in the absence of a magnetic field,the majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions. amoderately-strong magnetic field reduces the dispersion to a subsonic or atmost transonic value typically. most of the cores are out of virialequilibrium, with the external pressure dominating the self-gravity. theimplication is that the core evolution is largely controlled by theoutflow-driven turbulence. even an initially-weak magnetic field can retardstar formation significantly, because the field is amplified by theoutflow-driven turbulence to an equipartition strength, with the distortedfield component dominating the uniform one. in contrast, for amoderately-strong field, the uniform component remains dominant. such adifference in the magnetic structure is evident in our simulated polarizationmaps of dust thermal emission; it provides a handle on the field strength.recent polarization measurements show that the field lines in cluster-formingclumps are spatially well-ordered. it is indicative of a moderately-strong,dynamically important, field which, in combination with outflow feedback, cankeep the rate of star formation in embedded clusters at theobservationally-inferred, relatively-slow rate of several percent per free-falltime.

1205.4083	protostellar accretion flows destabilized by magnetic flux  redistribution	magnetic flux redistribution lies at the heart of the problem of starformation in dense cores of molecular clouds that are magnetized to a realisticlevel. if all of the magnetic flux of a typical core were to be dragged intothe central star, the stellar field strength would be orders of magnitudehigher than the observed values. this well-known "magnetic flux problem" can inprinciple be resolved through non-ideal mhd effects. two dimensional(axisymmetric) calculations have shown that ambipolar diffusion, in particular,can transport magnetic flux outward relative to matter, allowing material toenter the central object without dragging the field lines along. we showthrough simulations that such axisymmetric protostellar accretion flows areunstable in three dimensions to magnetic interchange instability in theazimuthal direction. the instability is driven by the magnetic fluxredistributed from the matter that enters the central object. it typicallystarts to develop during the transition from the prestellar phase of starformation to the protostellar mass accretion phase. in the latter phase, themagnetic flux is transported outward mainly through advection, by stronglymagnetized low-density regions that expand against the collapsing inflow. thetussle between the gravity-driven infall and magnetically driven expansionleads to a filamentary inner accretion flow, more disordered than previouslypictured. the efficient outward transport of magnetic flux by advection lowersthe field strength at small radii, making the magnetic braking less efficientand the formation of rotationally supported disks easier in principle. however,we find no evidence for such disks in any of our rotating collapse simulations.we conclude that the inner protostellar accretion flow is shaped to a largeextent by this magnetic interchange instability. how disks form in such anenvironment is unclear.

1210.2308	orbital and mass ratio evolution of protobinaries driven by magnetic  braking	the majority of stars reside in multiple systems, especially binaries. theformation and early evolution of binaries is a longstanding problem in starformation that is not fully understood. in particular, how the magnetic fieldobserved in star-forming cores shapes the binary characteristics remainsrelatively unexplored. we demonstrate numerically, using the enzo-mhd code,that a magnetic field of the observed strength can drastically change two ofthe basic quantities of a binary system: the orbital separation and mass ratioof the two components. our calculations focus on the protostellar massaccretion phase, after a pair of stellar 'seeds' have already formed. we findthat, in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level, the angular momentum ofthe gas accreted by the protobinary is greatly reduced by magnetic braking.accretion of strongly braked material shrinks the protobinary separation by alarge factor compared to the non-magnetic case. the magnetic braking alsochanges the evolution of the mass ratio of unequal-mass protobinaries byproducing gas of low specific angular momentum that accretes preferentiallyonto the primary rather than the secondary. this is in contrast with thepreferential mass accretion onto the secondary previously found forprotobinaries accreting from an unmagnetized envelope, which tends to drive themass ratio towards unity. in addition, the magnetic field greatly modifies themorphology and dynamics of the protobinary accretion flow. it suppresses thecircumstellar and circumbinary disks that feed the protobinary in thenon-magnetic case; the binary is fed instead by a fast collapsing pseudodiskwhose rotation is strongly braked. the magnetic braking-driven inward migrationof binaries from their birth locations may be constrained by high-resolutionobservations of the orbital distribution of deeply embedded protobinaries,especially with alma.

1301.6545	does magnetic field-rotation misalignment solve the magnetic braking  catastrophe in protostellar disk formation?	stars form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to besignificantly magnetized. in the simplest case of a laminar (non-turbulent)core with the magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis, both analyticconsiderations and numerical simulations have shown that the formation of alarge, $10^2\au$-scale, rotationally supported protostellar disk is suppressedby magnetic braking in the ideal mhd limit for a realistic level of coremagnetization. this theoretical difficulty in forming protostellar disks istermed "magnetic braking catastrophe". a possible resolution to this problem,proposed by \citeauthor{hennebelleciardi2009} and \citeauthor{joos+2012}, isthat misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis may weaken themagnetic braking enough to enable disk formation. we evaluate this possibilityquantitatively through numerical simulations. we confirm the basic result of\citeauthor{joos+2012} that the misalignment is indeed conducive to diskformation. in relatively weakly magnetized cores with dimensionlessmass-to-flux ratio $\gtrsim 5$, it enabled the formation of rotationallysupported disks that would otherwise be suppressed if the magnetic field androtation axis are aligned. for more strongly magnetized cores, disk formationremains suppressed, however, even for the maximum tilt angle of $90\degree$. ifdense cores are as strongly magnetized as indicated by oh zeeman observations(with a mean dimensionless mass-to-flux ratio $\sim 2$), it would be difficultfor the misalignment alone to enable disk formation in the majority of them. weconclude that, while beneficial to disk formation, especially for therelatively weak field case, the misalignment does not completely solve theproblem of catastrophic magnetic braking in general.

1307.4425	h\alpha\ absorption in transiting exoplanet atmospheres	absorption of stellar h\alpha\ by the upper atmosphere of the planethd189733b has recently been detected by jensen et al. motivated by thisobservation, we have developed a model for atomic hydrogen in the n=2 state andcompared the resulting h\alpha\ line profile to the observations. the modelatmosphere is in hydrostatic balance, as well as thermal and photoionizationequilibrium. collisional and radiative transitions are included in thedetermination of the n=2 state level population. we find that h\alpha\absorption is dominated by an optical depth \tau\ ~ 1 shell, composed ofhydrogen in the metastable 2s state that is located below the hydrogenionization layer. the number density of the 2s state within the shell is foundto vary slowly with radius, while that of the 1s state falls rapidly. thuswhile the ly\alpha absorption, for a certain wavelength, occurs inside arelatively well defined impact parameter, the contribution to h\alpha\absorption is roughly uniform over the entire atomic hydrogen layer. the modelcan approximately reproduce the observed ly\alpha\ and h\alpha\ integratedtransit depths for hd189733b by using an ionization rate enhanced over thatexpected for the star by an order of magnitude. for hd 209458b, we are unableto explain the asymmetric h\alpha\ line profile observed by jensen et al., asthe model produces a symmetric line profile with transit depth comparable tothat of hd 189733b. in an appendix, we study the effect of the stellarly\alpha\ absorption on the net cooling rate.

1308.0830	effect of magnetic misalignment on protobinary evolution	the majority of solar-type stars reside in multiple systems, especiallybinaries. they form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to besignificantly magnetized. our previous study shows that magnetic braking cantighten the binary separation during the protostellar mass accretion phase byremoving the angular momentum of the accreting material. recent numericalcalculations of single star formation have shown that misalignment between themagnetic field and rotation axis may weaken both magnetic braking and theassociated magnetically driven outflows. these two effects allow for diskformation even in strongly magnetized cores. here we investigate the effects ofmagnetic field misalignment on the properties of protobinaries. somewhatsurprisingly, the misaligned magnetic field is more efficient at tightening thebinary orbit compared to the aligned field. the main reason is that themisalignment weakens the magnetically-driven outflow, which allows morematerial to accrete onto the binary. even though the specific angular momentumof this inner material is higher than in the aligned case, it is insufficientto compensate for the additional mass. a corollary of this result is that aweaker field is required to achieve the same degree of inward migration whenthe field is tilted relative to the rotation axis. large field misalignmentalso helps to produce rotationally-supported circumbinary disks even forrelatively strong magnetic fields, by weakening the magnetically-dominatedstructure close to the binary. our result may provide an explanation for thecircumbinary disks detected in recent sma and alma observations.

1401.2219	the earliest stages of star and planet formation: core collapse, and the  formation of disks and outflows	(abridged) in this review we focus on the observations and theory of theformation of early disks and outflows, and their connections with the firstphases of planet formation. large rotationally supported circumstellar disks,although common around more evolved young stellar objects, are rarely detectedduring the earliest, "class 0" phase; however, a few excellent candidates havebeen discovered recently around both low and high mass protostars. in thisearly phase, prominent outflows are ubiquitously observed; they are expected tobe associated with at least small magnetized disks. disk formation - oncethought to be a simple consequence of the conservation of angular momentumduring hydrodynamic core collapse - is far more subtle in magnetized gas. inthis case, the rotation can be strongly magnetically braked. indeed, bothanalytic arguments and numerical simulations have shown that disk formation issuppressed in the strict ideal magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) limit for the observedlevel of core magnetization. we review what is known about this "magneticbraking catastrophe", possible ways to resolve it, and the current status ofearly disk observations. outflows are also intimately linked to disk formation;they are a natural product of magnetic fields and rotation and are importantsignposts of star formation. we review new developments on early outflowgeneration since ppv. the properties of early disks and outflows are a keycomponent of planet formation in its early stages and we review these majorconnections.

1401.5417	confronting outflow-regulated cluster formation model with observations	protostellar outflows have been shown theoretically to be capable ofmaintaining supersonic turbulence in cluster-forming clumps and keeping thestar formation rate per free-fall time as low as a few percent. we aim to testtwo basic predictions of this outflow-regulated cluster formation model, namely(1) the clump should be close to virial equilibrium and (2) the turbulencedissipation rate should be balanced by the outflow momentum injection rate,using recent outflow surveys toward 8 nearby cluster-forming clumps (b59,l1551, l1641n, serpens main cloud, serpens south, $\rho$ oph, ic 348, and ngc1333). we find, for almost all sources, that the clumps are close to virialequilibrium and the outflow momentum injection rate exceeds the turbulencemomentum dissipation rate. in addition, the outflow kinetic energy issignificantly smaller than the clump gravitational energy for intermediate andmassive clumps with $m_{\rm cl} \gtrsim {\rm a \ few} \times 10^2 m_\odot$,suggesting that the outflow feedback is not enough to disperse the clump as awhole. the number of observed protostars also indicates that the star formationrate per free-fall time is as small as a few percent for all clumps. theseobservationally-based results strengthen the case for outflow-regulated clusterformation.

1404.5817	magnetohydrodynamic simulations of hot jupiter upper atmospheres	two-dimensional simulations of hot jupiter upper atmospheres including theplanet's magnetic field are presented. the goal is to explore magnetic effectson the layer of the atmosphere that is ionized and heated by stellar euvradiation, and the imprint of these effects on the ly$\alpha$ transmissionspectrum. the simulations are axisymmetric, isothermal, and include bothrotation and azimuth-averaged stellar tides. mass density is converted toatomic hydrogen density through the assumption of ionization equilibrium. thethree-zone structure -- polar dead zone, mid-latitude wind zone, and equatorialdead zone -- found in previous analytic calculations is confirmed. for amagnetic field comparable to that of jupiter, the equatorial dead zone, whichis confined by the magnetic field and corotates with the planet, contributes atleast half of the transit signal. for even stronger fields, the gas escaping inthe mid-latitude wind zone is found to have a smaller contribution to thetransit depth than the equatorial dead zone. transmission spectra computed fromthe simulations are compared to hst stis and acs data for hd 209458b and hd189733b, and the range of model parameters consistent with the data is found.the central result of this paper is that the transit depth increases stronglywith magnetic field strength when the hydrogen ionization layer is magneticallydominated, for dipole magnetic field $b_0 &gt; 10\ {\rm g}$. hence transit depthis sensitive to magnetic field strength, in addition to standard quantitiessuch as the ratio of thermal to gravitational binding energies.

1407.3984	magnetic fields and massive star formation	massive stars ($m &gt; 8$ \msun) typically form in parsec-scale molecular clumpsthat collapse and fragment, leading to the birth of a cluster of stellarobjects. we investigate the role of magnetic fields in this process throughdust polarization at 870 $\mu$m obtained with the submillimeter array (sma).the sma observations reveal polarization at scales of $\lsim$ 0.1 pc. thepolarization pattern in these objects ranges from ordered hour-glassconfigurations to more chaotic distributions. by comparing the sma data withthe single dish data at parsec scales, we found that magnetic fields at densecore scales are either aligned within $40^\circ$ of or perpendicular to theparsec-scale magnetic fields. this finding indicates that magnetic fields playan important role during the collapse and fragmentation of massive molecularclumps and the formation of dense cores. we further compare magnetic fields indense cores with the major axis of molecular outflows. despite a limited numberof outflows, we found that the outflow axis appears to be randomly orientedwith respect to the magnetic field in the core. this result suggests that atthe scale of accretion disks ($\lsim 10^3$ au), angular momentum and dynamicinteractions possibly due to close binary or multiple systems dominate overmagnetic fields. with this unprecedentedly large sample massive clumps, weargue on a statistical basis that magnetic fields play an important role duringthe formation of dense cores at spatial scale of 0.01 - 0.1 pc in the contextof massive star and cluster star formation.

1408.2374	on the role of pseudodisk warping and reconnection in protostellar disk  formation in turbulent magnetized cores	the formation of rotationally supported protostellar disks is suppressed inideal mhd in non-turbulent cores with aligned magnetic field and rotation axis.a promising way to resolve this so-called "magnetic braking catastrophe" isthrough turbulence. the reason for the turbulence-enabled disk formation isusually attributed to the turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection, which isthought to reduce the magnetic flux accumulated in the disk-forming region. weadvance an alternative interpretation, based on magnetic decoupling-triggeredreconnection of severely pinched field lines close to the central protostar andturbulence-induced warping of the pseudodisk of galli and shu. suchreconnection weakens the central split magnetic monopole that lies at the heartof the magnetic braking catastrophe under flux freezing. we show, throughidealized numerical experiments, that the pseudodisk can be strongly warped,but not completely destroyed, by a subsonic or sonic turbulence. the warpingdecreases the rates of angular momentum removal from the pseudodisk by bothmagnetic torque and outflow, making it easier to form a rotationally supporteddisk. more importantly, the warping of the pseudodisk out of the disk-forming,equatorial plane greatly reduces the amount of magnetic flux threading thecircumstellar, disk-forming region, further promoting disk formation. thebeneficial effects of pseudodisk warping can also be achieved by a misalignmentbetween the magnetic field and rotation axis. these two mechanisms of diskformation, enabled by turbulence and field-rotation misalignment respectively,are thus unified. we find that the disks formed in turbulent magnetized coresare rather thick and significantly magnetized. implications of these findings,particularly for the thick young disk inferred in l1527, are briefly discussed.

1409.0787	recollimation boundary layers as x-ray sources in young stellar jets	young stars accrete mass from circumstellar disks and in many cases, theaccretion coincides with a phase of massive outflows, which can be highlycollimated. those jets emit predominantly in the optical and ir wavelengthrange. however, in several cases x-ray and uv observations reveal a weak buthighly energetic component in those jets. x-rays are observed both fromstationary regions close to the star and from knots in the jet several hundredau from the star. in this article we show semi-analytically that a fast stellarwind which is recollimated by the pressure from a slower, more massive diskwind can have the right properties to power stationary x-ray emission. the sizeof the shocked regions is compatible with observational constraints. ourcalculations support a wind-wind interaction scenario for the high energyemission near the base of yso jets. for the specific case of dg tau, a stellarwind with a mass loss rate of $5\cdot10^{-10}\;m_{\odot}\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ anda wind speed of 800 km s$^{-1}$ reproduces the observed x-ray spectrum. weconclude that a stellar wind recollimation shock is a viable scenario to powerstationary x-ray emission close to the jet launching point.

1409.2878	spatially resolved magnetic field structure in the disk of a t tauri  star	magnetic fields in accretion disks play a dominant role during the starformation process but have hitherto been observationally poorly constrained.field strengths have been inferred on t tauri stars themselves and possibly inthe innermost part of the accretion disk, but the strength and morphology ofthe field in the bulk of the disk have not been observed. unresolvedmeasurements of polarized emission (arising from elongated dust grains alignedperpendicular to the field) imply average fields aligned with the disks.theoretically, the fields are expected to be largely toroidal, poloidal, or amixture of the two, which imply different mechanisms for transporting angularmomentum in the disks of actively accreting young stars such as hl tau. here wereport resolved measurements of the polarized 1.25 mm continuum emission fromhl tau's disk. the magnetic field on a scale of 80 au is coincident with themajor axis (~210 au diameter) of the disk. from this we conclude that themagnetic field inside the disk at this scale cannot be dominated by a verticalcomponent, though a purely toroidal field does not fit the data well either.the unexpected morphology suggests that the magnetic field's role for theaccretion of a t tauri star is more complex than the current theoreticalunderstanding.

0804.4201	magnetically regulated star formation in 3d: the case of taurus  molecular cloud complex	we carry out three-dimensional mhd simulations of star formation inturbulent, magnetized clouds, including ambipolar diffusion and feedback fromprotostellar outflows. the calculations focus on relatively diffuse cloudsthreaded by a strong magnetic field capable of resisting severe tangling byturbulent motions and retarding global gravitational contraction in thecross-field direction. they are motivated by observations of the taurusmolecular cloud complex (and, to a lesser extent, pipe nebula), which shows anordered large-scale magnetic field, as well as elongated condensations that aregenerally perpendicular to the large-scale field. we find that stars form inearnest in such clouds when enough material has settled gravitationally alongthe field lines that the mass-to-flux ratios of the condensations approach thecritical value. only a small fraction (of order 1% or less) of the nearlymagnetically-critical, condensed material is turned into stars per localfree-fall time, however. the slow star formation takes place in condensationsthat are moderately supersonic; it is regulated primarily by magnetic fields,rather than turbulence. the quiescent condensations are surrounded by diffusehalos that are much more turbulent, as observed in the taurus complex. strongsupport for magnetic regulation of star formation in this complex comes fromthe extremely slow conversion of the already condensed, relatively quiescentc$^{18}$o gas into stars, at a rate two orders of magnitude below the maximum,free-fall value. we analyze the properties of dense cores, including their massspectrum, which resembles the stellar initial mass function.

1511.01141	mass assembly of stellar systems and their evolution with the sma  (masses). multiplicity and the physical environment in l1448n	we present continuum and molecular line observations at 230 ghz and 345 ghzfrom the sub-millimeter array (sma) toward three protostars in the perseusl1448n region. the data are from the large project "mass assembly of stellarsystems and their evolution with the sma" (masses). three dust continuumsources, source b, source nw, and source a, are detected at both frequencies.these sources have corresponding emission peaks in c18o (j=2-1), 13co (j=2-1),and hco+ (j=4-3), and have offsets with n2d+ (j=3-2) peaks. high angularresolution data from a complimentary continuum survey with the karl g. janskyvery large array show that source b is associated with three 8 mm continuumobjects, source nw with two, and source a remains single. these results suggestthat multiplicity in l1448n exists at different spatial scales from a fewthousand au to &lt; 100 au. velocity gradients in each source obtained fromtwo-dimensional fits to the sma c18o emission are found to be perpendicular towithin 20 degrees of the outflow directions as revealed by 12co (j=2-1). wehave observed that sources b and nw with multiplicity have higher densitiesthan source a without multiplicity. this suggests that thermal jeansfragmentation can be relevant in the fragmentation process. however, we havenot observed a difference in the ratio between rotational and gravitationalenergy between sources with and without multiplicity. we also have not observeda trend between non-thermal velocity dispersions and the level offragmentation. our study has provided the first direct and comprehensivecomparison between multiplicity and core properties in low-mass protostars,although based on small number statistics.

astro-ph;0107315	structure of magnetocentrifugal disk-winds: from the launching surface  to large distances	protostellar jets and winds are probably driven magnetocentrifugally from thesurface of accretion disks close to the central stellar objects. the exactlaunching conditions on the disk, such as the distributions of magnetic fluxand mass ejection rate, are poorly unknown. they could be constrained fromobservations at large distances, provided that a robust model is available tolink the observable properties of the jets and winds at the large distances tothe conditions at the base of the flow. we discuss the difficulties inconstructing such large-scale wind models, and describe a novel technique whichenables us to numerically follow the acceleration and propagation of the windfrom the disk surface to arbitrarily large distances and the collimation ofpart of the wind into a dense, narrow ``jet'' around the rotation axis. specialattention is paid to the shape of the jet and its mass flux relative to that ofthe whole wind. the mass flux ratio is a measure of the jet formationefficiency.

astro-ph;0110002	interaction models for grb afterglows	we review interaction models for grb afterglows, with an eye on constrainingthe nature of their progenitors and the geometry of explosion. evidence ispresented for two types of progenitors. the radio afterglow of grb 980425/sn1998bw and the multi-frequency observations of grb 970508 can be fitted by ablast wave expanding into a wind-type medium, pointing to a massive starprogenitor. the broadband afterglow data of grbs 990123 and 990510 are bettermodeled by a jet expanding into a constant-density medium, implying a compactstar merger origin. among other well observed grbs, the jet model appears to bemore widely applicable than the wind model, although some cases are ambiguous.the model fits often require a deviation of the energy distribution of theradiating electrons from the commonly assumed single power-law form,particularly for sources with a rapid decline and/or pronounced steepening inthe optical light curves. transition to non-relativistic evolution has beensuggested as an alternative explanation for the light curve steepening,although to produce steepening on the order of days or less would require veryhigh ambient densities, which are generally difficult to reconcile with radioobservations. major open issues include the hydrodynamics of jet-ambient mediuminteraction, a self-consistent determination of the electron energydistribution, and the effects of pair production on the early afterglows whichare expected to be particularly large for the wind interaction model.

astro-ph;0201019	a coupled dynamical and chemical model of starless cores of magnetized  molecular clouds: i. formulation and initial results	we develop a detailed chemical model for the starless cores of stronglymagnetized molecular clouds, with the ambipolar diffusion-driven dynamicevolution of the clouds coupled to the chemistry through ion abundances. weconcentrate on two representative model clouds in this initial study, one withmagnetic fields and the other without. the model predictions on the peak valuesand spatial distributions of the column densities of co, ccs, n$_2$h$^+$ andhco$^+$ are compared with those observationally inferred for the well-studiedstarless core l1544, which is thought to be on the verge of star formation. wefind that the magnetic model, in which the cloud is magnetically supported forseveral million years before collapsing dynamically, provides a reasonableoverall fit to the available data on l1544; the fit is significantly worse forthe non-magnetic model, in which the cloud collapses promptly. the observedlarge peak column density for n$_2$h$^+$ and clear central depression for ccsfavor the magnetically-retarded collapse over the free-fall collapse. arelatively high abundance of ccs is found in the magnetic model, resulting mostlikely from an interplay of depletion and late-time hydrocarbon chemistryenhanced by co depletion. these initial results lend some support to thestandard picture of dense core formation in strongly magnetized clouds throughambipolar diffusion. they are at variance with those of aikawa et al.

astro-ph;0201419	nonaxisymmetric evolution of magnetically subcritical clouds: bar  growth, core elongation, and binary formation	we have begun a systematic numerical study of the nonlinear growth ofnonaxisymmetric perturbations during the ambipolar diffusion-driven evolutionof initially magnetically subcritical molecular clouds, with an eye on theformation of binaries, multiple stellar systems and small clusters. in thisinitial study, we focus on the $m=2$ (or bar) mode, which is shown to beunstable during the dynamic collapse phase of cloud evolution after the centralregion has become magnetically supercritical. we find that, despite thepresence of a strong magnetic field, the bar can grow fast enough that for amodest initial perturbation (at 5% level) a large aspect ratio is obtainedduring the isothermal phase of cloud collapse. the highly elongated bar isexpected to fragment into small pieces during the subsequent adiabatic phase.our calculations suggest that the strong magnetic fields observed in somestar-forming clouds and envisioned in the standard picture of single starformation do not necessarily suppress bar growth and fragmentation; on thecontrary, they may actually promote these processes, by allowing the clouds tohave more than one (thermal) jeans mass to begin with without collapsingpromptly. nonlinear growth of the bar mode in a direction perpendicular to themagnetic field, coupled with flattening along field lines, leads to theformation of supercritical cores that are triaxial in general. it removes alongstanding objection to the standard scenario of isolated star formationinvolving subcritical magnetic field and ambipolar diffusion based on thelikely prolate shape inferred for dense cores. continuted growth of the barmode in already elongated starless cores, such as l1544, may lead to futurebinary and multiple star formation.

astro-ph;0206352	fragmentation of magnetically subcritical clouds into multiple  supercritical cores and the formation of small stellar groups	isolated low-mass stars are formed in dense cores of molecular clouds. in thestandard picture, the cores are envisioned to condense out of stronglymagnetized clouds through ambipolar diffusion. most previous calculations basedon this scenario are limited to axisymmetric cloud evolution leading to asingle core, which collapses to form an isolated star or stellar system at thecenter. these calculations are here extended to the nonaxisymmetric case underthin-disk approximation, which allows for a detailed investigation into theprocess of fragmentation, fundamental to binary, multiple system, and clusterformation. we have shown previously that initially axisymmetric, magneticallysubcritical clouds with an $m=2$ density perturbation of modest fractionalamplitude ($\sim 5%$) can develop highly elongated bars, which facilitatebinary and multiple system formation. in this paper, we show that in thepresence of higher order ($m\ge 3$) perturbations of similar amplitude suchclouds are capable of breaking up into a set of discrete dense cores. thesemultiple cores are magnetically supercritical. they are expected to collapseinto single stars or stellar systems individually and, collectively, to form asmall stellar group. our calculations demonstrate that the standard scenariofor single star formation involving magnetically subcritical clouds andambipolar diffusion can readily produce more than one star, provided that thecloud mass is well above the jeans limit and relatively uniformly distributed.the fragments develop in the central part of the cloud, after the region hasbecome magnetically supercritical but before rapid collapse sets in. it isenhanced by the flattening of mass distribution along the field lines and bythe magnetic tension force.

astro-ph;0207014	self-gravitating magnetically-supported protostellar disks and the  formation of substellar companions	isolated low-mass stars are formed, in the standard picture, from thecollapse of dense cores condensed out of strongly magnetized molecular clouds.the dynamically collapsing inflow traps nearly half of the critical magneticflux needed for the core support and deposits it in a small region surroundingthe protostar. it has been argued previously that the deposited flux can slowdown the inflow, allowing matter to pile up and settle along field lines into amagnetically supported, circumstellar disk. here we show that the disktypically contains $\sim 10%$ of the stellar mass, and that it could becomeself-gravitating under plausible conditions during the rapidly accreting,``class 0'' phase of star formation. subsequent fragmentation of theself-gravitating, magnetically subcritical disk, driven by magnetic diffusion,could produce fragments of substellar masses, which collapse to form browndwarfs and possibly massive planets. this scenario predicts substellar objectformation at distances of order 100 au from the central star, although orbitalevolution is possible after formation. it may provide an explanation for thesmall, but growing, number of brown dwarf companions found around nearby starsby direct imaging. the relatively large formation distances make the substellarcompanions vulnerable to dynamic ejection, particularly in binary (multiple)systems and dense clusters. those ejected may account for, at least in part,the isolated brown dwarfs and perhaps free-floating planetary mass objects.

astro-ph;0303650	wind-interaction models for the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts:  the case of grb 021004	wind-interaction models for gamma-ray burst afterglows predict that theoptical emission from the reverse shock drops below that from the forward shockwithin 100s of seconds of the burst. the typical frequency $\nu_m$ of thesynchrotron emission from the forward shock passes through the optical bandtypically on a timescale of minutes to hours. before the passage of $\nu_m$,the optical flux evolves as $t^{-1/4}$ and after the passage, the decaysteepens to $t^{-(3p-2)/4}$, where $p$ is the exponent for the assumedpower-law energy distribution of nonthermal electrons and is typically $\sim2$. the steepening in the slope of temporal decay should be readilyidentifiable in the early afterglow light curves. we propose that such asteepening was observed in the r-band light curve of grb 021004 around day 0.1.available data at several radio frequencies are consistent with thisinterpretation, as are the x-ray observations around day~1. the early evolutionof grb 021004 contrasts with that of grb 990123, which can be described byemission from interaction with a constant density medium.

astro-ph;0305317	binary and multiple star formation in magnetic clouds: bar growth and  fragmentation	we study the non-axisymmetric evolution of magnetized clouds, using a 2d mhdcode based on the physically motivated thin-disk approximation. we found thatsuch clouds become unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations after thesupercritical cores are formed due to ambipolar diffusion. we show that for awide range of initial cloud parameters, the $m=2$ mode grows nonlinearly into abar during the isothermal collapse after the supercritical core formation. thesupercritical core can break up into fragments during or after the isothermalphase of cloud evolution. the outcome of fragmentation depends on the initialcloud conditions, such as the magnetic field strength, rotation rate, amount ofcloud mass and mass distribution. it is classified into three different types:(1) separate core formation, (2) bar fragmentation, and (3) disk fragmentation.these three types of fragmentation loosely correspond to the empiricalclassification of embedded binary and multiple systems of looney, mundy, &amp;welch, based on millimeter dust continuum observations. the well-studiedstarless core, l1544, appears to belong to the bar fragmentation type. weexpect it to produce a highly elongated, opaque bar at the center in thefuture, which should break up into fragments of initial masses in thesubstellar regime.

astro-ph;0306519	magneto-centrifugal launching of jets from accretion disks. ii: inner  disk-driven winds	we follow numerically the time evolution of axisymmetric outflows drivenmagneto-centrifugally from the inner portion of accretion disks, from theirlaunching surface to large, observable distances. special attention is paid tothe collimation of part of the outflow into a dense, narrow jet around therotation axis, after a steady state has been reached. for parameters typical oft tauri stars, we define a fiducial ``jet'' as outlined by the contour ofconstant density at 10^4 cm^{-3}. we find that the jet, so defined, appearsnearly cylindrical well above the disk, in agreement with previous asymptoticanalyses. closer to the equatorial plane, the density contour can either bulgeoutwards or pinch inwards, depending on the conditions at the launchingsurface, particularly the mass flux distribution. we find that even though adense, jet-like feature is always formed around the axis, there is no guaranteethat the high-density axial jet would dominate the more tenuous, wide-anglepart of the wind. specifically, on the 100 au scale, resolvable by hst andground-based adaptive optics for nearby t tauri winds, the fraction of the windmass flux enclosed by the fiducial jet can vary substantially, again dependingon the launching conditions. we show two examples in which the fraction is ~20%and ~45%. these dependences may provide a way to constrain the conditions atthe launching surface, which are poorly known at present.

astro-ph;0311326	the diversity of gamma-ray bursts and the surroundings of massive stars	the finding of a type ic supernova connected with grb 030329 showed a massivestar origin for this burst, supporting evidence for this association inprevious bursts with lightcurve bumps at the appropriate time for a supernova.here, we explore the possibility that all long bursts have massive starprogenitors, interacting with either the freely expanding wind of theprogenitor or the shocked wind. we present models for the afterglows of grb020405 and grb 021211, which are a challenge to wind interaction models.considering sources for which wind interaction models are acceptable, a rangeof wind densities is required, from values typical of galactic wolf-rayet starsto values ~100 times smaller. the reason for the low densities is unclear, butmay involve low progenitor masses and/or low metallicities. if mass is afactor, a low density event should be associated with a low mass supernova. theinterpretation of bursts apparently interacting with constant density media asinteraction with a shocked wind requires both a range of mass loss densitiesand a range of external pressures. the highest pressures, p/k &gt; 10^8 cm^{-3} k,may be due to an extreme starburst environment, which would imply that theburst is superposed on an active star forming region. although the range ofobserved events can be accomodated by the shocked wind theory, specialcircumstances are necessary to bring this about. finally, we consider the highvelocity, high ionization absorption features observed in some afterglowspectra. if the features are circumstellar, the presence of the burst in astarburst region may be important for the formation of clumps near the burst.

astro-ph;0311426	does magnetic levitation or suspension define the masses of forming  stars?	we investigate whether magnetic tension can define the masses of formingstars by holding up the subcritical envelope of a molecular cloud that suffersgravitational collapse of its supercritical core. we perform an equilibriumanalysis of the initial and final states assuming perfect field freezing, norotation, isothermality, and a completely flattened configuration. the sheetgeometry allows us to separate the magnetic tension into a levitationassociated with the split monopole formed by the trapped flux of the centralstar and a suspension associated with curved field lines that thread the staticpseudodisk and envelope of material external to the star. we find solutionswhere the eigenvalue for the stellar mass is a fixed multiple of the initialcore mass of the cloud. we verify the analytically derived result by anexplicit numerical simulation of a closely related 3-d axisymmetric system.however, with field freezing, the implied surface magnetic fields much exceedmeasured values for young stars. if the pinch by the central split monopolewere to be eliminated by magnetic reconnection, then magnetic suspension alonecannot keep the subcritical envelope (i.e., the entire model cloud) fromfalling onto the star. we argue that this answer has general validity, even ifthe initial state lacked any kind of symmetry, possessed rotation, and had asubstantial level of turbulence. these findings strongly support a picture forthe halt of infall that invokes dynamic levitation by yso winds and jets, butthe breakdown of ideal magnetohydrodynamics is required to allow the appearancein the problem of a rapidly rotating, centrifugally supported disk. we usethese results to calculate the initial mass function and star formationefficiency for the distributed and clustered modes of star formation.

astro-ph;0410704	the structure of magnetocentrifugal winds i. steady mass loading	we present the results of a series of time-dependent numerical simulations ofcold, magnetocentrifugally launched winds from accretion disks. our simulationsspan four and half decades of mass loading; in the context of a disk with alaunching region from $0.1\au$ to $1.0\au$ around a $1\solarmass$ star and afield strength of about $20\gauss$ at the inner disk edge, this amounts to massloss rates of $1\times 10^{-9}$ -- $3\times 10^{-5}\solarmassyear$ from eachside of the disk. we find that the degree of collimation of the wind increaseswith mass loading; however even the ``lightest'' wind simulated issignificantly collimated compared with the force-free magnetic configuration ofthe same magnetic flux distribution. the implication is that for flows fromyoung stellar objects a radial field approximation is inappropriate.surprisingly, the terminal velocity of the wind and the magnetic lever arm arestill well-described by the analytical solutions for a radial field geometry.we also find that the isodensity contours and alfv\'en surface are very nearlyself-similar in mass loading. the wind becomes unsteady above some criticalmass loading rate. for a small enough injection speed, we are able to obtainthe first examples of a class of heavily-loaded magnetocentrifugal winds withmagnetic fields completely dominated by the toroidal component all the way tothe launching surface.

astro-ph;0502130	quiescent cores and the efficiency of turbulence-accelerated,  magnetically regulated star formation	the efficiency of star formation, defined as the ratio of the stellar tototal (gas and stellar) mass, is observed to vary from a few percent in regionsof dispersed star formation to about a third in cluster-forming cores. thisdifference may reflect the relative importance of magnetic fields andturbulence in controlling star formation. we investigate the interplay betweensupersonic turbulence and magnetic fields using numerical simulations, in asheet-like geometry. we demonstrate that star formation with an efficiency of afew percent can occur over several gravitational collapse times in moderatelymagnetically subcritical clouds that are supersonically turbulent. theturbulence accelerates star formation by reducing the time for dense coreformation. the dense cores produced are predominantly quiescent, with subsonicinternal motions. these cores tend to be moderately supercritical. they havelifetimes long compared with their local gravitational collapse time. some ofthe cores collapse to form stars, while others disperse away without starformation. in turbulent clouds that are marginally magnetically supercritical,the star formation efficiency is higher, but can still be consistent with thevalues inferred for nearby embedded clusters. if not regulated by magneticfields at all, star formation in a multi-jeans mass cloud endowed with a stronginitial turbulence proceeds rapidly, with the majority of cloud mass convertedinto stars in a gravitational collapse time. the efficiency is formally higherthan the values inferred for nearby cluster-forming cores, indicating thatmagnetic fields are dynamically important even for cluster formation.

astro-ph;0512278	cluster formation in protostellar outflow-driven turbulence	most, perhaps all, stars go through a phase of vigorous outflow duringformation. we examine, through 3d mhd simulation, the effects of protostellaroutflows on cluster formation. we find that the initial turbulence in thecluster-forming region is quickly replaced by motions generated by outflows.the protostellar outflow-driven turbulence (``protostellar turbulence'' forshort) can keep the region close to a virial equilibrium long after the initialturbulence has decayed away. we argue that there exist two types of turbulencein star-forming clouds: a primordial (or ``interstellar'') turbulence and aprotostellar turbulence, with the former transformed into the latter mostly inembedded clusters such as ngc 1333. since the majority of stars are thought toform in clusters, an implication is that the stellar initial mass function isdetermined to a large extent by the stars themselves, through outflows whichindividually limit the mass accretion onto forming stars and collectively shapethe environments (density structure and velocity field) in which most clustermembers form. we speculate that massive cluster-forming clumps supported byprotostellar turbulence gradually evolve towards a highly centrally condensed``pivotal'' state, culminating in rapid formation of massive stars in thedensest part through accretion.

astro-ph;0610630	magnetocentrifugal winds in 3d: nonaxisymmetric steady state	outflows can be loaded and accelerated to high speeds along rapidly rotating,open magnetic field lines by centrifugal forces. whether suchmagnetocentrifugally driven winds are stable is a longstanding theoreticalproblem. as a step towards addressing this problem, we perform the firstlarge-scale 3d mhd simulations that extend to a distance $\sim 10^2$ timesbeyond the launching region, starting from steady 2d (axisymmetric) solutions.in an attempt to drive the wind unstable, we increase the mass loading on onehalf of the launching surface by a factor of $\sqrt{10}$, and reduce it by thesame factor on the other half. the evolution of the perturbed wind is followednumerically. we find no evidence for any rapidly growing instability that coulddisrupt the wind during the launching and initial phase of propagation, evenwhen the magnetic field of the magnetocentrifugal wind is toroidally dominatedall the way to the launching surface. the strongly perturbed wind settles intoa new steady state, with a highly asymmetric mass distribution. thedistribution of magnetic field strength is, in contrast, much more symmetric.we discuss possible reasons for the apparent stability, including stabilizationby an axial poloidal magnetic field, which is required to bend field lines awayfrom the vertical direction and produce a magnetocentrifugal wind in the firstplace.

astro-ph;0703152	protostellar turbulence driven by collimated outflows	the majority of stars are thought to form in clusters. cluster formation indense clumps of molecular clouds is strongly influenced, perhaps controlled, bysupersonic turbulence. we have previously shown that the turbulence in regionsof active cluster formation is quickly transformed by the forming stars throughprotostellar outflows, and that the outflow-driven protostellar turbulence isthe environment in which most of the cluster members form. here, we takeinitial steps in quantifying the global properties of the protostellarturbulence through 3d mhd simulations. we find that collimated outflows aremore efficient in driving turbulence than spherical outflows that carry thesame amounts of momentum. gravity plays an important role in shaping theturbulence, generating infall motions in the cluster forming region thatbalance the outward motions driven by outflows. the resulting quasi-equilibriumstate is maintained through a slow rate of star formation, with a fraction ofthe total mass converted into stars per free fall time as low as a few percent.magnetic fields are dynamically important even in magnetically supercriticalclumps, provided that their initial strengths are not far below the criticalvalue for static cloud support. we find that the mass weighted pdf of thevolume density is often, although not always, approximately lognormal. the pdfsof the column density deviate more strongly from lognormal distributions. thereis a prominent break in the velocity power spectrum of the protostellarturbulence, which may provide a way to distinguish it from other types ofturbulence.

0809.3593	magnetic braking and protostellar disk formation: ambipolar diffusion	it is established that the formation of rotationally supported disks duringthe main accretion phase of star formation is suppressed by a moderately strongmagnetic field in the ideal mhd limit. non-ideal mhd effects are expected toweaken the magnetic braking, perhaps allowing the disk to reappear. weconcentrate on one such effect, ambipolar diffusion, which enables the fieldlines to slip relative to the bulk neutral matter. we find that the slippagedoes not sufficiently weaken the braking to allow rotationally supported disksto form for realistic levels of cloud magnetization and cosmic ray ionizationrate; in some cases, the magnetic braking is even enhanced. only in dense coreswith both exceptionally weak fields and unreasonably low ionization rate dosuch disks start to form in our simulations. we conclude that additionalprocesses, such as ohmic dissipation or hall effect, are needed to enable diskformation. alternatively, the disk may form at late times when the massiveenvelope that anchors the magnetic brake is dissipated, perhaps by aprotostellar wind.
