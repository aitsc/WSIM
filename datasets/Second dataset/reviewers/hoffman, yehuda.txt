0901.1317	dissecting galaxy formation: i. comparison between pure dark matter and  baryonic models	we compare assembly of dm halos with and without baryons, within the contextof cosmological evolution in the lcdm wmap3 universe (baryons+dm, bdm model,and pure dm, pdm model). in representative pdm and bdm models we find thatbaryons contribute decisively to the evolution of the central region, leadingto an isothermal dm cusp, and to a flat dm density core -- the result ofheating by dynamical friction of the substructure during a quiescent evolutionepoch. this process ablates the cold gas from an embedded disk, cutting thestar formation rate by ~10, and heats up the spheroidal gas and stellarcomponents, triggering their expansion. the substructure is more resilient inthe presence of baryons. the disk which formed from inside-out as gasdominated, is transformed into an intermediate hubble type by z ~ 2 and to anearly type by z ~ 0.5, based on its gas contents and spheroidal-to-disk stellarmass ratio. only a relatively small ~20% fraction of dm particles in pdm andbdm models are bound within the radius of maximal circular velocity in the halo-- most of the dm particles perform larger radial excursions. we also find thatthe fraction of baryons within the halo virial radius somewhat increases duringthe major mergers and decreases during the minor mergers. the net effectappears to be negligible. while the substructure is being tidally-disrupted,mixing of its debris in the halo is not efficient and becomes even less so withz. the streamers formed after z ~ 1 survive largely to the present time -- animportant implication for embedded disk evolution.

0905.3134	constrained simulations of the local universe: ii. the nature of the  local hubble flow	using a suite of n-body simulations in different cold dark matter (cdm)scenarios, with cosmological constant (\lcdm) and without (ocdm, scdm), westudy the hubble flow (\sigh) in local volumes (lv) around local group (lg)like objects found in these simulations, and compare the numerical results withthe most recent observations. we show that \lcdm and ocdm models exhibit thesame behavior of \sigh. hence, we demonstrate that the observed coldness of thehubble flow is not likely to be a manifestation of the dark energy, contrary toprevious claims. the coldness does not constitute a problem by itself but itposes a problem to the standard \lcdm model only if the mean density within thelocal volume is greater than twice the mean matter cosmic density. the lack ofblueshifted galaxies in the lv, outside of the lg can be considered as anothermanifestation of the coldness of the flow. finally, we show that the maindynamical parameter that affects the coldness of the flow is the relativeisolation of the lg, and the absence of nearby milky way like objects within adistance of about $3\mpc$.

0909.1916	the grouping, merging and survival of subhaloes in the simulated local  group	we use a simulation performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study a realistic local group-like object. weemploy this group as a numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of thepopulation of its subhaloes from the point of view of the effects it may haveon the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. we focus on the processesof tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and groupingbefore infall. the tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition betweenthe phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occursat the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape oftheir mass function with redshift. although the satellites often form groups,they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. theinfall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiardistribution of the local group satellites, but only if it occurred recently.mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an earlystage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 gyr ago, when they are still outside thehost haloes. such events could thus contribute to the formation of more distantearly type milky way companions. once the subhaloes enter the host halo themergers become very rare.

0909.4423	constrained simulations of the local group: on the radial distribution  of substructures	we examine the properties of satellites found in high resolution simulationsof the local group. we use constrained simulations designed to reproduce themain dynamical features that characterize the local neighborhood, i.e. withintens of mpc around the local group (lg). specifically, a lg-like object isfound located within the 'correct' dynamical environment and consisting ofthree main objects which are associated with the milky way, m31 and m33. byrunning two simulations of this lg from identical initial conditions - one withand one without baryons modeled hydrodynamically - we can quantify the effectof gas physics on the $z=0$ population of subhaloes in an environment similarto our own. we find that above a certain mass cut, $m_{\rm sub} &gt;2\times10^{8}h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ subhaloes in hydrodynamic simulations are moreradially concentrated than those in simulations with out gas. this is caused bythe collapse of baryons into stars that typically sit in the central regions ofsubhaloes, making them denser. the increased central density of such a subhalo,results in less mass loss due to tidal stripping than the same subhalosimulated with only dark matter. the increased mass in hydrodynamic subhaloeswith respect to dark matter ones, causes dynamical friction to be moreeffective, dragging the subhalo towards the centre of the host. this results inthese subhaloes being effectively more radially concentrated then their darkmatter counterparts.

1002.2853	the impact of baryonic physics on the shape and radial alignment of  substructures in cosmological dark matter haloes	we use two simulations performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study both the shape and radial alignment of (thedark matter component of) subhaloes; one of the simulations is a dark matteronly model while the other run includes all the relevant gas physics and starformation recipes. we find that the involvement of gas physics does not have astatistically significant effect on either property -- at least not for themost massive subhaloes considered in this study. however, we observe in bothsimulations including and excluding gasdynamics a (pronounced) evolution of thedark matter shapes of subhaloes as well as of the radial alignment signal sinceinfall time. further, this evolution is different when positioned in thecentral and outer regions of the host halo today; while subhaloes tend tobecome more aspherical in the central 50% of their host's virial radius, theradial alignment weakens in the central regime while strengthening in the outerparts. we confirm that this is due to tidal torquing and the fact thatsubhaloes at pericentre move too fast for the alignment signal to respond.

1002.4200	dissecting galaxy formation: ii. comparing substructure in pure dark  matter and baryonic models	we compare the substructure evolution in pure dark matter (dm) halos withthose in the presence of baryons (pdm and bdm). the prime halos have beenanalyzed by romano-diaz et al (2009). models have been evolved from identicalinitial conditions using constrained realizations, including star formation andfeedback. a comprehensive catalog of subhalos has been compiled and propertiesof subhalos analyzed in the mass range of 10^8 mo - 10^11 mo. we find thatsubhalo mass functions are consistent with a single power law, m_sbh^{alpha},but detect a nonnegligible shift between these functions, alpha -0.86 for thepdm, and -0.98 for the bdm. overall, alpha const. in time with variations of+-15%. second, we find that the radial mass distribution of subhalos can beapproximated by a power law, r^{gamma} with a steepening around the radius of amaximal circular velocity, rvmax, in the prime halos. gamma ~-1.5 for the pdmand -1 for the bdm, inside rvmax, and is steeper outside. we detect littlespatial bias between the subhalo populations and the dm of the main halos. thesubhalo population exhibits much less triaxiality with baryons, in tandem withthe prime halo. finally, we find that, counter-intuitively, the bdm populationis depleted at a faster rate than the pdm one within the central 30kpc of theprime. although the baryons provide a substantial glue to the subhalos, themain halos exhibit the same trend. this assures a more efficient tidaldisruption of the bdm subhalos. this effect can be reversed for a moreefficient feedback from stellar evolution and supermassive black holes, whichwill expel baryons from the center and decrease the concentration of the primehalo. we compare our results with via lactea and aquarius simulations and otherpublished results.

1005.3139	reionization of the local group of galaxies	we present the first detailed structure formation and radiative transfersimulations of the reionization history of our cosmic neighbourhood. to thisend, we follow the formation of the local group of galaxies and nearby clustersby means of constrained simulations, which use the available observationalconstraints to construct a representation of those structures which reproducestheir actual positions and properties at the present time. we find that thereionization history of the local group is strongly dependent on the assumedphoton production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorlyconstrained. if sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is'photon-rich', the local group is primarily ionized externally by the nearbyclusters. alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is'photon-poor' the local group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.the mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications forthe evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxypopulations and primordial stellar populations. this therefore provides animportant avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies ofour nearby structures.

1010.1531	the preferred direction of infalling satellite galaxies in the local  group	using a high resolution dm simulation of the local group (lg), conductedwithin the framework of the constrained local universe simulation (clues)project, we investigate the nature of how satellites of the mw and m31 areaccreted. satellites of these galaxies are accreted anisotropically, enteringthe virial radius of their hosts from specific "spots" with respect to thelarge scale structure. furthermore, material which is tidally stripped fromthese satellites is also, at z=0, distributed anisotropically and ischaracterized by an ellipsoidal sub-volume embedded in the halo. the angularpattern created by the locus of satellite infall points and the projectedstripped dm is investigated within a coordinate system determined by thelocation of the lg companion and the simulated virgo cluster across concentricshells ranging from 0.1 to 5 r_vir. remarkably, the principal axis of theellipsoidal sub-volume shows a coherent alignment extending from well withinthe halo to a few r_vir. a spherical harmonics transform applied to the angulardistributions confirms the visual impression: namely, the angular distributionsof both the satellites entry points and stripped dm is dominated by the l=2quadrupole term, whose major principal axis is aligned across the shellsconsidered. it follows that the structure of the outer (r&gt;0.5 r_vir) regions ofthe main halos is closely related to the cosmic web within which it isembedded. given the hypothesis that a large fraction of the stellar halo of themilky way has been accreted from satellites, the present results can be appliedto the stellar halo of the mw and m31. we predict that the remnants of tidallystripped satellites should be embedded in streams of material composed of darkmatter and stars. the present results can therefore shed light on the existenceof satellites embedded within larger streams of matter, such as the segue 2satellite.

1010.3715	the dark side of qso formation at high redshifts	observed high-redshift qsos, at z~6, may reside in massive dark matter (dm)halos of more than 10^{12} msun and are thus expected to be surrounded byoverdense regions. in a series of 10 constrained simulations, we have testedthe environment of such qsos. comparing the computed overdensities with respectto the unconstrained simulations of regions empty of qsos, assuming there is nobias between the dm and baryon distributions, and invoking anobservationally-constrained duty-cycle for lyman break galaxies, we haveobtained the galaxy count number for the qso environment. we find that a cleardiscrepancy exists between the computed and observed galaxy counts in the kimet al. (2009) samples. our simulations predict that on average eight z~6galaxies per qso field should have been observed, while kim et al. detect onaverage four galaxies per qso field compared to an average of three galaxies ina control sample (goods fields). while we cannot rule out a small numberstatistics for the observed fields to high confidence, the discrepancy suggeststhat galaxy formation in the qso neighborhood proceeds differently than in thefield. we also find that qso halos are the most massive of the simulated volumeat z~6 but this is no longer true at z~3. this implies that qso halos, even inthe case they are the most massive ones at high redshifts, do not evolve intomost massive galaxy clusters at z=0.

1107.2944	renegade subhaloes in the local group	using a dark matter only constrained local universe simulation (clues) weexamine the existence of subhaloes that change their affiliation from one ofthe two prominent hosts in the local group (i.e. the milky way and theandromeda galaxy) to the other, and call these objects "renegade subhaloes". inlight of recent claims that the two magellanic clouds (mcs) may have originatedfrom another region (or even the outskirts) of the local group or that theyhave been spawned by a major merger in the past of the andromeda galaxy, weinvestigate the nature of such events. however, we cannot confirm that renegadesubhaloes enter as deep into the potential well of their present host nor thatthey share the most simplest properties with the mcs, namely mass and relativevelocity. our simulation rather suggests that these renegade subhaloes appearto be flying past one host before being pulled into the other. a merger is notrequired to trigger such an event, it is rather the distinct environment of oursimulated local group facilitating such behavior. since just a small fractionof the full z=0 subhalo population are renegades, our study indicates that itwill be intrinsically difficult to distinguish them despite clear differencesin their velocity, radial distribution, shape and spin parameter distributions.

1107.4366	disentangling the dark matter halo from the stellar halo	the outer haloes of the milky way and andromeda galaxies contain as muchimportant information on their assembly and formation history as the propertiesof the discs resident in their centres. in this paper we have used theconstrained local universe simulation project to disentangle the stellar and dmcomponent of three galaxies that resemble the mw, m31 and m33 using both dmonly and dm + gas-dynamical simulations. stars that are accreted insubstructures and then stripped follow a completely different radialdistribution than the stripped dm: the stellar halo is much more centrallyconcentrated than dm. in order to understand how the same physical process canlead to different z=0 radial profiles, we examined the potential at accretionof each stripped particle. we found that star particles sit at systematicallyhigher potentials than dm, making them harder to strip. we then searched for athreshold in the potential of accreted particles \phi_[th], above which dmparticles behave as star particles. we found such a threshold at &gt;16\phi_{subhalo}, where \phi_{subhalo} is the potential at a subhaloes edge atthe time of accretion. thus a rule as simple as selecting particles accordingto their potential at accretion is able to reproduce the effect that thecomplicated physics of star formation has on the stellar distribution. thisniversal result reproduces the stellar halo to an accuracy of within ~2%.studies which make use of dm particles as a proxy for stars will undoubtedlymiscalculate their proper radial distribution and structure unless particlesare selected according to their potential at accretion. furthermore, we haveexamined the time it takes to strip a given star or dm particle afteraccretion. we find that, owing to their higher binding energies, stars takelonger to be stripped than dm. the stripped dm halo is thus considerably olderthan the stripped stellar halo.

1107.5045	too small to succeed? lighting up massive dark matter subhaloes of the  milky way	using constrained local universe simulations (clues) of the formation of thelocal group in a cosmological context we investigate the recently highlightedproblem that the majority of the most massive dark subhaloes of the milky wayare too dense to host any of its bright satellites. in particular, we examinethe influence of baryonic processes and find that they leave a twofold effecton the relation between the peak of the rotation curve and its position (vmaxand rmax). satellites with a large baryon fraction experience adiabaticcontraction thus decreasing rmax while leaving vmax more or less unchanged.subhaloes with smaller baryon fractions undergo a decrease in vmax possibly dueto outflows of material. furthermore, the situation of finding subhaloes insimulations that lie outside the confidence interval for possible hosts of thebright mw dwarf spheroidals, appears to be far more prominent in cosmologieswith a high sigma8 normalisation and depends on the mass of the host. weconclude that the problem cannot be simply solved by including baryonicprocesses and hence demands further investigations.

1109.3856	3d velocity and density reconstructions of the local universe with  cosmicflows-1	this paper presents an analysis of the local peculiar velocity field based onthe wiener filter reconstruction method. we used our currently availablecatalog of distance measurements containing 1,797 galaxies within 3000 km/s:cosmicflows-1. the wiener filter method is used to recover the full 3d peculiarvelocity field from the observed map of radial velocities and to recover theunderlying linear density field. the velocity field within a data zone of 3000km/s is decomposed into a local component that is generated within the datazone and a tidal one that is generated by the mass distribution outside thatzone. the tidal component is characterized by a coherent flow toward thenorma-hydra-centaurus (great attractor) region while the local component isdominated by a flow toward the virgo cluster and away from the local void. adetailed analysis shows that the local flow is predominantly governed by thelocal void and the virgo cluster plays a lesser role. the analysis procedurewas tested against a mock catalog. it is demonstrated that the wiener filteraccurately recovers the input velocity field of the mock catalog on the scaleof the extraction of distances and reasonably recovers the velocity field onsignificantly larger scales. the bayesian wiener filter reconstruction iscarried out within the ?cdm wmap5 framework. the wiener filter reconstructiondraws particular attention to the importance of voids in proximity to ourneighborhood. the prominent structure of the local supercluster is wrapped in ahorseshoe collar of under density with the local void as a major component.

1111.6629	estimating cosmic velocity fields from density fields and tidal tensors	in this work we investigate the nonlinear and nonlocal relation betweencosmological density and peculiar velocity fields. our goal is to provide analgorithm for the recon- struction of the nonlinear velocity field from thefully nonlinear density. we find that including the gravitational tidal fieldtensor using second order lagrangian perturba- tion theory (2lpt) based upon anestimate of the linear component of the nonlinear density field significantlyimproves the estimate of the cosmic flow in comparison to linear theory notonly in the low density, but also and more dramatically in the high densityregions. in particular we test two estimates of the linear component: the log-normal model and the iterative lagrangian linearisation. the present approachrelies on a rigorous higher order lagrangian perturbation theory analysis whichincorpo- rates a nonlocal relation. it does not require additional fitting fromsimulations being in this sense parameter free, it is independent ofstatistical-geometrical optimisation and it is straightforward and efficient tocompute. the method is demonstrated to yield an unbiased estimator of thevelocity field on scales ~&gt; 5 mpc/h with closely gaussian distributed errors.moreover, the statistics of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field isextremely well recovered showing a good agreement with the true one from n-bodysimulations. the typical errors of about 10 km/s (1 sigma confidence intervals)are reduced by more than 80% with respect to linear theory in the scale rangebetween 5 and 10 mpc/h in high density regions ({\delta} &gt; 2). we also findthat iterative lagrangian linearisation is significantly superior in the lowdensity regime with respect to the lognormal model.

1201.3365	the cosmic web and the orientation of angular momenta	we use a 64$h^{-1}$mpc dark matter (dm) only cosmological simulation toexamine the large scale orientation of haloes and substructures with respectthe cosmic web. a web classification scheme based on the velocity shear tensoris used to assign to each halo in the simulation a web type: knot, filament,sheet or void. using $\sim10^6$ haloes that span ~3 orders of magnitude in massthe orientation of the halo's spin and the orbital angular momentum ofsubhaloes with respect to the eigenvectors of the shear tensor is examined. wefind that the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes tends to align with theintermediate eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor for all haloes in knots,filaments and sheets. this result indicates that the kinematics ofsubstructures located deep within the virialized regions of a halo isdetermined by its infall which in turn is determined by the large scalevelocity shear, a surprising result given the virilaized nature of haloes. thenon-random nature of subhalo accretion is thus imprinted on the angularmomentum measured at z = 0. we also find that haloes' spin axis is aligned withthe third eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor in filaments and sheets: thehalo spin axis points along filaments and lies in the plane of cosmic sheets.

1201.3367	a kinematic classification of the cosmic web	a new approach for the classification of the cosmic web is presented. inextension of the previous work of hahn et al. (2007) and forero-romero et al.(2009) the new algorithm is based on the analysis of the velocity shear tensorrather than the gravitational tidal tensor. the procedure consists of theconstruction of the the shear tensor at each (grid) point in space and theevaluation of its three eigenvectors. a given point is classified to be eithera void, sheet, filament or a knot according to the number of eigenvalues abovea certain threshold, 0, 1, 2, or 3 respectively. the threshold is treated as afree parameter that defines the web. the algorithm has been applied to a darkmatter only, high resolution simulation of a box of side-length 64$h^{-1}$mpcand n = $1024^3$ particles with the framework of the wmap5/lcdm model. theresulting velocity based cosmic web resolves structures down to &lt;0.1$h^{-1}$mpcscales, as opposed to the ~1$h^{-1}$mpc scale of the tidal based web. theunder-dense regions are made of extended voids bisected by planar sheets, whosedensity is also below the mean. the over-dense regions are vastly dominated bythe linear filaments and knots. the resolution achieved by the velocity basedcosmic web provides a platform for studying the formation of halos and galaxieswithin the framework of the cosmic web.

0704.3385	constrained simulations of the local universe: i. mass and motion in the  local volume	it has been recently claimed that there is no correlation between thedistribution of galaxies and their peculiar velocities within the local volume(lv), namely a sphere of r=7/h mpc around the local group (lg). it has beenthen stated that this implies that either locally dark matter is notdistributed in the same way as luminous matter, or peculiar velocities are notdue to fluctuations in mass. to test that statement a set of constrained n-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. the simulations were performed within theflat-lambda, open and flat matter only cdm cosmogonies. two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-lambda and open cdm models were performed forcomparison. lg-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real lgenvironment. the local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachlv is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation. we conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and thelocal gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos.moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiarvelocities of halos. the exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. uponconsidering all matter inside the lvs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models. the main conclusion is that the lack ofcorrelation between the local gravitation and the peculiar velocity fieldsaround lg-like objects is naturally expected in the cdm cosmologies.

1204.0005	applying scale-free mass estimators to the local group in constrained  local universe simulations	we use the recently proposed scale-free mass estimators to determine themasses of the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) galaxy in a dark matter onlyconstrained local universe simulation (clues). while these mass estimators workrather well for isolated spherical host systems, we examine here theirapplicability to a simulated binary system with a unique satellite populationsimilar to the observed satellites of mw and m31. we confirm that thescale-free estimators work also very well in our simulated local group galaxieswith the right number of satellites which follow the observed radialdistribution. in the isotropic case and under the assumption that thesatellites are tracking the total gravitating mass, the power-law index of theradial satellite distribution $n(&lt;r)\propto r^{3-\gamma}$ is directly relatedto the host's mass profile $m(&lt;r)\propto r^{1-\alpha}$ as $\alpha=\gamma-2$.the use of this relation for any given $\gamma$ leads to highly accurate massestimations which is a crucial point for observer, since they do not know apriori the mass profile of the mw and m31 haloes. we discuss possible bias inthe mass estimators and conclude that the scale-free mass estimators can besatisfactorily applied to the real mw and m31 system.

1204.0515	size matters: the non-universal density profile of subhaloes in sph  simulations and implications for the milky way's dsphs	we use dark matter only and full hydrodynamical constrained local universesimulations (clues) of the formation of the local group to study the densityprofile of subhaloes of the simulated milky way and andromeda galaxies. we showthat the einasto model provides the best description of the subhaloes' densityprofile, as opposed to the more commonly used nfw profile or any generalisationof it. we further find that the einasto shape parameter \nein\ is stronglycorrelated with the total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of anon-universality of the subhaloes' density profile. we observe that the effectof mass loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and thehydrodynamical run, is the reduction of the shape parameter \nein\ between theinfall and the present time. assuming now that the dsphs of our galaxy followthe einasto profile and using the maximum and minimum values of \nein\ from ourhydrodynamical simulation as a gauge, we can improve the observationalconstraints on the \rmax-\vmax\ pairs obtained for the brightest satellitegalaxies of the milky way. when considering only the subhaloes with$-13.2\lesssim m_v\lesssim-8.8$, i.e. the range of luminosity of the classicaldwarfs, we find that all our simulated objects are consistent with the observeddsphs if their haloes follow the einasto model with $1.6\lesssim n_{\rm e}\lesssim5.3$. the numerically motivated einasto profile for the observed dsphswill alleviate the recently presented "massive failures" problem.

1205.5560	cosmic structure and dynamics of the local universe	we present a cosmography analysis of the local universe based on the recentlyreleased two-micron all-sky redshift survey (2mrs). our method is based on abayesian networks machine learning algorithm (the kigen-code) whichself-consistently samples the initial density fluctuations compatible with theobserved galaxy distribution and a structure formation model given by secondorder lagrangian perturbation theory (2lpt). from the initial conditions weobtain an ensemble of reconstructed density and peculiar velocity fields whichcharacterize the local cosmic structure with high accuracy unveiling nonlinearstructures like filaments and voids in detail. coherent redshift spacedistortions are consistently corrected within 2lpt. from the ensemble ofcross-correlations between the reconstructions and the galaxy field and thevariance of the recovered density fields we find that our method is extremelyaccurate up to k ~ 1 h mpc^-1 and still yields reliable results down to scalesof about 3-4 h^-1 mpc. the motion of the local group we obtain within ~ 80 h^-1mpc (v_lg=522+-86 km s^-1, l_lg=291^o +- 16^o, b_lg=34^o+-8^o) is in goodagreement with measurements derived from the cmb and from direct observationsof peculiar motions and is consistent with the predictions of lambdacdm.

0711.3791	dark matter halos: velocity anisotropy -- density slope relation	dark matter (dm) halos formed in cdm cosmologies seem to be characterized bya power law phase-space density profile. the density of the dm halos is oftenfitted by the nfw profile but a better fit is provided by the sersic fittingformula. these relations are empirically derived from cosmological simulationsof structure formation but have not yet been explained on a first principlebasis. here we solve the jeans equation under the assumption of a spherical dmhalo in dynamical equilibrium, that obeys a power law phase space density andeither the nfw-like or the sersic density profile. we then calculate thevelocity anisotropy, beta(r), analytically. our main result is that for thenfw-like profile the beta - gamma relation is not a linear one (where gamma isthe logarithmic derivative of the density rho[r]). the shape of beta(r) dependsmostly on the ratio of the gravitational to kinetic energy within the nfw scaleradius r_s. for the sersic profile a linear beta - gamma relation is recovered,and in particular for the sersic index of n = 6.0 case the linear fit of hansen&amp; moore is reproduced. our main result is that the phase-space density powerlaw, the sersic density form and the linear beta - gamma dependence constitutea consistent set of relations which obey the spherical jeans equation and assuch provide the framework for the dynamical modeling of dm halos.

1210.4559	the velocity shear tensor: tracer of halo alignment	the alignment of dm halos and the surrounding large scale structure (lss) isexamined in the context of the cosmic web. halo spin, shape and the orbitalangular momentum of subhaloes is investigated relative to the lss using theeigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1mpc/h, deep within the non-linear regime. knots, filaments, sheets and voidsare associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principaldirections simultaneously. each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e.knot halo, filament halo, etc) according to the nature of the collapse at thehalo's position. the full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to besubstantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that theobserved velocity shear is significantly biased. we find that larger masshaloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansionor collapse is more spherical. a correlation is found between the halo's shapeand the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis ofthe halo's shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsingeigenvector. this correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocityshear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. a similar result is foundfor the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. it has been shown that highmass haloes exhibit a spin flip with respect to the lss: we find the mass atwhich this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggestedpreviously. although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit analignment with the lss, providing a possible insight into the highly correlatedco-rotation of the milky way's satellite system. the present study suggeststhat the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studyingthe directional properties of the non-linear lss and of halos and galaxies.

1211.0536	dwarf galaxies and the cosmic web	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group ofgalaxies to identify a mechanism that enables the removal of baryons fromlow-mass halos without appealing to feedback or reionization. as the localgroup forms, matter bound to it develops a network of filaments and pancakes.this moving web of gas and dark matter drifts and sweeps a large volume,overtaking many halos in the process. the dark matter content of these halos isunaffected but their gas can be efficiently removed by ram-pressure. the lossof gas is especially pronounced in low-mass halos due to their lower bindingenergy and has a dramatic effect on the star formation history of affectedsystems. this "cosmic web stripping" may help to explain the scarcity of dwarfgalaxies compared with the numerous low-mass halos expected in \lambda cdm andthe large diversity of star formation histories and morphologies characteristicof faint galaxies. although our results are based on a single high-resolutionsimulation, it is likely that the hydrodynamical interaction of dwarf galaxieswith the cosmic web is a crucial ingredient so far missing from galaxyformation models.

1212.1454	cosmic vorticity and the origin of halo spins	in the standard model of cosmology, structure emerges out of non-rotationalflow and the angular momentum of collapsing halos is induced by tidal torques.the growth of halo angular momentum in the linear and quasi-linear phases isassociated with a shear, curl-free, flow and it is well described within thelinear framework of tidal torque theory (ttt). however, ttt is renderedirrelevant as haloes approach turn around and virialization. at that stage theflow field around halos has non-zero vorticity. using a cosmologicalsimulation, we have examined the importance of the curl of the velocity field(vorticity) in determining halo spin, finding a strong alignment between thetwo. we have also examined the alignment of vorticity with the principle axesof the shear tensor, finding that it tends to be perpendicular to the axisalong which material is collapsing fastest (e1). this behavior is independentof halo masses and cosmic web environment. our results agree with previousfindings on the tendency of halo spin to be perpendicular to e1, and of thespin of (simulated) halos and (observed) galaxies to be aligned with thelarge-scale structure. our results imply that angular momentum growth proceedsin two distinct phases. in the first phase angular momentum emerges out of ashear, curl-free, potential flow, as described by ttt. in the second phase, inwhich haloes approach virialization, the angular momentum emerges out of avortical flow and halo spin becomes strongly aligned with the vorticity of theambient flow field.

1212.2806	reconstructing cosmological initial conditions from galaxy peculiar  velocities. i. reverse zeldovich approximation	we propose a new method to recover the cosmological initial conditions of thepresently observed galaxy distribution, which can serve to run constrainedsimulations of the local universe. our method, the reverse zeldovichapproximation (rza), can be applied to radial galaxy peculiar velocity data andextends the previously used constrained realizations (cr) method by adding alagrangian reconstruction step. the rza method consists of applying thezeldovich approximation in reverse to galaxy peculiar velocities to estimatethe cosmic displacement field and the initial linear matter distribution fromwhich the present-day local universe evolved.we test our method with a mocksurvey taken from a cosmological simulation. we show that the halo peculiarvelocities at z = 0 are close to the linear prediction of the zeldovichapproximation, if a grouping is applied to the data to remove virial motions.we find that the addition of rza to the cr method significantly improves thereconstruction of the initial conditions. the rza is able to recover thecorrect initial positions of the velocity tracers with a median error of only1.36 mpc/h in our test simulation. for realistic sparse and noisy data, thismedian increases to 5 mpc/h. this is a significant improvement over theprevious approach of neglecting the displacement field, which introduces errorson a scale of 10 mpc/h or even higher. applying the rza method to the upcominghigh-quality observational peculiar velocity catalogues will generate much moreprecise constrained simulations of the local universe.

1212.2808	reconstructing cosmological initial conditions from galaxy peculiar  velocities. ii. the effect of observational errors	the reverse zeldovich approximation (rza) is a reconstruction method whichallows to estimate the cosmic displacement field from galaxy peculiar velocitydata and to constrain initial conditions for cosmological simulations of thelocal universe. in this paper, we investigate the effect of differentobservational errors on the reconstruction quality of this method. for this, webuild a set of mock catalogues from a cosmological simulation, varyingdifferent error sources like the galaxy distance measurement error (0 - 20%),the sparseness of the data points, and the maximum catalogue radius (3000 -6000 km/s). we perform the rza reconstruction of the initial conditions onthese mock catalogues and compare with the actual initial conditions of thesimulation. we also investigate the impact of the fact that only the radialpart of the peculiar velocity is observationally accessible. we find that thesparseness of a dataset has the highest detrimental effect on rzareconstruction quality. observational distance errors also have a significantinfluence, but it is possible to compensate this relatively well with wienerfilter reconstruction. we also investigate the effect of different objectselection criteria and find that distance catalogues distributed randomly andhomogeneously across the sky (such as spiral galaxies selected for thetully-fisher method) allow for a higher reconstruction quality than if whendata is preferentially drawn from massive objects or dense environments (suchas elliptical galaxies). we find that the error of estimating the initialconditions with rza is always dominated by the inherent non-linearity of dataobserved at z=0 rather than by the combined effect of the observational errors.even an extremely sparse dataset with high observational errors still leads toa good reconstruction of the initial conditions on a scale of about 5 mpc/h.

1212.2810	reconstructing cosmological initial conditions from galaxy peculiar  velocities. iii. constrained simulations	in previous works we proposed the reverse zeldovich approximation (rza)method, which can be used to estimate the cosmological initial conditionsunderlying the galaxy distribution in the local universe using peculiarvelocity data. in this paper, we apply the technique to run constrainedcosmological simulations from the rza-reconstructed initial conditions,designed to reproduce the large-scale structure of the local universe. we testthe method with mock peculiar velocity catalogues extracted from a referencesimulation. we first reconstruct the initial conditions of this referencesimulation using the mock data, and then run the reconstructed initialconditions forward in time until z=0. we compare the resulting constrainedsimulations with the original simulation at z=0 to test the accuracy of thismethod. we also compare them with constrained simulations run from the mockdata without the addition of rza, i.e. using only the currently establishedconstrained realizations (cr) method. our re-simulations are able to correctlyrecover the evolution of the large-scale structure underlying the data. theresults show that the addition of rza to the cr method significantly improvesboth the reconstruction of the initial conditions and the accuracy of theobtained constrained resimulations. haloes from the original simulation arerecovered in the re-simulations with an average accuracy of about 2 mpc/h ontheir position and a factor of 2 in mass, down to haloes with a mass of approx10^14 m_odot/h. in comparison, without rza the re-simulations recover only themost massive haloes with masses of about 5x10^14 m_odot/h and higher, and witha systematic shift on their position of about approx 10 mpc/h due to the cosmicdisplacement field. we show that with the additional lagrangian reconstructionstep introduced by the rza, this shift can be removed.

1303.2690	the kinematics of the local group in a cosmological context	recent observations constrained the tangential velocity of m31 with respectto the milky way (mw) to be v_tan&lt;34.4 km/s and the radial velocity to be inthe range v_rad=-109+/- 4.4 km/s (van der marel et al. 2012). in this study weuse a large volume high resolution n-body cosmological simulation (bolshoi)together with three constrained simulations to statistically study thiskinematics in the context of the lcdm. the comparison of the ensembles ofsimulated pairs with the observed lg at the 1-sigma level in the uncertaintieshas been done with respect to the radial and tangential velocities, the reducedorbital energy (e_tot), angular momentum (l_orb) and the dimensionless spinparameter, lambda. our main results are: (i) the preferred radial andtangential velocities for pairs in lcdm are v_rad=-80+/-20 km/s, v_tan=50+/-10km/s, (ii) pairs around that region are 3 to 13 times more common than pairswithin the observational values, (iii) 15%to 24% of lg-like pairs in lcdm haveenergy and angular momentum consistent with observations while (iv) 9% to 13%of pairs in the same sample show similar values in the inferred dimensionlessspin parameter. it follows that within current observational uncertainties thequasi-conserved quantities that characterize the orbit of the lg, i.e. e_tot,r_orb and lambda, do not challenge the standard lcdm model, but the model is intension with regard to the actual values of the radial and tangentialvelocities. this might hint to a problem of the lcdm model to reproduce theobserved lg.

1310.5706	the velocity shear and vorticity across redshifts and non-linear scales	the evolution of the large scale distribution of matter in the universe isoften characterized by the density field. here we take a complimentary approachand characterize it using the cosmic velocity field, specifically thedeformation of the velocity field. the deformation tensor is decomposed intoits symmetric component (known as the "shear tensor") and its anti-symmetricpart (the "vorticity"). using a high resolution cosmological simulation weexamine the relative orientations of the shear and the vorticity as a functionof spatial scale and redshift. the shear is found to be remarkable stable tothe choice of scale, while the vorticity is found to quickly decay withincreasing spatial scale or redshift. the vorticity emerges out of the linearregime randomly oriented with respect to the shear eigenvectors. non-linearevolution drives the vorticity to lie within the plane defined by theeigenvector of the fastest collapse. within that plane the vorticity first getsaligned with the middle eigenvector and then it moves to be preferentiallyaligned with the third eigenvector, of slowest collapse. finally a scale of"non-linearity" to be used when calculating properties of the non-lineardeformation tensor at different redshifts is suggested.

1311.2253	simulations of the local universe constrained by observational peculiar  velocities	peculiar velocities, obtained from direct distance measurements, are data ofchoice to achieve constrained simulations of the local universe reliable downto a scale of a few megaparsecs. unlike redshift surveys, peculiar velocitiesare direct tracers of the underlying gravitational field as they trace bothbaryonic and dark matter. this paper presents the first attempt to use solelyobservational peculiar velocities to constrain cosmological simulations of thenearby universe. in order to set up initial conditions, a reverse zel'dovichapproximation (rza) is used to displace constraints from their positions at z=0to their precursors' locations at higher redshifts. an additional new featurereplaces original observed radial peculiar velocity vectors by their full 3dreconstructions provided by the wiener-filter (wf) estimator. subsequently, theconstrained realization of gaussian fields technique (cr) is applied to buildvarious realizations of the initial conditions. the wf/rza/cr method is firsttested on realistic mock catalogs built from a reference simulation similar tothe local universe. these mocks include errors on peculiar velocities, ondata-point positions and a large continuous zone devoid of data in order tomimic galactic extinction. large scale structures are recovered with a typicalaccuracy of 5 megaparsecs/h in position, the best realizations reaching a 2-3mpc/h precision, the limit imposed by the rza linear theory. then, the methodis applied to the first observational radial peculiar velocity catalog of theproject cosmicflows. this paper is a proof of concept that the wf/rza/cr methodcan be applied to observational peculiar velocities to successfully buildconstrained initial conditions.

0802.1917	on the relation between radial alignment of dark matter subhalos and  host mass in cosmological simulations	we explore the dependence of the radial alignment of subhalos on the mass ofthe host halo they orbit in. as the effect is seen on a broad range of scalesincluding massive clusters as well as galactic systems it only appears naturalto explore this phenomenon by means of cosmological simulations covering thesame range in masses. we have 25 well resolved host dark matter halos at ourdisposal ranging from 10^15 msun/h down to 10^12 msun/h each consisting oforder of a couple of million particles within the virial radius. we observethat subhalos tend to be more spherical than isolated objects. both thedistributions of sphericity and triaxiality of subhalos are gaussiandistributed with peak values of s approx. 0.80 and t approx. 0.56, irrespectiveof host mass. interestingly we note that the radial alignment is independent ofhost halo mass and the distribution of \cos\theta (i.e. the angle between themajor axis e_a of each subhalo and the radius vector of the subhalo in thereference frame of the host) is well fitted by a simple power law p(\cos\theta)proportional to \cos^4\theta with the same fitting parameters for all hosthalos.

1405.5540	the imprint of reionization on the star formation histories of dwarf  galaxies	we explore the impact of cosmic reionization on nearby isolated dwarfgalaxies using a compilation of sfhs estimated from deep hst data and acosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the local group. the nearby dwarfsshow a wide diversity of star formation histories; from ancient systems thathave largely completed their star formation $\sim 10$ gyr ago to young dwarfsthat have formed the majority of their stars in the past $\sim 5$ gyr totwo-component systems characterized by the overlap of comparable numbers of oldand young stars. taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips tolower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4&lt;t$/gyr $&lt;8$), a feature thatwe trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. reionizationheats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low masshalos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that correspondsto a virial temperature of $\sim 2 \times 10^4 $ $\mathrm{k}$ at $z_{\rmreion}$.  the loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity ofearly-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early starformation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single oldstellar component prevails. in halos below the threshold at $z_{\rm reion}$,reionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lastsuntil the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cooland form stars. young stellar components therefore dominate in dwarfs whosehalos assemble late and thus form few stars before reionization. two-componentsystems may be traced to late mergers of individual examples of the twoaforementioned cases. the relative dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearbydwarfs might thus be the clearest signature yet identified of the imprint ofcosmic reionization on the star formation history of dwarf galaxies.

1407.0394	the universal nature of subhalo accretion	we examine the angular infall pattern of subhaloes onto host haloes in thecontext of the large-scale structure. we find that this infall pattern isessentially driven by the shear tensor of the ambient velocity field. darkmatter subhaloes are found to be preferentially accreted along the principalaxis of the shear tensor which corresponds to the direction of weakestcollapse. we examine the dependence of this preferential infall on subhalomass, host halo mass and redshift. although strongest for the most massivehosts and the most massive subhaloes at high redshift, the preferential infallof subhaloes is effectively universal in the sense that its always aligned withthe axis of weakest collapse of the velocity shear tensor. it is the same sheartensor that dictates the structure of the cosmic web and hence the shear fieldemerges as the key factor that governs the local anisotropic pattern ofstructure formation. since the small (sub-mpc) scale is strongly correlatedwith the mid-range (~10 mpc) scale - a scale accessible by current surveys ofpeculiar velocities - it follows that findings presented here open a new windowinto the relation between the observed large scale structure unveiled bycurrent surveys of peculiar velocities and the preferential infall direction ofthe local group. this may shed light on the unexpected alignments of dwarfgalaxies seen in the local group

1503.05422	cosmic bulk flow and the local motion from cosmicflows-2	full sky surveys of peculiar velocity are arguably the best way to map thelarge scale structure out to distances of a few times 100 mpc/h. using thelargest and most accurate ever catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities"cosmicflows-2", the large scale structure has been reconstructed by means ofthe wiener filter and constrained realizations assuming as a bayesian priormodel the lcdm model with the wmap inferred cosmological parameters. thepresent paper focuses on studying the bulk flow of the local flow field,defined as the mean velocity of top-hat spheres with radii ranging out to r=500mpc/h. the estimated large scale structures, in general, and the bulk flow, inparticular, are determined by the tension between the observational data andthe assumed prior model. a prerequisite for such an analysis is the requirementthat the estimated bulk flow is consistent with the prior model. such aconsistency is found here. at r=50(150) mpc/h the estimated bulk velocity is250+/-21 (239+/-38) km/s. the corresponding cosmic variance at these radii is126(60)km/s, which implies that these estimated bulk flows are dominated by thedata and not by the assumed prior model. the estimated bulk velocity isdominated by the data out to r~200 mpc/h, where the cosmic variance on theindividual supergalactic cartesian components (of the r.m.s. values) exceedsthe variance of the constrained realizations by at least a factor of 2. thesupergalactic sgx and sgy components of the cmb dipole velocity are recoveredby the wiener filter velocity field down to a very few km/s. the sgz componentof the estimated velocity, the one that is most affected by the zone ofavoidance, is off by 126 km/s (an almost 2 sigma discrepancy).

1503.05915	planes of satellite galaxies and the cosmic web	recent observational studies have demonstrated that the majority of satellitegalaxies tend to orbit their hosts on highly flattened, vast, possiblyco-rotating planes. two nearly parallel planes of satellites have beenconfirmed around the m31 galaxy and around the centaurus a galaxy, while themilky way also sports a plane of satellites. it has been argued that such analignment of satellites on vast planes is unexpected in the standard({\lambda}cdm) model of cosmology if not even in contradiction to its genericpredictions. guided by {\lambda}cdm numerical simulations, which suggest thatsatellites are channeled towards hosts along the axis of the slowest collapseas dictated by the ambient velocity shear tensor, we re-examine the planes oflocal satellites systems within the framework of the local shear tensor derivedfrom the cosmicflows-2 dataset. the analysis reveals that the local group andcentaurus a reside in a filament stretched by the virgo cluster and compressedby the expansion of the local void. four out of five thin planes of satellitegalaxies are indeed closely aligned with the axis of compression induced by thelocal void. being the less massive system, the moderate misalignment of themilky way's satellite plane can likely be ascribed to its greatersusceptibility to tidal torques, as suggested by numerical simulations. thealignment of satellite systems in the local universe with the ambient shearfield is thus in general agreement with predictions of the {\lambda}cdm model.

1505.07454	filaments from the galaxy distribution and from the velocity field in  the local universe	the cosmic web that characterizes the large-scale structure of the universecan be quantified by a variety of methods. for example, large redshift surveyscan be used in combination with point process algorithms to extract longcurvilinear filaments in the galaxy distribution. alternatively, given a full3d reconstruction of the velocity field, kinematic techniques can be used todecompose the web into voids, sheets, filaments and knots. in this paper welook at how two such algorithms - the bisous model and the velocity shear web -compare with each other in the local universe (within 100 mpc), finding goodagreement. this is both remarkable and comforting, given that the two methodsare radically different in ideology and applied to completely independent anddifferent data sets. unsurprisingly, the methods are in better agreement whenapplied to unbiased and complete data sets, like cosmological simulations, thanwhen applied to observational samples. we conclude that more observational datais needed to improve on these methods, but that both methods are most likelyproperly tracing the underlying distribution of matter in the universe.

1512.02236	the alignment of galaxy spin with the shear field in observations	tidal torque theory suggests that galaxies gain angular momentum in thelinear stage of structure formation. such a theory predicts alignments betweenthe spin of haloes and tidal shear field. however, non-linear evolution andangular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. in thispaper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic shear field from observed peculiarvelocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within $115\,\mathrm{mpc} $ ($\sim8000 \, {\mathrm {km}}{\mathrm s}^{-1}$) from 2mrscatalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes ofshear field. although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked atsimilar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments withvelocity-shear field. ellipticals in the 2mrs sample, show a statisticallysignificant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. ingeneral, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis ofgreatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression.spiral galaxies show no signal. such an alignment is significantly strengthenedwhen considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity fieldreconstruction. when examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axisof greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. this resultindicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairlynoisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strongenough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered -especially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.

0808.0195	erasing dark matter cusps in cosmological galactic halos with baryons	we study the central dark matter (dm) cusp evolution in cosmological galactichalos. models with and without baryons (baryons+dm, hereafter bdm model, andpure dm, pdm model, respectively) are advanced from identical initialconditions. the dm cusp properties are contrasted by a direct comparison ofpure dm and baryonic models. we find a divergent evolution between the pdm andbdm models within the inner ~10 kpc region. the pdm model forms a r^{-1} cuspas expected, while the dm in the bdm model forms a larger isothermal cuspr^{-2} instead. the isothermal cusp is stable until z~1 when it graduallylevels off. this leveling proceeds from inside out and the final density slopeis shallower than -1 within the central 3 kpc (i.e., expected size of ther^{-1} cusp), tending to a flat core within ~2 kpc. this effect cannot beexplained by a finite resolution of our code which produces only a 5%difference between the gravitationally softened force and the exact newtonianforce of point masses at 1 kpc from the center. neither is it related to theenergy feedback from stellar evolution or angular momentum transfer from thebar. instead it can be associated with the action of dm+baryon subhalos heatingup the cusp region via dynamical friction and forcing the dm in the cusp toflow out and to `cool' down. the process described here is not limited to low zand can be efficient at intermediate and even high z.

astro-ph;0003306	goodness-of-fit analysis of radial velocities surveys	using eigenmode expansion of the mark-3 and sfi surveys of cosmologicalradial velocities a goodness-of-fit analysis is applied on a mode-by-modebasis. this differential analysis complements thebayesian maximum likelihoodanalysis that finds the most probable model given the data. analyzing thesurveys with their corresponding most likely models from the cmb-like family ofmodels, as well as with the currently popular lambda-cdm model, reveals asystematic inconsistency of the data with these `best' models. there is asystematic trend of the cumulative chi^2 to increase with the mode number(where the modes are sorted by decreasing order of the eigenvalues). thiscorresponds to a decrease of the chi^2 with the variance associated with amode, and hence with its effective scale. it follows that the differentialanalysis finds that on small (large) scales the global analysis of all themodes `puts' less (more) power than actually required by the data. thisobserved trend might indicate one of the followings: a. the theoretical model(i.e. power spectrum) or the error model (or both) have an excess of power onlarge scales; b. velocity bias; c. the velocity data suffers from stilluncorrected systematic errors.

astro-ph;0005566	formation of cuspy density profiles - a generic feature of collisionless  gravitational collapse	using the formalism of the spherical infall model the structure of collapsedand virialized dark halos is calculated for a variety of scale-free initialconditions. in spite of the scale-free cosmological nature of the problem, thecollapse of individual objects is not self-similar. unlike most of previouscalculations the dynamics used here relies only on adiabatic invariants and noton self-similarity. the paper focuses on the structure of the innermost part ofthe collapsed halos and addresses the problem of central density cusps. theslopes of density profiles at 1% of virial radius are calculated for a varietyof cosmological models and are found to vary with the mass of the halos andpower spectrum of the initial conditions. the inner slopes range between r^-2.3and r^-2 with the limiting case of r^-2 reached for the largest masses. thesteep cusps found here correspond to the limiting case where all particles moveon radial orbits. the introduction of angular momentum will make the densityprofile shallower. we expect this to resolve the discrepancy found between thecalculated profiles and the ones found in high resolution n-body simulations,where the exponent ranges from -0.5 to -1.5. the robust prediction here is thatcollisionless gravitational collapse in an expanding universe is expected toform density cups and not halos with a core structure.

astro-ph;0103386	dark halos: the flattening of the density cusp by dynamical friction	n-body simulations and analytical calculations of the gravitational collapsein an expanding universe predict that halos should form with a diverging innerdensity profile, the cusp. there are some observational indications that thedark matter distribution in galaxies might be characterized by a finite core.this `core catastrophe' has prompted a search for alternatives to the cdmcosmogony. it is shown here that the discrepancy between theory andobservations can be very naturally resolved within the standard cdm model,provided that gas is not initially smoothly distributed in the dark matterhalo, but rather is concentrated in clumps of mass $\geq 0.01 %$ the total massof the system. dynamical friction acting on these lumps moving in thebackground of the dark matter particles, dissipates the clumps orbital energyand deposits it in the dark matter. using monte-carlo simulations, it is shownthat the dynamical friction provides a strong enough drag, and that withrealistic baryonic mass fractions, the available orbital energy of the clumpsis sufficient to heat the halo and turn the primordial cusp into a finite,non-diverging core --- overcoming the competing effect of adiabatic contractiondue to gravitational influence of the shrinking baryonic component. dependingon the initial conditions, the total density distribution may either becomemore or less centrally concentrated. possible consequences of the proposedmechanism for other problems in the cdm model and for the formation and earlyevolution of the baryonic component of galaxies are also briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0105123	testing tidal-torque theory: i. spin amplitude and direction	we evaluate the success of linear tidal-torque theory (ttt) in predictinggalactic-halo spin using a cosmological n-body simulation with thousands ofwell-resolved haloes. the proto-haloes are identified by tracing today's haloesback to the initial conditions. the ttt predictions for the proto-haloes match,on average, the spin amplitudes of today's virialized haloes if linear growthis assumed until ~t_0/3, or 55-70 per cent of the halo effective turn-aroundtime. this makes it a useful qualitative tool for understanding certain averageproperties of galaxies, such as total spin and angular-momentum distributionwithin haloes, but with a random scatter of the order of the signal itself.non-linear changes in spin direction cause a mean error of ~50 degrees in thettt prediction at t_0, such that the linear spatial correlations of spins onscales &gt;~ 1 mpc/h are significantly weakened by non-linear effects. thisquestions the usefulness of ttt for predicting intrinsic alignments in thecontext of gravitational lensing. we find that the standard approximations madein ttt, including a second order expansion of the zel'dovich potential and asmoothing of the tidal field, provide close-to-optimal results.

astro-ph;0105165	testing tidal-torque theory: ii. alignment of inertia and shear and the  characteristics of proto-haloes	we investigate the cross-talk between the two key components of tidal-torquetheory, the inertia (i) and shear (t) tensors, using a cosmological n-bodysimulation with thousands of well-resolved haloes. we find that the principalaxes of i and t are strongly aligned, even though i characterizes theproto-halo locally while t is determined by the large-scale structure. thus,the resultant galactic spin, which plays a key role in galaxy formation, isonly a residual due to ~10 per cent deviations from perfect alignment of t andi. the t-i correlation induces a weak tendency for the proto-halo spin to beperpendicular to the major axes of t and i, but this correlation is erased bynon-linear effects at late times, making the observed spins poor indicators ofthe initial shear field. however, the t-i correlation implies that the sheartensor can be used for identifying the positions and boundaries of proto-haloesin cosmological initial conditions -- a missing piece in galaxy formationtheory. the typical configuration is of a prolate proto-halo lyingperpendicular to a large-scale high-density ridge, with the surrounding voidsinducing compression along the major and intermediate inertia axes of theproto-halo. this leads to a transient sub-halo filament along the large-scaleridge, whose sub-clumps then flow along the filament and merge into the finalhalo. the centres of proto-haloes tend to lie in ~1 sigma over-density regions,but their association with linear density maxima smoothed on galactic scales isvague: only ~40 per cent of the proto-haloes contain peaks within them. severalother characteristics distinguish proto-haloes from density peaks, e.g., theytend to compress along two principal axes while many peaks compress along threeaxes.

astro-ph;0107104	constrained simulations of the real universe: the local supercluster	we present cosmological simulations which closely mimic the real universewithin 100mpc of the local group. the simulations, called constrainedsimulations, reproduce the large-scale density field with major nearbystructures, including the local group, the coma and virgo clusters, the greatattractor, the perseus-pices, and the local supercluster, in approximatelycorrect locations. the mark iii survey of peculiar velocities of the observedstructures inside 80mpc/h sphere is used to constrain the initial conditions.fourier modes on scales larger then 5mpc/h are dominated by the constraints,while small scale waves are random. the main aim of this paper is the structureof the local supercluster (lsc; 30mpc/h around the virgo cluster) and the localgroup environment. we find that at the current epoch most of the mass(7.5e14msun/h) of the lsc is located in a filament roughly centered on thevirgo cluster and extending over 40mpc/h. the simulated local group (lg) islocated in an adjacent smaller filament, which is not a part of the main bodyof the lsc, and has a peculiar velocity of 250kms toward the virgo cluster. thepeculiar velocity field in the lsc region is complicated and is drasticallydifferent from the field assumed in the virgocentric infall models. thepeculiar velocity flow in the vicinity of the lg in the simulation is ``cold'':the peculiar line-of-sight velocity dispersion within 7mpc/h of the lg is lessthan 60km/s, comparable to the observed velocity dispersion of nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;0305393	the structure of voids	using high resolution n-body simulations we address the problem of emptinessof giant 20 mpc/h diameter voids found in the distribution of bright galaxies.are the voids filled by dwarf galaxies? do cosmological models predict too manysmall dark matter haloes inside the voids? can the problems of cosmologicalmodels on small scales be addressed by studying the abundance of dwarf galaxiesinside voids? we find that voids in the distribution of 10^12 msun/h haloes(expected galactic magnitudes ~ m_*) are almost the same as the voids in 10^11msun/h haloes. yet, much smaller haloes with masses 10^9 msun/h and circularvelocities v_circ about 20 km/s readily fill the voids: there should be almost1000 of these haloes in a 20 mpc/h void. a typical void of diameter 20 mpc/hcontains about 50 haloes with v_circ &gt; 50 km/s. the haloes are arranged in apattern, which looks like a miniature universe: it has the same structuralelements as the large-scale structure of the galactic distribution of theuniverse. there are filaments and voids; larger haloes are at the intersectionsof filaments. the only difference is that all masses are four orders ofmagnitude smaller. there is severe (anti)bias in the distribution of haloes,which depends on halo mass and on the distance from the centre of the void.large haloes are more antibiased and have a tendency to form close to voidboundaries. the mass function of haloes in voids is different from the``normal'' mass function. it is much steeper for high masses resulting in veryfew m33-type galaxies (v_circ about 100 km/s). we present an analyticalapproximation for the mass function of haloes in voids.

astro-ph;0309412	flat-cored dark matter in cuspy clusters of galaxies	sand, treu, &amp; ellis (2002) have measured the central density profile ofcluster ms2137-23 with gravitational lensing and velocity dispersion andremoved the stellar contribution with a reasonable m/l. the resulting darkmatter distribution within r&lt;50 kpc was fitted by a density cusp of r^{-beta}with beta=0.35. this stands in an apparent contradiction to the cdm predictionof beta~1, and the disagreement worsens if adiabatic compression of the darkmatter by the infalling baryons is considered. following el-zant, shlosman &amp;hoffman (2001), we argue that dynamical friction acting on galaxies movingwithin the dark matter background counters the effect of adiabatic compressionby transfering the orbital energy of galaxies to the dark matter, thus heatingup and softening the central density cusp. using n-body simulations of massivesolid clumps moving in clusters we show that indeed the inner dark matterdistribution flattens (with beta approx 0.35 for a cluster like ms2137-23) whenthe galaxies spiral inward. we find as a robust result that while the darkmatter distribution becomes core-like, the overall mass distribution preservesits cuspy nature, in agreement with x-ray and lensing observations of clusters.

astro-ph;0309485	cluster mass functions in the quintessential universe	we use $n$-body simulations to measure mass functions in flat cosmologicalmodels with quintessence characterized by constant $w$ with $w=-1$, -2/3 and-1/2. the results are compared to the predictions of the formula proposed byjenkins et al. at different redshifts, in terms of fof masses as well as abellmasses appropriate for direct comparison to observations. the formulareproduces quite well the mass functions of simulated haloes in models withquintessence. we use the cluster mass function data at a number of redshiftsfrom carlberg et al. to constrain $\omega_0$, $\sigma_8$ and $w$. the best fitis obtained in the limit $w \to 0$, but none of the values of $w$ in theconsidered range $-1 \le w &lt; 0$ can actually be excluded. however, the adoptedvalue of $w$ affects significantly the constraints in the $\omega_0-\sigma_8$plane. taking into account the dependence on $w$ we find $\omega_0=0.32 \pm0.15$ and $\sigma_8=0.85_{-0.12}^{+0.38}$ (68% c.l.). since less negative $w$push the confidence regions toward higher $\omega_0$ and lower $\sigma_8$ weconclude that relaxing the assumption of $w=-1$ typically made in suchcomparisons may resolve the discrepancy between recent cluster mass functionresults (yielding rather low $\omega_0$ and high $\sigma_8$) and most otherestimates. the fact that high $w$ values are preferred may however also pointtowards some unknown systematics in the data or the model with constant $w$being inadequate.

astro-ph;0501452	imprints of mass accretion on properties of galaxy clusters	a large scale sph+n-body simulation (gadget) of the concordance lcdm universeis used to investigate orientation and angular momentum of galaxy clusters atz=0 in connection with their recent accretion histories. the basic clustersample comprises the 3000 most massive friends-of-friends halos found in the500 mpc/h simulation box. two disjoint sub-samples are constructed, using themass ratio of the two most massive progenitors at z=0.5 m_2 / m_1 (m_1 &lt; m_2),namely a recent major merger sample and a steady accretion mode sample. themass of clusters in the merger sample is on average ~43% larger than the massof the two progenitors (m_1 + m_2), whereas in the steady accretion mode samplea smaller increase of ~25% is found. the separation vector connecting the twomost massive progenitor halos at z=0.5 is strongly correlated with theorientation of the cluster at z=0. the angular momentum of the clusters in therecent major merger sample tends to be parallel to orbital angular momentum ofthe two progenitors, whereas the angular momentum of the steady accretion modesample is mainly determined by the angular momentum of the most massiveprogenitor. the long range correlations for the major and the minor principalaxes of cluster pairs extend to distances of ~100 mpc/h. weak angular momentumcorrelations are found for distances &lt; 20 mpc/h. within these ranges the majoraxes tend to be aligned with the connecting line of the cluster pairs whereasminor axes and angular momenta tend to be perpendicular to this line. aseparate analysis of the two sub-samples reveals that the long rangecorrelations are independent of the mass accretion mode. thus orientation andangular momentum of galaxy clusters is mainly determined by the accretion alongthe filaments independently of the particular accretion mode.

astro-ph;0509478	non-parametric reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum at  horizon scales from wmap data	we extend to large scales a method proposed in previous work thatreconstructs non-parametrically the primordial power spectrum from cosmicmicrowave background data at high resolution. the improvement is necessary toaccount for the non-gaussianity of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap) likelihood due primarily to cosmic variance. we assume the concordancelambdacdm cosmology, utilise a smoothing prior and perform monte carlosimulations around an initial power spectrum that is scale-free and withspectral index n_s=0.97, very close to the concordance spectrum. the horizonscale for the model we are considering corresponds to the wavenumberk_h=4.52x10^{-4} mpc^{-1}. we find some evidence for the presence of featuresand we quantify the probabilities of exceeding the observed deviations in wmapdata with respect to the fiducial models. we detect the following marginaldepartures from a scale-free (spectral index n_s=0.97) initial spectrum: acut-off at 0.0001&lt;k&lt;0.001 mpc^{-1} at 79.5% (92%), a dip at 0.001&lt;k&lt;0.003mpc^{-1} at 87.2% (98%) and a bump at 0.003&lt;k&lt;0.004 mpc^{-1} at 90.3% (55.5%)confidence level.  these frequentist confidence levels are calculated by integrating over thedistribution of the monte carlo reconstructions built around the fiducialmodels. the frequentist analysis finds the low k cutoff of the estimated powerspectrum to be about 2.5 sigma away from the n_s=0.97 model, while in thebayesian analysis the model is about 1.5 sigma away from the estimatedspectrum.

astro-ph;0610090	evolution of characteristic quantities for dark matter halo density  profiles	we investigate the effect of an assembly history on the evolution of darkmatter (dm) halos of 10^{12} msun/h using constrained realizations of randomgaussian fields. five different realizations of a dm halo with distinct merginghistories were constructed and evolved. our main results are: a halo evolvesvia a sequence of quiescent phases of a slow mass accretion intermitted byviolent episodes of major mergers. in the quiescent phases, the density is wellfitted by an nfw profile, the inner scale radius rs and the mass enclosedwithin it remain constant, and the virial radius (rvir) grows linearly with theexpansion parameter "a". within each quiescent phase the concentrationparameter ("c") scales as "a", and the mass accretion history (mvir) is welldescribed by the tasitsiomi etal. fitting formula. in the violent phases thehalos are not in a virial equilibrium and both rs and rvir growdiscontinuously. the violent episodes drive the halos from one nfw dynamicalequilibrium to another. the final structure of a halo, including "c", dependson the degree of violence of the major mergers and on their number. next, wefind a distinct difference between the behavior of various nfw parameters takenas averages over an ensemble of halos and those of individual halos. moreover,the simple scaling relations c--mvir do not apply to the entire evolution ofindividual halos, and so is the common notion that late forming halos are lessconcentrated than early forming ones. the entire evolution of the halo cannotbe fitted by single analytical expressions.

astro-ph;9811410	cold flows and large scale tides	several studies have indicated that the local cosmic velocity field is rathercold, in particular in the regions outside the massive, virialized clusters ofgalaxies. if our local cosmic environment is taken to be a representativevolume of the universe, the repercussion of this finding is that either we livein a low-$\omega$ universe and/or that the galaxy distribution is a biasedreflection of the underlying mass distribution. otherwise, the pronouncednature of the observed galaxy distribution would be irreconcilable with therelatively quiet flow of the galaxies.  here we propose a different view on this cosmic dilemma, stressing the factthat our cosmic neighbourhood embodies a region of rather particular dynamicalproperties, and henceforth we are apt to infer flawed conclusions with respectto the global universe. suspended between two huge mass concentrations, thegreat attractor region and the perseus-pisces chain, we find ourselves in aregion of relatively low density yet with a very strong tidal shear. this tidalfield induces a local velocity field with a significant large-scale bulk flowbut a low small-scale velocity dispersion. by means of constrained realizationsof our local universe, consisting of wiener-filtered reconstructions inferredfrom the mark iii catalogue of galaxy peculiar velocities in combination withappropriate spectrally determined fluctuations, we study the implications forour local velocity field. we find that we live near a local peak in thedistribution of the cosmic mach number, $|v_{bulk}|/\sigma_v$, and that ourlocal cosmic niche is located in the tail of the mach number distributionfunction.

astro-ph;9909158	eigenmode analysis of radial velocities	radial velocity surveys are examined in terms of eigenmode analysis withinthe framework of cdm-like family of models. rich surveys such as mark iii andsfi, which consist of more than $10^{3}$ radial velocities, are found to have afew tens of modes that are not noise dominated. poor surveys, which have only afew tens of radial velocities, are noise dominated across the eigenmodespectrum. in particular, the bulk velocity of such surveys has been found to bedominated by the more noisy modes. the mark iii and sfi are well fitted by atilted flat cdm model found by a maximum likelihood analysis and a $\chi^{2}$statistics . however, a mode-by-mode inspection shows that a substantialfraction of the modes lie outside the $90% $ confidence level. this impliesthat although globally the cdm-like family of models seems to be consistentwith radial velocity surveys, in detail it does not. this might indicate a needfor a revised power spectrum or for some non-trivial biasing scheme.

0706.0006	evolution of phase-space density in dark matter halos	the evolution of the phase-space density profile in dark matter (dm) halos isinvestigated by means of constrained simulations, designed to control themerging history of a given dm halo. halos evolve through a series of quiescentphases of a slow accretion intermitted by violent events of major mergers. inthe quiescent phases the density of the halo closely follows the nfw profileand the phase-space density profile, q(r), is given by the taylor &amp; navarropower law, r^{-beta}, where beta ~ 1.9 and stays remarkably stable over thehubble time. expressing the phase-space density by the nfw parameters, q(r)=qs(r/rs)^{-beta}, the evolution of q is determined by qs. we have found that theeffective mass surface density within rs, sigma_s = rhos rs, remains constantthroughout the evolution of a given dm halo along the main branch of itsmerging tree. this invariance entails that qs ~ rs^{-5/2} and q(r) ~sigma_s^{-1/2} rs^{-5/2} (r/ rs)^{-beta}. it follows that the phase-spacedensity remains constant, in the sense of qs=const., in the quiescent phasesand it decreases as rs^{-5/2} in the violent ones. the physical origin of thenfw density profile and the phase-space density power law is still unknown.yet, the numerical experiments show that halos recover these relations afterthe violent phases. the major mergers drive rs to increase and qs to decreasediscontinuously while keeping qs rs^{5/2} = const. the virial equilibrium inthe quiescent phases implies that a dm halos evolves along a sequence of nfwprofiles with constant energy per unit volume (i.e., pressure) within rs.
