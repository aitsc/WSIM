0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

1002.3365	mid-infrared variability from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	we use the multi-epoch, mid-infrared spitzer deep, wide-field survey toinvestigate the variability of 474,179 objects in 8.1 deg^2 of the ndwfs bootesfield. we perform a difference image analysis of the four available epochsbetween 2004 and 2008, focusing on the deeper 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. we findthat 1.1% of the studied sample meet our standard selection criteria for beingclassed as a variable source. we require that the 3.6 and 4.5 micronlight-curves are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.8) and that their joint varianceexceeds that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2 sigma. we thenexamine the mid-ir colors of the variable sources and match them with x-raysources from the xbootes survey, radio catalogs, 24 micron-selected agncandidates, and spectroscopically identified agns from the agn and galaxyevolution survey (ages). based on their mid-ir colors, most of the variablesources are agns (76%), with smaller contributions from stars (11%), galaxies(6%), and unclassified objects. most of the stellar, galaxy and unclassifiedsources are false positives. for our standard selection criteria, 11-12% of themid-ir counterparts to x-ray sources, 24 micron-selected agn candidates andspectroscopically identified agns show variability. mid-ir agn variability canbe well described by a single power-law structure function with a power-lawindex of 0.5 at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and an amplitude of 0.1 mag onrest-frame time scales of 2 years. the variability amplitude is higher forshorter rest-frame wavelengths and lower luminosities.

1002.4198	a galaxy populations study of a radio-selected protocluster at z~3.1	we present a population study of several types of galaxies within theprotocluster surrounding the radio galaxy mrc0316-257 at z~3.1. in addition tothe known population of ly_alpha emitters (laes) and [oiii] emitters, we usecolour selection techniques to identify protocluster candidates that are lymanbreak galaxies (lbg) and balmer break galaxies (bbgs). the radio galaxy fieldcontains an excess of lbg candidates, with a surface density 1.6\pm0.3 timeslarger than found for comparable blank fields. this surface overdensitycorresponds to an lbg volume overdensity of ~8\pm4. the bbg photometricredshift distribution peaks at the protocluster's redshift, but we detect nosignificant surface overdensity of bbg. this is not surprising because a volumeoverdensity similar to the lbgs would have resulted in a surface density of~1.2 that found in the blank field. this could not have been detected in oursample. masses and star formation rates of the candidate protocluster galaxiesare determined using sed fitting. these properties are not significantlydifferent from those of field galaxies. the galaxies with the highest massesand star formation rates are located near the radio galaxy, indicating that theprotocluster environment influences galaxy evolution at z~3. we conclude thatthe protocluster around mrc0316-257 is still in the early stages of formation.

1005.4681	the xmm cluster survey: the build up of stellar mass in brightest  cluster galaxies at high redshift	we present deep j and ks band photometry of 20 high redshift galaxy clustersbetween z=0.8-1.5, 19 of which are observed with the moircs instrument on thesubaru telescope. by using near-infrared light as a proxy for stellar mass wefind the surprising result that the average stellar mass of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) has remained constant at ~9e11msol since z~1.5. we investigatethe effect on this result of differing star formation histories generated bythree well known and independent stellar population codes and find it to berobust for reasonable, physically motivated choices of age and metallicity. byperforming monte carlo simulations we find that the result is unaffected by anycorrelation between bcg mass and cluster mass in either the observed or modelclusters. the large stellar masses imply that the assemblage of these galaxiestook place at the same time as the initial burst of star formation. this resultleads us to conclude that dry merging has had little effect on the averagestellar mass of bcgs over the last 9-10 gyr in stark contrast to thepredictions of semi-analytic models, based on the hierarchical merging of darkmatter haloes, which predict a more protracted mass build up over a hubbletime. we discuss however that there is potential for reconciliation betweenobservation and theory if there is a significant growth of material in theintracluster light over the same period.

1010.5786	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: ii. the type ia  supernova rate in high-redshift galaxy clusters	we report a measurement of the type ia supernova (sn ia) rate in galaxyclusters at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.45 from the hubble space telescope (hst) clustersupernova survey. this is the first cluster sn ia rate measurement withdetected z &gt; 0.9 sne. finding 8 +/- 1 cluster sne ia, we determine a sn ia rateof 0.50 +0.23-0.19 (stat) +0.10-0.09 (sys) snub (snub = 10^-12 sne l_{sun,b}^-1yr^-1). in units of stellar mass, this translates to 0.36 +0.16-0.13 (stat)+0.07-0.06 (sys) snum (snum = 10^-12 sne m_sun^-1 yr^-1). this represents afactor of approximately 5 +/- 2 increase over measurements of the cluster rateat z &lt; 0.2. we parameterize the late-time sn ia delay time distribution with apower law (proportional to t^s). under the assumption of a cluster formationredshift of z_f = 3, our rate measurement in combination with lower-redshiftcluster sn ia rates constrains s = -1.41 +0.47/-0.40, consistent withmeasurements of the delay time distribution in the field. this measurement isgenerally consistent with expectations for the "double degenerate" scenario andinconsistent with some models for the "single degenerate" scenario predicting asteeper delay time distribution at large delay times. we check forenvironmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations bycalculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and inmorphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the fullcluster rate. finally, the upper limit of one host-less cluster sn ia detectedin the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium isless than 0.47 (95% confidence), consistent with measurements at lowerredshifts.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1103.0259	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. ii. masses and ages of early-type galaxies  in different environments and their dependence on stellar population model  assumptions	we have derived masses and ages for 79 early-type galaxies (etgs) indifferent environments at z~1.3 in the lynx supercluster and in the goods/cdf-sfield using multiwavelength (0.6-4.5 $\mu$m; kpno, palomar, keck, hst, spitzer)datasets. at this redshift the contribution of the tp-agb phase is importantfor etgs, and the mass and age estimates depend on the choice of the stellarpopulation model used in the spectral energy distribution fits. we describe indetail the differences among model predictions for a large range of galaxyages, showing the dependence of these differences on age. current models stillyield large uncertainties. while recent models from maraston and charlot &amp;bruzual offer better modeling of the tp-agb phase with respect to less recentbruzual &amp; charlot models, their predictions do not often match. the modeling ofthis tp-agb phase has a significant impact on the derived parameters forgalaxies observed at high-redshift. some of our results do not depend on thechoice of the model: for all models, the most massive galaxies are the oldestones, independent of the environment. when using maraston and charlot &amp; bruzualmodels, the mass distribution is similar in the clusters and in the groups,whereas in our field sample there is a deficit of massive (m $\gtrsim$ 10^11msun) etgs. according to those last models, etgs belonging to the clusterenvironment host on average older stars with respect to group and fieldpopulations. this difference is less significant than the age difference ingalaxies of different masses.

1103.0265	early-type galaxies at z ~ 1.3. iii. on the dependence of formation  epochs and star formation histories on stellar mass and environment	we study the environmental dependence of stellar population properties at z ~1.3. we derive galaxy properties (stellar masses, ages and star formationhistories) for samples of massive, red, passive early-type galaxies in twohigh-redshift clusters, rxj0849+4452 and rxj0848+4453 (with redshifts of z =1.26 and 1.27, respectively), and compare them with those measured for therdcs1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 and with those measured for a similarlymass-selected sample of field contemporaries drawn from the goods-south field.robust estimates of the aforementioned parameters have been obtained bycomparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with extensive8-10 band photometric coverage, from the rest-frame far-ultraviolet to theinfrared. we find no variations of the overall stellar population propertiesamong the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. however, whencomparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, evenif the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxymass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their finalmass. we find that, approximately 1 gyr after the onset of star formation, themajority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (&gt; 80%) of theirfinal mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field etgs have. thus weconclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, theenvironment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories.

1105.3186	scaling relations and overabundance of massive clusters at z&gt;~1 from  weak-lensing studies with hst	we present weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 high-redshift (z &gt;~1)clusters based on hubble space telescope images. most clusters in our sampleprovide significant lensing signals and are well detected in theirreconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. combining the current results and ourprevious weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we comparegravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. werevisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in oursample is in tension with the current lambdacdm structure formation paradigm.we find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gastemperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperaturerelation at z &gt;~ 1. for the power law slope of the m-tx relation (m proptot^{\alpha}), we obtain \alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. this is consistent with thetheoretical self-similar prediction \alpha=3/2 and with the results previouslyreported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. however, ournormalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that thenormalization in the m-tx relation might evolve. after correcting for eddingtonbias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we findthat the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides atension with the current lambda cdm model. the combined probability of findingthe four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization overcurrent cosmological parameters is less than 1%.

1108.4037	ultra steep spectrum radio sources in the lockman hole: servs  identifications and redshift distribution at the faintest radio fluxes	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources have been successfully used toselect powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z&gt;~2). typically restricted tolarge-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has graduallybecome possible to extend the uss search to sub-mjy levels, thanks to therecent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. here a firstdetailed analysis of the nature of the faintest uss sources is presented. byusing giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array radio observationsof the lockman hole at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz, a sample of 58 uss sources, with610 mhz integrated fluxes above 100 microjy, is assembled. deep infrared dataat 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the spitzer extragalactic representative volumesurvey (servs) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of thesesources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](ab)=19.8 mag.spectroscopic redshifts for 14 uss sources, together with photometric redshiftestimates, improved by the use of the deep servs data, for a further 19objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 andtailing off at high redshifts. the remaining 25 uss sources, with no redshiftestimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]&gt;22-23 mag, from local measurements), whichsuggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mjy usspopulation. the comparison with the square kilometre array design studiessimulated skies models indicate that fanaroff-riley type i radio sources andradio-quiet active galactic nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest usspopulation, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the usstechnique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at thesub-mjy level.

1201.2943	origin of the 12um emission across galaxy populations from wise and sdss  surveys	we cross-matched wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) sources brighterthan 1 mjy at 12um with the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) galaxyspectroscopic catalog to produce a sample of ~10^5 galaxies at &lt;z&gt;=0.08, thelargest of its kind. this sample is dominated (70%) by star-forming (sf)galaxies from the blue sequence, with total ir luminosities in the range~10^8-10^12 l_sun. we identify which stellar populations are responsible formost of the 12um emission. we find that most (~80%) of the 12um emission in sfgalaxies is produced by stellar populations younger than 0.6 gyr. in contrast,the 12um emission in weak agn (l[oiii]&lt;10^7 l_sun) is produced by older stars,with ages of ~1-3 gyr. we find that l_[12um] linearly correlates with stellarmass for sf galaxies. at fixed 12um luminosity, weak agn deviate toward highermasses since they tend to be hosted by massive, early-type galaxies with olderstellar populations. star-forming galaxies and weak agn follow differentl_[12um]-sfr (star formation rate) relations, with weak agn showing excess 12umemission at low sfr (~0.02-1 m_sun/yr). this is likely due to dust grainsheated by older stars. while the specific star formation rate (ssfr) of sfgalaxies is nearly constant, the ssfr of weak agn decreases by ~3 orders ofmagnitude, reflecting the very different star formation efficiencies between sfgalaxies and massive, early-type galaxies. stronger type ii agn in our sample(l_[oiii]&gt;10^7 l_sun), act as an extension of massive sf galaxies, connectingthe sf and weak agn sequences. this suggests a picture where galaxies formstars normally until an agn (possibly after a starburst episode) starts togradually quench the sf activity. we also find that 4.6-12um color is a usefulfirst-order indicator of sf activity in a galaxy when no other data areavailable.

1201.3989	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: iii. correlated  properties of type ia supernovae and their hosts at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.46	using the sample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the hubblespace telescope (hst) cluster supernova survey and augmented with hst-observedsne ia in the goods fields, we search for correlations between the propertiesof sne and their host galaxies at high redshift. we use galaxy color andquantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters anddevelop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies fromstar-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. with this approach, weidentify six sn ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven sn iahosts that are early-type field galaxies. we confirm for the first time atz&gt;0.9 that sne ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quicklythan sne ia hosted by late-type galaxies. we also show that the two samples ofhosts produce sne ia with similar color distributions. the relatively simplespectral energy distributions (seds) expected for passive galaxies enable us tomeasure stellar masses of early-type sn hosts. in combination with stellar massestimates of late-type goods sn hosts from thomson &amp; chary (2011), weinvestigate the correlation of host mass with hubble residual observed at lowerredshifts. although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hintof this relation is found at z&gt;0.9. by simultaneously fitting the averagecluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,we show that the reddening of early-type cluster sn hosts is likely e(b-v) &lt;~0.06. the similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggeststhat field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also beminimally affected by dust. hence, the early-type hosted sne ia studied hereoccupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshiftstandard candles than other sne ia.

1205.5570	the xmm cluster survey: evidence for energy injection at high redshift  from evolution of the x-ray luminosity-temperature relation	we measure the evolution of the x-ray luminosity-temperature (l_x-t) relationsince z~1.5 using a sample of 211 serendipitously detected galaxy clusters withspectroscopic redshifts drawn from the xmm cluster survey first data release(xcs-dr1). this is the first study spanning this redshift range using a single,large, homogeneous cluster sample. using an orthogonal regression technique, wefind no evidence for evolution in the slope or intrinsic scatter of therelation since z~1.5, finding both to be consistent with previous measurementsat z~0.1. however, the normalisation is seen to evolve negatively with respectto the self-similar expectation: we find e(z)^{-1} l_x = 10^{44.67 +/- 0.09}(t/5)^{3.04 +/- 0.16} (1+z)^{-1.5 +/- 0.5}, which is within 2 sigma of the zeroevolution case. we see milder, but still negative, evolution with respect toself-similar when using a bisector regression technique. we compare our resultsto numerical simulations, where we fit simulated cluster samples using the samemethods used on the xcs data. our data favour models in which the majority ofthe excess entropy required to explain the slope of the l_x-t relation isinjected at high redshift. simulations in which agn feedback is implementedusing prescriptions from current semi-analytic galaxy formation models predictpositive evolution of the normalisation, and differ from our data at more than5 sigma. this suggests that more efficient feedback at high redshift may beneeded in these models.

1207.4790	assembly of the red sequence in infrared-selected galaxy clusters from  the irac shallow cluster survey	we present results for the assembly and star formation histories of massive(~l*) red sequence galaxies in 11 spectroscopically confirmed,infrared-selected galaxy clusters at 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, the precursors topresent-day massive clusters with m ~ 10^15 m_sun. using rest-frame opticalphotometry, we investigate evolution in the color and scatter of the redsequence galaxy population, comparing with models of possible star formationhistories. in contrast to studies of central cluster galaxies at lower redshift(z &lt; 1), these data are clearly inconsistent with the continued evolution ofstars formed and assembled primarily at a single, much-earlier time.specifically, we find that the colors of massive cluster galaxies at z = 1.5imply that the bulk of star formation occurred at z ~ 3, whereas by z = 1 theircolors imply formation at z ~ 2; therefore these galaxies exhibit approximatelythe same luminosity-weighted stellar age at 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. this likely reflectsstar formation that occurs over an extended period, the effects of significantprogenitor bias, or both. our results generally indicate that massive clustergalaxy populations began forming a significant mass of stars at z &gt;~ 4,contained some red spheroids by z ~ 1.5, and were actively assembling much oftheir final mass during 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 in the form of younger stars. qualitatively,the slopes of the cluster color-magnitude relations are consistent with nosignificant evolution relative to local clusters.

1209.2065	characterizing the mid-ir extragalactic sky with wise and sdss	the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) has completed its all-skysurvey at 3.4-22 micron. we merge the wise data with optical sdss data andprovide a phenomenological characterization of mid-ir, extragalactic sources.wise is most sensitive at 3.4micron(w1) and least at 22micron(w4). the w1 bandprobes massive early-type galaxies out to z\gtrsim1. this is more distant thansdss identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of3.4micron sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r&gt;22.2). in contrast,92-95% of 12 and 22micron sources have sdss optical counterparts with r&lt;22.2.wise 3.4micron detects 89.8% of the entire sdss qso catalog at snr(w1)&gt;7, butonly 18.9% at 22micron with snr(w4)&gt;5. we show that wise colors alone areeffective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forminggalaxies and strong agn/qsos at z&lt;3. we highlight three major applications ofwise colors: (1) selection of strong agn/qsos at z&lt;3 using w1-w2&gt;0.8 andw2&lt;15.2 criteria, producing a census of this population. the surface density ofthese strong agn/qso candidates is 67.5+-0.14/deg^2. (2) selection ofdust-obscured, type-2 agn/qso candidates. we show that wise w1-w2&gt;0.8, w2&lt;15.2combined with r-w2&gt;6 (vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 agncandidates. the fraction of these type-2 agn candidates is 1/3rd of all wisecolor-selected agns. (3) selection of ulirgs at z\sim2 with extremely redcolors, r-w4&gt;14 or well-detected 22micron sources lacking detections in the 3.4and 4.6micron bands. the surface density of z~2 r-w4&gt;14 ulirgs is0.9+-0.07/deg^2 at snr(w4)&gt;5 (flux(w4)&gt;=2.5mjy), which is consistent with thatinferred from smaller area spitzer surveys. optical spectroscopy of a smallnumber of these high-redshift ulirgs confirms our selection, and reveals apossible trend that optically fainter or r-w4 redder candidates are at higherredshifts.

1311.4953	optical spectroscopy and velocity dispersions of galaxy clusters from  the spt-sz survey	we present optical spectroscopy of galaxies in clusters detected through thesunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we reportour own measurements of $61$ spectroscopic cluster redshifts, and $48$ velocitydispersions each calculated with more than $15$ member galaxies. this catalogalso includes $19$ dispersions of spt-observed clusters previously reported inthe literature. the majority of the clusters in this paper are spt-discovered;of these, most have been previously reported in other spt cluster catalogs, andfive are reported here as spt discoveries for the first time. by performing aresampling analysis of galaxy velocities, we find that unbiased velocitydispersions can be obtained from a relatively small number of member galaxies($\lesssim 30$), but with increased systematic scatter. we use this analysis todetermine statistical confidence intervals that include the effect ofmembership selection. we fit scaling relations between the observed clustervelocity dispersions and mass estimates from sz and x-ray observables. in bothcases, the results are consistent with the scaling relation between velocitydispersion and mass expected from dark-matter simulations. we measure a$\sim$30% log-normal scatter in dispersion at fixed mass, and a $\sim$10%offset in the normalization of the dispersion-mass relation when compared tothe expectation from simulations, which is within the expected level ofsystematic uncertainty.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

0802.2095	the nascent red sequence at z~2	we present new constraints on the evolution of the early-type galaxycolor-magnitude relation (cmr) based on deep near-infrared imaging of a galaxyprotocluster at z=2.16 obtained using nicmos on-board the hubble spacetelescope. this field contains a spectroscopically confirmed space-overdensityof lyman-alpha and h-alpha emitting galaxies which surrounds the powerful radiogalaxy mrc 1138-262. using these nicmos data we identify a significantsurface-overdensity (= 6.2x) of red j-h galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram(when compared with deep nicmos imaging from the hdf-n and udf). theoptical-nir colors of these prospective red-sequence galaxies indicate thepresence of on-going dust-obscured star-formation or recently formed (&lt;~ 1.5gyr)stellar populations in a majority of the red galaxies. we measure the slopeand intrinsic scatter of the cmr for three different red galaxy samplesselected by a wide color cut, and using photometric redshifts both with andwithout restrictions on rest-frame optical morphology. in all three cases boththe rest-frame $u-b$ slope and intrinsic color scatter are considerably higherthan corresponding values for lower redshift galaxy clusters. these resultssuggest that while some relatively quiescent galaxies do exist in thisprotocluster both the majority of the galaxy population and hence thecolor-magnitude relation are still in the process of forming, as expected.

1404.0023	candidate clusters of galaxies at $z&gt;1.3$ identified in the spitzer spt  deep field survey	we present 279 galaxy cluster candidates at $z &gt; 1.3$ selected from the 94deg$^{2}$ spitzer south pole telescope deep field (ssdf) survey. we use asimple algorithm to select candidate high-redshift clusters of galaxies basedon spitzer/irac mid-infrared data combined with shallow all-sky optical data.we identify distant cluster candidates in ssdf adopting an overdensitythreshold that results in a high purity (80%) cluster sample based on tests inthe spitzer deep, wide-field survey of the bo\"otes field. our simple algorithmdetects all three $1.4 &lt; z \leq 1.75$ x-ray detected clusters in the bo\"otesfield. the uniqueness of the ssdf survey resides not just in its area, one ofthe largest contiguous extragalactic fields observed with spitzer, but also inits deep, multi-wavelength coverage by the south pole telescope (spt),herschel/spire and xmm-newton. this rich dataset will allow direct or stackedmeasurements of sunyaev-zel'dovich effect decrements or x-ray masses for manyof the ssdf clusters presented here, and enable systematic study of the mostdistant clusters on an unprecedented scale. we measure the angular correlationfunction of our sample and find that these candidates show strong clustering.employing the cosmos/ultravista photometric catalog in order to infer theredshift distribution of our cluster selection, we find that these clustershave a comoving number density $n_c = (0.7^{+6.3}_{-0.6}) \times 10^{-7} h^{3}\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}$ and a spatial clustering correlation scale length $r_0 = (32\pm 7) h^{-1} \rm{mpc}$. assuming our sample is comprised of dark matter halosabove a characteristic minimum mass, $m_{{\rm min}}$, we derive that at $z=1.5$these clusters reside in halos larger than $m_{{\rm min}} = 1.5^{+0.9}_{-0.7}\times 10^{14} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$.

1404.2930	the spitzer south pole telescope deep field survey: linking galaxies and  halos at z=1.5	we present an analysis of the clustering of high-redshift galaxies in therecently completed 94 deg$^2$ spitzer-spt deep field survey. applying flux andcolor cuts to the mid-infrared photometry efficiently selects galaxies at$z\sim1.5$ in the stellar mass range $10^{10}-10^{11}m_\odot$, making thissample the largest used so far to study such a distant population. we measurethe angular correlation function in different flux-limited samples at scales$&gt;6^{\prime \prime}$ (corresponding to physical distances $&gt;0.05$ mpc) andthereby map the one- and two-halo contributions to the clustering. we fit halooccupation distributions and determine how the central galaxy's stellar massand satellite occupation depend on the halo mass. we measure a prominent peakin the stellar-to-halo mass ratio at a halo mass of $\log(m_{\rm halo} /m_\odot) = 12.44\pm0.08$, 4.5 times higher than the $z=0$ value. this supportsthe idea of an evolving mass threshold above which star formation is quenched.we estimate the large-scale bias in the range $b_g=2-4$ and the satellitefraction to be $f_\mathrm{sat}\sim0.2$, showing a clear evolution compared to$z=0$. we also find that, above a given stellar mass limit, the fraction ofgalaxies that are in similar mass pairs is higher at $z=1.5$ than at $z=0$. inaddition, we measure that this fraction mildly increases with the stellar masslimit at $z=1.5$, which is the opposite of the behavior seen at low-redshift.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1407.2942	mass calibration and cosmological analysis of the spt-sz galaxy cluster  sample using velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ and x-ray $y_\textrm{x}$  measurements	we present a velocity dispersion-based mass calibration of the south poletelescope sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey (spt-sz) galaxy cluster sample.using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster candidates from 720 deg2of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and 16 x-ray yxmeasurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate themass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. thecalibrations using $\sigma_v$ and yx are consistent at the $0.6\sigma$ level,with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. we use the fullcluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. thespt cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the wmap9 orplanck+wmap9 polarization (wp) data, but assuming the sum of the neutrinomasses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ ev, we find the datasets to be consistent at the1.0$\sigma$ level for wmap9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for planck+wp. allowing for larger$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. when we combine the cluster andplanck+wp datasets with bao and snia, the preferred cluster masses are$1.9\sigma$ higher than the yx calibration and $0.8\sigma$ higher than the$\sigma_v$ calibration. given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23% in mass,respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension,indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of thedata. using the multi-probe dataset, we measure $\omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and$\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. within a $\nu$cdm model we find $\sum m_\nu =0.148\pm0.081$ ev. we present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of stateparameter $w$ to vary, we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$,demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with alcdm model ($\gamma=0.55; \,w=-1$).

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

astro-ph;0012037	evidence against a redshift z&gt;6 for the galaxy stis 123627+621755	the identification of galaxies at extreme distances provides our most directinformation on the earliest phases of galaxy formation. the distance implied byredshifts z &gt; 5 makes this a challenging endeavor for even the most luminoussources; interpretation of low signal-to-noise ratio observations of faintgalaxies is difficult and occasional misidentifications will occur. here wereport on stis 123627+621755, a galaxy with a suggested spectroscopic redshiftof z = 6.68 and the most distant spectroscopically-identified object claimed.for the suggested redshift and reported spectral energy distribution, thegalaxy should be essentially invisible shortward of 9300 angstroms because theintervening intergalactic medium absorbs essentially all light energetic enoughto ionize neutral hydrogen (lambda &lt; (1 + z) x 912 angstroms; the redshiftedlyman limit). the galaxy should be relatively bright in the near-infrared withf(nu) ~ 1 microjy. here we report a detection of the galaxy at 6700 angstroms,below the lyman limit for z = 6.68. we also report a non-detection at 1.2microns, implying the flux has dropped by a factor of three or more betweenrest 1216 angstroms and rest 1560 angstroms for z = 6.68. our observations areinconsistent with the suggested extreme distance of stis 123627+621755 andconservatively require z &lt; 6.

astro-ph;0012250	the intracluster medium in z &gt; 1 galaxy clusters	the chandra x-ray observatory was used to obtain a 190 ks image of three highredshift galaxy clusters in one observation. the results of our analysis ofthese data are reported for the two z &gt; 1 clusters in this lynx field,including the most distant known x-ray selected cluster. spatially-extendedx-ray emission was detected from both these clusters, indicating the presenceof hot gas in their intracluster media. a fit to the x-ray spectrum of rxj0849+4452, at z=1.26, yields a temperature of kt = 5.8^{+2.8}_{-1.7} kev.using this temperature and the assumption of an isothermal sphere, the totalmass of rx j0849+4452 is found to be 4.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9} x 10^{14} h_{65}^{-1}m_{\sun} within r = 1 h_{65}^{-1} mpc. the t_x for rx j0849+4452 approximatelyagrees with the expectation based on its l_{bol} = 3.3^{+0.9}_{-0.5} x 10^{44}$erg s$^{-1} according to the low redshift l_x - t_x relation. the verydifferent distributions of x-ray emitting gas and of the red member galaxies inthe two z &gt; 1 clusters, in contrast to the similarity of the optical/ir colorsof those galaxies, suggests that the early-type galaxies mostly formed beforetheir host clusters.

astro-ph;0105011	rx j0848+4456: disentangling a moderate redshift cluster	we present a multi-wavelength study of rx j0848+4456, a cluster of galaxiesdiscovered through x-ray emission in the rosat deep cluster survey. ourobservations consist of wfpc2 imaging, optical spectra, and x-ray datacollected with the chandra observatory. we find that rx j0848+4456 consists ofan x-ray emitting cluster of galaxies at a redshift of z=0.570 and a group atslightly lower redshift, z=0.543, with little x-ray emission. this lowerredshift system, however, is a gravitational lens, with the lensed galaxy anunusual agn or star-forming system at z=3.356.  the cluster has an x-ray temperature of kt = 3.6 +/- 0.4 kev, a bolometricluminosity of 1.0e44 +/- 0.3e44 erg/s and a velocity dispersion of 670 +/- 50km/s. these values all agree with the low redshift correlations for clusters ofgalaxies, implying a relaxed system with the icm in equilibrium with the darkmatter potential. the lower redshift group of galaxies at z=0.543 has, at most1/5, more likely 1/10, of the x-ray luminosity of rx j0848+4456. despite beinga gravitational lens, this is a low mass system, with an x-ray temperature ofkt = 2.3 +0.5 -0.4 kev and a velocity dispersion of only 430 +/- 20 km/s. ourobservations show the importance of detailed studies of clusters of galaxieswhen using them as probes of cosmological mass functions.

(sn 1991bg, the prototype of thesubclass of fast declining type ia supernovae, is a special case.) thedispersion in the hubble diagram in jhk is only ~0.15 mag. the near-infraredproperties of type ia supernovae continue to be excellent measures of theluminosity distances to the supernova host galaxies, due to the need for onlysmall corrections from the epoch of observation to maximum light, lowdispersion in absolute magnitudes at maximum light, and the minimal reddeningeffects in the near-infrared.

(1998), yields a sampleof cluster early--type galaxies that span a lookback time of 9 gigayears fromthe present. we see the colors of the early--type cluster members become bluerwith increasing redshift. we fit a set of models to the change in the color asa function of redshift with the best fitting values ranging from a formationredshift of 3^+2_-1 to 5_-3. the large scatter in resulting formation epochs,which depends on the details of the models used, implies that we can concludethat the oldest stars in the elliptical galaxies appear to have formed atredshifts of z&gt;3. we find possible evolution in the scatter of the colors, withsome high redshift clusters showing scatter as small as the coma cluster butothers showing much larger scatter. those clusters with a small scatter implyeither a formation redshift of at least z ~ 3 or a smaller spread in the rangeof formation redshifts at lower redshifts, assuming a gaussian distribution ofstar-formation around the mean epoch.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;9803019	morphological evolution in high redshift radio galaxies and the  formation of giant elliptical galaxies	we present deep near-ir images of high redshift radio galaxies obtained withnirc on the keck i telescope. in most cases, the near-ir data sample restwavelengths at ~4000 angstroms, free of strong emission lines. at z &gt; 3, therest frame optical morphologies generally have faint, large-scale emissionsurrounding multiple components of ~10 kpc size. the brightest of the smallknots are often aligned with the radio structures. at z &lt; 3, the morphologieschange dramatically, showing single, compact structures without radio-alignedfeatures. the sizes and luminosities of the individual components in the z &gt; 3radio galaxies are similar to those of the radio-quiet star-forming galaxiesdiscovered at z ~ 3 by the lyman dropout technique. the rest frame opticalcolors of the z &gt; 3 radio galaxies are consistent with models in which recentstar formation dominates the observed ir light, and in one case (4c 41.17) wehave direct spectroscopic evidence for massive star formation (dey et al.1997a). our results suggest that the z &gt; 3 radio galaxies evolve into verymassive elliptical galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 3, in qualitative agreement with thehierarchical model of galaxy formation. we also discuss the hubble diagram ofradio galaxies, the possibility of a radio power dependence in the k-zrelation, and the implications for radio galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9803327	color--luminosity relations for the resolved hot stellar populations in  the centers of m 31 and m 32	we present faint object camera (foc) ultraviolet images of the central14x14'' of messier 31 and messier 32. the hot stellar population detected inthe composite uv spectra of these nearby galaxies is partially resolved intoindividual stars, and their individual colors and apparent magnitudes aremeasured. we detect 433 stars in m 31 and 138 stars in m 32, down to detectionlimits of m_f275w = 25.5 mag and m_f175w = 24.5 mag. we investigate theluminosity functions of the sources, their spatial distribution, theircolor-magnitude diagrams, and their total integrated far-uv flux. although m 32has a weaker uv upturn than m 31, the luminosity functions and color-magnitudediagrams of m 31 and m 32 are surprisingly similar, and are inconsistent with amajority contribution from any of the following: pagb stars more massive than0.56 msun, main sequence stars, or blue stragglers. both the the luminosityfunctions and color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with a dominantpopulation of stars that have evolved from the extreme horizontal branch (ehb)along tracks with masses between 0.47 and 0.53 msun. these stars are well belowthe detection limits of our images while on the zero-age ehb, but becomedetectable while in the more luminous (but shorter) agb-manque' and post-earlyasymptotic giant branch (peagb) phases. the foc observations require that onlya only a very small fraction of the main sequence population (2% in m 31 and0.5% in m 32) in these two galaxies evolve though the ehb and post-ehb phases,with the remainder evolving through bright pagb evolution that is so rapid thatfew if any stars are expected in the small field of view covered by the foc.

astro-ph;9812110	a polarimetric search for hidden quasars in three radio selected  ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we have carried out a spectropolarimetric search for hidden broad-linequasars in three ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) discovered in thepositional correlations between sources detected in deep radio surveys and theiras faint source catalog. only the high-ionization seyfert 2 galaxy tfj1736+1122 is highly polarized, displaying a broad-line spectrum visible inpolarized light. the other two objects, tf j1020+6436 and ff j1614+3234,display spectra dominated by a population of young (a-type) stars similar tothose of ``e + a'' galaxies. they are unpolarized, showing no sign of hiddenbroad-line regions. the presence of young starburst components in all threegalaxies indicates that the ulirg phenomenon encompasses both agn and starburstactivity, but the most energetic ulirgs do not necessarily harbor ``buriedquasars''.  we find that a luminous infrared galaxy is most likely to host an obscuredquasar if it exhibits a high-ionization ([o iii] 5007/hb &gt;~ 5) spectrum typicalof a ``classic'' seyfert 2 galaxy with little or no balmer absorption lines, is``ultraluminous'' (l_ir &gt;~ 10^12 l_sun), and has a ``warm'' ir color (f_25/f_60&gt;~ 0.25). the detection of hidden quasars in this group but not in thelow-ionization, starburst-dominated ulirgs (classified as liners or h iigalaxies) may indicate an evolutionary connection, with the latter being foundin younger systems.

astro-ph;9901387	discovery of a radio-loud/radio-quiet binary quasar	we report the discovery of a small separation quasar pair (z=0.586, o=18.4,19.2, sep. = 2.3 arcsec) associated with the radio source firstj164311.3+315618 (s_1400 = 120 mjy). the spectrum of the brighter quasar (a)has a much stronger narrow emission-line spectrum than the other (b), and alsostronger balmer lines relative to the continuum. the continuum ratio of thespectra is flat in the blue at about 2.1, but falls to 1.5 at longerwavelengths. a k' image shows two unresolved sources with a flux ratio of 1.3.the different colors appear to result from the contribution of the host galaxyof b, which is evident from ca ii and high-order balmer absorption linesindicative of a substantial young stellar population. new 3.6 cm vlaobservations show that the compact radio source is coincident with quasar a (bis only marginally detected). we rule out the lensing hypothesis because theoptical flux ratio is a/b = 1.2 to 2, while the radio flux ratio is a/b &gt; 40,and conclude that this system is a binary. moreover, the radio-loud quasar is acompact steep spectrum source. first j164311.3+315618a, b is the lowestredshift and smallest separation binary quasar yet identified.

astro-ph;9903381	an x-ray selected galaxy cluster at z=1.26	we report the discovery of an x-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=1.26.rxj0848.9+4452 was selected as an x-ray cluster candidate in the rosat deepcluster survey, on the basis of its spatial extent. deep optical and near-irimaging have revealed a galaxy overdensity around the peak of the x-rayemission, with a significant excess of red objects with j-k colors typical ofelliptical galaxies at z&gt;1. spectroscopic observations at the keck ii telescopehave secured 6 galaxy redshifts in the range 1.257&lt;z&lt;1.267 (&lt;z&gt;=1.261), withina 35 arcsec radius around the peak x-ray emission. this system lies only 4.2arcmin away (5.0 h^{-1}_{50} comoving mpc, q_0=0.5) from the galaxy cluster clgj0848+4453, which was identified by stanford et al. (1997) at z=1.273 in anear-ir field galaxy survey, and is also known to be x-ray luminous. assumingthat the x-ray emission is entirely due to hot intra-cluster gas, both thesesystems have similar rest frame luminosities l_x ~=1x10^{44} ergs/s (0.5-2.0kev band). in combination with our spectrophotometric data for the entire 30arcmin^2 field, this suggests the presence of a superstructure, consisting oftwo collapsed, possibly virialized clusters, the first detected to date at z&gt;1.

astro-ph;9905137	the k band luminosity function in galaxy clusters to z ~ 1	we present $k$-band luminosity functions for galaxies in a heterogeneoussample of 38 clusters at $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1$. using infrared-selected galaxy sampleswhich generally reach 2 magnitudes fainter than the characteristic galaxyluminosity $l^*$, we fit schechter functions to background-corrected clustergalaxy counts to determine $k^*$ as a function of redshift. because of themagnitude limit of our data, the faint-end slope $\alpha$ is fixed at -0.9 inthe fitting process. we find that $k^*(z)$ departs from no-evolutionpredictions at $z &gt; 0.4$, and is consistent with the behavior of a simple,passive luminosity evolution model in which galaxies form all their stars in asingle burst at $z_f = 2 (3)$ in an $h_0 = 65 km/s mpc^{-1}, \omega_m = 0.3,\omega_{\lambda}=0.7 (0)$ universe. this differs from the flat or negativeinfrared luminosity evolution which has been reported for high redshift fieldgalaxy samples. we find that the observed evolution appears to be insensitiveto cluster x-ray luminosity or optical richness, implying little variation inthe evolutionary history of galaxies over the range of environmental densitiesspanned by our cluster sample. these results support and extend previousanalyses based on the color evolution of high redshift cluster e/s0 galaxies,indicating not only that their stellar populations formed at high redshift, butthat the assembly of the galaxies themselves was largely complete by $z \approx1$, and that subsequent evolution down to the present epoch was primarilypassive.

astro-ph;9905301	the unusual afterglow of grb 980326: evidence for the gamma-ray  burst/supernova connection	cosmic gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been firmly established as one of themost powerful phenomena in the universe, releasing electromagnetic energyapproaching the rest-mass energy of a neutron star in a few seconds. the twocurrently popular models for grb progenitors are the coalescence of two compactobjects (such as neutron stars or black holes) or collapse of a massive star.an unavoidable consequence of the latter model is that a bright supernovaeshould accompany the grb. the emission from this supernova competes with themuch brighter afterglow produced by the relativistic shock that gives rise tothe grb itself. here we present evidence for an unusual light curve for grb980326 based on new optical observations. the transient brightened ~3 weeksafter the burst to a flux sixty times larger than that extrapolated from therapid decay seen at early time. furthermore, the spectrum changed dramaticallyand became extremely red. we argue that the new source is the underlyingsupernova. if our hypothesis is true then this would be the first evidence fora supernova connection with grbs at cosmological distances. we suggest thatgrbs with long durations are associated with death of massive stars.

astro-ph;9908083	the unusual infrared object hdf-n j123656.3+621322	we describe an object in the hubble deep field north with very unusualnear-infrared properties. it is readily visible in hubble space telescopenicmos images at 1.6um and from the ground at 2.2um, but is undetected (withsignal-to-noise &lt;~ 2) in very deep wfpc2 and nicmos data from 0.3 to 1.1um. thef_nu flux density drops by a factor &gt;~ 8.3 (97.7% confidence) from 1.6 to1.1um. the object is compact but may be slightly resolved in the nicmos 1.6umimage. in a low-resolution, near-infrared spectrogram, we find a possibleemission line at 1.643um, but a reobservation at higher spectral resolutionfailed to confirm the line, leaving its reality in doubt. we consider varioushypotheses for the nature of this object. its colors are unlike those of knowngalactic stars, except perhaps the most extreme carbon stars or mira variableswith thick circumstellar dust shells. it does not appear to be possible toexplain its spectral energy distribution as that of a normal galaxy at anyredshift without additional opacity from either dust or intergalactic neutralhydrogen. the colors can be matched by those of a dusty galaxy at z &gt;~ 2, by amaximally old elliptical galaxy at z &gt;~ 3 (perhaps with some additionalreddening), or by an object at z &gt;~ 10 whose optical and 1.1um light have beensuppressed by the intergalactic medium. under the latter hypothesis, if theluminosity results from stars and not an agn, the object would resemble aclassical, unobscured protogalaxy, with a star formation rate &gt;~ 100 m_sun/yr.such uv-bright objects are evidently rare at 2 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, however, with aspace density several hundred times lower than that of present-day l* galaxies.

astro-ph;9909178	vlt spectroscopy of the z=4.11 radio galaxy tn j1338-1942	we present optical, infrared and radio data of the z=4.11 radio galaxy tnj1338-1942, including an intermediate resolution spectrum obtained with fors1onthe vlt antu telescope. tn j1338-1942 was the first z&gt;4 radio galaxy to bediscovered in the southern hemisphere and is one of the most luminous ly-alphaobjects in its class. the ly-alpha and rest-frame optical emission appearco-spatial with the brightest radio hotspot of this very asymmetric radiosource, suggesting extremely strong interaction with dense ambient clouds. thevlt observations are sufficiently sensitive to detect the continuum flux bothblue-ward and red-ward of the ly-alpha emission, allowing us to measure thely-alpha forest continuum break (ly-alpha 'discontinuity', d_a) and the lymanlimit. we measure a d_a=0.37+-0.1, which is ~0.2 lower than the values foundfor quasars at this redshift. we interpret this difference as possibly due to abias towards large d_a introduced in high--redshift quasar samples that areselected on the basis of specific optical colors. if such a bias would exist inoptically selected quasars, - and even in samples of lyman break galaxies -,then the space density of both classes of object will be underestimated.furthermore, the average hi column density along cosmological lines of sight asdetermined using quasar absorption lines would be overestimated. because oftheir radio-based selection, we argue that z&gt;4 radio galaxies are excellentobjects for investigating d_a statistics.
