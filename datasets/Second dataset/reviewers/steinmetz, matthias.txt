0902.2477	galaxy-induced transformation of dark matter halos	we use n-body/gasdynamical lambdacdm cosmological simulations to examine theeffect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of itsdark halo. two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only theevolution of the dark matter component and a second one where a baryoniccomponent is added. these simulations include radiative cooling but neglectstar formation and feedback, leading most baryons to collect at the halo centerin a disk which is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral.this unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effectthat galaxies may have in transforming their dark halos. we find that the shapeof the halo becomes more axisymmetric: halos are transformed from triaxial intoessentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughlyconstant flattening (c/a ~ 0.85). halos always contract as a result of galaxyassembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the"adiabatic contraction" hypothesis. the reduced contraction helps to reconcilelambdacdm halos with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solarcircle and should alleviate the long-standing difficulty of matchingsimultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy disks and the luminosityfunction. the halo contraction is also less pronounced than found in earliersimulations, a disagreement that suggests that halo contraction is not solely afunction of the initial and final distribution of baryons. not only how muchbaryonic mass has been deposited at the center of a halo matters, but also themode of its deposition. it might prove impossible to predict the halo responsewithout a detailed understanding of a galaxy's assembly history.

0909.4156	the angular momentum problem in cosmological simulations of disk galaxy  formation	we conduct a systematic study of the angular momentum problem in numericalsimulations of disk galaxy formation. we investigate the role of numericalresolution using a semi-cosmological setup which combines an efficient use ofthe number of particles in an isolated halo while preserving the hierarchicalbuild-up of the disk through the merging of clumps. we perform the samesimulation varying the resolution over 4 orders of magnitude. independent onthe level of resolution, the loss of angular momentum stays the same and can betied to dynamical friction during the build-up phase. this is confirmed in acosmological simulation. we also perform simulations including star formationand star formation and supernova feedback. while the former has no influence onthe angular momentum problem, the latter reduces the loss to a levelpotentially in agreement with observations. this is achieved through asuppression of early star formation and therefore the formation of a large,slowly rotating bulge. we conclude that feedback is a critical component toachieve realistic disk galaxies in cosmological simulations. numericalresolution is important, but by itself not capable of solving the angularmomentum problem.

0909.4167	the modelling of feedback processes in cosmological simulations of disk  galaxy formation	we present a systematic study of stellar feedback processes in simulations ofdisk galaxy formation. using a dark matter halo with properties similar to theones for the milky way's stellar halo, we perform a comparison of differentmethods of distributing energy related to feedback processes to the surroundinggas. a most promising standard model is applied to halos spanning a range ofmasses in order to compare the results to disk galaxy scaling relations. withfew exceptions we find little or no angular momentum deficiency for ourgalaxies and a good agreement with the angular momentum-size relation. ourgalaxies are in good agreement with the baryonic tully-fisher relation and theslope of the photometric tully-fisher relation is reproduced. we find azero-point offset of 0.7 to 1 magnitudes, depending on the employed imf. wealso study our standard feedback model in combination with additional physicalprocesses like a uv background, kinetic feedback, a delayed energy depositionas expected for type ia supernovae, mass return and metal-dependent cooling.only a combination of effects yields a real improvement of the resulting galaxyby reducing the bulge, while including metal-dependent cooling increases thebulge again. we find that in general the stellar mass fraction of our galaxiesis too high. in an ad-hoc experiment we show that an removal of the bulge couldreconcile this. however, the fit of the tully-fisher relation can only beimproved by delaying the star formation, but not suppressing it completely. ourmodels do not seem to be efficient enough to achieve either effect. we concludethat disk formation is a complex, highly interconnected problem and we expect asolution to come from a combination of small effects.

1010.1531	the preferred direction of infalling satellite galaxies in the local  group	using a high resolution dm simulation of the local group (lg), conductedwithin the framework of the constrained local universe simulation (clues)project, we investigate the nature of how satellites of the mw and m31 areaccreted. satellites of these galaxies are accreted anisotropically, enteringthe virial radius of their hosts from specific "spots" with respect to thelarge scale structure. furthermore, material which is tidally stripped fromthese satellites is also, at z=0, distributed anisotropically and ischaracterized by an ellipsoidal sub-volume embedded in the halo. the angularpattern created by the locus of satellite infall points and the projectedstripped dm is investigated within a coordinate system determined by thelocation of the lg companion and the simulated virgo cluster across concentricshells ranging from 0.1 to 5 r_vir. remarkably, the principal axis of theellipsoidal sub-volume shows a coherent alignment extending from well withinthe halo to a few r_vir. a spherical harmonics transform applied to the angulardistributions confirms the visual impression: namely, the angular distributionsof both the satellites entry points and stripped dm is dominated by the l=2quadrupole term, whose major principal axis is aligned across the shellsconsidered. it follows that the structure of the outer (r&gt;0.5 r_vir) regions ofthe main halos is closely related to the cosmic web within which it isembedded. given the hypothesis that a large fraction of the stellar halo of themilky way has been accreted from satellites, the present results can be appliedto the stellar halo of the mw and m31. we predict that the remnants of tidallystripped satellites should be embedded in streams of material composed of darkmatter and stars. the present results can therefore shed light on the existenceof satellites embedded within larger streams of matter, such as the segue 2satellite.

1012.2127	the dawning of the stream of aquarius in rave	we identify a new, nearby (0.5 &lt; d &lt; 10 kpc) stream in data from the radialvelocity experiment (rave). as the majority of stars in the stream lie in theconstellation of aquarius we name it the aquarius stream. we identify 15members of the stream lying between 30 &lt; l &lt; 75 and -70&lt; b &lt;-50, withheliocentric line-of-sight velocities v_los~-200 km/s. the members are outliersin the radial velocity distribution, and the overdensity is statisticallysignificant when compared to mock samples created with both the besan\c{c}ongalaxy model and newly-developed code galaxia. the metallicity distributionfunction and isochrone fit in the log g - t_eff plane suggest the streamconsists of a 10 gyr old population with [m/h]~-1.0. we explore relations toother streams and substructures, finding the stream cannot be identified withknown structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the galaxy's halo. usinga simple dynamical model of a dissolving satellite galaxy we account for thelocalization of the stream. we find that the stream is dynamically young andtherefore likely the debris of a recently disrupted dwarf galaxy or globularcluster. the aquarius stream is thus a specimen of ongoing hierarchical galaxyformation, rare for being right in the solar suburb.

1101.1529	sdss-iii: massive spectroscopic surveys of the distant universe, the  milky way galaxy, and extra-solar planetary systems	building on the legacy of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-i and ii),sdss-iii is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes:dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the milkyway, and the population of giant planets around other stars. in keeping withsdss tradition, sdss-iii will provide regular public releases of all its data,beginning with sdss dr8 (which occurred in jan 2011). this paper presents anoverview of the four sdss-iii surveys. boss will measure redshifts of 1.5million massive galaxies and lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using thebao feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations ofthe distance scale and hubble expansion rate at z&lt;0.7 and at z~2.5. segue-2,which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (r=1800) optical spectra of118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matterhalo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. apogee will obtainhigh-resolution (r~30,000), high signal-to-noise (s/n&gt;100 per resolutionelement), h-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the firsthigh-precision spectroscopic survey of all galactic stellar populations (bulge,bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectraldiagnostics. marvels will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 fgk starswith the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed todetect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedenteddata set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giantplanet systems.

1102.4463	a sagittarius-induced origin for the monoceros ring	the monoceros ring is a collection of stars in nearly-circular orbits atroughly 18 kpc from the galactic center. it may have originated (i) as theresponse of the disc to perturbations excited by satellite companions or (ii)from the tidal debris of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. the metallicity of monocerosstars differs from that of disc stars at comparable galactocentric distances,an observation that disfavours the first scenario. on the other hand, circularorbits are difficult to accommodate in the tidal-disruption scenario, since itrequires a satellite which at the time of disruption was itself in a nearlycircular orbit. such satellite could not have formed at the location of thering and, given its low mass, dynamical friction is unlikely to have played amajor role in its orbital evolution. we search cosmological simulations forlow-mass satellites in nearly-circular orbits and find that they result, almostinvariably, from orbital changes induced by collisions with more massivesatellites: the radius of the circular orbit thus traces the galactocentricdistance of the collision. interestingly, the sagittarius dwarf, one of themost luminous satellites of the milky way, is in a polar orbit that crosses thegalactic plane at roughly the same galactocentric distance as monoceros. we useidealized simulations to demonstrate that an encounter with sagittarius mightwell have led to the circularization and subsequent tidal demise of theprogenitor of the monoceros ring.

1104.2037	disc heating: comparing the milky way with cosmological simulations	we present the analysis of a suite of simulations run with differentparticle-and grid-based cosmological hydrodynamical codes and compare them withobservational data of the milky way. this is the first study to makecomparisons of properties of galaxies simulated with particle and grid-basedcodes. our analysis indicates that there is broad agreement between thesedifferent modelling techniques. we study the velocity dispersion - age relationfor disc stars at z=0 and find that four of the simulations are more consistentwith observations by holmberg et al. (2008) in which the stellar disc appearsto undergo continual/secular heating. two other simulations are in betteragreement with the quillen &amp; garnett (2001) observations that suggest a"saturation" in the heating profile for young stars in the disc. none of thesimulations have thin discs as old as that of the milky way. we also analysethe kinematics of disc stars at the time of their birth for different epochs inthe galaxies' evolution and find that in some simulations old stars are borncold within the disc and are subsequently heated, while other simulationspossess old stellar populations which are born relatively hot. the models whichare in better agreement with observations of the milky way's stellar discundergo significantly lower minor-merger/assembly activity after the last majormerger - i.e. once the disc has formed. all of the simulations aresignificantly "hotter" than the milky way disc; on top of the effects ofmergers, we find a "floor" in the dispersion that is related to the underlyingtreatment of the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium, and the lowdensity threshold which such codes use for star formation. this finding hasimportant implications for all studies of disc heating that use hydrodynamicalcodes.

1105.3691	observational properties of the metal-poor thick disk of the milky way  galaxy and insights into its origins	we have undertaken the study of the elemental abundances and kinematicproperties of a metal-poor sample of candidate thick-disk stars selected fromthe rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to differentiate among thepresent scenarios of the formation of the thick disk. in this paper, we reporton a sample of 214 red giant branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74main-sequence/sub-giant branch metal-poor stars, which serves to augment ourprevious sample of only giant stars. we find that the thick disk [alpha/fe]ratios are enhanced, and have little variation (&lt;0.1 dex), in agreement withour previous study. the augmented sample further allows, for the first time,investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients, &lt;0.03 +/- 0.02dex/kpc, in alpha-enhancement, while we find a +0.01 +/- 0.04 dex/kpc radialgradient and a -0.09 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc vertical gradient in iron abundance. inaddition, we show that the peak of the distribution of orbital eccentricitiesfor our sample agrees better with models in which the stars that comprise thethick disk were formed primarily in the galaxy, with direct accretion of starscontributing little. our results thus disfavor direct accretion of stars fromdwarf galaxies into the thick disk as a major contributor to the thick diskpopulation, but cannot discriminate between alternative models for the thickdisk, such as those that invoke high-redshift (gas-rich) mergers, heating of apre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial migrationof stars.

1110.0823	kinematics in galactic tidal tails - a source for hypervelocity stars?	[abridged] in this work we study in detail the kinematics of tidal debrisstars to investigate the implications of the new scenario that the observedsample of hypervelocity stars could partly originate from a dwarf-host galaxycollision. we use a suite of n-body simulations following the encounter of asatellite galaxy with its milky way-type host galaxy to gather statistics onthe properties of stripped-off stars. we study especially the orbital energydistribution of this population.  we quantify the typical pattern in angular and phase space formed by thedebris stars. we further develop a simple stripping model predicting thekinematics of stripped-off stars. we show that the distribution of orbitalenergies in the tidal debris has a typical form which can be described quiteaccurately by a simple function. based on this we develop a method to predictthe energy distribution which allows us to evaluate the significance and theimplications of high velocity stars in satellite tidal debris.  generally tidal collisions of satellite galaxy produce stars which escapeinto the intragalactic space even if the satellite itself is on a bound orbit.the main parameters determining the maximum energy kick a tidal debris star canget is the initial mass of the satellite and only to a lower extent its orbit.main contributors to an unbound stellar population created in this way aremassive satellites (m_sat &gt; 10^9 m_sun). we thus expect intragalactic stars tohave a metallicity higher than the surviving satellite population of the milkyway. however, the probability that the observed hvs population is significantlycontaminated by tidal debris stars appears small in the light of our results.

1111.1623	metal-poor lithium-rich giants in the radial velocity experiment survey	we report the discovery of eight lithium-rich field giants found in a highresolution spectroscopic sample of over 700 metal-poor stars ([fe/h]&lt;-0.5)selected from the rave survey. the majority of the li-rich giants in our sampleare very metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-1.9), and have a li abundance (in the form of7li), a(li)=log(n(li)/n(h))+12, between 2.30 and 3.63, well above the typicalupper red giant branch limit, a(li)&lt;0.5, while two stars, with a(li)~1.7-1.8,show similar lithium abundances to normal giants at the same gravity. wefurther included two metal-poor, li-rich globular cluster giants in our sample,namely the previously discovered m3-iv101 and newly discovered (in this work)m68-a96. this comprises the largest sample of metal-poor li-rich giants todate. we performed a detailed abundance analysis of all stars, finding that themajority our sample stars have elemental abundances similar to that ofli-normal halo giants. although the evolutionary phase of each li-rich giantcannot be definitively determined, the li-rich phase is likely connected toextra mixing at the red giant branch bump or early asymptotic giant branch thattriggers cool bottom processing in which the bottom of the outer convectiveenvelope is connected to the h-burning shell in the star. the surface of a starbecomes li-enhanced as 7be (which burns to 7li) is transported to the stellarsurface via the cameron-fowler mechanism. we discuss and discriminate amongseveral models for the extra mixing that can cause li-production, given thedetailed abundances of the li-rich giants in our sample.

1201.3365	the cosmic web and the orientation of angular momenta	we use a 64$h^{-1}$mpc dark matter (dm) only cosmological simulation toexamine the large scale orientation of haloes and substructures with respectthe cosmic web. a web classification scheme based on the velocity shear tensoris used to assign to each halo in the simulation a web type: knot, filament,sheet or void. using $\sim10^6$ haloes that span ~3 orders of magnitude in massthe orientation of the halo's spin and the orbital angular momentum ofsubhaloes with respect to the eigenvectors of the shear tensor is examined. wefind that the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes tends to align with theintermediate eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor for all haloes in knots,filaments and sheets. this result indicates that the kinematics ofsubstructures located deep within the virialized regions of a halo isdetermined by its infall which in turn is determined by the large scalevelocity shear, a surprising result given the virilaized nature of haloes. thenon-random nature of subhalo accretion is thus imprinted on the angularmomentum measured at z = 0. we also find that haloes' spin axis is aligned withthe third eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor in filaments and sheets: thehalo spin axis points along filaments and lies in the plane of cosmic sheets.

1206.0784	tracing the origin of the aquarius stream: i	we present an abundance analysis of six member stars of the recentlydiscovered aquarius stream, in an attempt to ascertain whether this halo streamis real and, if so, to understand its origin. the mean metallicities of the sixstars have a dispersion of only 0.10 dex, indicating that they are part of achemically coherent structure. we then investigate whether the streamrepresents the debris of a disrupted dwarf galaxy or a disrupted globularcluster. the [ni/fe] - [na/fe] plane provides a good diagnostic: globularcluster stars and dwarf spheroidal galaxy stars are well separated in thisplane, and the aquarius stream stars lie unambiguously in the globular clusterregion. the aquarius stream stars also lie on the distinct [na/fe] - [o/fe] and[mg/fe] - [al/fe] relations delineated by galactic globular cluster stars.spectroscopic parameters for the six aquarius stars show that they are tightlyconfined to a 12 gyr, [fe/h] = -1.0, alpha-enhanced isochrone, consistent withtheir identification as globular cluster debris. we present evidence that theaquarius stream may continue through the disk and out into the northern halo.our results indicate a globular cluster origin for the aquarius stream, anddemonstrate the potential for chemical tagging to identify the origins ofgalactic substructures.

1210.4559	the velocity shear tensor: tracer of halo alignment	the alignment of dm halos and the surrounding large scale structure (lss) isexamined in the context of the cosmic web. halo spin, shape and the orbitalangular momentum of subhaloes is investigated relative to the lss using theeigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1mpc/h, deep within the non-linear regime. knots, filaments, sheets and voidsare associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principaldirections simultaneously. each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e.knot halo, filament halo, etc) according to the nature of the collapse at thehalo's position. the full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to besubstantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that theobserved velocity shear is significantly biased. we find that larger masshaloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansionor collapse is more spherical. a correlation is found between the halo's shapeand the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis ofthe halo's shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsingeigenvector. this correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocityshear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. a similar result is foundfor the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. it has been shown that highmass haloes exhibit a spin flip with respect to the lss: we find the mass atwhich this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggestedpreviously. although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit analignment with the lss, providing a possible insight into the highly correlatedco-rotation of the milky way's satellite system. the present study suggeststhat the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studyingthe directional properties of the non-linear lss and of halos and galaxies.

1211.0536	dwarf galaxies and the cosmic web	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group ofgalaxies to identify a mechanism that enables the removal of baryons fromlow-mass halos without appealing to feedback or reionization. as the localgroup forms, matter bound to it develops a network of filaments and pancakes.this moving web of gas and dark matter drifts and sweeps a large volume,overtaking many halos in the process. the dark matter content of these halos isunaffected but their gas can be efficiently removed by ram-pressure. the lossof gas is especially pronounced in low-mass halos due to their lower bindingenergy and has a dramatic effect on the star formation history of affectedsystems. this "cosmic web stripping" may help to explain the scarcity of dwarfgalaxies compared with the numerous low-mass halos expected in \lambda cdm andthe large diversity of star formation histories and morphologies characteristicof faint galaxies. although our results are based on a single high-resolutionsimulation, it is likely that the hydrodynamical interaction of dwarf galaxieswith the cosmic web is a crucial ingredient so far missing from galaxyformation models.

1212.1454	cosmic vorticity and the origin of halo spins	in the standard model of cosmology, structure emerges out of non-rotationalflow and the angular momentum of collapsing halos is induced by tidal torques.the growth of halo angular momentum in the linear and quasi-linear phases isassociated with a shear, curl-free, flow and it is well described within thelinear framework of tidal torque theory (ttt). however, ttt is renderedirrelevant as haloes approach turn around and virialization. at that stage theflow field around halos has non-zero vorticity. using a cosmologicalsimulation, we have examined the importance of the curl of the velocity field(vorticity) in determining halo spin, finding a strong alignment between thetwo. we have also examined the alignment of vorticity with the principle axesof the shear tensor, finding that it tends to be perpendicular to the axisalong which material is collapsing fastest (e1). this behavior is independentof halo masses and cosmic web environment. our results agree with previousfindings on the tendency of halo spin to be perpendicular to e1, and of thespin of (simulated) halos and (observed) galaxies to be aligned with thelarge-scale structure. our results imply that angular momentum growth proceedsin two distinct phases. in the first phase angular momentum emerges out of ashear, curl-free, potential flow, as described by ttt. in the second phase, inwhich haloes approach virialization, the angular momentum emerges out of avortical flow and halo spin becomes strongly aligned with the vorticity of theambient flow field.

0705.0354	constraining dark energy via baryon acoustic oscillations in the  (an)isotropic light-cone power spectrum	the measurement of the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in thegalaxy power spectrum as a function of redshift is a promising method toconstrain the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy w. to measure thescale of the bao precisely, a substantial volume of space must be surveyed. wetest whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relationsused to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this casesufficiently accurate. we investigate the degeneracies in the cosmologicalparameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic powerspectrum. finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured byproposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.  in the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and thatthe simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortionwork fairly well even for large survey volumes. the analysis of thetwo-dimensional anisotropic power spectra enables an independent determinationto be made of the apparent scale of the bao, perpendicular and parallel to theline of sight. this is essential for two-parameter w-models, such as theredshift-dependent dark energy model w=w_0+(1-a)w_a. using planck priors forthe matter and baryon density and delta(h_0)=5% for the hubble constant, weestimate that the bao measurements of future surveys around z=3 and z=1 will beable to constrain, independently of other cosmological probes, a constant w to~ 12% and ~ 11% (68% c.l.), respectively.

1305.5557	cold versus warm dark matter simulations of a galaxy group	the differences between cold (cdm) and warm (wdm) dark matter in theformation of a group of galaxies is examined by running two identicalsimulations where in the wdm case the initial power spectrum has been alteredto mimic a 1kev dark matter particle. the cdm initial conditions wereconstrained to reproduce at z = 0 the correct local environment within which a"local group" (lg) of galaxies may form. two significant differences betweenthe two simulations are found. while in the cdm case a group of galaxies thatresembles the real lg forms, the wdm run fails to reproduce a viable lg,instead forming a diffuse group which is still expanding at z = 0. this issurprising since, due to the suppression of small scale power in its powerspectrum, wdm is naively expected to only affect the collapse of small haloesand not necessarily the dynamics on a scale of a group of galaxies. furthermorethe concentration of baryons in halo center's is greater in cdm than in wdm andthe properties of the disks differ.

1309.4270	new distances to rave stars	probability density functions are determined from new stellar parameters forthe distance moduli of stars for which the radial velocity experiment (rave)has obtained spectra with s/n&gt;=10. single-gaussian fits to the pdf in distancemodulus suffice for roughly half the stars, with most of the other half havingsatisfactory two-gaussian representations. as expected, early-type stars rarelyrequire more than one gaussian. the expectation value of distance is largerthan the distance implied by the expectation of distance modulus; the latter isitself larger than the distance implied by the expectation value of theparallax. our parallaxes of hipparcos stars agree well with the values measuredby hipparcos, so the expectation of parallax is the most reliable distanceindicator. the latter are improved by taking extinction into account. theeffective temperature absolute-magnitude diagram of our stars is significantlyimproved when these pdfs are used to make the diagram. we use the method ofkinematic corrections devised by schoenrich, binney &amp; asplund to check forsystematic errors for general stars and confirm that the most reliable distanceindicator is the expectation of parallax. for cool dwarfs and low-gravitygiants &lt;pi&gt; tends to be larger than the true distance by up to 30 percent. themost satisfactory distances are for dwarfs hotter than 5500 k. we compare ourdistances to stars in 13 open clusters with cluster distances from theliterature and find excellent agreement for the dwarfs and indications that weare over-estimating distances to giants, especially in young clusters.

1309.4285	galactic kinematics and dynamics from rave stars	we analyse the kinematics of ~400000 rave stars. we split the sample into hotand cold dwarfs, red-clump and non-clump giants. the kinematics of the clumpgiants are consistent with being identical with those of non-clump giants. wefit gaussian velocity ellipsoids to the meridional-plane components of velocityof each star class and give formulae from which the shape and orientation ofthe velocity ellipsoid can be determined at any location. the data areconsistent with the giants and the cool dwarfs sharing the same velocityellipsoids; sigma_z rises from 21 kms in the plane to sim 55 kms at |z|=2 kpc,while sigma_r rises from 37 kms to 82 kms. at (r,z) the longest axis of one ofthese velocity ellipsoids is inclined to the galactic plane by an angle ~0.8arctan(z/r). we use a novel formula to obtain precise fits to the highlynon-gaussian distributions of v_phi components.  we compare the observed velocity distributions with the predictions of adynamical model fitted to the velocities of stars that lie within ~150 pc ofthe sun and star counts towards the galactic pole. the model accuratelyreproduces the non-gaussian nature of the v_r and v_z distributions andprovides excellent fits to the data for v_z at all locations. the model v_phidistributions for the cool dwarfs fit the data extremely well, while those forthe hot dwarfs have displacements to low v_phi that grow with |z| from verysmall values near the plane. at |z|&gt;0.5 kpc, the theoretical v_phidistributions for giants show a deficit of stars with large v_phi and the modelv_r distributions are too narrow. systematically over-estimating distances by20 per cent introduces asymmetry into the model v_r and v_z distributions nearthe plane and but significantly improves the fits to the data at |z|&gt;0.5 kpc.the quality of the fits lends credence to the assumed, disc-dominated,gravitational potential.

1311.1215	counterrotating stars in simulated galaxy disks	counterrotating stars in disk galaxies are a puzzling dynamical feature whoseorigin has been ascribed to either satellite accretion events or to diskinstabilities triggered by deviations from axisymmetry. we use a cosmologicalsimulation of the formation of a disk galaxy to show that counterrotatingstellar disk components may arise naturally in hierarchically-clusteringscenarios even in the absence of merging. the simulated disk galaxy consists oftwo coplanar, overlapping stellar components with opposite spins: an innercounterrotating bar-like structure made up mostly of old stars surrounded by anextended, rotationally-supported disk of younger stars. the opposite-spincomponents originate from material accreted from two distinct filamentarystructures which at turn around, when their net spin is acquired, intersectdelineating a "v"-like structure. each filament torques the other in oppositedirections; the filament that first drains into the galaxy forms the innercounterrotating bar, while material accreted from the other filament forms theouter disk. mergers do not play a substantial role and most stars in the galaxyare formed in situ; only 9% of all stars are contributed by accretion events.the formation scenario we describe here implies a significant age differencebetween the co- and counterrotating components, which may be used todiscriminate between competing scenarios for the origin of counterrotatingstars in disk galaxies.

1402.4479	the galactic bar and the large scale velocity gradients in the galactic  disk	aims: we investigate whether the cylindrical (galactocentric) radial velocitygradient of ~ -3 km/s/kpc, directed radially from the galactic center andrecently observed in the stars of the solar neighborhood with the rave survey,can be explained by the resonant effects of the bar near the solarneighborhood.  methods: we compared the results of test particle simulations of the milkyway with a potential that includes a rotating bar with observations from therave survey. to this end we applied the rave selection function to thesimulations and convolved these with the characteristic rave errors. weexplored different "solar neighborhoods" in the simulations, as well asdifferent bar models  results: we find that the bar induces a negative radial velocity gradient atevery height from the galactic plane, outside the outer lindblad resonance andfor angles from the long axis of the bar compatible with the current estimates.the selection function and errors do not wash away the gradient, but often makeit steeper, especially near the galactic plane, because this is where the ravesurvey is less radially extended. no gradient in the vertical velocityispresent in our simulations, from which we may conclude that this cannot beinduced by the bar.

1403.7528	the distribution of gas in the local group from constrained cosmological  simulations: the case for andromeda and the milky way galaxies	we study the gas distribution in the milky way and andromeda using aconstrained cosmological simulation of the local group (lg) within the contextof the clues (constrained local universe simulations) project. we analyse theproperties of gas in the simulated galaxies at $z=0$ for three differentphases: `cold', `hot' and hi, and compare our results with observations. theamount of material in the hot halo ($m_{hot}\approx4-5\times10^{10}\,$m$_{\odot}$), and the cold($m_{cold}(r\lesssim10\,$kpc$)\approx10^{8}\,$m$_{\odot}$) and hi($m_{hi}(r\lesssim50\,$kpc$)\approx 3-4\times10^8\,$m$_{\odot}$) componentsdisplay a reasonable agreement with observations. we also compute theaccretion/ejection rates together with the hi (radial and all-sky) coveringfractions. the integrated hi accretion rate within $r=50\,$kpc gives$\sim$$0.2-0.3\,$m$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$, i.e. close to that obtained fromhigh-velocity clouds in the milky way. we find that the global accretion rateis dominated by hot material, although ionized gas with $t\lesssim10^5\,$k cancontribute significantly too. the $net$ accretion rates of $all$ material atthe virial radii are $6-8\,$m$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$. at $z=0$, we find asignificant gas excess between the two galaxies, as compared to any otherdirection, resulting from the overlap of their gaseous haloes. in oursimulation, the gas excess first occurs at $z\sim1$, as a consequence of thekinematical evolution of the lg.

1405.5540	the imprint of reionization on the star formation histories of dwarf  galaxies	we explore the impact of cosmic reionization on nearby isolated dwarfgalaxies using a compilation of sfhs estimated from deep hst data and acosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the local group. the nearby dwarfsshow a wide diversity of star formation histories; from ancient systems thathave largely completed their star formation $\sim 10$ gyr ago to young dwarfsthat have formed the majority of their stars in the past $\sim 5$ gyr totwo-component systems characterized by the overlap of comparable numbers of oldand young stars. taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips tolower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4&lt;t$/gyr $&lt;8$), a feature thatwe trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. reionizationheats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low masshalos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that correspondsto a virial temperature of $\sim 2 \times 10^4 $ $\mathrm{k}$ at $z_{\rmreion}$.  the loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity ofearly-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early starformation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single oldstellar component prevails. in halos below the threshold at $z_{\rm reion}$,reionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lastsuntil the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cooland form stars. young stellar components therefore dominate in dwarfs whosehalos assemble late and thus form few stars before reionization. two-componentsystems may be traced to late mergers of individual examples of the twoaforementioned cases. the relative dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearbydwarfs might thus be the clearest signature yet identified of the imprint ofcosmic reionization on the star formation history of dwarf galaxies.

1412.1482	overview of the sdss-iv manga survey: mapping nearby galaxies at apache  point observatory	we present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey calledmanga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory), one of three coreprograms in the fourth-generation sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iv) that beganon 2014 july 1. manga will investigate the internal kinematic structure andcomposition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearbygalaxies. we summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and surveydesign in the context of manga's key science goals and present prototypeobservations to demonstrate manga's scientific potential. manga employsdithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary indiameter from 12" (19 fibers) to 32" (127 fibers). two dual-channelspectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 a atr~2000. with a typical integration time of 3 hr, manga reaches a target r-bandsignal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (per a, per 2" fiber) at 23 ab mag per sq. arcsec,which is typical for the outskirts of manga galaxies. targets are selected withstellar mass greater than 1e9 msun using sdss-i redshifts and i-band luminosityto achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, anapproximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a widerange of environments. analysis of our prototype observations demonstratesmanga's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formationand quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, andmap the composition of stellar populations. manga's spatially resolved spectrawill enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies inthe coming 6 yr.

1501.03083	the effect of environment on milky way-mass galaxies in a constrained  simulation of the local group	in this letter we present, for the first time, a study of star formationrate, gas fraction and galaxy morphology of a constrained simulation of themilky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) galaxies, compared to other mw-massgalaxies. by combining with unconstrained simulations we cover a sufficientvolume to compare these galaxies environmental densities ranging from the fieldto that of the local group (lg). this is particularly relevant as it has beenshown that, quite generally, galaxy properties depend intimately upon theirenvironment, most prominently when galaxies in clusters are compared to thosein the field. for galaxies in loose groups such as the lg, however,environmental effects have been less clear. we consider the galaxy'senvironmental density in spheres of 1200 kpc (comoving) and find that whilstenvironment does not appear to directly affect morphology, there is a positivetrend with star formation rates. this enhancement in star formation occurssystematically for galaxies in higher density environments, regardless whetherthey are part of the lg or in filaments. our simulations suggest that thericher environment at mpc-scales may help replenish the star-forming gas,allowing higher specific star formation rates in galaxies such as the mw.

1501.05500	spectro-photometric distances to stars: a general-purpose bayesian  approach	we developed a code that estimates distances to stars using measuredspectroscopic and photometric quantities. we employ a bayesian approach tobuild the probability distribution function over stellar evolutionary modelsgiven these data, delivering estimates of model parameters for each starindividually. the code was first tested on simulations, successfully recoveringinput distances to mock stars with &lt;1% bias.the method-intrinsic randomdistance uncertainties for typical spectroscopic survey measurements amount toaround 10% for dwarf stars and 20\% for giants, and are most sensitive to thequality of $\log g$ measurements. the code was validated by comparing ourdistance estimates to parallax measurements from the hipparcos mission fornearby stars (&lt; 300 pc), to asteroseismic distances of corot red giant stars,and to known distances of well-studied open and globular clusters. the externalcomparisons confirm that our distances are subject to very small systematicbiases with respect to the fundamental hipparcos scale (+0.4 % for dwarfs, and+1.6% for giants). the typical random distance scatter is 18% for dwarfs, and26% for giants. for the corot-apogee sample, the typical random distancescatter is ~15%, both for the nearby and farther data. our distances aresystematically larger than the corot ones by about +9%, which can mostly beattributed to the different choice of priors. the comparison to known distancesof star clusters from segue and apogee has led to significant systematicdifferences for many cluster stars, but with opposite signs, and withsubstantial scatter. finally, we tested our distances against those previouslydetermined for a high-quality sample of giant stars from the rave survey, againfinding a small systematic trend of +5% and an rms scatter of 30%.

1503.00723	the milky way and andromeda galaxies in a constrained hydrodynamical  simulation: morphological evolution	we study the two main constituent galaxies of a constrained simulation of thelocal group as candidates for the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31). we focuson the formation of the stellar discs and its relation to the formation of thegroup as a rich system with two massive galaxies, and investigate the effectsof mergers and accretion as drivers of morphological transformations. we use astate-of-the-art hydrodynamical code which includes star formation, feedbackand chemical enrichment to carry out our study. we run two simulations, wherewe include or neglect the effects of radiation pressure from stars, toinvestigate the impact of this process on the morphologies and star formationrates of the simulated galaxies. we find that the simulated m31 and mw havedifferent formation histories, even though both inhabit, at z=0, the sameenvironment. these differences directly translate into and explain variationsin their star formation rates, in-situ fractions and final morphologies. them31 candidate has an active merger history, as a result of which its stellardisc is unable to survive unaffected until the present time. in contrast, themw candidate has a smoother history with no major mergers at late times, andforms a disc that grows steadily; at z=0 the simulated mw has an extended,rotationally-supported disc which is dominant over the bulge. our two feedbackimplementations predict similar evolution of the galaxies and their discs,although some variations are detected, the most important of which is theformation time of the discs: in the model with weaker/stronger feedback thediscs form earlier/later. in summary, by comparing the formation histories ofthe two galaxies, we conclude that the particular merger/accretion history of agalaxy rather than its environment at the lg-scales is the main driver of theformation and subsequent growth or destruction of galaxy discs.

1503.02110	chemical cartography with apogee: metallicity distribution functions and  the chemical structure of the milky way disk	using a sample of 69,919 red giants from the sdss-iii/apogee data release 12,we measure the distribution of stars in the [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane andthe metallicity distribution functions (mdf) across an unprecedented volume ofthe milky way disk, with radius $3&lt;r&lt;15$ kpc and height $|z|&lt;2$ kpc. stars inthe inner disk ($r&lt;5$ kpc) lie along a single track in [$\alpha$/fe] vs.[fe/h], starting with $\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at[$\alpha$/fe]$\sim0$ and [fe/h]$\sim+0.4$. at larger radii we find two distinctsequences in [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] space, with a roughly solar-$\alpha$sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-$\alpha$ sequence thatmerges with the low-$\alpha$ sequence at super-solar [fe/h]. the location ofthe high-$\alpha$ sequence is nearly constant across the disk, however thereare very few high-$\alpha$ stars at $r&gt;11$ kpc. the peak of the midplane mdfshifts to lower metallicity at larger $r$, reflecting the galactic metallicitygradient. most strikingly, the shape of the midplane mdf changes systematicallywith radius, with a negatively skewed distribution at $3&lt;r&lt;7$ kpc, to a roughlygaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in theouter galaxy. for stars with $|z|&gt;1$ kpc or [$\alpha$/fe]$&gt;0.18$, the mdf showslittle dependence on $r$. the positive skewness of the outer disk mdf may be asignature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations byorbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of mdf shape but asimple model of radial migration can do so.

1503.05915	planes of satellite galaxies and the cosmic web	recent observational studies have demonstrated that the majority of satellitegalaxies tend to orbit their hosts on highly flattened, vast, possiblyco-rotating planes. two nearly parallel planes of satellites have beenconfirmed around the m31 galaxy and around the centaurus a galaxy, while themilky way also sports a plane of satellites. it has been argued that such analignment of satellites on vast planes is unexpected in the standard({\lambda}cdm) model of cosmology if not even in contradiction to its genericpredictions. guided by {\lambda}cdm numerical simulations, which suggest thatsatellites are channeled towards hosts along the axis of the slowest collapseas dictated by the ambient velocity shear tensor, we re-examine the planes oflocal satellites systems within the framework of the local shear tensor derivedfrom the cosmicflows-2 dataset. the analysis reveals that the local group andcentaurus a reside in a filament stretched by the virgo cluster and compressedby the expansion of the local void. four out of five thin planes of satellitegalaxies are indeed closely aligned with the axis of compression induced by thelocal void. being the less massive system, the moderate misalignment of themilky way's satellite plane can likely be ascribed to its greatersusceptibility to tidal torques, as suggested by numerical simulations. thealignment of satellite systems in the local universe with the ambient shearfield is thus in general agreement with predictions of the {\lambda}cdm model.

1505.06226	unveiling the counter-rotating nature of the kinematically distinct core  in ngc5813 with muse	muse observations of ngc5813 reveal a complex structure in the velocitydispersion map, previously hinted by sauron observations. the structure isreminiscent of velocity dispersion maps of galaxies comprising twocounter-rotating discs, and may explain the existence of the kinematicallydistinct core (kdc). further evidence for two counter-rotating components comesfrom the analysis of the higher moments of the stellar line-of-sight velocitydistributions and fitting muse spectra with two separate gaussian line-of-sightvelocity distributions. the emission-line kinematics show evidence of beinglinked to the present cooling flows and the buoyant cavities seen in x-rays. wedetect ionised gas in a nuclear disc-like structure, oriented like the kdc,which is, however, not directly related to the kdc. we build an axisymmetricschwarzschild dynamical model, which shows that the muse kinematics can bereproduced well with two counter-rotating orbit families, characterised byrelatively low angular momentum components, but clearly separated in integralphase space and with radially varying contributions. the model indicates thatthe counter-rotating components in ngc5813 are not thin discs, but dynamicallyhot structures. our findings give further evidence that kdcs in massivegalaxies should not necessarily be considered as structurally or dynamicallydecoupled regions, but as the outcomes of the mixing of different orbitalfamilies, where the balance in the distribution of mass of the orbital familiesis crucial. we discuss the formation of the kdc in ngc5813 within the frameworkof gas accretion, binary mergers and formation of turbulent thick discs fromcold streams at high redshift.

1510.04900	cosmicflows constrained local universe simulations	this paper combines observational datasets and cosmological simulations togenerate realistic numerical replicas of the nearby universe. these latter areexcellent laboratories for studies of the non-linear process of structureformation in our neighborhood. with measurements of radial peculiar velocitiesin the local universe (cosmicflows-2) and a newly developed technique, weproduce constrained local universe simulations (clues). to assess the qualityof these constrained simulations, we compare them with random simulations aswell as with local observations. the cosmic variance, defined as the meanone-sigma scatter of cell-to-cell comparison between two fields, issignificantly smaller for the constrained simulations than for the randomsimulations. within the inner part of the box where most of the constraintsare, the scatter is smaller by a factor 2 to 3 on a 5 mpc/h scale with respectto that found for random simulations. this one-sigma scatter obtained whencomparing the simulated and the observation-reconstructed velocity fields isonly 104 +/- 4 km/s i.e. the linear theory threshold. these two resultsdemonstrate that these simulations are in agreement with each other and withthe observations of our neighborhood. for the first time, simulationsconstrained with observational radial peculiar velocities resemble the localuniverse up to a distance of 150 mpc/h on a scale of a few tens of megaparsecs.when focusing on the inner part of the box, the resemblance with our cosmicneighborhood extends to a few megaparsecs (&lt; 5 mpc/h). the simulations providea proper large scale environment for studies of the formation of nearbyobjects.

1511.06188	mergers and the outside-in formation of dwarf spheroidals	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group toexplore the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidalgalaxies. we find that a number of simulated dwarfs form "outside-in", with anold, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentratedmetal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like sculptor orsextans. we focus on a few examples where stars form in two populationsdistinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. thespatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; theold stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young populationforms largely in situ. the older component results from a first episode of starformation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects ofstellar feedback and reionization. the younger component forms when a lateaccretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. the effect of mergers isto disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasingtheir central density relative to the young population. we argue thatdwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systemswith multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of ageand metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.

1512.02236	the alignment of galaxy spin with the shear field in observations	tidal torque theory suggests that galaxies gain angular momentum in thelinear stage of structure formation. such a theory predicts alignments betweenthe spin of haloes and tidal shear field. however, non-linear evolution andangular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. in thispaper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic shear field from observed peculiarvelocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within $115\,\mathrm{mpc} $ ($\sim8000 \, {\mathrm {km}}{\mathrm s}^{-1}$) from 2mrscatalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes ofshear field. although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked atsimilar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments withvelocity-shear field. ellipticals in the 2mrs sample, show a statisticallysignificant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. ingeneral, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis ofgreatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression.spiral galaxies show no signal. such an alignment is significantly strengthenedwhen considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity fieldreconstruction. when examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axisof greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. this resultindicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairlynoisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strongenough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered -especially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.

astro-ph;0001003	dark halo and disk galaxy scaling laws in hierarchical universes	we use cosmological n-body/gasdynamical simulations that include starformation and feedback to examine the proposal that scaling laws between thetotal luminosity, rotation speed, and angular momentum of disk galaxies reflectanalogous correlations between the structural parameters of their surroundingdark matter halos. the numerical experiments follow the formation ofgalaxy-sized halos in two cold dark matter dominated universes: the standardomega=1 cdm scenario and the currently popular lcdm model. we find that theslope and scatter of the i-band tully-fisher relation are well reproduced inthe simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of thecosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: largesystematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxiesand in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in ournumerical experiments. the tully-fisher slope and scatter are recovered in thismodel as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assemblyof the luminous component of the galaxy. we conclude that models that neglectthe self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of thehalo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope ofthe tully-fisher relation. our models fail, however, to match the zero-point ofthe tully-fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking diskrotation speed and angular momentum. these failures can be traced,respectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed inthe cold dark matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxydisks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events.

astro-ph;0208380	tidal torques and galactic warps	(abridged) we investigate how galactic disks react to external tidal torques.we calculate the strength and radial dependence of torques on disks that arisefrom a misalignment between the disk and the main axis system of a flatteneddark matter halo. we find that except for in the very inner regions, thetorques are well-described by a power law of the form $\tau \propto r^{-2.5}$.the magnitude of the torque is large enough for the entire disk to react to thetorque in less than the hubble time. we demonstrate analytically that diskswhich are originally located in the $xy$-plane and which are subjected to atorque around the x-axis tilt around the y-axis, as also found in fullynon-linear n-body simulations. we further demonstrate that that the torquecauses the radius of a chosen particle to increase with time. investigations oftilting disks which treat the disk as a set of solid rings thus maysystematically overestimate the effects of the torque by a factor of two. fortorques of the form we investigate, the inner regions of the disk react to thetorque faster than the outer regions, resulting in a trailing warp. we thenstudy the effect of the self-gravity of the disk in such a scenario usingnumerical n-body models. self-gravity flattens out the inner regions of thedisk, but these regions are tilted with respect to their initial plane followedby a non-flat outer region whose tilt decreases with radius. the ``warpradius,'' which marks the end of the inner flat disk, grows throughout the diskat a rate that depends only on the strength of the torque and the local surfacedensity of the disk.

astro-ph;0212282	simulations of galaxy formation in a lambda cdm universe ii: the fine  structure of simulated galactic disks	we present a detailed analysis of the dynamical properties of a simulateddisk galaxy assembled hierarchically in the lambda cdm cosmogony. at z=0, twodistinct dynamical components are identified on the basis of the orbitalparameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating, centrally concentratedspheroid and a disk-like component largely supported by rotation. thesecomponents are also recognized in the surface brightness profile of the galaxy,which can be very well approximated by the superposition of an r^{1/4} spheroidand an exponential disk. however, neither does the dynamically-identifiedspheroid follow de vaucouleurs' law nor is the disk purely exponential, aresultwhich calls for caution when estimating the importance of the disk fromtraditional photometric decomposition techniques. the disk may be furtherdecomposed into a thin, dynamically cold component with stars on nearlycircularorbits and a hotter, thicker component with orbital parameterstransitional between the thin disk and the spheroid. the spheroid is old, andhas essentiallyno stars younger than the time elapsed since the last majoraccretion event ~8 gyr ago. the majority of thin disk stars, form after themerging activity is over, although a significant fraction ~15% of thin-diskstars are old enough to predate the last major merger event. this unexpectedpopulation of old disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satelliteswhose orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits werecircularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. our resultshighlight the role of satellite accretion events in shaping the disk and thespheroidal component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly process of agalaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar populations.

astro-ph;0301224	simulations of galaxy formation in a lambda cdm universe iii: the  dissipative formation of an elliptical galaxy	we examine in detail the dynamical structure of an elliptical galaxysimulated in the lambda cdm scenario. the morphology of the galaxy evolvesdramatically over time in response to the mode and timing of mass accretion;smooth deposition of cooled gas leads to the formation of centrifugallysupported disks, whilst major mergers disperse stellar disks into spheroids.these two modes of accretion alternate successively until z~0.6, when thegalaxy undergoes one last major (1:2) merger that consumes much of theremaining gas into stars. little gas cools and accretes subsequently and, as aresult, most stars at z=0 are in a spheroidal component that resemblespresent-day elliptical galaxies. dynamically, the galaxy is well approximatedby an e4 oblate rotator. boxy isophotes are obtained when the galaxy is seenface-on and vrot/sigma&lt;&lt;1. on the other hand, disky isophotes are found forinclinations which maximize vrot/sigma. the line-of-sight velocity distributionis nearly gaussian at all radii. the sign of the gauss-hermite skewnessparameter h3 is anti-correlated with the apparent sense of rotation, inagreement with observed trends. the simulated galaxy has much higher effectivesurface brightness than normal ellipticals of similar luminosity, in a wayreminiscent of the less common type of compact ellipticals. our simulationshows that repeated episodes of dissipational collapse, followed by mergerevents, lead to stellar spheroids that are only mildly triaxial and ofrelatively simple kinematic structure. this is in better agreement withobservation than earlier models based on dissipationless mergers of stellardisks, and a positive step towards reconciling the observed structure ofellipticals with the hierarchical merging scenario.

astro-ph;0303305	on the nature of the ring-like structure in the outer galactic disk	we examine the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies in a cosmologicalsimulation of the formation of a disk galaxy in the $\lambda$cdm scenario. wefind that the disruption of satellite galaxies in orbits roughly coplanar withthe disk leads naturally to the formation of ring-like stellar structuressimilar to that recently discovered in the outer disk of the milky way. twointerpretations appear plausible in this context. one is that the ring is atransitory, localized radial density enhancement reflecting the apocenter ofparticles stripped from a satellite during a recent pericentric passage (a``tidal arc'' reminiscent of the tidal arms seen in disk galaxy mergers). inthe second scenario, the ring is analogous to the ``shells'' found around someelliptical galaxies, and would result from a minor merger that took placeseveral gyr ago. the two interpretations differ in several ways. tidal arcs areexpected to span a limited longitude range; may carry a substantial fraction ofthe original mass of the satellite; should exhibit a significant velocitygradient with galactic longitude; and are in all likelihood asymmetric aboveand below the plane of the disk. shells, on the other hand, may comprise atmost a small fraction of the original mass of the satellite and, due to theirmore relaxed state, ought to be symmetric above and below the plane, with nodiscernible velocity gradients across the structure. if confirmed as a tidalfeature, the ring discovered by sdss in the outer galactic disk wouldstrengthen the view--supported by numerical simulations--that minor mergershave played a significant role building up not only the stellar halo, but alsothe disk components of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0310199	coupling between satellite dwarfs and the milky way warp	the perturbations of satellite galaxies, in particular the large magellaniccloud (lmc), have been repeatedly proposed and discounted as the cause of themilky way warp. while the lmc may excite a wake in the galactic dark matterhalo that could provide sufficient torque to excite a warp of the observedmagnitude, its orbit may be incompatible with the orientation of the warp'sline of nodes. the sgr dsph galaxy has an appropriately-oriented orbit, and dueto its closer orbit may produce a stronger tidal effect than the lmc. evidencethat sgr may be responsible for the warp comes from its orbital angularmomentum, which has the same magnitude as the angular momentum of the warpedcomponent of the galactic disk and is anti-aligned with it. we have run highresolution numerical n-body simulations of sgr-sized satellites around a milkyway-sized disk to test this idea. preliminary results suggest that sgr-sizedsatellites can indeed excite warps with properties similar to that observed forthe milky way.

astro-ph;0405429	tidal torques and the orientation of nearby disk galaxies	we use numerical simulations to investigate the orientation of the angularmomentum axis of disk galaxies relative to their surrounding large scalestructure. we find that this is closely related to the spatial configuration atturnaround of the material destined to form the galaxy, which is often part ofa coherent two-dimensional slab criss-crossed by filaments. the rotation axisis found to align very well with the intermediate principal axis of the inertiamomentum tensor at this time. this orientation is approximately preservedduring the ensuing collapse, so that the rotation axis of the resulting diskends up lying on the plane traced by the protogalactic material at turnaround.this suggests a tendency for disks to align themselves so that their rotationaxis is perpendicular to the minor axis of the structure defined by surroundingmatter. one example of this trend is provided by our own galaxy, where thegalactic plane is almost at right angles with the supergalactic plane (sgp)drawn by nearby galaxies; indeed, the sgp latitude of the north galactic poleis just 6 degrees. we have searched for a similar signature in catalogs ofnearby disk galaxies, and find a significant excess of edge-on spirals (forwhich the orientation of the disk rotation axis may be determinedunambiguously) highly inclined relative to the sgp. this result supports theview that disk galaxies acquire their angular momentum as a consequence ofearly tidal torques acting during the expansion phase of the protogalacticmaterial.

astro-ph;0406533	the angular momentum distribution of gas and dark matter in galactic  halos	(abridged) we report results of a series of non radiative n-body/sphsimulations in a lcdm cosmology. we find that the spin of the baryoniccomponent is on average larger than that of the dark matter (dm) component andwe find this effect to be more pronounced at lower redshifts. a significantfraction f of gas has negative angular momentum and this fraction is found toincrease with redshift. we describe a toy model in which the tangentialvelocities of particles are smeared by gaussian random motions. this model issuccessful in explaining some of the angular momentum properties. we compareand contrast various techniques to determine the angular momentum distributions(amds). we show that broadening of velocity dispersions is unsuitable formaking comparisons between gas and dm. we smooth the angular momentum of theparticles over a fixed number of neighbors. we find that an analytical functionbased on gamma distribution can be used to describe a wide variety of profiles,with just one parameter \alpha. the distribution of the shape parameter$\alpha$ for both gas and dm follows roughly a log-normal distribution. themean and standard deviation of log(\alpha) for gas is -0.04 and 0.11respectively. about 90-95% of halos have \alpha&lt;1.3, while exponential disks innfw halos would require 1.3&lt;\alpha&lt;1.6. this implies that a typical halo insimulations has an excess of low angular momentum material as compared to thatof observed exponential disks, a result which is consistent with the findingsof earlier works. \alpha for gas is correlated with that of dm but they have asignificant scatter &lt;\alpha_gas/\alpha_dm&gt;=1.09 \pm 0.2. \alpha_gas is alsobiased towards slightly higher values compared to \alpha_dm.

astro-ph;0408567	accretion relicts in the solar neighbourhood: debris from omegacen's  parent galaxy	we use numerical simulations to investigate the orbital characteristics oftidal debris from satellites whose orbits are dragged into the plane ofgalactic disks by dynamical friction before disruption. we find that thesesatellites may deposit a significant fraction of their stars into the diskcomponents of a galaxy, and use our results to motivate the search foraccretion relicts in samples of metal-poor disk stars in the vicinity of thesun. satellites disrupted on very eccentric orbits coplanar with the disk areexpected to shed stars in "trails" of distinct orbital energy and angularmomentum during each pericentric passage. to an observer located between thepericenter and apocenter of such orbits, these trails would show as distinctgroupings of stars with low vertical velocity and a broad, symmetric, oftendouble-peaked distribution of galactocentric radial velocities. one group ofstars with these characteristics stands out in available compilations of nearbymetal-poor stars. these stars have specific angular momenta similar to that ofthe globular cluster omegacen, long hypothesized to be the nucleus of a dwarfgalaxy disrupted by the milky way tidal field. in addition to their kindredkinematics, stars in the omegacen group share distinct chemical abundancecharacteristics, and trace a well-defined track in the [alpha/fe] versus [fe/h]plane, consistent with simple closed-box enrichment models and a protractedstar formation history. the dynamical and chemical coherence of this groupsuggests that it consists of stars that once belonged to the dwarf that broughtomegacen into the galaxy. the presence of this and other "tidal relicts" in thesolar neighbourhood suggest an extra-galactic origin for the presence of nearbystars with odd kinematics and chemistry.

astro-ph;0502231	how concentrated are the haloes of low surface brightness galaxies in  the cold dark matter model?	we investigate whether a correlation exists between the concentration andspin parameters of dark matter haloes forming in lcdm n-body simulations. inparticular, we focus on haloes with virial masses characteristic of the hostsof low surface brightness (lsb) and high surface brightness (hsb) galaxies. ouranalysis demonstrates that concentration and spin are anti-correlated. if weassume that a galaxy disk forms in one of these haloes from baryons thatapproximately conserved angular momentum during their dissipation into therotationally supported disk, then it is possible to estimate the disk's centralsurface density. for an appropriate choice of mass-to-light ratio, we can placeconstraints on the central surface brightness of the disk and hence identifythe analogues of the host haloes of lsb and hsb galaxies. we find that our lsbgalaxy analogues occupy haloes that have lower concentrations than might beexpected based on consideration of the mass-concentration relation for the lcdmcosmology. the distribution of concentrations peaks at c~6, in good agreementwith observational data, although there are important differences between theshapes of the simulated and observationally inferred distributions. thissuggests that lsb galaxies inhabit a biased subsample of the halo population,and that this bias may be an important ingredient for resolving the currentdebate regarding the structure of lsb galaxy dark matter haloes.

astro-ph;0506659	stars beyond galaxies: the origin of extended luminous halos around  galaxies	(abridged) we use numerical simulations to investigate the origin andstructure of the luminous halos that surround isolated galaxies. these stellarstructures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist ofstars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events thatcharacterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. such origin suggests thatouter luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess oflight over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditionalluminous radius. the mass profile of the accreted stellar component is wellapproximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically withradius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near thevirial radius of the system. such spatial distribution is consistent with thatof galactic and m31 globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globularswere brought in by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classicsearle-zinn scenario. the outer stellar spheroid is supported by a velocitydispersion tensor with a substantial and radially increasing radial anisotropy.these properties distinguish the stellar halo from the dark matter component,which is more isotropic in velocity space, as well as from some tracers of theouter spheroid such as satellite galaxies. most stars in the outer halo formedin progenitors that have since merged with the central galaxy; very few starsin the halo are contributed by satellites that survive as self-bound entitiesat the present. these features are in reasonable agreement with recentobservations of the outer halo of the mw, of m31, and of other isolatedspirals, and suggest that all of these systems underwent an early period ofactive merging, as envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9512009	galaxy formation and large-scale bias	we outline a simple approach to understanding the physical origin of bias inthe distribution of galaxies relative to that of dark matter. the first step isto specify how collapsed, virialized halos of dark matter trace the overallmatter distribution. the next step is to make a connection between halos andthe luminous galaxies we observe. we appeal to the results of semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation that are tuned to fit the observed luminosityfunctions of local groups and clusters. we have also used a high-resolutionn-body simulation of a cold dark matter (cdm) universe to study the biasrelation in more detail. the differences between the galaxy and dark matterdistributions are quantified using a number of different clustering statistics.we arrive at the following general conclusions: 1) a comparison of the galaxyand dark matter density fields shows that linear biasing is a good descriptionon large scales. 2) the bias factor b depends on the shape and normalization ofthe power spectrum. the lower the normalization, the larger the bias. more biasis obtained for spectra with more power on large scales. for "realistic"models, b ranges from 1 to 2.5. 3) galaxies of different luminosity ormorphology have different bias factors. 4) the scale dependence of the biasfactor is weak.

astro-ph;9512118	civ absorption from galaxies in the process of formation	we investigate the heavy element qso absorption systems caused by gascondensations at high redshift which evolve into galaxies with circularvelocity of 100 to 200 km/s at the present epoch. artificial qso spectra weregenerated for a variety of lines-of-sight through regions of the universesimulated with a hydrodynamics code. the civ and hi absorption features inthese spectra closely resemble observed civ and hi absorption systems over awide range in column density. civ absorption complexes with multiple-componentstructure and velocity spreads up to about 600 km/s are found. the broadestsystems are caused by lines-of-sight passing through groups of protogalacticclumps with individual velocity dispersions of less than 150 km/s aligned alongfilamentary structures. the temperature of most of the gas does not take thephotoionization equilibrium value. this invalidates density and size estimatesderived from thermal equilibrium models. consequences for metal abundancedeterminations are briefly discussed. we predict occasional exceptionally largeratios of civ to hi column density (up to a third) for lines-of-sight passingthrough compact halos of hot gas with temperature close to 3 10^5 k. our modelmay be able to explain both high-ionization multi-component heavy-elementabsorbers and damped lyman alpha systems as groups of small protogalacticclumps.

astro-ph;9603101	a comparison of x-ray and strong lensing properties of simulated x-ray  clusters	we use gas-dynamical simulations of galaxy clusters to compare their x-rayand strong lensing properties. special emphasis is laid on mass estimates. thecluster masses range between 6 x 10^14 solar masses and 4 x 10^15 solar masses,and they are examined at redshifts between 1 and 0. we compute the x-rayemission of the intracluster gas by thermal bremsstrahlung, add backgroundcontamination, and mimic imaging and spectral observations with current x-raytelescopes. although the beta model routinely provides excellent fits to thex-ray emission profiles, the derived masses are typically biased low because ofthe restricted range of radii within which the fit can be done. for beta valuesof ~ 2/3, which is the average in our numerically simulated sample, the mass istypically underestimated by ~ 40 per cent. the masses of clusters which exhibitpronounced substructure are often substantially underestimated. we suggest thatthe ratio between peak temperature and emission-weighted average clustertemperature may provide a good indicator for ongoing merging and, therefore,for unreliable mass estimates. x-ray mass estimates are substantially improvedif we fit a king density profile rather than the beta model to the x-rayemission, thereby dropping the degree of freedom associated with beta. clustersselected for their strong lensing properties are typically dynamically moreactive than typical clusters. bulk flows in the intracluster gas contain alarger than average fraction of the internal energy of the gas in such objects,hence the measured gas temperatures are biased low. the bulk of the opticaldepth for arc formation is contributed by clusters with intermediate ratherthan high x-ray luminosity. arcs occur predominantly in clusters which exhibitsubstructure and are not in an equilibrium state. finally we explain why the

astro-ph;9605043	the effects of a photoionizing uv background on the formation of disk  galaxies	we use high resolution n-body/gasdynamical simulations to investigate theeffects of a photoionizing uv background on the assembly of disk galaxies inhierarchically clustering universes. we focus on the mass and rotationalproperties of gas that can cool to form centrifugally supported disks in darkmatter halos of different mass. photoheating can significantly reduce theamount of gas that can cool in galactic halos. depending on the strength of theuv background field, the amount of cooled gas can be reduced by up to $50\%$ insystems with circular speeds in the range $80$-$200$ \kms. the magnitude of theeffect, however, is not enough to solve the ``overcooling'' problem thatplagues hierarchical models of galaxy formation if the uv background is chosento be consistent with estimates based on recent observations of qso absorptionsystems. photoionization has little effect on the collapse of gas at highredshift and affects preferentially gas that is accreted at late times. sincedisks form inside-out, accreting higher angular momentum gas at later times,disks formed in the presence of a uv background have spins that are evensmaller than those formed in simulations that do not include the effects ofphotoionization. this exacerbates the angular momentum problem that afflictshierarchical models of disk formation. we conclude that photoionization cannotprovide the heating mechanism required to reconcile hierarchically clusteringmodels with observations. energy feedback and enrichment processes from theformation and evolution of stars must therefore be indispensable ingredientsfor any successful model of the formation of disk galaxies.

astro-ph;9608013	numerical simulations of galaxy formation	an overview over the current status of modeling galaxies by means ofnumerical simulations is given. after a short description of how galaxies formin hierarchically clustering scenarios, success and failures of currentsimulations are demonstrated using three different applications: the morphologyof present day galaxies; the appearance of high redshift galaxies; and thenature of the ly-alpha forest and metal absorption lines. it is shown thatcurrent simulations can qualitatively account for many observed features ofgalaxies. however, the objects which form in these simulations suffer from astrong overcooling problem. star formation and feedback processes are likely tobe indispensable ingredients for a realistic description even of the most basicparameters of a galaxy. the progenitors of todays galaxies are expected to behighly irregular and concentrated, as supported by recent observations. thoughthey exhibit a velocity dispersion similar to present day l &gt; l^* galaxies,they may be much less massive. the filamentary distribution of the gas providesa natural explanation for ly-alpha and metal absorption systems. furthermore,numerical simulations can be used to avoid misinterpretations of observed dataand are able to alleviate some apparent contradictions in the size estimates ofly-alpha absorption systems.

astro-ph;9609021	two--body heating in numerical galaxy formation experiments	we show that discreteness effects related to classical two-body relaxationproduce spurious heating of the gaseous component in numerical simulations ofgalaxy formation. a simple analytic model demonstrates that this artificialheating will dominate radiative cooling in any simulation where the mass of anindividual dark matter particle exceeds a certain critical value. this maximummass depends only on the cooling function of the gas, on the fraction of thematerial in gaseous form, and (weakly) on typical temperatures in the gas. itis comparable to, or smaller than, the dark matter particle masses employed inmost published simulations of cosmological hydrodynamics and galaxy formation.any simulation which violates this constraint will be unable to follow coolingflows, although catastrophic cooling of gas may still occur in regions withvery short cooling times. we use a series of n--body/smoothed particlehydrodynamics simulations to explore this effect. in simulations which neglectradiative cooling, two--body heating causes a gradual expansion of the gascomponent. when radiative effects are included, we find that gas cooling isalmost completely suppressed for dark matter particle masses above our limit.although our test simulations use smoothed particle hydrodynamics, similareffects, and a similar critical mass, are expected in any simulation where thedark matter is represented by discrete particles.

astro-ph;9706175	energy input and mass redistribution by supernovae in the interstellar  medium	we present the results of numerical studies of supernova remnant evolutionand their effects on galactic and globular cluster evolution. we show thatparameters such as the density and the metallicity of the environmentsignificantly influence the evolution of the remnant, and thus change itseffects on the global environment (e.g., globular clusters, galaxies) as asource of thermal and kinetic energy.  we conducted our studies using a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code, in whichwe implemented a metallicity dependent cooling function.  global time-dependent quantities such as the total kinetic and thermalenergies and the radial extent are calculated for a grid of parameter sets. thequantities calculated are the total energy, the kinetic energy, the thermalenergy, the radial extent, and the mass. we distinguished between the hot,rarefied bubble and the cold, dense shell, as those two phases are distinct intheir roles in a gas-stellar system.  we also present power-law fits to those quantities as a function ofenvironmental parameters after the extensive cooling has ceased. the power-lawfits enable simple incorporation of improved supernova energy input and matterredistribution (including the effect of the local conditions) ingalactic/globular cluster models.  our results for the energetics of supernova remnants in the late stages oftheir expansion give total energies ranging from 9e49 to 3e50 ergs, with atypical case being 1e50 erg, depending on the surrounding environment. about8.5e49 erg of this energy can be found in the form of kinetic energy.  supernovae play an important role in the evolution of the interstellar medium

astro-ph;9709260	the relation between qso absorption systems and high redshift galaxies	the relation between high redshift galaxies and qso absorption systems isdiscussed in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation. it is demonstratedthat imprints of the reionization history of the universe are detectable in the$b$-parameter distribution of the \lya forest at redshifts two to four,favoring models in which hydrogen and helium are reionized simultaneously at orbefore redshift five by a quasar-like spectrum of uv photons. hydrodynamicalsimulations including star formation, feedback due to supernovae and chemicalenrichment are also presented. energy feedback in form of kinetic energy cangive rise to an efficient transport of metals out to distances of a few hundredkpc. the observational signature of this metal transport mechanism compared tosimple homogeneous enrichment models is discussed. finally, it is shown thatpresent day $l^*$ galaxies typically have several progenitors at $z\approx3$spread over a few hundred kpc. these progenitors are closely associated withdamped \lya and ly-limit systems, and have velocity dispersions, luminositiesand colors comparable to u-dropout galaxies at $z\approx 3$.

astro-ph;9803117	how universal are the density profiles of dark halos?	we investigate the formation of virialized halos due to the gravitationalcollapse of collisionless matter using high-resolution n-body simulations. avariety of formation scenarios are studied, ranging from hierarchicalclustering to monolithic radial collapse. the goal of these experiments was tostudy departures from the universal density profiles recently found to arise incosmological settings. however, we found that even for models which exhibitquite a different formation history, the density and velocity dispersionprofiles of the virialized halos are strikingly similar.  power law density profiles do not result even in models with initial powerlaw profiles and no initial substructure or non-radial motions. such initialconditions give rise to a radial orbit instability which leads to curvedvelocity dispersion and density profiles. the shapes of the density profiles inall our models are well parameterized by the profiles of halos formed in ageneric cosmological setting. our results show that the universality of darkhalo density profiles does not depend crucially on hierarchical merging as hasbeen suggested recently in the literature. rather it arises because apparentlydifferent collapse histories produces a near universal angular momentumdistribution among the halo particles. we conclude that the density andvelocity dispersion profiles of virialized halos in an expanding universe arerobust outcomes of gravitational collapse, nearly independent of the initialconditions and the formation history.

astro-ph;9808076	the cosmological origin of the tully-fisher relation	we use high-resolution cosmological simulations that include the effects ofgasdynamics and star formation to investigate the origin of the tully-fisherrelation in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. luminosities are computedfor each model galaxy using their full star formation histories and the latestspectrophotometric models. we find that at z=0 the stellar mass of modelgalaxies is proportional to the total baryonic mass within the virial radius oftheir surrounding halos. circular velocity then correlates tightly with thetotal luminosity of the galaxy, reflecting the equivalence between mass andcircular velocity of systems identified in a cosmological context. the slope ofthe relation steepens slightly from the red to the blue bandpasses, and is infairly good agreement with observations. its scatter is small, decreasing from\~0.45 mag in the u-band to ~0.34 mag in the k-band. the particularcosmological model we explore here seems unable to account for the zero-pointof the correlation. model galaxies are too faint at z=0 (by about twomagnitudes) if the circular velocity at the edge of the luminous galaxy is usedas an estimator of the rotation speed. the tully-fisher relation is brighter inthe past, by about ~0.7 magnitudes in the b-band at z=1, at odds with recentobservations of z~1 galaxies. we conclude that the slope and tightness of thetully-fisher relation can be naturally explained in hierarchical models butthat its normalization and evolution depend strongly on the star formationalgorithm chosen and on the cosmological parameters that determine theuniversal baryon fraction and the time of assembly of galaxies of differentmass.

astro-ph;9908114	the core density of dark matter halos: a critical challenge to the  lambda-cdm paradigm?	we compare the central mass concentration of cold dark matter halos found incosmological n-body simulations with constraints derived from the milky waydisk dynamics and from the tully-fisher relation. for currently favored valuesof the cosmological parameters ($\omega_0 \sim 0.3$; $\lambda_0=1-\omega_0 \sim0.7$; $h \sim 0.7$; cobe- and cluster abundance-normalized $\sigma_8$; big-bangnucleosynthesis $\omega_b$), we find that halos with circular velocitiescomparable to the rotation speed of the galaxy have typically {\it three times}more dark matter inside the solar circle than inferred from observations ofgalactic dynamics. such high central concentrations of dark matter on the scaleof galaxy disks also imply that stellar mass-to-light ratios much lower thanexpected from population synthesis models must be assumed in order to reproducethe zero-point of the tully-fisher relation. indeed, even under the extremeassumption that {\it all} baryons in a dark halo are turned into stars, diskswith conventional $i$-band stellar mass-to-light ratios ($m/l_i \sim 2 \pm 1(m/l_i)_{\odot}$) are about two magnitudes fainter than observed at a givenrotation speed. we examine several modifications to the $\lambda$cdm model thatmay account for these discrepancies and conclude that agreement can only beaccomplished at the expense of renouncing other major successes of the model.reproducing the observed properties of disk galaxies thus appears to demandsubstantial revision to the currently most successful model of structureformation.

astro-ph;9910002	numerical simulations of galaxy formation	the current status of numerical simulations of galaxy formation is reviewed.after a short description of the main numerical simulation techniques, threesample applications illustrate how numerical simulations have provided deeperinsight in the galaxy formation process and how they have illuminated successand failure of the hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm: n-body simulationsdemonstrate that the density profiles of dark matter halos that form inhierarchical clustering scenarios follow a characteristic law. a comparisonwith the kinematics of disk galaxies however unravels that these densityprofiles are too concentrated. hydrodynamical simulation show that the highlyirregular velocity field of merging subclumps at redshift $z\approx 3$ caneasily account for the observed asymmetry in the absorption profiles of lowionization species in damped \lya absorption systems. the built-up of galaxiesdue to mergers is however also cause for one of the major inconsistencies ofhierarchical structure formation models, the failure to reproduce the sizes ofthe present day disk galaxies due to excessive transport of angular momentumfrom the baryonic to the dark matter component. hydrodynamical simulations thatinclude star formation show that scaling laws like the tully-fisher relationcan readily be reproduced in hierarchical scenarios, however the highconcentration of dark matter halos results in a zero-point of the simulatedtully-fisher relation that is incompatible wi th observations.

astro-ph;9910573	the cosmological origin of disk galaxy scaling laws	we discuss possible origins of scaling laws relating structural properties ofdisk galaxies within the context of hierarchically clustering theories ofgalaxy formation. using gasdynamical simulations that incorporate the effectsof star formation we illustrate these global trends and highlight thedifficulties faced by models that envision disk galaxies as the final outcomeof a hierarchical sequence of merger events. in particular, we focus on thecosmological origin of the tully-fisher relation, and argue that thiscorrelation between the total luminosity and rotation speed of disk galaxies isa natural result of the approximately scale free formation process of themassive halos they inhabit. although the slope and scatter of the tully-fisherrelation can be readily reproduced in hierarchical formation scenarios, theobserved zero-point of the relation is inconsistent with simulations of galaxyformation in cold dark matter universes, a difficulty that can be traced to thehigh central mass concentration of dark halos formed in this cosmogony. thisresult indicates that substantial revision to the new ``standard'' model ofstructure formation ($\lambda$cdm) may be needed in order to accommodateobservations on the scale of individual disk galaxies.

0706.0004	the accretion origin of the milky way's stellar halo	we have used data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 toexplore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the milkyway using about 4 million color-selected main sequence turn-off stars. we fitoblate and triaxial broken power-law models to the data, and found a `best-fit'oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5&lt;c/a&lt;0.8, and halo stellar masses betweengalactocentric radii of 1 and 40kpc of (3.7+/-1.2)x10^8 m_sun. the densityprofile of the stellar halo is approximately r^{-3}; it is possible that thepower law slope is shallower inside 20kpc and steeper outside that radius. yet,we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to thedistribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal ofspatial substructure. we quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxialmodel using the rms of the data around the model profile on scales &gt;~100pc,after accounting for the (known) contribution of poisson uncertainties. thefractional rms deviation of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth,parameterized halo model is &gt;~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highlystructured. we compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellarhalos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmologicalcontext by analysing the simulations in the same way as the data. while themasses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellarhalos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure inthe milky way's halo match well the properties of a `typical' stellar halobuilt exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies. ourresults therefore point towards a picture in which an important fraction of themilky way's stellar halo has been accreted from satellite galaxies.

0810.1429	an alternative origin for hypervelocity stars	halo stars with unusually high radial velocity ("hypervelocity" stars, orhvs) are thought to be stars unbound to the milky way that originate from thegravitational interaction of stellar systems with the supermassive black holeat the galactic center. we examine the latest hvs compilation and findpeculiarities that are unexpected in this black hole-ejection scenario. forexample, a large fraction of hvs cluster around the constellation of leo andshare a common travel time of $\sim 100$-200 myr. furthermore, their velocitiesare not really extreme if, as suggested by recent galaxy formation models, themilky way is embedded within a $2.5\times 10^{12} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ dark halowith virial velocity of $\sim 220$ km/s. in this case, the escape velocity at$\sim 50$ kpc would be $\sim 600$ km/s and very few hvs would be truly unbound.we use numerical simulations to show that disrupting dwarf galaxies maycontribute halo stars with velocities up to and sometimes exceeding the nominalescape speed of the system. these stars are arranged in a thinly-collimatedoutgoing ``tidal tail'' stripped from the dwarf during its latest pericentricpassage. we speculate that some hvs may therefore be tidal debris from a dwarfrecently disrupted near the center of the galaxy. in this interpretation, theangular clustering of hvs results because from our perspective the tail is seennearly ``end on'', whereas the common travel time simply reflects the fact thatthese stars were stripped simultaneously from the dwarf during a singlepericentric passage. this proposal is eminently falsifiable, since it makes anumber of predictions that are distinct from the black-hole ejection mechanismand that should be testable with improved hvs datasets.
