0911.5451	an infrared/x-ray survey for new members of the taurus star-forming  region	we present the results of a search for new members of the taurus star-formingregion using data from the spitzer space telescope and the xmm-newtonobservatory. we have obtained optical and near-infrared spectra of 44 sourcesthat exhibit red spitzer colors that are indicative of stars with circumstellardisks and 51 candidate young stars that were identified by scelsi and coworkersusing xmm-newton. we also performed spectroscopy on four possible companions tomembers of taurus that were reported by kraus and hillenbrand. through thesespectra, we have demonstrated the youth and membership of 41 sources, 10 ofwhich were independently confirmed as young stars by scelsi and coworkers. fiveof the new taurus members are likely to be brown dwarfs based on their latespectral types (&gt;m6). one of the brown dwarfs has a spectral type of l0, makingit the first known l-type member of taurus and the least massive known memberof the region (m=4-7 m_jup). another brown dwarf exhibits a flat infraredspectral energy distribution, which indicates that it could be in theprotostellar class i stage (star+disk+envelope). upon inspection of archivalimages from various observatories, we find that one of the new young stars hasa large edge-on disk (r=2.5=350 au). the scattered light from this disk hasundergone significant variability on a time scale of days in optical imagesfrom the canada-france-hawaii telescope. using the updated census of taurus, wehave measured the initial mass function for the fields observed by xmm-newton.the resulting mass function is similar to previous ones that we have reportedfor taurus, showing a surplus of stars at spectral types of k7-m1 (0.6-0.8m_sun) relative to other nearby star-forming regions like ic 348, chamaeleon i,and the orion nebula cluster.

1004.0539	discovery of a planetary-mass companion to a brown dwarf in taurus	we have performed a survey for substellar companions to young brown dwarfs inthe taurus star-forming region using the wide field planetary camera 2 on boardthe hubble space telescope. in these data, we have discovered a candidatecompanion at a projected separation of 0.105" from one of the brown dwarfs,corresponding to 15 au at the distance of taurus. to determine if this objectis a companion, we have obtained images of the pair at a second epoch with theadaptive optics system at gemini observatory. the astrometry from the hubbleand gemini data indicates that the two objects share similar proper motions andthus are likely companions. we estimate a mass of 5-10 mjup for the secondarybased on a comparison of its bolometric luminosity to the predictions oftheoretical evolutionary models. this object demonstrates that planetary-masscompanions to brown dwarfs can form on a timescale of &lt;=1 myr. companionformation on such a rapid timescale is more likely to occur via gravitationalinstability in a disk or fragmentation of a cloud core than through coreaccretion. the gemini images also reveal a possible substellar companion(rho=0.23") to a young low-mass star that is 12.4" from the brown dwarftargeted by hubble. if these four objects comprise a quadruple system, then itshierarchical configuration would suggest that the fragmentation of molecularcloud cores can produce companions below 10 mjup.

1005.2365	unveiling the structure of pre-transitional disks	in the past few years, several disks with inner holes that are empty of smalldust grains have been detected and are known as transitional disks. recently,spitzer has identified a new class of "pre-transitional disks" with gaps; theseobjects have an optically thick inner disk separated from an optically thickouter disk by an optically thin disk gap. a near-infrared spectrum provided thefirst confirmation of a gap in the pre-transitional disk of lkca 15 byverifying that the near-infrared excess emission in this object was due to anoptically thick inner disk. here we investigate the difference between thenature of the inner regions of transitional and pre-transitional disks usingthe same veiling-based technique to extract the near-infrared excess emissionabove the stellar photosphere. we show that the near-infrared excess emissionof the previously identified pre-transitional disks of lkca 15 and ux tau a intaurus as well as the newly identified pre-transitional disk of rox 44 inophiuchus can be fit with an inner disk wall located at the dust destructionradius. we also model the broad-band seds of these objects, taking into accountthe effect of shadowing by the inner disk on the outer disk, considering thefinite size of the star. the near-infrared excess continua of these threepre-transitional disks, which can be explained by optically thick inner disks,are significantly different from that of the transitional disks of gm aur,whose near-infrared excess continuum can be reproduced by emission fromsub-micron-sized optically thin dust, and dm tau, whose near-infrared spectrumis consistent with a disk hole that is relatively free of small dust. thestructure of pre-transitional disks may be a sign of young planets forming inthese disks and future studies of pre-transitional disks will provideconstraints to aid in theoretical modeling of planet formation.

0704.0203	a spitzer census of the ic 348 nebula	we present a spitzer based census of the ic 348 nebula and embedded starcluster. our spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42class ii t-tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/iprotostars. the population of ic 348 likely exceeds 400 sources afteraccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. our spitzer censusof ic 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatiallywith the t-tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster arounda b star. the protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster peripheryabout 1 pc from the b star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. we findthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with thatrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar populationindicates that the ic 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. we show thatthe ic 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by itssmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. whileit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result ofdynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findingssupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smallersub-clusters. finally, the results of our spitzer census indicate that thesupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud shouldnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

1008.3916	spitzer observations of the lambda orionis cluster. ii. disks around  solar-type and low mass stars	we present irac/mips spitzer space telescope observations of the solar typeand the low mass stellar population of the young (~5 myr) lambda orioniscluster. combining optical and 2mass photometry, we identify 436 stars asprobable members of the cluster. given the distance (450 pc) and the age of thecluster, our sample ranges in mass from 2 solar mass to objects below thesubstellar limit. with the addition of the spitzer mid-infrared data, we haveidentified 49 stars bearing disks in the stellar cluster. using spectral energydistribution (sed) slopes, we place objects in several classes: non-excessstars (diskless), stars with optically thick disks, stars with ``evolveddisks''( with smaller excesses than optically thick disk systems), and``transitional disks'' candidates (in which the inner disk is partially orfully cleared). the disk fraction depends on the stellar mass, ranging from ~6%for k type stars (rc-j&lt;2) to ~27% for stars with spectral type m5 or later(rc-j&gt;4). we confirm the dependence of disk fraction on stellar mass in thisage range found in other studies. regarding clustering levels, the overallfraction of disks in the lambda orionis cluster is similar to those reported inother stellar groups with ages normally quoted as ~5 myr.

1012.0022	spitzer spectroscopy of the circumprimary disk in the binary brown dwarf  2mass j04414489+2301513	using the spitzer infrared spectrograph, we have performed mid-infraredspectroscopy on the young binary brown dwarf 2mass j04414489+2301513 (15 au) inthe taurus star-forming region. the spectrum exhibits excess continuum emissionthat likely arises from a circumstellar disk around the primary. silicateemission is not detected in these data, indicating the presence of significantgrain growth. this is one of the few brown dwarf disks at such a young age (~1myr) that has been found to lack silicate emission. to quantitatively constrainthe properties of the disk, we have compared the spectral energy distributionof 2mass j04414489+2301513 to the predictions of our vertical structure codesfor irradiated accretion disks. our models suggest that the remainingatmospheric grains of moderately depleted layers may have grown to a size of$\gtrsim5$ micron. in addition, our model fits indicate an outer radius of0.2-0.3 au for the disk. the small size of this circumprimary disk could be dueto truncation by the secondary. the absence of an outer disk containing areservoir of small, primordial grains, combined with a weak turbulentmechanism, may be responsible for the advanced grain growth in this disk.

1101.4226	spitzer infrared spectrograph survey of young stars in the chamaeleon i  star-forming region	we present 5 to 36 micron mid-infrared spectra of 82 young stars in the ~2myr old chamaeleon i star-forming region, obtained with the spitzer infraredspectrograph (irs). we have classified these objects into various evolutionaryclasses based on their spectral energy distributions and the spectral featuresseen in the irs spectra. we have analyzed the mid-ir spectra of class iiobjects in chamaeleon i in detail, in order to study the vertical and radialstructure of the protoplanetary disks surrounding these stars. we find evidencefor substantial dust settling in most protoplanetary disks in chamaeleon i. wehave identified several disks with altered radial structures in chamaeleon i,among them transitional disk candidates which have holes or gaps in theirdisks. analysis of the silicate emission features in the irs spectra of classii objects in chamaeleon i shows that the dust grains in these disks haveundergone significant processing (grain growth and crystallization). however,disks with radial holes/gaps appear to have relatively unprocessed grains. wefurther find the crystalline dust content in the inner (&lt; 1-2 au) and theintermediate (&lt; 10 au) regions of the protoplanetary disks to be tightlycorrelated. we also investigate the effects of accretion and stellarmultiplicity on the disk structure and dust properties. finally, we compare theobserved properties of protoplanetary disks in cha i with those in slightlyyounger taurus and ophiuchus regions and discuss the effects of disk evolutionin the first 1-2 myr.

1102.5411	discovery of a candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf	we have used multi-epoch images from the infrared array camera on board thespitzer space telescope to search for substellar companions to stars in thesolar neighborhood based on common proper motions. through this work, we havediscovered a faint companion to the white dwarf wd 0806-661. the comovingsource has a projected separation of 130", corresponding to 2500 au at thedistance of the primary (19.2 pc). if it is physically associated, then itsabsolute magnitude at 4.5um is ~1 mag fainter than the faintest known t dwarfs,making it a strong candidate for the coolest known brown dwarf. the combinationof m_4.5 and the age of the primary (1.5 gyr) implies an effective temperatureof ~300 k and a mass of ~7 m_jup according to theoretical evolutionary models.the white dwarf's progenitor likely had a mass of ~2 m_sun, and thus could havebeen born with a circumstellar disk that was sufficiently massive to produce acompanion with this mass. therefore, the companion could be either a browndwarf that formed like a binary star or a giant planet that was born within adisk and has been dynamically scattered to a larger orbit.

1110.4353	confirmation of one of the coldest known brown dwarfs	using two epochs of 4.5um images from the infrared array camera (irac) onboard the spitzer space telescope, we recently identified a common propermotion companion to the white dwarf wd 0806-661 that is a candidate for thecoldest known brown dwarf. to verify its cool nature, we have obtained imagesof this object at 3.6um with irac, at j with hawk-i on the very largetelescope, and in a filter covering the red half of j with fourstar onmagellan. wd 0806-661 b is detected by irac but not hawk-i or fourstar. fromthese data we measure colors of [3.6]-[4.5]=2.77+/-0.16 and j-[4.5]&gt;7.0(snr&lt;3). based on these colors and its absolute magnitudes, wd 0806-661 b isthe coldest companion directly imaged outside of the solar system and is acontender for the coldest known brown dwarf with the y dwarf wisep j1828+2650.it is unclear which of these two objects is colder given the available data. acomparison of its absolute magnitude at 4.5um to the predictions of theoreticalspectra and evolutionary models suggests that wd 0806-661 b has t=300-345 k.

0710.3037	the stellar population of the chamaeleon i star-forming region	i present a new census of the stellar population in the chamaeleon istar-forming region. using optical and near-ir photometry and followupspectroscopy, i have discovered 50 new members of chamaeleon i, expanding thecensus of known members to 226 objects. fourteen of these new members havespectral types later than m6, which doubles the number of known members thatare likely to be substellar. i have estimated extinctions, luminosities, andeffective temperatures for the known members, used these data to construct anh-r diagram for the cluster, and inferred individual masses and ages with thetheoretical evolutionary models of baraffe and chabrier. the distribution ofisochronal ages indicates that star formation began 3-4 and 5-6 myr ago in thesouthern and northern subclusters, respectively, and has continued to thepresent time at a declining rate. the imf in chamaeleon i reaches a maximum ata mass of 0.1-0.15 m_sun, and thus closely resembles the imfs in ic 348 and theorion nebula cluster. in logarithmic units where the salpeter slope is 1.35,the imf is roughly flat in the substellar regime and shows no indication ofreaching a minimum down to a completeness limit of 0.01 m_sun. the low-massstars are more widely distributed than members at other masses in the northernsubcluster, but this is not the case in the southern subcluster. meanwhile, thebrown dwarfs have the same spatial distribution as the stars out to a radius of3 deg (8.5 pc) from the center of chamaeleon i.

1206.6350	ysovar: six pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries in the orion nebula  cluster	eclipsing binaries (ebs) provide critical laboratories for empiricallytesting predictions of theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution.pre-main-sequence (pms) ebs are particularly valuable, both due to their rarityand the highly dynamic nature of pms evolution, such that a dense grid of pmsebs is required to properly calibrate theoretical pms models. analyzingmulti-epoch, multi-color light curves for 2400 candidateorion nebula cluster(onc) members from our warm spitzer exploration science program ysovar, we haveidentified 12 stars whose light curves show eclipse features. four of these 12ebs are previously known. supplementing our light curves with follow-up opticaland near-infrared spectroscopy, we establish two of the candidates as likelyfield ebs lying behind the onc. we confirm the remaining six candidate systems,however, as newly identified onc pms ebs. these systems increase the number ofknown pms ebs by over 50% and include the highest mass (theta1 ori e, for whichwe provide a complete set of well-determined parameters including componentmasses of 2.807 and 2.797 solar masses) and longest period (isoyj053505.71-052354.1, p \sim 20 days) pms ebs currently known. in two cases(theta1 ori e and isoy j053526.88-044730.7), enough photometric andspectroscopic data exist to attempt an orbit solution and derive the systemparameters. for the remaining systems, we combine our data with literatureinformation to provide a preliminary characterization sufficient to guidefollow-up investigations of these rare, benchmark systems.

1303.7283	resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of wise j104915.57-531906.1ab: a  flux-reversal binary at the l dwarf/t dwarf transition	we report resolved near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry of the recentlyidentified brown dwarf binary wise j104915.57-531906.1ab, located 2.02+/-0.15pc from the sun. low-resolution spectral data from magellan/fire and irtf/spexreveal strong h2o and co absorption features in the spectra of both components,with the secondary also exhibiting weak ch4 absorption at 1.6 micron and 2.2micron. spectral indices and comparison to low-resolution spectral standardsindicate component types of l7.5 and t0.5, the former consistent with theoptical classification of the primary. relative photometry reveals a fluxreversal between the j- and k-bands, with the t dwarf component being brighterin the 0.95--1.3 micron range. as with other l/t transition binaries, thisreversal likely reflects significant depletion of condensate opacity across thetransition, a behavior that may be enhanced in wise j1049-5319ab if the unusualred color of its l dwarf component is indicative of thick clouds. on the otherhand, differing cloud properties may have modified the evolutionary paths ofthese two components, and we propose a scenario in which the cooler secondarycould be the more massive of the two components. fortunately, the proximity,brightness and small separation (3.12+/-0.25 au) of this system make itamenable to astrometric and radial velocity orbit measurement during itsestimated 25 yr orbit, providing a rare opportunity for the directdetermination of individual brown dwarf masses and a unique benchmark forstudying cloud evolution across the l dwarf/t dwarf transition.

1304.0135	characterizing the stellar photospheres and near-infrared excesses in  accreting t tauri systems	using nasa irtf spex data from 0.8 to 4.5 $\mu$m, we determineself-consistently the stellar properties and excess emission above thephotosphere for a sample of classical t tauri stars (ctts) in the taurusmolecular cloud with varying degrees of accretion. this process uses acombination of techniques from the recent literature as well as observations ofweak-line t tauri stars (wtts) to account for the differences in surfacegravity and chromospheric activity between the tts and dwarfs, which aretypically used as photospheric templates for ctts. our improved veiling andextinction estimates for our targets allow us to extract flux-calibratedspectra of the excess in the near-infrared. we find that we are able to producean acceptable parametric fit to the near-infrared excesses using a combinationof up to three blackbodies. in half of our sample, two blackbodies attemperatures of 8000 k and 1600 k suffice. these temperatures and thecorresponding solid angles are consistent with emission from the accretionshock on the stellar surface and the inner dust sublimation rim of the disk,respectively. in contrast, the other half requires three blackbodies at 8000,1800, and 800 k, to describe the excess. we interpret the combined two coolerblackbodies as the dust sublimation wall with either a contribution from thedisk surface beyond the wall or curvature of the wall itself, neither of whichshould have single-temperature blackbody emission. in these fits, we find noevidence of a contribution from optically thick gas inside the inner dust rim.

0802.1732	spitzer irs observations of disks around brown dwarfs in the tw hydra  association	using spex at the nasa infrared telescope facility and the spitzer infraredspectrograph, we have obtained infrared spectra from 0.7 to 30um for threeyoung brown dwarfs in the tw hydra association (~10 myr), 2m j1207-3932, 2mj1139-3159, and ss j1102-3431. the spectral energy distribution for 2mj1139-3159 is consistent with a stellar photosphere for the entire wavelengthrange of our data while the other two objects exhibit significant excessemission at &gt;5um. we are able to reproduce the excess emission from each browndwarf using our models of irradiated accretion disks. according to our modelfits, both disks have experienced a high degree of dust settling. we also findthat silicate emission at 10 and 20um is absent from the spectra of thesedisks, indicating that grains in the upper disk layers have grown to sizeslarger than ~5um. both of these characteristics are consistent with previousobservations of decreasing silicate emission with lower stellar masses andolder ages. these trends suggest that either 1) the growth of dust grains, andperhaps planetesimal formation, occurs faster in disks around brown dwarfs thanin disks around stars, or 2) the radii of the mid-ir-emitting regions of disksare smaller for brown dwarfs than for stars, and grains grow faster at smallerdisk radii. finally, we note the possible detection of an unexplained emissionfeature near 14um in the spectra of both of the disk-bearing brown dwarfs.

1404.0213	a search for companions to brown dwarfs in the taurus and chamaeleon  star forming regions	we present the results of a search for companions to young brown dwarfs inthe taurus and chamaeleon i star forming regions (1/2-3 myr). we have usedwfpc2 on board hst to obtain f791w and f850lp images of 47 members of theseregions that have spectral types of m6-l0 (0.01-0.1 msun). an additionallate-type member of taurus, fu tau (m7.25+m9.25), was also observed withadaptive optics at keck observatory. we have applied psf subtraction to theprimaries and have searched the resulting images for objects that have colorsand magnitudes that are indicative of young low-mass objects. through thisprocess, we have identified promising candidate companions to 2massj04414489+2301513 (rho=0.105"/15 au), 2mass j04221332+1934392 (rho=0.05"/7 au),and iso 217 (rho=0.03"/5 au). we reported the discovery of the first candidatein a previous study, showing that it has a similar proper motion as the primarythrough a comparison of astrometry measured with wfpc2 and gemini adaptiveoptics. we have collected an additional epoch of data with gemini that furthersupports that result. by combining our survey with previous high-resolutionimaging in taurus, chamaeleon, and upper sco (10 myr), we measure binaryfractions of 14/93 = 0.15+0.05/-0.03 for m4-m6 (0.1-0.3 msun) and 4/108 =0.04+0.03/-0.01 for &gt;m6 (&lt;0.1 msun) at separations of &gt;10 au. given the youthand low density of these three regions, the lower binary fraction at latertypes is probably primordial rather than due to dynamical interactions amongassociation members. the widest low-mass binaries (&gt;100 au) also appear to bemore common in taurus and chamaeleon than in the field, which suggests that thewidest low-mass binaries are disrupted by dynamical interactions at &gt;10 myr, orthat field brown dwarfs have been born predominantly in denser clusters wherewide systems are disrupted or inhibited from forming.

0803.1019	the disk population of the chamaeleon i star-forming region	we present a census of circumstellar disks in the chamaeleon i star-formingregion. using the infrared array camera and the multiband imaging photometeronboard the spitzer space telescope, we have obtained images of chamaeleon i at3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 um. to search for new disk-bearing members of thecluster, we have performed spectroscopy on objects that have red colors inthese data. through this work, we have discovered four new members ofchamaeleon i with spectral types of m4, m6, m7.5, and l0. the first threeobjects are highly embedded (a_j~5) and reside near known protostars,indicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster(&lt;1 myr). the l0 source is the coolest known member of chamaeleon i. itsluminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 m_sun, making it the least massivebrown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. tocharacterize the disk population in chamaeleon i, we have classified theinfrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that areencompassed by the spitzer images. through these classifications, we find thatthe disk fraction in chamaeleon i is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3m_sun. these data are similar to the disk fraction of ic 348, which is a densercluster at the same age as chamaeleon i. however, the disk fraction at m&gt;1m_sun is significantly higher in chamaeleon i than in ic 348 (65% vs. 20%),indicating longer disk lifetimes in chamaeleon i for this mass range. thus,low-density star-forming regions like chamaeleon i may offer more time forplanet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters.

1409.5897	near-infrared detection of wd 0806-661 b with the hubble space telescope	wd 0806-661 b is one of the coldest known brown dwarfs (t=300-345 k) based onprevious mid-infrared photometry from the spitzer space telescope. in addition,it is a benchmark for testing theoretical models of brown dwarfs because itsage and distance are well-constrained via its primary star (2+/-0.5 gyr,19.2+/-0.6 pc). we present the first near-infrared detection of this object,which has been achieved through f110w imaging (~y+j) with the wide field camera3 on board the hubble space telescope. we measure a vega magnitude ofm110=25.70+/-0.08, which implies j~25.0. when combined with the spitzerphotometry, our estimate of j helps to better define the empirical sequence ofthe coldest brown dwarfs in m4.5 versus j-[4.5]. the positions of wd 0806-661 band other y dwarfs in that diagram are best matched by the cloudy models ofburrows et al. and the cloudless models of saumon et al., both of which employchemical equilibrium. the calculations by morley et al. for 50% cloud coveragediffer only modestly from the data. spectroscopy would enable a more stringenttest of the models, but based on our f110w measurement, such observations arecurrently possible only with hubble, and would require at least ~10 orbits toreach a signal-to-noise ratio of ~5.

1504.06514	the deepest constraints on radio and x-ray magnetic activity in  ultracool dwarfs from wise j104915.57-531906.1	we report upper limits to the radio and x-ray emission from the newlydiscovered ultracool dwarf binary wise j104915.57$-$531906.1 (luhman 16ab). asthe nearest ultracool dwarf binary (2 pc), its proximity offers a heftyadvantage to studying plasma processes in ultracool dwarfs which are moresimilar in gross properties (radius, mass, temperature) to the solar systemgiant planets than stars. the radio and x-ray emission upper limits from theaustralia telescope compact array (atca) and chandra observations, eachspanning multiple rotation periods, provide the deepest fractional radio andx-ray luminosities to date on an ultracool dwarf, with $\log{(l_{\rmr,\nu}/l_{\rm bol}) [hz^{-1}]} &lt; -18.1$ (5.5 ghz), $\log{(l_{\rm r,\nu}/l_{\rmbol}) [hz^{-1}]} &lt; -17.9$ (9 ghz), and $\log{(l_{\rm x}/l_{\rm bol})} &lt; -5.7$.while the radio upper limits alone do not allow for a constraint on themagnetic field strength, we limit the size of any coherently emitting region inour line of sight to less than 0.2\% of the radius of one of the brown dwarfs.any source of incoherent emission must span less than about 20\% of the browndwarf radius, assuming magnetic field strengths of a few tens to a few hundredgauss. the fast rotation and large amplitude photometric variability exhibitedby the t dwarf in the luhman 16ab system are not accompanied by enhancednonthermal radio emission, nor enhanced heating to coronal temperatures, asobserved on some higher mass ultracool dwarfs, confirming the expecteddecoupling of matter and magnetic field in cool neutral atmospheres.

1511.06403	measuring high-precision astrometry with the infrared array camera on  the spitzer space telescope	the infrared array camera (irac) on the spitzer space telescope currentlyoffers the greatest potential for high-precision astrometry of faint mid-irsources across arcminute-scale fields, which would be especially valuable formeasuring parallaxes of cold brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and propermotions of obscured members of nearby star-forming regions. to more fullyrealize irac's astrometric capabilities, we have sought to minimize the largestsources of uncertainty in astrometry with its 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m bands. bycomparing different routines that estimate stellar positions, we have foundthat point response function (prf) fitting with the spitzer science center'sastronomical point source extractor produces both the smallest systematicerrors from varying intra-pixel sensitivity and the greatest precision inmeasurements of positions. in addition, self-calibration has been used toderive new 7$^{\rm th}$ and 8$^{\rm th}$ order distortion corrections for the3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m arrays of irac, respectively. these corrections are suitablefor data throughout the mission of spitzer when a time-dependent scale factoris applied to the corrections. to illustrate the astrometric accuracy that canbe achieved by combining prf fitting with our new distortion corrections, wehave applied them to archival data for a nearby star-forming region, arrivingat total astrometric errors of $\sim$20 and 70 mas at signal to noise ratios of100 and 10, respectively.

0806.2818	new young brown dwarfs in the orion molecular cloud 2/3 region	forty new low mass members with spectral types ranging from m4-m9 have beenconfirmed in the orion molecular cloud 2/3 region. through deep, i, z', j, h, kphotometry of a 20' x 20' field in omc 2/3, we selected brown dwarf candidatesfor follow-up spectroscopy. low resolution far-red and near-infrared spectrawere obtained for the candidates, and 19 young brown dwarfs in the omc 2/3region are confirmed. they exhibit spectral types of m6.5-m9, corresponding toapproximate masses of 0.075-0.015 m_solar using the evolutionary models ofbaraffe et al. (1998). at least one of these bona fide young brown dwarfs hasstrong halpha emission, indicating that it is actively accreting. in addition,we confirm 21 new low mass members with spectral types of m4-m6, correspondingto approximate masses of 0.35-0.10 m_solar in omc 2/3. by comparing pre-mainsequence tracks to the positions of the members in the h-r diagram, we findthat most of the brown dwarfs are less than 1 myr, but find a number of lowmass stars with inferred ages greater than 3 myr. the discrepancy in thestellar and substellar ages is due to our selection of only low luminositysources; however, the presence of such objects implies the presence of an agespread in the omc 2/3 region. we discuss possible reasons for this apparent agespread.

0808.0471	disks around brown dwarfs in the sigma orionis cluster	we have performed a census of disks around brown dwarfs in the sigma oricluster using all available images from irac onboard the spitzer spacetelescope. to search for new low-mass cluster members with disks, we havemeasured photometry for all sources in the spitzer images and have identifiedthe ones that have red colors that are indicative of disks. we present 5promising candidates, which may consist of 2 brown dwarfs, 2 stars with edge-ondisks, and a low-mass protostar if they are bona fide members. spectroscopy isneeded to verify the nature of these sources. we have also used the spitzerdata to determine which of the previously known probable members of sigma oriare likely to have disks. by doing so, we measure disk fractions of ~40% and~60% for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, respectively. these results aresimilar to previous estimates of disk fractions in ic 348 and cha i, which haveroughly the same median ages as sigma ori (3 myr). finally, we note that ourphotometric measurements and the sources that we identify as having disksdiffer significantly from those of other recent studies that analyzed the samespitzer images. for instance, previous work has suggested that the t dwarf sori 70 is redder than typical field dwarfs, which has been cited as possibleevidence of youth and cluster membership. however, we find that this object isonly slightly redder than the reddest field dwarfs in [3.6]-[4.5] (1.56+/-0.07vs. 0.93-1.46). we measure a larger excess in [3.6]-[5.8] (1.75+/-0.21 vs.0.87-1.19), but the flux at 5.8um may be overestimated because of the lowsignal-to-noise ratio of the detection. thus, the spitzer data do not offerstrong evidence of youth and membership for this object, which is the faintestand coolest candidate member of sigma ori that has been identified to date.

astro-ph;0004174	membership and multiplicity among very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs  in the pleiades cluster	we present near-infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy of very low-massstars and brown dwarf candidates in the pleiades open cluster. the membershipstatus of these objects is assessed. eight objects out of 45 appear to benon-members. a search for companions among 34 very low-mass pleiades members(m$\le$0.09 m$_\odot$) in high-spatial resolution images obtained with thehubble space telescope and the adaptive optics system of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope produced no resolved binaries with separationslarger than 0.2 arcsec (a ~ 27 au; p ~ 444 years). nevertheless, we findevidence for a binary sequence in the color-magnitude diagrams, in agreementwith the results of steele &amp; jameson (1995) for higher mass stars. we comparethe multiplicity statistics of the pleiades very low-mass stars and browndwarfs with that of g and k-type main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood(duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991). we find that there is some evidence for a deficiencyof wide binary systems (separation &gt;27 au) among the pleiades very low-massmembers. we briefly discuss how this result can fit with current scenarios ofbrown dwarf formation. we correct the pleiades substellar mass function for thecontamination of cluster non-members found in this work. we find acontamination level of 33% among the brown dwarf candidates identified bybouvier et al. (1998). assuming a power law imf across the substellar boundary,we find a slope dn/dm ~ m^{-0.53}, implying that the number of objects per massbin is still rising but the contribution to the total mass of the cluster isdeclining in the brown dwarf regime.

astro-ph;0004386	the initial mass function of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in young  clusters	we have obtained images of the trapezium cluster (140" x 140"; 0.3 pc x 0.3pc) with the hubble space telescope near-infrared camera and multi-objectspectrometer (nicmos). combining these data with new ground-based k-bandspectra (r=800) and existing spectral types and photometry and the models ofd'antona &amp; mazzitelli, we find that the distributions of ages of comparablesamples of stars in the trapezium, rho oph, and ic 348 indicate median ages of\~0.4 myr for the first two regions and ~1-2 myr for the latter. the low-massimfs in these sites of clustered star formation are similar over a wide rangeof stellar densities and other environmental conditions. with current data, wecannot rule out modest variations in the substellar mass functions among theseclusters. we then make the best estimate of the true form of the imf in thetrapezium by using the evolutionary models of baraffe et al. and an empiricallyadjusted temperature scale and compare this mass function to recent results forthe pleiades and the field. all of these data are consistent with an imf thatis flat or rises slowly from the substellar regime to about 0.6 msun, and thenrolls over into a power law that continues from about 1 msun to higher masseswith a slope similar to or somewhat larger than the salpeter value of 1.35. forthe trapezium, this behavior holds from our completeness limit of ~0.02 msunand probably, after a modest completeness correction, even from 0.01-0.02 msun.these data include ~50 likely brown dwarfs. we test the predictions of theoriesof the imf against various properties of the observed imf.

astro-ph;0110550	an adaptive optics search for companions to stars with planets	we have performed a keck adaptive optics (ao) imaging survey of 25 extrasolarplanetary systems discovered by the radial velocity programs. typically, thehigh-resolution (fwhm~0.04") near-infrared images are able to detect pointsources at dh=10 at 1", l and t dwarfs at 0.5" to 2.0", and stars and browndwarfs at 3-10 au and 10-100 au from the targets. the ao images reveal 15 faintsources (h=14-20) near the stars hd 37124, hd 168443, hd 187123, and hd 190228out to a search radius of 3.3. we have obtained ao images at a second epoch forfive of the candidate companions at keck and gemini observatories. theresulting measurements of proper motions relative to the primary stars indicatethat these five sources are background stars. given that the four primaries arenear the galactic plane (|b|&lt;6 deg), the remaining faint sources are alsolikely to be background stars rather than substellar companions. we present thecompanion detection limits for each target as a function of separation andcompare them to the sensitivities of radial velocity surveys, demonstrating thecomplementary nature of the two techniques.

astro-ph;0204272	discovery of an edge-on disk in the mbm 12 young association	we report the discovery of a spatially-resolved edge-on protoplanetary diskin the ~2-myr-old mbm 12 young association. our near-infrared images of lkha263c (mbm 12a 3c), obtained with the hokupa'a adaptive optics system on thegemini north telescope, clearly show two elongated reflection nebulositiesseparated by a dark lane, a morphology well-matched by scattered light modelsof an optically thick (at near-infrared wavelengths) edge-on disk. an opticalspectrum of the scattered light nebulosity obtained with the keck ii telescopeexhibits a spectral type of m0 +/- 0.5 (t_eff = 3850 +/- 100 k) for the centralstar and contains h_alpha and forbidden emission lines, which may indicate thepresence of a jet. the absence of a near-infrared point source implies a_k &gt;9.5 toward the unseen central star. the disk is flared and has a radius of ~150au (at a distance of 275 pc) and an inclination of 87 degrees. the aspect ratioof the model disk in the j-band is 0.72. there is possible evidence for dustsettling to the disk midplane. lkha 263c is 4.115" from the 0.415" binary lkha263 a and b (mbm 12a 3a and 3b), which is itself 15.5" from lkha 262 (mbm 12a2). thus, lkha 263c may be the first disk to be clearly resolved around anindividual star in a young quadruple system. the detection of a faint edge-ondisk near a bright star demonstrates both the high angular resolution and thehigh sensitivity that can be achieved with adaptive optics imaging on largetelescopes.

astro-ph;0407344	the first discovery of a wide binary brown dwarf	i present observations of a new faint double, 2mass j11011926-7732383ab,toward the chamaeleon i star-forming region. from optical and near-infraredimages of the pair, i measure a separation of 1.44" and extract rijhk_sphotometry of the components (i_a=17.21, di=1.07, k_s a=11.97, dk_s=0.84). iuse resolved optical spectroscopy to derive spectral types of m7.25 and m8.25for the a and b components, respectively. based on the strengths ofgravity-sensitive features in these data, such as the na i and k i absorptionlines, i conclude that these objects are young members of chamaeleon i ratherthan field stars. the probability that this pair is composed of unrelatedlate-type members of chamaeleon i is low enough (~5x10^-5) to definitivelyestablish it as a binary system. after estimating extinctions, effectivetemperatures, and bolometric luminosities for the binary components, i placethem on the h-r diagram and infer their masses with the evolutionary models ofchabrier and baraffe, arriving at substellar values of 0.05 and 0.025 m_sun.the projected angular separation of this system corresponds to 240 au at thedistance of chamaeleon i, making it the first known binary brown dwarf with aseparation greater than 20 au. this demonstration that brown dwarfs can form infragile, easily disrupted configurations is direct evidence that the formationof brown dwarfs does not require ejection from multiple systems or otherdynamical effects. it remains possible that ejection plays a role in theformation of some brown dwarfs, but it is not an essential component accordingto these observations.

astro-ph;0411444	a survey for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the eta cha and eps cha  young associations	i present the results of a search for new low-mass stars and brown dwarfs inthe eta cha and eps cha young associations. within radii of 1.5 and 0.5 degsurrounding eta cha and eps cha, respectively, i have constructedcolor-magnitude diagrams from denis and 2mass photometry and have obtainedspectra of the candidate low-mass members therein. the five candidates in etacha are classified as four field m dwarfs and one carbon star. no new membersare found in this survey, which is complete for m_sun=0.015-0.15 according tothe evolutionary models of chabrier and baraffe. thus, an extended populationof low-mass members is not present in eta cha out to four times the radius ofthe known membership. meanwhile, the three candidate members of eps cha areclassified as young stars, and thus likely members of the association, based onli absorption and gravity-sensitive absorption lines. these new sources havespectral types of m2.25, m3.75, and m5.75, corresponding to masses of 0.45,0.25, and 0.09 m_sun by the models of chabrier and baraffe. for one of thesestars, intense h(alpha) emission, forbidden line emission, and strong k-bandexcess emission suggest the presence of accretion, an outflow, and a disk,respectively. this young star is also much fainter than expected for anassociation member at its spectral type, which could indicate that it is seenin scattered light. no brown dwarfs are detected in eps cha down to thecompleteness limit of 0.015 m_sun. the absence of brown dwarfs in theseassociations is statistically consistent with the mass functions measured instar-forming regions, which exhibit only ~2 and ~1 brown dwarfs for stellarsamples at the sizes of the eta cha and eps cha associations.

astro-ph;0502023	measuring accretion in young substellar objects: approaching the  planetary mass regime	we present observations of halpha emission line profiles taken at magellanobservatory for a sample of 39 young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in thetaurus and chamaeleon i star forming regions. we have identified 11 newsubstellar accretors, more than tripling the number of known brown dwarfs withmeasurable accretion activity. these include the lowest-mass objects yet seenwith accretion, with masses down to ~0.015 msun. using models of halphaemission produced in magnetospheric accretion flows, the most widely applicableprimary calibrator now available, we determine the first estimates of massaccretion rates for objects at such extremely low masses. for the six objectswith masses &lt; 0.03 msun, we find accretion rates of ~ 5x10^{-12} msun/yr, amongthe smallest yet measured. these new results continue the trend of decreasingmass accretion rate with decreasing (sub)stellar mass that we have notedpreviously for samples of more massive objects; the overall correlation is mdot\~ m^{2.1}, and now extends over a mass range of over two orders of magnitude.finally, the absence of a discontinuity in the distribution of accretion rateswith mass tends to suggest that stars and brown dwarfs share similar formationhistories.

astro-ph;0502100	spitzer identification of the least massive known brown dwarf with a  circumstellar disk	using the infrared array camera (irac) aboard the spitzer space telescope, wehave obtained mid-infrared photometry of the least massive known brown dwarf inthe chamaeleon i star-forming region. for this young brown dwarf, ots 44, wehave constructed a spectral energy distribution (sed) from 0.8-8 um bycombining the measurements at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 um from irac withground-based photometry at i, j, h, and k. the resulting sed for ots 44exhibits significant excess emission longward of 3 um relative to the sedexpected from the photosphere of the brown dwarf. we have successfully modeledthe source of this excess emission in terms of an irradiated viscous accretiondisk with m'&lt;=10^-10 m_sun/year. with a spectral type of m9.5 and a mass of ~15m_jup, ots 44 is now the coolest and least massive brown dwarf observed to havea circumstellar disk. these measurements demonstrate that disks exist aroundbrown dwarfs even down to the deuterium burning mass limit and the approximateupper mass limit of extrasolar planetary companions.

astro-ph;0510662	discovery of a wide low-mass binary system in upper scorpius	using the near-infrared spectrometer spex and its slit-viewing camera at theirtf, i have resolved a low-mass member of the upper scorpius ob associationinto a double star. from k-band images of the pair, denis-p j161833.2-251750.4a and b, i measure a separation of 0.96" and a magnitude difference of dk=0.42mag. i present resolved 0.8-2.5 micron spectroscopy of the two objects, both ofwhich exhibit signatures of youth in the shape of their h- and k-band continua,demonstrating that both are members of upper scorpius rather than field stars.in addition, through a comparison to optically-classified pre-main-sequenceobjects, i derive a spectral type near m5 for each component, corresponding toa mass of ~0.15 msun with the evolutionary models of chabrier and baraffe. theprobability that this pair is composed of unrelated m-type members of upperscorpius is ~10^-5. when added to the recent discoveries of other wide, easilydisrupted low-mass binaries, this new system further establishes that theformation of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs does not require ejection frommultiple systems. these observations also indicate that wide low-mass binariescan form in ob associations as well as in smaller clusters where the previouslyknown wide pairs have been found. thus, the available data show no perceptibleeffect of star-forming environment on the prevalence of loosely bound low-masssystems.

astro-ph;0510665	the age of ab dor	we have derived a new age estimate for the nearby young star ab dor and haveinvestigated the resulting implications for testing theoretical evolutionarymodels with the data reported by close and coworkers for the low-mass companionab dor c. using color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the ab dor moving groupis roughly coeval with the pleiades (100-125 myr) and is clearly older than ic2391 (35-50 myr). in fact, based on a comparison of the kinematics of ab dorand the pleiades, we suggest that the stars identified by zuckerman andcoworkers as members of a moving group with ab dor are remnants of the largescale star-formation event that formed the pleiades. using the age of 50+50/-20myr adopted by close, the luminosity predicted by the models of chabrier andbaraffe for ab dor c is larger than the value reported by close, but is stillwithin the quoted uncertainties. meanwhile, the agreement is good when our ageestimate for ab dor c is adopted. thus, we find no evidence in the datapresented by close for ab dor c to suggest that previous studies using themodels of chabrier and baraffe and bolometric luminosity as the mass indicatorhave significantly underestimated the masses of young low-mass stars and browndwarfs.

astro-ph;0510666	testing theoretical evolutionary models with ab dor c and the initial  mass function	we assess the constraints on the evolutionary models of young low-massobjects that are provided by the measurements of the companion ab dor c byclose and coworkers and by a new comparison of model-derived imfs ofstar-forming regions to the well-calibrated imf of the solar neighborhood.after performing an independent analysis of close's imaging and spectroscopicdata for ab dor c, we find that ab dor c is not detected at a significant level(sn 1.2) in the sdi images when one narrow-band image is subtracted fromanother, but that it does appear in the individual sdi frames as well as theimages at jhk. using the age of 75-150 myr for ab dor from luhman, stauffer, &amp;mamajek, the luminosity predicted by the models of chabrier &amp; baraffe isconsistent with the value that we estimate. we measure a spectral type ofm6+/-1 from the k-band spectrum of ab dor c, which is earlier than the value ofm8+/-1 from close and is consistent with the model predictions when a dwarftemperature scale is adopted. in a test of these models at much younger ages,we show that the low-mass imfs that they produce for star-forming regions aresimilar to the imf of the solar neighborhood. if the masses of the low-massstars and brown dwarfs in these imfs of star-forming regions wereunderestimated by a factor of two as suggested by close, then the imfcharacterizing the current generation of galactic star formation would have tobe radically different from the imf of the solar neighborhood.

astro-ph;0511314	spitzer/irac photometry of the eta chameleontis association	we present irac 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron photometry for the 17 a, k and mtype members of the eta chameleontis association. these data show infraredexcesses toward six of the 15 k and m stars, indicating the presence ofcircumstellar disks around 40% of the stars with masses of 0.1-1 solar mass.the two a-stars show no infrared excesses. the excess emission around one ofthe stars is comparable to the median excess for classical t tauri stars in thetaurus association; the remaining five show comparatively weak excess emission.taking into account published halpha spectroscopy that shows that five of thesix stars are accreting, we argue that the disks with weak mid-infraredexcesses are disks in which the inner disks have been largely depleted of smallgrains by grain growth, or, in one case, the small grains have settled to themidplane. this suggests that eta cha has a much higher fraction of disks caughtin the act of transitioning into optically thin disks than that measured inyounger clusters and associations.

astro-ph;0511638	observations of ic348: the disk population at 2-3 million years	we present near and mid-infrared photometry obtained with the spitzer spacetelescope of 300 known members of the ic348 cluster. we merge this photometrywith existing ground-based optical and near-infrared photometry in order toconstruct optical-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) for all thecluster members and present a complete atlas of these seds. we employ theseobservations to both investigate the frequency and nature of the circumstellardisk population in the cluster. the observations are sufficiently sensitive toenable the first detailed measurement of the disk frequency for very low massstars at the peak of the stellar imf. using measurements of infrared excessbetween 3.6 and 8 microns we find the total frequency of disk-bearing stars inthe cluster to be 50 +/- 6%. however, only 30 +/- 4% of the member stars aresurrounded by optically thick, primordial disks, while the remainingdisk-bearing stars are surrounded by what appear to be optically thin,anemicdisks. the disk fraction appears to be a function of spectral type and stellarmass. the disk longevity and thus conditions for planet formation appear to bemost favorable for stars which are of comparable mass to the sun. the opticallythick disks around later type (&gt; m4) stars appear to be less flared than thedisks around earlier type stars. this may indicate a greater degree of dustsettling and a more advanced evolutionary state for the late m disk population.finally we find that the presence of an optically thick dust disk is correlatedwith gaseous accretion as measured by the strength of halpha emission. theseresults suggest that it is more likely for dust disks to persist in the absenceof active gaseous accretion than for active accretion to persist in the absenceof dusty disks.

astro-ph;0511807	discovery of a planetary-mass brown dwarf with a circumstellar disk	using the hubble space telescope, the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerrotololo inter-american observatory, and the spitzer space telescope, we haveperformed deep imaging from 0.8 to 8 um of the southern subcluster in thechamaeleon i star-forming region. in these data, we have discovered an object,cha 110913-773444, whose colors and magnitudes are indicative of a verylow-mass brown dwarf with a circumstellar disk. in a near-infrared spectrum ofthis source obtained with the gemini near-infrared spectrograph, the presenceof strong steam absorption confirms its late-type nature (&gt;=m9.5) while theshapes of the h- and k-band continua and the strengths of the na i and k ilines demonstrate that it is a young, pre-main-sequence object rather than afield dwarf. a comparison of the bolometric luminosity of cha 110913-773444 tothe luminosities predicted by the evolutionary models of chabrier and baraffeand burrows and coworkers indicates a mass of 8+7/-3 m_jup, placing it fullywithin the mass range observed for extrasolar planetary companions (m&lt;=15m_jup). the spectral energy distribution of this object exhibits mid-infraredexcess emission at &gt;5 um, which we have successfully modeled in terms of anirradiated viscous accretion disk with m'&lt;=10e-12 m_sun/year. cha 110913-773444is now the least massive brown dwarf observed to have a circumstellar disk, andindeed is one of the least massive free-floating objects found to date. theseresults demonstrate that the raw materials for planet formation exist aroundfree-floating planetary-mass bodies.

astro-ph;0608547	the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs in taurus	by combining photometry from the 2mass point source catalog and the usno-b1.0catalog with optical and infrared spectroscopy, i have performed a search foryoung brown dwarfs in an area of 225 deg^2 encompassing all of the taurusstar-forming region (1 myr). from this work, i have discovered 22 new membersof taurus, five of which were independently found by guieu and coworkers.sixteen of these new members have spectral types later than m6 and thus arelikely to be brown dwarfs according to the theoretical evolutionary models ofchabrier and baraffe. after adding these new members to the previously knownmembers of taurus, i have compared the spatial distributions of stars and browndwarfs across the entire region. i find no statistically significant differencebetween these two distributions. taurus does not contain the large, extendedpopulation of brown dwarfs that has been predicted by some embryo ejectionmodels for the formation of brown dwarfs. however, these results are consistentwith other ejection models, as well as models in which stars and brown dwarfsshare a common formation mechanism.

astro-ph;0608548	a survey for new members of taurus with the spitzer space telescope	we present the results of a search for new members of the taurus star-formingregion using the infrared array camera (irac) aboard the spitzer spacetelescope}. with irac images of 29.7 deg^2 of taurus at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0um, we have identified sources with red mid-infrared colors indicative ofdisk-bearing objects and have obtained optical and infrared spectra of 23 ofthese candidate members. through this work, we have discovered 13 new membersof taurus, two of which have spectral types later than m6 and thus are likelyto be brown dwarfs according to the theoretical evolutionary models of chabrierand baraffe. this survey indicates that the previous census of taurus has acompleteness of ~80% for members with disks. the new members that we have founddo not significantly modify the previously measured distributions of taurusmembers as a function of position, mass, and extinction. for instance, we findno evidence for a population of highly reddened brown dwarfs (a_k~2) that hasbeen missed by previous optical and near-infrared surveys, which suggests thatbrown dwarf disks are not significantly more flared than disks around stars. inaddition to the new members, we also present irac photometry for the 149previously known members that appear within this survey, which includes 27objects later than m6.

astro-ph;0609187	discovery of a young substellar companion in chamaeleon	during an imaging survey of the chamaeleon i star-forming region with the acsaboard hst, we have discovered a candidate substellar companion to the younglow-mass star chxr 73 (~2 myr, m=0.35 msun). we measure a projected separationof 1.3+/-0.03" for the companion, chxr 73 b, which corresponds to 210 au at thedistance of the cluster. a near-infrared spectrum of this source obtained withcormass at the magellan ii telescope exhibits strong steam absorption thatconfirms its late-type nature (&gt;=m9.5). in addition, the gravity-sensitiveshapes of the h- and k-band continua demonstrate that chxr 73 b is a young,pre-main-sequence object rather than a field star. the probability that chxr73a and b are unrelated members of chamaeleon i is ~0.001. we estimate themasses of chxr 73 b and other known substellar companions in young clusterswith a method that is consistent with the dynamical measurements of theeclipsing binary brown dwarf 2m 0535-0546, which consists of a comparison ofthe bolometric luminosities of the companions to the values predicted by theevolutionary models of chabrier &amp; coworkers and burrows &amp; coworkers. we arriveat mass estimates of 0.003-0.004, 0.024+/-0.012, 0.011+0.01/-0.003, and0.012+0.008/-0.005 msun for 2m 1207-3932 b, gq lup b, dh tau b, and chxr 73 b,respectively. thus, dh tau b and chxr 73 b appear to be the least massivecompanions to stars outside the solar system that have been detected in directimages, and may have masses that are within the range observed for extrasolarplanetary companions (m&lt;=0.015 msun). however, because these two objects (aswell as 2m 1207-3932 b) probably did not form within circumstellar disks aroundtheir primaries, we suggest that they should be viewed as brown dwarfcompanions rather than planets.

astro-ph;0609464	discovery of two t dwarf companions with the spitzer space telescope	we report the discovery of t dwarf companions to the nearby stars hn peg(g0v, 18.4 pc, ~0.3 gyr) and hd 3651 (k0v, 11.1 pc, ~7 gyr). during an ongoingsurvey of 5'x5' fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with iracaboard the spitzer space telescope, we identified these companions as candidatet dwarfs based on their mid-ir colors. using near-ir spectra obtained with spexat the nasa irtf, we confirm the presence of methane absorption thatcharacterizes t dwarfs and measure spectral types of t2.5+/-0.5 and t7.5+/-0.5for hn peg b and hd 3651 b, respectively. by comparing our spitzer data toimages from 2mass obtained several years earlier, we find that the propermotions of hn peg b and hd 3651 b are consistent with those of the primaries,confirming their companionship. hn peg b and hd 3651 b have angular separationsof 43.2" and 42.9" from their primaries, which correspond to projected physicalseparations of 795 and 476 au, respectively. a comparison of their luminositiesto the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of0.021+/-0.009 and 0.051+/-0.014 msun for hn peg b and hd 3651 b. in addition,the models imply an effective temperature for hn peg b that is significantlylower than the values derived for other t dwarfs at similar spectral types,which is the same behavior reported by metchev &amp; hillenbrand for the younglate-l dwarf hd 203030 b. thus, the temperature of the l/t transition appearsto depend on surface gravity. meanwhile, hd 3651 b is the first substellarcompanion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close-inplanet from rv surveys. the discovery of this companion supports the notionthat the high eccentricities of close-in planets like the one near hd 3651 maybe the result of perturbations by low-mass companions at wide separations.

astro-ph;0611408	characterizing young brown dwarfs using low resolution near-ir spectra	we present near-infrared (1.0-2.4 micron) spectra confirming the youth andcool effective temperatures of 6 brown dwarfs and low mass stars withcircumstellar disks toward the chamaeleon ii and ophiuchus star formingregions. the spectrum of one of our objects indicates that it has a spectraltype of ~l1, making it one of the latest spectral type young brown dwarfsidentified to date. comparing spectra of young brown dwarfs, field dwarfs, andgiant stars, we define a 1.49-1.56 micron h2o index capable of determiningspectral type to within 1 sub-type, independent of gravity. we have alsodefined an index based on the 1.14 micron sodium feature that is sensitive togravity, but only weakly dependent on spectral type for field dwarfs. our 1.14micron na index can be used to distinguish young cluster members (t &lt;~ 5 myr)from young field dwarfs, both of which may have the triangular h-band continuumshape which persists for at least tens of myr. using effective temperaturesdetermined from the spectral types of our objects along with luminositiesderived from near and mid-infrared photometry, we place our objects on the h-rdiagram and overlay evolutionary models to estimate the masses and ages of ouryoung sources. three of our sources have inferred ages (t ~= 10-30 myr)significantly older than the median stellar age of their parent clouds (1-3myr). for these three objects, we derive masses ~3 times greater than expectedfor 1-3 myr old brown dwarfs with the bolometric luminosities of our sources.the large discrepancies in the inferred masses and ages determined using twoseparate, yet reasonable methods, emphasize the need for caution when derivingor exploiting brown dwarf mass and age estimates.

astro-ph;0701242	oph 1622-2405: not a planetary-mass binary	we present an analysis of the mass and age of the young low-mass binary oph1622-2405. using resolved optical spectroscopy of the binary, we measurespectral types of m7.25+/-0.25 and m8.75+/-0.25 for the a and b components,respectively. we show that our spectra are inconsistent with the spectral typesof m9 and m9.5-l0 from jayawardhana &amp; ivanov and m9+/-0.5 and m9.5+/-0.5 fromclose and coworkers. based on our spectral types and the theoreticalevolutionary models of chabrier and baraffe, we estimate masses of 0.055 and0.019 msun for oph 1622-2405a and b, which are significantly higher than thevalues of 0.013 and 0.007 msun derived by jayawardhana &amp; ivanov and above therange of masses observed for extrasolar planets (m&lt;=0.015 msun). planet-likemass estimates are further contradicted by our demonstration that oph1622-2405a is only slightly later (by 0.5 subclass) than the composite of theyoung eclipsing binary brown dwarf 2m 0535-0546, whose components havedynamical masses of 0.034 and 0.054 msun. to constrain the age of oph1622-2405, we compare the strengths of gravity-sensitive absorption lines inoptical and near-infrared spectra of the primary to lines in field dwarfs (&gt;1gyr) and members of taurus (~1 myr) and upper scorpius (~5 myr). the linestrengths for oph 1622-2405a are inconsistent with membership in ophiuchus (&lt;1myr) and instead indicate an age similar to that of upper sco, which isagreement with a similar analysis performed by close and coworkers. we concludethat oph 1622-2405 is part of an older population in sco-cen, perhaps upper scoitself.

astro-ph;9905286	low-mass star formation and the initial mass function in the rho  ophiuchi cloud core	we have obtained moderate-resolution (r=800-1200) k-band spectra for ~100stars within and surrounding the cloud core of rho oph. we have measuredspectral types and continuum veilings and have combined this information withresults from new deep imaging. the imf peaks at about 0.4 m_sun and slowlydeclines to the hydrogen burning limit with a slope of ~-0.5 in logarithmicunits (salpeter is +1.35). our lower limits on the numbers of substellarobjects demonstrate that the imf probably does not fall more steeply below thehydrogen burning limit, at least down to ~0.02 m_sun. we then make the firstcomparison of mass functions of stars and pre-stellar clumps (motte, andre, &amp;neri) measured in the same region. the similar behavior of the two massfunctions in rho oph supports the suggestion of motte et al. and testi &amp;sargent that the stellar mass function in young clusters is a direct product ofthe process of cloud fragmentation. after considering the effect of extinctionon the sed classifications of the sample, we find that ~17% of the rho ophstars are class i, implying ~0.1 myr for the lifetime of this stage. in spectraseparated by two years, we observe simultaneous variability in the br gammaemission and k-band continuum veiling for two stars, where the hydrogenemission is brighter in the more heavily veiled data. this behavior indicatesthat the disk may contribute significantly to continuous k-band emission, incontrast to the proposal that the infalling envelope always dominates. ourdetection of strong 2 micron veiling (r_k=1-4) in several class ii and iiistars, which should have disks but little envelope material, further supportsthis proposition.

astro-ph;9909207	keck spectra of brown dwarf candidates and a precise determination of  the lithium depletion boundary in the alpha persei open cluster	we have identified twenty-seven candidate very low mass members of therelatively young alpha persei open cluster from a six square degree ccd imagingsurvey. based on their i magnitudes and the nominal age and distance to thecluster, these objects should have masses less than 0.1 msunif they are clustermembers. we have subsequently obtained intermediate resolution spectra ofseventeen of these objects using the keck ii telescope and lris spectrograph.we have also obtained near-ir photometry for many of the stars. our primarygoal was to determine the location of the "lithium depletion boundary" andhence to derive a precise age for the cluster. we detect lithium withequivalent widths greater than or equal to 0.4 \aa in five of the programobjects. we have constructed a color-magnitude diagram for the faint end of thealpha persei main sequence. these data allow us to accurately determine thealpha persei single-star lithium depletion boundary at m(i$_c$) = 11.47, m(bol)= 11.42, (r-i)$_{c0}$ = 2.12, spectral type m6.0. by reference to theoreticalevolutionary models, this converts fairly directly into an age for the alphapersei cluster of 90 $\pm$ 10 myr. at this age, the two faintest of ourspectroscopically confirmed members should be sub-stellar (i.e., brown dwarfs)according to theoretical models.

0706.0279	hubble and spitzer observations of an edge-on circumstellar disk around  a brown dwarf	we present observations of a circumstellar disk that is inclined close toedge-on around a young brown dwarf in the taurus star-forming region. usingdata obtained with spex at the nasa infrared telescope facility, we find thatthe slope of the 0.8-2.5 um spectrum of the brown dwarf 2mass j04381486+2611399cannot be reproduced with a photosphere reddened by normal extinction. instead,the slope is consistent with scattered light, indicating that circumstellarmaterial is occulting the brown dwarf. by combining the spex data with mid-irphotometry and spectroscopy from the spitzer space telescope and previouslypublished millimeter data from scholz and coworkers, we construct the spectralenergy distribution for 2mass j04381486+2611399 and model it in terms of ayoung brown dwarf surrounded by an irradiated accretion disk. the presence ofboth silicate absorption at 10 um and silicate emission at 11 um constrains theinclination of the disk to be ~70 deg, i.e. ~20 deg from edge-on. additionalevidence of the high inclination of this disk is provided by our detection ofasymmetric bipolar extended emission surrounding 2mass j04381486+2611399 inhigh-resolution optical images obtained with the hubble space telescope.according to our modeling for the sed and images of this system, the diskcontains a large inner hole that is indicative of a transition disk (r_in~58r_star~0.275 au) and is somewhat larger than expected from embryo ejectionmodels (r_out=20-40 au vs. r_out&lt;10-20 au).
