0902.2064	photometric h alpha and [o ii] luminosity function of sdf and sxdf  galaxies: implications for future baryon oscillation surveys	efficient selection of emission line galaxies at z &gt; 1 by photometricinformation in wide field surveys is one of the keys for future spectroscopicsurveys to constrain dark energy using the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)signature. here we estimate the h alpha and [o ii] line luminosity functions ofgalaxies at z = 0.5-1.7 using a novel approach where multi-wavelength imagingdata is used to jointly estimate both photometric redshifts and star-formationrates. these photometric estimates of line luminosities at high-redshift usethe large data sets of the subaru deep field and subaru xmm-newton deep field(covering \sim 1 deg^2) and are calibrated with the spectroscopic data of thelocal sloan digital sky survey galaxies. the derived luminosity functions(especially h alpha) are in reasonable agreement with the past estimates basedon spectroscopic or narrow-band-filter surveys. this dataset is useful forexamining the photometric selection of target galaxies for bao surveys becauseof the large cosmological volume covered and the large number of galaxies withdetailed photometric information. we use the sample to derive the photometricand physical properties of emission line galaxies to assist planning for futurespectroscopic bao surveys. we also show some examples of photometric selectionprocedures which can efficiently select these emission line galaxies.

0902.4712	lyman break galaxies at z~1.8-2.8: galex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep  field	abridged: a photometric sample of ~7100 v&lt;25.3 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)has been selected by combining subaru/suprime-cam bvrci'z' data with deepgalex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep field. follow-up spectroscopy confirmed 24lbgs at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7. among the optical spectra, 12 have ly-alpha emission withrest-frame equivalent widths of ~5-60aa. the success rate for identifying lbgsas nuv-dropouts at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7 is 86%. the rest-frame uv (1700aa) luminosityfunction (lf) is constructed from the photometric sample with corrections forstellar contamination and z&lt;1.5 interlopers. the lf is 1.7+/-0.1 times higherthan those of z~2 bxs and z~3 lbgs. three explanations were considered, and itis argued that significantly underestimating low-z contamination or effectivecomoving volume is unlikely: the former would be inconsistent with thespectroscopic sample at 93% confidence, and the second explanation would notresolve the discrepancy. the third scenario is that different photometricselection of the samples yields non-identical galaxy populations, such thatsome bx galaxies are lbgs and vice versa. this argument is supported by ahigher surface density of lbgs at all magnitudes while the redshiftdistribution of the two populations is nearly identical. this study, whencombined with other star-formation rate (sfr) density uv measurements from lbgsurveys, indicates that there is a rise in the sfr density: a factor of 3-6(3-10) increase from z~5 (z~6) to z~2, followed by a decrease to z~0. thisresult, along with past sub-mm studies that find a peak at z~2 in theirredshift distribution, suggest that z~2 is the epoch of peak star-formation.additional spectroscopy is required to characterize the complete shape of thez~2 lbg uv lf via measurements of contamination and accurate distances.

0903.2535	subaru mid-infrared imaging of the quadruple lenses. ii. unveiling lens  structure of mg0414+0534 and q2237+030	we present mid-infrared imaging at 11.7 $\mu$m for the quadruple lenssystems, mg0414+0534 and q2237+030, using the cooled mid-infrared camera andspectrometer (comics) attached on the subaru telescope. mg0414+0534 ischaracterized by a bright pair of lensed images (a1, a2) and their optical fluxratio a2/a1 deviates significantly from the prediction of a smooth lens model.q2237+030 is comprised of four lensed images, which are significantly affectedby microlensing in a foreground lensing galaxy. our mid-infrared observationsof these lensed images have revealed that the mid-infrared flux ratio for a2/a1of mg0414+0534 is nearly unity (0.90 +- 0.04). we find that this flux ratio issystematically small, at 4 to 5 sigma level, compared with the prediction of abest smooth lens model (1.09) represented by a singular isothermal ellipsoidand external shear, thereby suggesting the presence of substructures to explainour observational result. in contrast, for q2237+030, our high signal-to-noiseobservation indicates that the mid-infrared flux ratios between all the fourimages of q2237+030 are virtually consistent with the prediction of a smoothlens model. based on the size estimate of the dust torus surrounding the nucleiof these qsos, we set limits on the mass of a substructure in these lenssystems, which can cause anomalies in the flux ratios. for mg0414+0534, sincethe required mass of a substructure inside its einstein radius is &gt; 360 m_sun,millilensing by a cdm substructure is most likely. if it is modeled as asingular isothermal sphere, the mass inside radius of 100 pc is given as &gt;1.0x10^5 m_sun. for q2237+030, there is no significant evidence ofmillilensing, so the reported anomalous flux ratios in shorter wavelengths areentirely caused by microlensing by stars (abridged).

0908.3191	large area survey for z=7 galaxies in sdf and goods-n: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present results of our large-area survey for z'-band dropout galaxies atz=7 in a 1568 arcmin^2 sky area covering the sdf and goods-n fields. combiningour ultra-deep subaru/suprime-cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images withlegacy data of subaru and hst, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxiesdown to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determinedfrom lya emission. the z=7 luminosity function (lf) yields the best-fitschechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) mpc^(-3), muv*=-20.10+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a&gt;95% confidence level. this decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our twofields, which is estimated to be a factor of &lt;~2. we have found that the cosmicstar formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by afactor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. a comparison with the reionizationmodels suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by onlygalaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 aredifferent from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction(&gt;~0.2), and/or a flatter imf. our sdf z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-mpclong filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with lya emission is locatedat the center of an overdense region consisting of four uv bright dropoutcandidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubbleat z=7.

0707.1561	the reionization and galaxy evolution probed by z=7 lyman alpha emitters	we made a narrowband nb973 (bandwidth of 200a at 9755a) imaging of the subarudeep field (sdf) and found two z=7 lyman alpha emitter (lae) candidates down tonb973=24.9. carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy, we identified one of themas a real z=6.96 lae. this has shown that galaxy formation was in progress just750 myr after the big bang. meanwhile, the lyman alpha line luminosity functionof lae is known to decline from z=5.7 to 6.6 in the sdf. l* at z=6.6 is 40-60%of that at z=5.7. we also confirm that the number density of z=7 lae is only17% of the density at z=6.6 comparing the latest sdf lae samples. this seriesof significant decreases in lae density with increasing redshift can be theresult of galaxy evolution during these epochs. however, using the uv continuumluminosity functions of laes, those of lyman break galaxies, and a laeevolution model based on the hierarchical clustering, we find that galaxyevolution alone cannot explain all the decrease in density. this extra densitydeficit can be interpreted as the attenuation of the lyman alpha photons fromlaes due to a rapid evolution of neutral hydrogen fraction during the ongoingcosmic reionization at z~6.6-7.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1008.4837	spitzer space telescope constraint on the stellar mass of a z = 6.96  lyman alpha emitter	we obtained mid-infrared 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging of a z=6.96 lyman alphaemitter (lae) iok-1 discovered in the subaru deep field, using spitzer spacetelescope infrared array camera observations. after removal of a nearby brightsource, we find that iok-1 is not significantly detected in any of theseinfrared bands to m_3.6 ~ 24.00 and m_4.5 ~ 23.54 at 3 sigma. fittingpopulation synthesis models to the spectral energy distribution consisting ofthe upper limit fluxes of the optical to infrared non-detection images andfluxes in detection images, we constrain the stellar mass m* of iok-1. this laecould have either a mass as low as m* &lt;~ 2-9 x 10^8 msun for the young age (&lt;~10 myr) and the low dust reddening (a_v ~ 0) or a mass as large as m* &lt;~ 1-4 x10^{10} msun for either the old age (&gt; 100 myr) or the high dust reddening (a_v~ 1.5). this would be within the range of masses of z ~ 3-6.6 laes studied todate, ~ 10^6-10^{10} msun. hence, iok-1 is not a particularly unique galaxywith extremely high mass or low mass but is similar to one of the laes seen atthe later epochs.

1008.4842	lyman alpha emitters at z=7 in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field:  photometric candidates and luminosity function	we conducted a deep narrowband nb973 (fwhm = 200 a centered at 9755 a) surveyof z=7 lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field,using the fully depleted ccds newly installed on the subaru telescopesuprime-cam, which is twice more sensitive to z=7 lyman alpha at ~ 1 micronthan the previous ccds. reaching the depth 0.5 magnitude deeper than ourprevious survey in the subaru deep field that led to the discovery of a z=6.96lae, we detected three probable z=7 lae candidates. even if all the candidatesare real, the lyman alpha luminosity function (lf) at z=7 shows a significantdeficit from the lf at z=5.7 determined by previous surveys. the lae number andlyman alpha luminosity densities at z=7 is ~ 7.7-54% and ~5.5-39% of those atz=5.7 to the lyman alpha line luminosity limit of l(ly-alpha) &gt;~ 9.2 x 10^{42}erg s^{-1}. this could be due to evolution of the lae population at theseepochs as a recent galaxy evolution model predicts that the lae modestlyevolves from z=5.7 to 7. however, even after correcting for this effect ofgalaxy evolution on the decrease in lae number density, the z=7 lyman alpha lfstill shows a deficit from z=5.7 lf. this might reflect the attenuation oflyman alpha emission by neutral hydrogen remaining at the epoch of reionizationand suggests that reionization of the universe might not be complete yet atz=7. if we attribute the density deficit to reionization, the intergalacticmedium (igm) transmission for lyman alpha photons at z=7 would be 0.4 &lt;=t_{ly-alpha}^{igm} &lt;= 1, supporting the possible higher neutral fraction at theearlier epochs at z &gt; 6 suggested by the previous surveys of z=5.7-7 laes, z ~6 quasars and z &gt; 6 gamma-ray bursts.

0704.2238	the habitat segregation between lyman break galaxies and lyman alpha  emitters around a qso at z~5	we carried out a target survey for lyman break galaxies (lbgs) and lymanalpha emitters (laes) around qso sdss j0211-0009 at z=4.87. the deep and widebroadband and narrowband imaging simultaneously revealed the perspectivestructure of these two high-z populations. the lbgs without ly-alpha emissionform a filamentary structure including the qso, while the laes are distributedaround the qso but avoid it within a distance of ~4.5mpc. on the other hand, weserendipitously discovered a protocluster with a significant concentration oflbgs and laes where no strongly uv ionizing source such as a qso or radiogalaxy is known to exist. in this cluster field, two populations are spatiallycross-correlated with each other. the relative spatial distribution of laes tolbgs is in stark contrast between the qso and the cluster fields. we also founda weak trend showing that the number counts based on ly-alpha and uv continuumfluxes of laes in the qso field are slightly lower than in the cluster field,whereas the number counts of lbgs are almost consistent with each other. thelaes avoid the nearby region around the qso where the local uv backgroundradiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. theclustering segregation between lbgs and laes seen in the qso field could be dueto either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment havingcaused all the laes to evolve into lbgs, or local photoionization due to thestrong uv radiation from the qso effectively causing a deficit in low-massgalaxies like laes.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1104.5019	a census of star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3 in the subaru deep field	several uv and near-infrared color selection methods have identified galaxiesat z = 1-3. since each method suffers from selection biases, we have appliedthree leading techniques (lyman break, bx/bm, and bzk selection) simultaneouslyin the subaru deep field. this field has reliable ({\delta}z/(1 + z) =0.02--0.09) photometric redshifts for ~53,000 galaxies from 20 bands(1500{\aa}--2.2{\mu}m). the bzk, lbg, and bx/bm samples suffer contaminationfrom z&lt;1 interlopers of 6%, 8%, and 20%, respectively. around the redshiftswhere it is most sensitive (z~1.9 for star-forming bzk, z~1.8 for z~2 lbgs,z~1.6 for bm, and z~2.3 for bx), each technique finds 60-80% of the census ofthe three methods. in addition, each of the color techniques shares 75-96% ofits galaxies with another method, which is consistent with previous studiesthat adopt identical criteria on magnitudes and colors. combining the threesamples gives a comprehensive census that includes ~90% of z-phot = 1-3galaxies, using standard magnitude limits similar to previous studies. in fact,we find that among z = 1-2.5 galaxies in the color selection census, 81-90% ofthem can be selected by just combining the bzk selection with one of the uvtechniques (z~2 lbg or bx and bm). the average galaxy stellar mass, reddeningand sfrs all decrease systematically from the sbzk population to the lbgs, andto the bx/bms. the combined color selections yield a total cosmic sfr densityof 0.18 $\pm$ 0.03 m_sun yr^{-1} mpc^{-3} for k_ab &lt;= 24. we find that 65% ofthe star formation is in galaxies with e(b-v) &gt; 0.25 mag, even though they areonly one-fourth of the census by number.

1111.0630	resolving the galaxies within a giant lya nebula: witnessing the  formation of a galaxy group?	detailed analysis of the substructure of lya nebulae can put importantconstraints on the physical mechanisms at work and the properties of galaxiesforming within them. using high resolution hst imaging of a lya nebula atz~2.656, we have taken a census of the compact galaxies in the vicinity, usedoptical/near-infrared colors to select system members, and put constraints onthe morphology of the spatially-extended emission. the system is characterizedby (a) a population of compact, low luminosity (~0.1 l*) sources --- 17primarily young, small (re~1-2 kpc), disky galaxies including an obscured agn--- that are all substantially offset (&gt;20 kpc) from the line-emitting nebula;(b) the lack of a central galaxy at or near the peak of the lya emission; and(c) several nearly coincident, spatially extended emission components --- lya,heii, and uv continuum --- that are extremely smooth. these morphologicalfindings are difficult to reconcile with theoretical models that invokeoutflows, cold flows, or resonant scattering, suggesting that while all ofthese physical phenomena may be occurring, they are not sufficient to explainthe powering and large extent of lya nebulae. in addition, although the compactgalaxies within the system are irrelevant as power sources, the region issignificantly overdense relative to the field galaxy population (by at least afactor of 4). these observations provide the first estimate of the luminosityfunction of galaxies within an individual lya nebula system, and suggest thatlarge lya nebulae may be the seeds of galaxy groups or low-mass clusters.

1112.3997	the first systematic survey for lyman alpha emitters at z=7.3 with  red-sensitive subaru/suprime-cam	we have performed deep imaging surveys for lya emitters (laes) at redshift~7.3 in two blank fields, the subaru deep field (sdf) and the subaru/xmm-newtondeep survey field (sxdf), using the subaru/suprime-cam equipped with newred-sensitive ccds and a new narrow-band filter, nb1006 (lambda_c=10052 ang,fwhm=214 ang). we identified four objects as lae candidates that exhibitluminosity excess in nb1006. by carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy forthree of them using subaru/focas and keck/deimos, a definitively asymmetricemission line is detected for one of them, sxdf-nb1006-2. assuming this line islya, this object is a lae at z=7.215 which has luminosity of 1.2^{+1.5}_{-0.6}x 10^43 [erg s-1] and a weighted skewness s_w=4.90+-0.86. another object,sdf-nb1006-2, shows variable photometry and is thus probably a quasar (qso) oran active galactic nucleus (agn). it shows an asymmetric emission line at 10076ang, which may be due to either lya at z=7.288 or [oii] at z=1.703. the thirdobject, sdf-nb1006-1, is likely a galaxy with temporal luminosity enhancementassociated with a supernova explosion, as the brightness of this object variesbetween the observed epochs. its spectrum does not show any emission lines. theinferred decrease in the number density of laes toward higher redshift isn_lya(z=7.3)/n_lya(z=5.7) = 0.05^+0.11_-0.05 from z=5.7 to 7.3 down tol(lya)=1.0 x 10^43 [erg s-1]. the present result is consistent with theinterpretation in previous studies that the neutral hydrogen fraction israpidly increasing from z=5.7 to 7.3.

1202.0278	dust attenuation and h-alpha star formation rates of z~0.5 galaxies	using deep narrow-band and broad-band imaging, we identify 401 z~0.40 and 249z~0.49 h-alpha line-emitting galaxies in the subaru deep field. compared toother h-alpha surveys at similar redshifts, our samples are unique since theyprobe lower h-alpha luminosities, are augmented with multi-wavelength(rest-frame 1000aa--1.5 microns) coverage, and a large fraction (20%) of oursamples has already been spectroscopically confirmed. our spectra allow us tomeasure the balmer decrement for nearly 60 galaxies with h-beta detected above5-sigma. the balmer decrements indicate an average extinction ofa(h-alpha)=0.7^{+1.4}_{-0.7} mag. we find that the balmer decrementsystematically increases with higher h-alpha luminosities and with largerstellar masses, in agreement with previous studies with sparser samples. wefind that the sfrs estimated from modeling the spectral energy distribution(sed) is reliable---we derived an "intrinsic" h-alpha luminosity which is thenreddened assuming the color excess from sed modeling. the sed-predicted h-alphaluminosity agrees with h-alpha narrow-band measurements over 3 dex (rms of 0.25dex). we then use the sed sfrs to test different statistically-based dustcorrections for h-alpha and find that adopting one magnitude of extinction isinappropriate: galaxies with lower luminosities are less reddened. we find thatthe luminosity-dependent dust correction of hopkins et al. yields consistentresults over 3 dex (rms of 0.3 dex). our comparisons are only possible byassuming that stellar reddening is roughly half of nebular reddening. thestrong correspondence argue that with sed modeling, we can derive reliableintrinsic sfrs even in the absence of h-alpha measurements at z~0.5.

1202.1044	kinematics and excitation of the ram pressure stripped ionized gas  filaments in the coma cluster of galaxies	we present the results of deep imaging and spectroscopic observations of veryextended ionized gas (eig) around four member galaxies of the coma cluster ofgalaxies: rb199, ic4040, gmp2923 and gmp3071. the eigs were serendipitouslyfound in an h-alpha narrow band imaging survey of the central region of thecoma cluster. the relative radial velocities of the eigs with respect to thesystemic velocities of the parent galaxies from which they emanate increasealmost monotonically with the distance from the nucleus of the respectivegalaxies, reaching -400 - -800 km/s at around 40 - 80 kpc from the galaxies.the one-sided morphologies and the velocity fields of the eigs are consistentwith the predictions of numerical simulations of ram pressure stripping. wefound a very low-velocity filament (v_rel = -1300 km/s) at the southeasternedge of the disk of ic4040. some bright compact knots in the eigs of rb199 andic4040 exhibit blue continuum and strong h-alpha emission. the equivalentwidths of the h-alpha emission exceed 200 a, and are greater than 1000 a forsome knots. the emission line intensity ratios of the knots are basicallyconsistent with those of sub-solar abundance hii regions. these facts indicatethat intensive star formation occurs in the knots. some filaments, includingthe low velocity filament of the ic4040 eig, exhibit shock-like emission linespectra, suggesting that shock heating plays an important role in ionizationand excitation of the eigs.

1203.1326	discovery of a protocluster at z~6	we report the discovery of a protocluster at z~6 containing at least eightcluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide-fieldimage of the subaru deep field (sdf). the overdensity of the protocluster issignificant at the 6 sigma level, based on the surface number density ofi'-dropout galaxies. the overdense region covers ~36 sq. arcmin, and includes30 i'-dropout galaxies. follow-up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these arereal z~6 galaxies (5.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.3). eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrowredshift range centered at z=6.01, corresponding to a seven-fold increase innumber density over the average in redshift space. we found no significantdifference in the observed properties, such as ly-alpha luminosities and uvcontinuum magnitudes, between the eight protocluster members and the sevennon-members. the velocity dispersion of the eight protocluster members is 647km/s, which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standardcold dark matter model. this discrepancy could be attributed to thedistinguishing three-dimensional distribution of the eight protoclustermembers. we discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy: either theprotocluster is already mature, with old galaxies at the center, or it is stillimmature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster. ineither case, this concentration of z=6.01 galaxies in the sdf may be one of thefirst sites of formation of a galaxy cluster in the universe.

1205.5366	the galaxy luminosity functions down to m_r=-10 in the coma cluster	we derived the luminosity function (lf) of dwarf galaxies in the coma clusterdown to m_r=-10 at three fields located at the center, intermediate, andoutskirt. the lf (-19&lt;m_r&lt;-10) shows no significant differences among the threefields. it shows a clear dip at m_r\sim-13, and is composed of two distinctcomponents of different slopes; the bright component with -19&lt;m_r&lt;-13 has aflatter slope than the faint component with -13&lt;m_r&lt;-10 which has a steepslope. the bright component (-19&lt;m_r&lt;-13) consists of mostly red extendedgalaxies including few blue galaxies whose colors are typical of late-typegalaxies. on the other hand, the faint component (-13&lt;m_r&lt;-10) consists oflargely psf-like compact galaxies. we found that both these compact galaxiesand some extended galaxies are present in the center while only compactgalaxies are seen in the outskirt. in the faint component, the fraction of bluegalaxies is larger in the outskirt than in the center. we suggest that thedwarf galaxies in the coma cluster, which make up the two components in the lf,are heterogeneous with some different origins.

1206.4303	the stellar population and star formation rates of z~1.5-1.6 [o ii]  emitting galaxies selected from narrow-band emission-line surveys	we present the first detailed study of the stellar populations ofstar-forming galaxies at z~1.5, which are selected by their [o ii] emissionline, detected in narrow-band surveys. we identified ~1,300 [o ii] emitters atz=1.47 and z=1.62 in the subaru deep field with rest-frame ews above 13\aa.optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations for ~10% of our samplesshow that our separation of [o ii] from [o iii] emission-line galaxies intwo-color space is 99% successful. we analyze the multi-wavelength propertiesof a subset of ~1,200 galaxies with the best photometry. they have averagerest-frame ew of 45\aa, stellar mass of 3 x 10^9 m_sun, and stellar age of 100myr. in addition, our sed fitting and broad-band colors indicate that [o ii]emitters span the full range of galaxy populations at z~1.5. we also find that80% of [o ii] emitters are also photometrically classified as "bx/bm" (uv)galaxies and/or the star-forming "bzk" (near-ir) galaxies. our [o ii] emissionline survey produces a far more complete, and somewhat deeper sample of z~1.5galaxies than either the bx/bm or sbzk selection alone. we constructed averageseds and find that higher [o ii] ew galaxies have somewhat bluer continua. sedmodel-fitting shows that they have on average half the stellar mass of galaxieswith lower [o ii] ew. the observed [o ii] luminosity is well-correlated withthe far-uv continuum with a logarithmic slope slightly 0f 0.89\pm0.22. thescatter of the [o ii] luminosity against the far-uv continuum suggests that [oii] can be used as a sfr indicator with a reliability of 0.23 dex.

1210.4933	a ly-alpha emitter with an extremely large rest-frame equivalent width  of ~900a at z=6.5: a candidate of population iii-dominated galaxy?	we have identified a very interesting ly-alpha emitter, whose ly-alphaemission line has an extremely large observed equivalent width ofew_0=436^{+422}_{-149}a, which corresponds to an extraordinarily largeintrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0^{int}=872^{+844}_{-298}a afterthe average intergalactic absorption correction. the object wasspectroscopically confirmed to be a real ly-alpha emitter by its apparentasymmetric ly-alpha line profile detected at z=6.538. the continuum emission ofthe object was definitely detected in our deep z'-band image; thus, its ew_0was reliably determined. follow-up deep near-infrared spectroscopy revealedemission lines of neither he ii lambda1640 as an apparent signature ofpopulation iii, nor c iv lambda1549 as a proof of active nucleus. no detectionof short-lived he ii lambda1640 line is not necessarily inconsistent with theinterpretation that the underlying stellar population of the object isdominated by population iii. we found that the observed extremely large ew_0 ofthe ly-alpha emission and the upper limit on the ew_0 of the he ii lambda1640emission can be explained by population synthesis models favoring a very youngage less than 2-4myr and massive metal-poor (z&lt;10^{-5}) or even metal-freestars. the observed large ew_0 of ly-alpha is hardly explained by populationi/ii synthesis models with z&gt;10^{-3}. however, we cannot conclusively rule outthe possibility that this object is composed of a normal stellar populationwith a clumpy dust distribution, which could enhance the ly-alpha ew_0, thoughits significance is still unclear.

1303.0024	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6.  i. basic characteristics of the rest-frame uv continuum and lyman-alpha  emission	we present deep hst near-ir and spitzer mid-ir observations of a large sampleof spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6. the sample consists of 51lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at z ~ 5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16 lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) at 5.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.5. the near-ir images were mostly obtained withwfc3 in the f125w and f160w bands, and the mid-ir images were obtained withirac in the 3.6um and 4.5um bands. our galaxies also have deep optical imagingdata from subaru suprime-cam. we utilize the multi-band data and secureredshifts to derive their rest-frame uv properties. these galaxies have steepuv continuum slopes roughly between beta ~ -1.5 and -3.5, with an average valueof beta ~ -2.3, slightly steeper than the slopes of lbgs in previous studies.the slope shows little dependence on uv continuum luminosity except for a fewof the brightest galaxies. we find a statistically significant excess ofgalaxies with slopes around beta ~ -3, suggesting the existence of very youngstellar populations with extremely low metallicity and dust content. ourgalaxies have moderately strong rest-frame lyman-alpha equivalent width (ew) ina range of ~10 to ~200 \aa. the star-formation rates are also moderate, from afew to a few tens solar masses per year. the laes and lbgs in this sample sharemany common properties, implying that laes represent a subset of lbgs withstrong lyman-alpha emission. finally, the comparison of the uv luminosityfunctions between laes and lbgs suggests that there exists a substantialpopulation of faint galaxies with weak lyman-alpha emission (ew &lt; 20 \aa) thatcould be the dominant contribution to the total ionizing flux at z &gt;= 6.

1303.0027	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6.  ii. morphology of the rest-frame uv continuum and lyman-alpha emission	we present a detailed structural and morphological study of a large sample ofspectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6, using deep hst near-irbroad-band images and subaru optical narrow-band images. the galaxy sampleconsists of 51 lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at z ~ 5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at 5.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.5. these galaxies exhibit a widerange of rest-frame uv continuum morphology in the hst images, from compactfeatures to multiple component systems. the fraction of merging/interactinggalaxies reaches 40% ~ 50% at the brightest end of m_1500 &lt;= -20.5 mag. theintrinsic half-light radii r_{hl,in}, after correction for psf broadening, areroughly between r_{hl,in} ~ 0.05" (0.3 kpc) and 0.3" (1.7 kpc) at m_1500 &lt;=-19.5 mag. the median r_{hl,in} value is 0.16" (~0.9 kpc). this is consistentwith the sizes of bright laes and lbgs at z &gt;= 6 in previous studies. inaddition, more luminous galaxies tend to have larger sizes, exhibiting a weaksize-luminosity relation r_{hl,in} \propto l^{0.14} at m_1500 &lt;= -19.5 mag. theslope of 0.14 is significantly flatter than those in fainter lbg samples. wediscuss the morphology of z &gt;= 6 galaxies with nonparametric methods, includingthe cas system and the gini and m_20 parameters, and demonstrate their validitythrough simulations. we search for extended lyman-alpha emission halos aroundlaes at z ~ 5.7 and 6.5, by stacking a number of narrow-band images. we do notfind evidence of extended halos predicted by cosmological simulations. suchlyman-alpha halos, if they exist, could be weaker than predicted. finally, weinvestigate any positional misalignment between uv continuum and lyman-alphaemission in laes. while the two positions are generally consistent, severalmerging galaxies show significant positional differences. this is likely causedby a disturbed ism distribution due to merging activity.

1307.7712	"direct" gas-phase metallicities, stellar properties, and local  environments of emission-line galaxies at redshift below 0.90	using deep narrow-band (nb) imaging and optical spectroscopy from the kecktelescope and mmt, we identify a sample of 20 emission-line galaxies (elgs) atz=0.065-0.90 where the weak auroral emission line, [oiii]4363, is detected at&gt;3\sigma. these detections allow us to determine the gas-phase metallicityusing the "direct'' method. with electron temperature measurements and dustattenuation corrections from balmer decrements, we find that 4 of theselow-mass galaxies are extremely metal-poor with 12+log(o/h) &lt;= 7.65 orone-tenth solar. our most metal-deficient galaxy has 12+log(o/h) =7.24^{+0.45}_{-0.30} (95% confidence), similar to some of the lowestmetallicity galaxies identified in the local universe. we find that ourgalaxies are all undergoing significant star formation with average specificstar formation rate (sfr) of (100 myr)^{-1}, and that they have high centralsfr surface densities (average of 0.5 msun/yr/kpc^2. in addition, more thantwo-thirds of our galaxies have between one and four nearby companions within aprojected radius of 100 kpc, which we find is an excess among star-forminggalaxies at z=0.4-0.85. we also find that the gas-phase metallicities for agiven stellar mass and sfr lie systematically below the local m-z-(sfr)relation by \approx0.2 dex (2\sigma\ significance). these results are partlydue to selection effects, since galaxies with strong star formation and lowmetallicity are more likely to yield [oiii]4363 detections. finally, theobserved higher ionization parameter and electron density suggest that they arelower redshift analogs to typical z&gt;1 galaxies.

1311.5534	extended lyman-alpha emission from a high-z dla at z=3.115	we searched for star formation activity associated with high-z dampedlyman-alpha systems (dlas) with subaru telescope. we used a set of narrow-band(nb) filters whose central wavelengths correspond to the redshifted lyman-alphaemission lines of targeted dla absorbers at 3&lt;z&lt;4.5. we detected one apparentnb-excess object located 3.80 arcsec (~28kpc) away from the quasar sdssj031036.84+005521.7. follow-up spectroscopy revealed an asymmetric lyman-alphaemission at z_em=3.115+/-0.003, which perfectly matches the sub-dla trough atz_abs=3.1150 with logn(hi)/cm^-2=20.05. the lyman-alpha luminosity is estimatedto be l(lya)=1.07x10^42 erg s^-1, which corresponds to a star formation rate of0.97 m_\odot yr^-1. interestingly, the detected lyman-alpha emission isspatially extended with a sharp peak. the large extent of the lyman-alphaemission is remarkably one-sided toward the quasar line-of-sight, and isredshifted. the observed spatially asymmetric surface brightness profile can bequalitatively explained by a model of a dla host galaxy, assuming a galacticoutflow and a clumpy distribution of hi clouds in the circumgalactic medium.this large lyman-alpha extension, which is similar to those found in rauch etal.

1407.1851	a first site of galaxy cluster formation: complete spectroscopy of a  protocluster at $z=6.01$	we performed a systematic spectroscopic observation of a protocluster at$z=6.01$ in the subaru deep field. we took spectroscopy for all 53 $i'$-dropoutgalaxies down to $z'=27.09\,\mathrm{mag}$ in/around the protocluster region.from these observations, we confirmed that 28 galaxies are at $z\sim6$, ofwhich ten are clustered in a narrow redshift range of $\delta z&lt;0.06$. to tracethe evolution of this primordial structure, we applied the same $i'$-dropoutselection and the same overdensity measurements used in the observations to asemi-analytic model built upon the millennium simulation. we obtain a relationbetween the significance of overdensities observed at $z\sim6$ and thepredicted dark matter halo mass at $z=0$. this protocluster with $6\sigma$overdensity is expected to grow into a galaxy cluster with a mass of$\sim5\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$ at $z=0$. ten galaxies within$10\,\mathrm{comoving\&gt;mpc}$ of the overdense region can, with more than an 80%probability, merge into a single dark matter halo by $z=0$. no significantdifferences appeared in uv and ly$\alpha$ luminosities between the protoclusterand field galaxies, suggesting that this protocluster is still in the earlyphase of cluster formation before the onset of any obvious environmentaleffects. however, further observations are required to study other properties,such as stellar mass, dust, and age. we do find that galaxies tend to be inclose pairs in this protocluster. these pair-like subgroups will coalesce intoa single halo and grow into a more massive structure. we may witness an onsetof cluster formation at $z\sim6$ toward a cluster as seen in local universe.

0804.3448	overdensity of i'-dropout galaxies in the subaru deep field: a candidate  protocluster at z ~ 6	we investigate the sky distribution of z ~ 6 lyman break galaxies selected asi'-dropouts having i' - z' &gt; 1.45 down to z' &lt; 26.5 in the subaru deep field(sdf). we discover 37 i'-dropouts clustered in a projected comoving 21.6 x 21.6mpc^2 region at z = 6, showing a local density excess. carrying out follow-upspectroscopy, we identify four of them as lyman-alpha emitters at z = 5.92,6.01, 6.03 and 6.03 (spread over a distance of 46.6 mpc). the number density ofthe cluster itself in sdf is ~ 2.2 x 10^{-7} mpc^{-3}, smaller than those ofprotoclusters (i.e., forming galaxy clusters) at z ~ 2-5.7. also, the structureshows ~4-21 times larger galaxy number density than those of z ~ 6 galaxies ina general field. it has a mass of m ~ 1.5^{+1.8}_{-0.5} x 10^{15}m_sun,comparable to those of z ~ 0-5 protoclusters. since the contamination of oursample by interlopers is estimated to be quite low, 5.9%, most of the otherunconfirmed i'-dropouts in the overdense region can be also z ~ 6 galaxies.hence, it could be a candidate forming cluster at z ~ 6, representing aprogenitor of galaxy clusters seen in the recent-day universe.

1511.01519	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $z\ge6$.  iii. stellar populations from sed modeling with secure ly$\alpha$ emission  and redshifts	we present a study of stellar populations in a sample ofspectroscopically-confirmed lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) and ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) at $5.7&lt;z&lt;7$. these galaxies have deep optical and infrared images fromsubaru, $hst$, and $spitzer$/irac. we focus on a subset of 27 galaxies withirac detections, and characterize their stellar populations utilizing galaxysynthesis models based on the multi-band data and secure redshifts. byincorporating nebular emission estimated from the observed ly$\alpha$ flux, weare able to break the strong degeneracy of model spectra between young galaxieswith prominent nebular emission and older galaxies with strong balmer breaks.the results show that our galaxies cover a wide range of ages from several to afew hundred million years (myr), and a wide range of stellar masses from$\sim10^8$ to $\sim10^{11}$ $m_{\odot}$. these galaxies can be roughly dividedinto an `old' subsample and a `young' subsample. the `old' subsample consistsof galaxies older than 100 myr, with stellar masses higher than $10^9$$m_{\odot}$. the galaxies in the `young' subsample are younger than $\sim$30myr, with masses ranging between $\sim10^8$ and $\sim3\times10^9$ $m_{\odot}$.both subsamples display a correlation between stellar mass and star-formationrate (sfr), but with very different normalizations. the average specific sfr(ssfr) of the `old' subsample is 3--4 gyr$^{-1}$, consistent with previousstudies of `normal' star-forming galaxies at $z\ge6$. the average ssfr of the`young' subsample is an order of magnitude higher, likely due to starburstactivity. our results also indicate little or no dust extinction in themajority of the galaxies, as already suggested by their steep rest-frame uvslopes. finally, laes and lbgs with strong ly$\alpha$ emission areindistinguishable in terms of age, stellar mass, and sfr.

1512.09208	giant h$\alpha$ nebula surrounding the starburst merger ngc 6240	we revealed the detailed structure of a vastly extended h$\alpha$-emittingnebula ("h$\alpha$ nebula") surrounding the starburst/merging galaxy ngc 6240by deep narrow-band imaging observations with the subaru suprime-cam. theextent of the nebula is $\sim$90 kpc in diameter and the total h$\alpha$luminosity amounts to $\approx 1.6 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the volumefilling factor and the mass of the warm ionized gas are$\sim$10$^{-4}$--10$^{-5}$ and $\sim$$5 \times 10^8$ $m_\odot$, respectively.the nebula has a complicated structure, which includes numerous filaments,loops, bubbles, and knots. we found that there is a tight spatial correlationbetween the h$\alpha$ nebula and the extended soft x-ray-emitting gas, both inlarge and small scales. the overall morphology of the nebula is dominated byfilamentary structures radially extending from the center of the galaxy. alarge-scale bi-polar bubble extends along the minor axis of the main stellardisk. the morphology strongly suggests that the nebula was formed by intenseoutflows - superwinds - driven by starbursts. we also found three bright knotsembedded in a looped filament of ionized gas that show head-tail morphologiesin both emission-line and continuum, suggesting close interactions between theoutflows and star forming regions. based on the morphology and surfacebrightness distribution of the h$\alpha$ nebula, we propose the scenario thatthree major episodes of starburst/superwind activities which were initiated$\sim$10$^2$ myr ago formed the extended ionized gas nebula of ngc 6240.

astro-ph;0108126	a shock-induced pair of superbubbles in the high-redshift powerful radio  galaxy mrc 0406-244	we present new optical spectroscopy of the high-redshift powerful radiogalaxy mrc 0406$-$244 at redshift of 2.429. we find that the two extensionstoward nw and se probed in the rest-frame ultraviolet image are heated mainlyby the nonthermal continuum of the active galactic nucleus. however, eachextension shows a shell-like morphology, suggesting that they are a pair ofsuperbubbles induced by the superwind activity rather than by the interactionbetween the radio jet and the ambient gas clouds. if this is the case, theintense starburst responsible for the formation of superbubbles could occur$\sim 1 \times 10^9$ yr ago. on the other hand, the age of the radio jets maybe of the order of $\sim 10^6$ yr, being much shorter than the starburst age.therefore, the two events, i.e., the starburst and the radio-jet activities,are independent phenomena. however, their directions of the expanding motionscould be governed by the rotational motion of the gaseous component in the hostgalaxy. this idea appears to explain the alignment effect of mrc 0406$-$244.

astro-ph;0110473	discovery of very extended emission-line region around the seyfert 2  galaxy ngc 4388	we found a very large, 35 kpc, emission-line region around the seyfert type 2galaxy ngc 4388, using deep narrow-band imaging with the prime focus camera(suprime-cam) of the subaru telescope. this region consists of many faint gasclouds or filaments, and extends northeastwards from the galaxy. the typicalh-alpha luminosity l(h-alpha) of the clouds is 10^37 erg s^-1, and the totall(h-alpha) of the region within 10 kpc from the nucleus is 2 x 10^38 erg s^-1,which corresponds to an ionized gas mass of 10^5 m_solar. the map of theemission-line intensity ratio i([oiii])/i(h-alpha) indicates that the inner (r&lt; 12 kpc) region of the veelr may be excited by nuclear ionizing radiation. theexcitation mechanism of the outer (r &gt; 12 kpc) region is unclear, but it islikely that the nuclear radiation is also a dominant source of its ionization.we discuss the origin of the ionized gas. two plausible origins of the gas inthe veelr are (i) the tidal debris resulting from a past interaction with agas-rich dwarf galaxy, i.e., a minor merger, or (ii) the interstellar medium ofngc 4388, stripped by the ram pressure of the hot intracluster medium of thevirgo cluster.

astro-ph;0209092	ero r1 in cl0939+4713 field - evidence for an s0-like galaxy at z \sim  1.5	we present further observations of the extremely red object eroj094258+4659.2, identified by \citet{iye00} as ero r1 in their deep images ofthe cluster a851. we estimate its redshift independently by eight-bandphotometric redshift determination and cross-correlation of a new h-bandspectrum with the optical spectra of local e/s0 galaxies, and conclude that itlies at $z \sim 1.5$. although its colors are consistent both with anelliptical galaxy and an s0 galaxy at that redshift, its elongated shape andexponential luminosity profile suggest the presence of an evolved stellar diskcomponent. we rule out the possibility that these properties are stronglyinfluenced by gravitational lensing by the foreground cluster, and thereforeconclude that this object is more likely to be an s0-like galaxy, rather than alensed elliptical. the h-band spectrum does not show strong h$\alpha$ emissionand the star formation rate therefore appears to be very modest. the presenceof such a galaxy with an apparently relaxed disk of stars at this high redshiftprovides a new and strong constraint on theoretical models which aim to explainthe formation and evolution of galaxies.

astro-ph;0209445	subaru deep survey iii. evolution of rest-frame luminosity functions  based on the photometric redshifts for a k'-band selected galaxy sample	we have constructed a very deep k'-selected multicolor bvriz'jk' sample of439 field galaxies. photometric redshifts for sample galaxies were estimated.the overall redshift distribution n(z) for the k'&lt;21.0 sample is consistentwith previous observations, and for the first time we derive the n(z) down tok'=24.0. after taking account of the dust extinction and selection effects ofthe sample, the observed n(z) distribution is well described with the plemodel, while the hierarchical galaxy formation model shows an apparentdeficiency of galaxies especially at z&gt;2. the photometric redshift and thebest-fit sed model evaluations allow the derivation of the rest-frame k', b,and uv(2000a) luminosity functions (lfs) and their evolutions. the rest-k' lfshows almost no evolution up to z=3, while the rest b lf shows mild luminosityevolution, and the rest uv lf shows strong luminosity evolution. this trendcorresponds to the evolution of the rest uv-k' color, which gets bluer withincreasing redshift. we also found that more massive galaxies are redder inthis rest-frame color in every epoch. the rest-uv lf of our k'-selectedgalaxies shows a much shallower faint end slope at z=3 than that of previousestimations for rest-uv selected lyman break galaxies. as a consequence, thecontribution to the global star formation rate of our k'-selected galaxies isabout 42% of that derived from the integration of lf of lyman break galaxies atz=3. this result suggests that a large fraction of the star formation ratedensity at z&gt;1.5 comes from the contribution from the faint (m_2000a&gt;-20) bluegalaxy population at high redshift universe that have not yet obviously beenidentified.

astro-ph;0509690	near-infrared search for c iv absorption counterparts along the  line-of-sights to pair quasars	we carried out a subaru and ukirt near infrared imaging survey for h-alphaemitting galaxies around two pair quasar systems (q0301-005/q0302-003 andq2343+125/q2344+125), and a triple quasar system (kp76/kp77/kp78). narrow bandnear infrared filters covering the h-alpha emission expected for galaxies atthe confirmed c iv absorption redshift toward the quasar systems were used forthis survey. these quasar pairs or triplet are separated at most by 17 arcmins(~5 h^-1 mpc in proper distance) from each other on the sky, and have common civ absorption lines at almost identical redshifts at z=2.24-2.43, whichsuggests there could be a mpc-scale absorbing systems such as a cluster, or agroup, of galaxies that cover all the line-of-sights to the pair/triplequasars. using narrow-band deep images, we detected five candidates for h-alphaemitting galaxies around two of the six fields, q2343+125 and q2344+125, whoseapparent star formation rates are, extremely high, 20-466 m_solar/year.however, all or most of them are not likely to be galaxies at the absorptionredshift but galaxies at lower redshift, because of their extreme brightness.in the fields of the other quasars, we detected no star-forming galaxies, nordid we find any number excess of galaxy counts around them. this no-detectionresults could be because the luminosities and star formation rates of galaxiesare lower than the detection limits of our observations (k' &gt; 21 and sfr &lt;1.8-240 h^-2 m_solar/year). they could be located outside of the observedfields by chance. otherwise, most c iv absorption lines could be ascribed notto cluster of galaxies, but to isolated star forming pockets far from brightgalaxies and could be analogous objects to weak mg ii absorbers.

astro-ph;0608512	luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies at z~4 and 5 in the subaru  deep field	we investigate the luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies (lbg) at z~4and 5 based on the optical imaging data obtained in the subaru deep fieldproject. three samples of lbgs in a contiguous 875 arcmin^2 area areconstructed. one consists of 3,808 lbgs at z~4 down to i'=26.85 selected withthe b-r vs r-i' diagram. the other two consist of 539 and 240 lbgs at z~5 downto z'=26.05 selected with two kinds of two-color diagrams: v-i' vs i'-z' andr-i' vs i'-z'. the adopted selection criteria are proved to be fairly reliableby spectroscopic observation. we derive the luminosity functions of the lbgs atrest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths down to m_{uv}=-19.2 at z~4 and m_{uv}=-20.3at z~5. we find clear evolution of the luminosity function over the redshiftrange of 0&lt;z&lt;6, which is accounted for by a sole change in the characteristicmagnitude, m^*. the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) density at z~4 and z~5 ismeasured from the luminosity functions. we examine the evolution of the cosmicsfr density and its luminosity dependence over 0&lt;z&lt;6. the sfr densitycontributed from brighter galaxies is found to change more drastically withcosmic time. the contribution from brighter galaxies has a sharp peak aroundz=3-4, while that from fainter galaxies evolves relatively mildly with a broadpeak at earlier epoch. combining the observed sfr density with the standardcold dark matter model, we compute the cosmic sfr per unit baryon mass in darkhaloes, i.e., the specific sfr. the specific sfr is found to scale withredshift as (1+z)^3 up to z~4, implying that the efficiency of star formationis on average higher at higher redshift in proportion to the cooling ratewithin dark haloes, while this is not simply the case at z&gt;4.

astro-ph;0609393	a galaxy at a redshift z = 6.96	when galaxy formation started in the history of the universe remains unclear.studies of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe, afterinitial cooling (following the big bang), was reheated and reionized by hotstars in newborn galaxies at a redshift in the range 6 &lt; z &lt; 14 (ref. 1).though several candidate galaxies at redshift z &gt; 7 have been identifiedphotometrically (refs 2,3), galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshiftshave been confined to z &lt; 6.6 (refs. 4-8). here we report a spectroscopicredshift of z = 6.96 (corresponding to just 750 myr after the big bang) for agalaxy whose spectrum clearly shows lyman-alpha emission at 9,682 a, indicatingactive star formation at a rate of about 10 m_sun/yr, where m_sun us the massof the sun. this demonstrates that galaxy formation was under way when theuniverse was only about 6 per cent of its present age. the number density ofgalaxies at z = 7 seems to be only 18-36 per cent of the density at z = 6.6.

astro-ph;0610846	the luminosity function and star formation rate between redshifts of  0.07 and 1.47 for narrow-band emitters in the subaru deep field	abridged: subaru deep field line-emitting galaxies in four narrow-bandfilters at low and intermediate redshifts are presented. broad-band colors,follow-up optical spectroscopy, and multiple nb filters are used to distinguishha, [o ii], and [o iii] emitters between redshifts of 0.07 and 1.47 toconstruct their luminosity functions (lfs). these lfs are derived down to faintmagnitudes, which allows for a more accurate determination of the faint endslope. with a large (n~200-900) sample for each redshift interval, a schechterprofile is fitted to each lf. prior to dust extinction corrections, the [o iii]and [o ii] lfs reported in this paper agree reasonably well with those ofhippelein et al. the z=0.08 ha lf, which reaches two orders of magnitudefainter than gallego et al., is steeper by 25%. this indicates that there aremore low luminosity star-forming galaxies for z&lt;0.1. the faint end slope \alphaand \phi_{\star} show a strong evolution with redshift while l_{\star} showlittle evolution. the evolution in \alpha indicates that low-luminositygalaxies have a stronger evolution compared to brighter ones. integrated starformation rate densities are derived via ha, [o iii], and [o ii] for0.07&lt;z&lt;1.47. a steep increase in the star-formation rate density, as a functionof redshift, is seen for 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9. for z&gt;1, the star-formation rate densitiesare more or less constant. the latter is consistent with previous uv and [o ii]measurements. below z&lt;0.4, the sfr densities are consistent with several ha, [oii], and uv measurements, but other measurements are a factor of two higher.for example, the z=0.066-0.092 ha lf agrees with those of jones &amp;bland-hawthorn, but at z=0.24 and 0.40, their number density is higher by afactor of two. this discrepancy can be explained by cosmic variance.

astro-ph;0701637	luminosity dependent clustering of star-forming bzk galaxies at redshift  2	we use the bzk color selection proposed by daddi et al. (2004) to obtain asample of 1092 faint star-forming galaxies (hereafter sbzks) from 180 arcmin^2in the subaru deep field. this sample represents star-forming galaxies at 1.4 &lt;z &lt; 2.5 down to k(ab)=23.2, which roughly corresponds to a stellar-mass limitof ~ 1 x 10^{10} msun. we measure the angular correlation function (acf) ofthese sbzks to be w(theta) = (0.58 +- 0.13) x theta["]^{-0.8} and translate theamplitude into the correlation length assuming a reasonable redshiftdistribution. the resulting value, r0 = 3.2^{+0.6}_{-0.7} h^{-1} mpc, suggeststhat our sbzks reside in haloes with a typical mass of 2.8 x 10^{11} msun.combining this halo mass estimate with those for brighter samples of kong etal. (2006), we find that the mass of dark haloes largely increases with kbrightness, a measure of the stellar mass. comparison with other galaxypopulations suggests that faint sbzks (k(ab)&lt;23.2) and lyman break galaxies atz ~ 2 are similar populations hosted by relatively low-mass haloes, whilebright sbzks (k(ab)&lt;21) reside in haloes comparable to or more massive thanthose of distant red galaxies and extremely red objects. using the extendedpress-schechter formalism, we predict that present-day descendants of haloeshosting sbzks span a wide mass range depending on k brightness, from lower thanthat of the milky way up to those of richest clusters.

astro-ph;0701661	results of monitoring the dramatically variable c iv mini-bal system in  the quasar hs 1603+3820	we present six new and two previously published high-resolution spectra ofthe quasar hs 1603+3820 (z_em = 2.542) taken over an interval of 4.2 years (1.2years in the quasar rest frame). the observations were made with thehigh-dispersion spectrograph on the subaru telescope and medium-resolutionspectrograph on the hobby-eberly telescope. the purpose was to study the narrowabsorption lines (nals). we use time variability as well as coverage fractionanalysis to separate intrinsic absorption lines, which are physically relatedto the quasar, from intervening absorption lines. by fitting models to the lineprofiles, we derive the parameters of the respective absorbers as a function oftime. only the mini-bal system at z_abs ~ 2.43 (v_off ~ 9,500 km/s) shows bothpartial coverage and time variability, although two nal systems possibly showevidence of partial coverage. we find that all the troughs of the mini-balsystem vary in concert and its total equivalent width variations resemble thoseof the coverage fraction. however, no other correlations are seen between thevariations of different model parameters. thus, the observed variations cannotbe reproduced by a simple change of ionization state nor by motion of ahomogeneous parcel of gas across the cylinder of sight. we propose that theobserved variations are a result of rapid continuum fluctuations, coupled withcoverage fraction fluctuations caused by a clumpy screen of variable opticaldepth located between the continuum source and the mini-bal gas. an alternativeexplanation is that the observed partial coverage signature is the result ofscattering of continuum photons around the absorber, thus the equivalent widthof the mini-bal can vary as the intensity of the scattered continuum changes.

astro-ph;0702377	high-redshift ly alpha emitters with a large equivalent width:  properties of i-dropout galaxies with an nb921-band depression in the subaru  deep field	we report new follow-up spectroscopy of i-dropout galaxies with an nb921-banddepression found in the subaru deep field. the nb921-depressed i-dropoutselection method is expected to select galaxies with large equivalent width lyalpha emission over a wide redshift range, 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5. two of four observedtargets show a strong emission line with a clear asymmetric profile, identifiedas ly alpha emitters at z=6.11 and 6.00. their rest-frame equivalent widths are153a and 114a, which are lower limits on the intrinsic equivalent widths.through our spectroscopic observations (including previous ones) ofnb921-depressed i-dropout galaxies, we identified 5 galaxies in total with arest-frame equivalent width larger than 100a at 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 out of 8 photometriccandidates, which suggests that the nb921-depressed i-dropout selection methodis possibly an efficient way to search for ly alpha emitters with a large lyalpha equivalent width, in a wider redshift range than usual narrow-band excesstechniques. by combining these findings with our previous observationalresults, we infer that the fraction of broad-band selected galaxies having arest-frame equivalent width larger than 100a is significantly higher at z~6(the cosmic age of ~1 gyr) than that at z~3 (~2 gyr), being consistent with theidea that the typical stellar population of galaxies is significantly youngerat z~6 than that at z~3. the nb921-depressed i-dropout galaxies may beinteresting candidates for hosts of massive, zero-metallicity population iiistars.

astro-ph;0703606	kinematic substructures in the coma cluster core as traced by  intracluster planetary nebulae	the coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yetthere is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. a sensitiveprobe of this evolution is the dynamics of intracluster stars, which areunbound from galaxies while the cluster forms, according to cosmologicalsimulations. with a new multi-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered atthe 8.2 m subaru telescope and focas, we can now detect and measure theline-of-sight velocities of the intracluster planetary nebulae which areassociated with the diffuse stellar population of stars, at 100 mpc distance.we detect significant velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field,centred on the coma x-ray cluster emission. one substructure ispresent at ~5000km/s, probably from infall of a galaxy group, while the main intraclusterstellar component moves at ~ 6500 km/s. hence the icpns associated with thediffuse light at the position of the msis field are not bound to the nearby cdgalaxy ngc 4874, whose radial velocity is ~ 700 km/s greater.

astro-ph;0703770	the kinematics of intracluster planetary nebulae and the on-going  subcluster merger in the coma cluster core	the coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yetthere is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. with a newmulti-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered at the 8.2 m subarutelescope and focas, we have detected and measured the line-of-sight velocitiesof 37 intracluster planetary nebulae associated with the diffuse stellarpopulation of stars in the coma cluster core, at 100 mpc distance. we detectclear velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field. a substructureis present at ~5000 km/s, probably from in-fall of a galaxy group, while themain intracluster stellar component is centered around ~6500 km/s, ~700 km/soffset from the nearby cd galaxy ngc 4874. the kinematics and morphology of theintracluster stars show that the cluster core is in a highly dynamicallyevolving state. in combination with galaxy redshift and x-ray data this arguesstrongly that the cluster is currently in the midst of a subcluster merger,where the ngc 4874 subcluster core may still be self-bound, while the ngc 4889subcluster core has probably dissolved. the ngc 4889 subcluster is likely tohave fallen into coma from the eastern a2199 filament, in a direction nearly inthe plane of the sky, meeting the ngc 4874 subcluster arriving from the west.the two inner subcluster cores are presently beyond their first and secondclose passage, during which the elongated distribution of diffuse light hasbeen created. we predict the kinematic signature expected in this scenario, andargue that the extended western x-ray arc recently discovered traces the arcshock generated by the collision between the two subcluster gas halos. anypreexisting cooling core region would have been heated by the subclustercollision.

astro-ph;9909063	probing the evolution of early-type galaxies using multi-colour number  counts and redshift distributions	we investigate pure luminosity evolution models for early-type (ellipticaland s0) galaxies (i.e., no number density change or morphology transition), andexamine whether these models are consistent with observed number counts in theb, i and k bands and redshift distributions of two samples of faint galaxiesselected in the i and k bands. the models are characterized by the starformation time scale $\tau_{sf}$ and the time $t_{gw}$ when galactic wind blowsin addition to several other conventional parameters. we find the single-burstmodel ($\tau_{sf}$=0.1 gyr and $t_{gw}$=0.353 gyr), which is known to reproducethe photometric properties of early-type galaxies in clusters, is inconsistentwith redshift distributions of early-type galaxies in the field environment dueto overpredictions of galaxies at $z\gsim1.4$ even with strong extinction whichis at work until $t_{gw}$. in order for dust extinction to be more effective,we change $\tau_{sf}$ and $t_{gw}$ as free parameters, and find that modelswith $\tau_{sf}\gsim0.5$ gyr and $t_{gw}&gt;1.0$ gyr can be made consistent withboth the observed redshift distributions and number counts, if we introducestrong extinction $(e(b-v)\geq1$ as a peak value). these results suggest thatearly-type galaxies in the field environment do not have the same evolutionaryhistory as described by the single-burst model.

0809.5100	star formation rates and metallicities of k-selected star forming  galaxies at z~2	we present spectroscopy of 15 star-forming bzk galaxies (sbzks) with k(ab)&lt;23in the subaru deep field, for which halpha and some other emission lines aredetected in 0.9 to 2.3 micron spectra with a resolution of r=500. using halphaluminosities, we obtain star formation rates (sfrs), and then specific sfrs(ssfrs) dividing sfrs by stellar masses, which are derived from sed fitting tobvri'z'k photometry. it is found that sbzks with higher stellar masses havelarger sfrs. a negative correlation is seen between stellar mass and ssfr,which is consistent with the previous results for z~2 galaxies. this impliesthat a larger growth of stellar mass occurs in less massive galaxies. inaddition, gas-phase oxygen abundances, 12+log(o/h), are derived from the ratioof nii(lambda 6584) to halpha using the n2 index method. we have found acorrelation between stellar mass and oxygen abundance in the sense that moremassive sbzks tend to be more metal rich, which is qualitatively consistentwith the relation for uv-selected z~2 galaxies. however, the metallicity of thesbzks is ~0.2 dex higher than that of uv-selected galaxies with similar stellarmasses, which is significant considering the small uncertainties. the sbzks inour sample have redder r-k colors than the uv-selected galaxies. this galaxycolor-dependence in the oxygen abundance may be caused by older or dustiergalaxies having higher metallicities at z~2.
