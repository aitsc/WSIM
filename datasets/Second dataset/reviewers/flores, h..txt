0901.0718	a forming, dust enshrouded disk at z=0.43: the first example of a late  type disk rebuilt after a major merger?	abreg: by combining hst/udf imagery with kinematics from vlt/giraffe wederive a physical model of distant galaxy j033245.11-274724.0 in a way similarto what can be done in the nearby universe. here we study the properties of adistant compact lirgs galaxy. given the photometric and spectro photometricaccuracies, we can decompose the galaxy in sub components and correct them forreddening. the galaxy is dominated by a dust enshrouded disk revealed by udfimagery. the disk radius is half that of the milky way and the galaxy have asfr=20mo/yr. morphology and kinematics show that gas and stars together spiralinwards rapidly to feed the disk and the central regions. a combined system ofa bar and two non rotating spiral arms regulates the material accretion,induces large sigma, with sigma larger than 100 km/s and redistributes theangular momentum (am). the detailed physical properties resemble to theexpectations from modeling a merger of two equal mass, gaseous rich galaxies,0.5 gyr after the merger. in its later evolution, this galaxy could become alate type galaxy which falls on the t-f relation, with an am mostly induced bythe orbital am of the merger.

0903.3961	the baryonic content and tully-fisher relation at z~0.6	[abr.] using the multi-integral-field spectrograph giraffe at vlt, weprevisouly derived the stellar-mass tully-fisher relation (smtfr) at z~0.6, andfound that the distant relation is systematically offset by roughly a factor oftwo toward lower masses. we extend the study of the evolution of the tfr byestablishing the first distant baryonic tfr. to derive gas masses in distantgalaxies, we estimate a gas radius and invert the schmidt-kennicutt law betweenstar formation rate and gas surface densities. we find that gas extends fartherout than the uv light from young stars, a median of ~30%. we present the firstbaryonic tfr (btfr) ever established at intermediate redshift and show that,within an uncertainty of +/-0.08 dex, the zeropoint of the btfr does not appearto evolve between z~0.6 and z=0. the absence of evolution in the btfr over thepast 6 gyr implies that no external gas accretion is required for distantrotating disks to sustain star formation until z=0 and convert most of theirgas into stars. finally, we confirm that the larger scatter found in thedistant smtfr, and hence in the btfr, is caused entirely by major mergers. thisscatter results from a transfer of energy from bulk motions in the progenitors,to random motions in the remnants, generated by shocks during the merging.shocks occurring during these events naturally explain the large extent ofionized gas found out to the uv radius in z~0.6 galaxies. all the resultspresented in this paper support the ``spiral rebuilding scenario'' of hammerand collaborators, i.e., that a large fraction of local spiral disks have beenreprocessed during major mergers in the past 8 gyr.

0903.3962	the hubble sequence: just a vestige of merger events?	abr: we investigate whether the hubble sequence can be reproduced by therelics of merger events. we verify that, at zmed=0.65, the abundant populationof anomalous starbursts is mainly linked to the local spirals. theirmorphologies are dominated by young stars and are related to their ionised-gaskinematics. we show that both morphologies and kinematics can be reproduced byusing gas modelling from barnes' (2002) study of major mergers. using ourmodelling to estimate the gas-to-stars transformation during a merger, weidentify the gas fraction in the progenitors to be generally above 50%. alldistant and massive starbursts can be distributed along a temporal sequencefrom the first passage to the nuclei fusion and then to the disk rebuildingphase. it confirms that the rebuilding spiral disk scenario is possibly animportant channel for the formation of present-day disks in spirals. becausehalf of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies and anomalouskinematics at zmed=0.65, they could indeed be in major mergers phases 6 gyrsago, and almost all at z~1. it is time now to study in detail the formation ofspiral disks and of their substructures, including bulge, disks, arms, bars,rings that may mainly originate from instabilities created during the lastmajor merger.

0904.1621	a surviving disk from a galaxy collision at z=0.4	spiral galaxies dominate the local galaxy population. disks are known to befragile with respect to collisions. thus it is worthwhile to probe under whichconditions a disk can possibly survive such interactions. we present a detailedmorpho-kinematics study of a massive galaxy with two nuclei,j033210.76--274234.6, at z=0.4. the morphological analysis reveals that theobject consists of two bulges and a massive disk, as well as a faint blue ring.combining the kinematics with morphology we propose a near-center collisionmodel to interpret the object. we find that the massive disk is likely to havesurvived the collision of galaxies with an initial mass ratio of ~4:1. then-body/sph simulations show that the collision possibly is a single-shot polarcollision with a very small pericentric distance of ~1 kpc and that the remnantof the main galaxy will be dominated by a disk. the results support the disksurvival hypothesis. the survival of the disk is related to the polar collisionwith an extremely small pericentric distance. with the help of n-body/sphsimulations we find the probability of disk survival is quite large regardlesswhether the two galaxies merge or not.

0906.2805	how was the hubble sequence 6 gyrs ago?	the way galaxies assemble their mass to form the well-defined hubble sequenceis amongst the most debated topic in modern cosmology. one difficulty is tolink distant galaxies to those at present epoch. we aim at establishing howwere the galaxies of the hubble sequence, 6 gyrs ago. we intend to derive apast hubble sequence that can be causally linked to the present-day one. weselected samples of nearby galaxies from the sdss and of distant galaxies fromthe goods survey. we verified that each sample is representative of galaxies.we further showed that the observational conditions necessary to retrieve theirmorphological classification are similar in an unbiased way. morphologicalanalysis has been done in an identical way for all galaxies in the two samples.we found an absence of number evolution for elliptical and lenticular galaxies,which strikingly contrasts with the strong evolution of spiral and peculiargalaxies. spiral galaxies were 2.3 times less abundant in the past, that isexactly compensated by the strong decrease by a factor 5 of peculiar galaxies.it strongly suggests that more than half of the present-day spirals hadpeculiar morphologies, 6 gyrs ago, and this has to be accounted by any scenarioof galactic disk evolution and formation. the past hubble sequence can be usedto test these scenarios as well as to test evolution of fundamental planes forspirals and bulges.

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

1001.2476	the wolf-rayet features and mass-metallicity relation of long-duration  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	aims. we have gathered optical spectra of 8 long-duration grb host galaxiesselected from the archival data of vlt/fors2. we investigated whether or notwolf-rayet (wr) stars can be detected in these grb host galaxies. we also triedto estimate the physical properties of grb host galaxies, such as metallicity.  methods. we identified the wr features in these spectra by fitting the wrbumps and wr emission lines in blue and red bumps. we also identified thesubtypes of the wr stars, and estimated the numbers of stars in each subtype,then calculated the wr/o star ratios. the (o/h) abundances of grb hosts wereestimated from both the electron temperature (te) and the metallicity-sensitivestrong-line ratio (r23), for which we have broken the r23 degeneracy. wecompared the environments of long-duration grb host galaxies with those ofother galaxies in terms of their luminosity (stellar mass)-metallicityrelations (lz, mz).  results. we detected the presence of wr stars in 5 grb host galaxies havingspectra with relatively high signal-to-noise ratios (s/n). in the comparison oflz, mz relations, it shows that grb hosts have lower metallicities than othersamples with comparable luminosity and stellar mass. the presence of wr starsand the observed high wr/o star ratio, together with low metallicity, supportthe core-collapsar model and implie the first stage of star formation in thehosted regions of grbs.

1002.2013	comparing six evolutionary population synthesis models through spectral  synthesis on galaxies	we compare six popularly used evolutionary population synthesis (eps) models(bc03, cb07, ma05, galev, grasil, vazdekis/miles) through fitting the fulloptical spectra of six representative types of galaxies (star-forming andcomposite galaxies, seyfert 2s, liners, e+a and early-type galaxies), which aretaken from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). throughout our paper, we usethe simple stellar populations (ssps) from each eps model and the softwarestarlight to do our fits. our main results are: using different eps models theresulted numerical values of contributed light fractions change obviously, eventhough the dominant populations are consistent. the stellar populationsynthesis does depend on the selection of age and metallicity, while it doesnot depend on the stellar evolution track much. the importance of youngpopulations decreases from star-forming, composite, seyfert 2, liner toearly-type galaxies, and e+a galaxies lie between composite galaxies andseyfert 2s in most cases. we conclude that different eps models do derivedifferent stellar populations, so that it is not reasonable to directly comparestellar populations estimated from different eps models. to get reliableresults, we should use the same eps model for the compared samples.

1004.4336	the star formation histories of red and blue low surface brightness disk  galaxies	we study the star formation histories (sfh) and stellar populations of 213red and 226 blue nearly face-on low surface brightness disk galaxies (lsbgs),which are selected from the main galaxy sample of sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release seven (dr7). we also want to compare the stellarpopulations and sfh between the two groups. the sample of both red and bluelsbgs have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in the spectral continua. we obtaintheir absorption-line indices (e.g. mg_2, h\delta_a), d_n(4000) and stellarmasses from the mpa/jhu catalogs to study their stellar populations and sfh.moreover we fit their optical spectra (stellar absorption lines and continua)by using the spectral synthesis code starlight on the basis of the templates ofsimple stellar populations (ssps). we find that red lsbgs tend to be relativelyolder, higher metallicity, more massive and have higher surface mass densitythan blue lsbgs. the d_n(4000)-h\delta_a plane shows that perhaps red and bluelsbgs have different sfh: blue lsbgs are more likely to be experiencing asporadic star formation events at the present day, whereas red lsbgs are morelikely to form stars continuously over the past 1-2 gyr. moreover, the fractionof galaxies that experienced recent sporadic formation events decreases withincreasing stellar mass. furthermore, two sub-samples are defined for both redand blue lsbgs: the sub-sample within the same stellar mass range of 9.5 &lt;=log(m_\star/m_\odot) &lt;= 10.3, and the surface brightness limiting sub-samplewith \mu_0(r) &lt;= 20.7 mag arcsec^{-2}. they show consistent results with thetotal sample in the corresponding relationships, which confirm that our resultsto compare the blue and red lsbgs are robust.

0704.2177	unravelling the morphologies of luminous compact galaxies using the  hst/acs goods survey	(abridged) luminous compact galaxies (lcgs) (m_b &lt; -20, r_{1/2} &lt; 4.5kpc andew_{0}(oii) &gt;15\aa) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxypopulations over the last ~8 gyr history of the universe. due to theirinherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of theirmorphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. in this work we use thehigh angular resolution imaging data, from the hst/acs goods survey, to studythe quantitative morphology of a complete sample of lcgs in the redshift range0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. we have derived structural parameters for a representativesample of 39 lcgs selected from the goods-s field, using full 2-dimensionalsurface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the fourfilters available. b-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphologicalclassification. we then use the rest frame b band bulge flux fraction (b/t) todetermine the morphological class of the galaxies. mergers were essentiallyidentified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensityin the rest frame b band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish themfrom hii regions. we derive the following morphological mix for our sample ofintermediate redshift lcgs: mergers: ~36%, disk dominated: ~22%, s0: ~20%,early types: ~7%, irr/tadpole: ~15%. we establish that our sample lcgs areintermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of log(m/m_{\odot})=10.32.we also derive dust enshrouded sfr values ranging from a few to ~65$m_{\odot}$/year using spitzer 24$\mu m$ data. we estimate a factor ~11 fall inthe comoving number density of blue lcgs from redshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 to thecurrent epoch. we finally discuss the evolutionary scenario of these lcgs whichmight give us some clues regarding their descendants in the local universe.

1202.4454	loops formed by tidal tails as fossil records of a major merger	many haloes of nearby disc galaxies contain faint and extended features,including loops, which are often interpreted as relics of satellite infall inthe main galaxy's potential well. in most cases, however, the residual nucleusof the satellite is not seen, although it is predicted by numericalsimulations. we test whether such faint and extended features can be associatedto gas-rich, major mergers, which may also lead to disc rebuilding and thus bea corner stone for the formation of spiral galaxies. using the treesph codegadget-2, we model the formation of an almost bulge-less galaxy similar to ngc5907 (b/t $\le$ 0.2) after a gas-rich major merger. we indeed find that 3:1major mergers can form features similar to the loops found in many galactichaloes, including in ngc 5907, and can reproduce an extended thin disc, abulge, as well as the pronounced warp of the gaseous disc. even though itremains difficult to fully cover the large volume of free parameters, thepresent modelling of the loops in ngc 5907 proves that they could well be theresult of a major merger. it has many advantages over the satellite infallscenario; e.g., it solves the problem of the visibility of the satelliteremnant, and it may explain some additional features in the ngc 5907 halo, aswell as some gas properties of this system. for orbital parameters derived fromcosmological simulations, the loops in ngc 5907 can be reproduced by majormergers (3:1 to 5:1) and possibly by intermediate mergers (5:1 to 12:1). themajor merger scenario thus challenges the minor merger one and could explainmany properties that haloes of spiral galaxies have in common, including theirred colours and the presence of faint extended features.

0711.0611	first detection of a minor merger a z~0.6	numerical simulations predict that minor mergers are an important channel forthe mass assembly of galaxies. however, minor mergers are relatively difficultto detect using imaging, especially at high redshift. while such events aremuch less violent than major mergers, they can nevertheless leave severalfeatures on the kinematical structures of remnant galaxies which could bedetected using 3d spectroscopy. we present the first direct detection of aminor merger in a z~0.6 galaxy. such events could indeed be good candidates toexplain the kinematics of perturbed rotating disks observed with giraffe atz~0.6. we present photometric and kinematical evidence of such an event in acombined analysis of three-band hst/acs imaging and vlt/giraffe 2d-kinematics.using these data, we are able to demonstrate that a minor merger of arelatively small satellite (mass ratio ~1:18) is occurring in this galaxy. wealso derive a total sfr ~21mo/yr. minor mergers could be one of the physicalprocesses explaining the kinematics of perturbed rotating disks, whichrepresent ~25% of emission line intermediate mass galaxies at z~0.6. 3dspectroscopy appears to be a very good tool to identify minor mergers indistant (and local) galaxies.

1205.5183	type ia supernova host galaxies as seen with ifu spectroscopy	(abridged) we used the wide-field ifu spectrograph pmas/ppak at the 3.5mtelescope of calar alto observatory to observe six nearby spiral galaxies thathosted sne ia. spatially resolved 2d maps of the properties of the ionized gasand the stellar populations were derived. five of the observed galaxies have anongoing star formation rate of 1-5 m_sun/yr and mean stellar population ages ~5gyr. the sixth galaxy shows no star formation and has an about 12 gyr oldstellar population. all galaxies have stellar masses larger than 2e+10 m_sunand metallicities above solar. four galaxies show negative radial metallicitygradients of the ionized gas up to -0.058 dex/kpc and one has nearly uniformmetallicity with a possible shallow positive slope. the stellar components showshallower negative metallicity gradients up to -0.03 dex/kpc. we find no clearcorrelation between the properties of the galaxy and those of the supernovae,which may be because of the small ranges spanned by the galaxy parameters.however, we note that the hubble residuals are on average positive whilenegative hubble residuals are expected for sne ia in massive hosts such as thegalaxies in our sample. in conclusion, ifu spectroscopy on 4-m telescopes is aviable technique for studying host galaxies of nearby sne ia. it allows one tocorrelate the supernova properties with the properties of their host galaxiesat the projected positions of the supernovae. our current sample of sixgalaxies is too small to draw conclusions about the sn ia progenitors orcorrelations with the galaxy properties, but the ongoing califa ifu survey willprovide a solid basis to exploit this technique more and improve ourunderstanding of sne ia as cosmological standard candles.

1206.0008	galaxy disks do not need to survive in the l-cdm paradigm: the galaxy  merger rate out to z~1.5 from morpho-kinematic data	about two-thirds of present-day, large galaxies are spirals such as the milkyway or andromeda, but the way their thin rotating disks formed remainsuncertain. observations have revealed that half of their progenitors, sixbillion years ago, had peculiar morphologies and/or kinematics, which excludethem from the hubble sequence. major mergers, i.e., fusions between galaxies ofsimilar mass, are found to be the likeliest driver for such strongpeculiarities. however, thin disks are fragile and easily destroyed by suchviolent collisions, which creates a critical tension between the observedfraction of thin disks and their survival within the l-cdm paradigm. here weshow that the observed high occurrence of mergers amongst their progenitors isonly apparent and is resolved when using morpho-kinematic observations whichare sensitive to all the phases of the merging process. this provides anoriginal way of narrowing down observational estimates of the galaxy mergerrate and leads to a perfect match with predictions by state-of-the-art l-cdmsemi-empirical models with no particular fine-tuning needed. these resultsimply that half of local thin disks do not survive but are actually rebuiltafter a gas-rich major merger occurring in the past nine billion years, i.e.,two-thirds of the lifetime of the universe. this emphasizes the need to studyhow thin disks can form in halos with a more active merger history thanpreviously considered, and to investigate what is the origin of the gasreservoir from which local disks would reform.

1207.2472	characterizing the red optical sky background fluctuations from  narrow-band imaging	the detection and characterization of the physical properties of very distantgalaxies will be one the prominent science case of all future extremely largetelescopes, including the 39m e-elt. multi-object spectroscopic instruments arepotentially very important tools for studying these objects, and in particularfiber-based concepts. however, detecting and studying such faint and distantsources will require subtraction of the sky background signal (i.e., between ohairglow lines) with an accuracy of ~1%. this requires a precise and accurateknowledge of the sky background temporal and spatial fluctuations. using fors2narrow-band filter imaging data, we are currently investigating what are thefluctuations of the sky background at ~9000a. we present preliminary results ofsky background fluctuations from this study over spatial scales reaching ~4arcmin, as well as first glimpses into the temporal variations of suchfluctuations over timescales of the order of the hour. this study (and othercomplementary on-going studies) will be essential in designing thenext-generation fiber-fed instruments for the e-elt.

1210.8150	califa, the calar alto legacy integral field area survey. ii. first  public data release	we present the first public data release of the califa survey. it consists ofscience-grade optical datacubes for the first 100 of eventually 600 nearby(0.005&lt;z&lt;0.03) galaxies, obtained with the integral-field spectrographpmas/ppak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the calar alto observatory. thegalaxies in dr1 already cover a wide range of properties in color-magnitudespace, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionization conditions. thisoffers the potential to tackle a variety of open questions in galaxy evolutionusing spatially resolved spectroscopy. two different spectral setups areavailable for each galaxy, (i) a low-resolution v500 setup covering the nominalwavelength range 3745-7500a with a spectral resolution of 6.0a (fwhm), and (ii)a medium-resolution v1200 setup covering the nominal wavelength range3650-4840a with a spectral resolution of 2.3a (fwhm). we present thecharacteristics and data structure of the califa datasets that should be takeninto account for scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the effectsof vignetting, bad pixels and spatially correlated noise. the data quality testfor all 100 galaxies showed that we reach a median limiting continuumsensitivity of 1.0x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 5635a and2.2x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 4500a for the v500 and v1200 setuprespectively, which corresponds to limiting r and g band surface brightnessesof 23.6mag/arcsec^2 and 23.4mag/arcsec^2, or an unresolved emission-line fluxdetection limit of roughly 1x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 and0.6x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, respectively. the median spatial resolution is3.7", and the absolute spectrophotometric calibration is better than 15%(1sigma). we also describe the available interfaces and tools that allow easyaccess to this first public califa data.

1304.1644	aperture corrections for disk galaxy properties derived from the califa  survey. balmer emission lines in spiral galaxies	this work investigates the effect of the aperture size on derived galaxyproperties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. we focus onsome indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiralgalaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. wehave used 104 spiral galaxies from the califa survey for which 2d spectroscopywith complete spatial coverage is available. from the 3d cubes we have derivedgrowth curves of the most conspicuous balmer emission lines (halpha, hbeta) forcircular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus afterremoving the underlying stellar continuum. we find that the halpha flux(f(halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radiusshowing low dispersion around the median value. from this analysis, we deriveaperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshiftintervals. once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, thef(halpha)/f(hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towardsthe absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. aperturecorrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval[0.3,2.5]r_50. finally, the halpha equivalent width (ew(halpha)) growth curveincreases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion forsmall apertures. this large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperturecorrections for this quantity. in addition, this result suggests thatseparating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed ew(halpha)through small apertures is likely to result in low ew(halpha) star-forminggalaxies begin classified as quiescent.

1304.2158	the mass-metallicity relation explored with califa: i. is there a  dependence on the star formation rate?	we present the results on the study of the global and local m-z relationbased on the first data available from the califa survey (150 galaxies). thissurvey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent ofeach galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separateindividual hii regions and/or aggregations. nearly $\sim$3000 individual hiiregions have been detected. the spectra cover the wavelength range between[oii]3727 and [sii]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise to derive the oxygenabundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. in addition, wehave computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surfacedensities), based on sdss photometric data. we explore the relations betweenthe stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.  we derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and thegas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one already reported inthe literature ($\sigma_{\delta{\rm log(o/h)}}=$0.07 dex). indeed, thisdispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for ouroxygen abundances. however, we do not find any secondary relation with thestar-formation rate, other than the one induced due to the primary relation ofthis quantity with the stellar mass. we confirm the result using the $\sim$3000individual hii regions, for the corresponding local relations.  our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, bothlocally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, like thatof gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. in essence,late-type/disk dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, witha behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneousrecycling/closed-box model.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1406.1190	the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at z~0.6: reinstating major  mergers	the relation between the star formation rate and the stellar mass ofstar-forming galaxies has been used to argue that major mergers cannot be themain driver of star formation. here, we re-examine these arguments using therepresentative images-cdfs sample of star-forming galaxies at z=0.4-0.75,taking advantage of their previously established classification intopre-fusion, fusion, and relaxing galaxy mergers. contrary to previous claims,we show there is no tension between the main sequence scatter and the averageduration of the fusion star formation rate sfr peak. we confirm previousestimates of the fraction of sfr due to morphologically-selected galaxies(~23%) or the sfr enhancement due to major merger during the fusion phase(~10%). however, galaxy mergers are not instantaneous processes, which impliesthat the total fraction of the sfr associated to galaxies undergoing majormergers must account for the three merger phases. when doing so, galaxiesinvolved in major mergers are found to represent 53-88% of the total sfr atz~0.6. the fraction of lirgs in the fusion phase is found to be in agreementwith the observed morphological fraction of lirgs without disks and with theobserved and expected major merger rates at z&lt;1.5.

0803.3002	images-iii: the evolution of the near-infrared tully-fisher relation  over the last 6 gyr	using the multi-integral field spectrograph giraffe at vlt, we have derivedthe k-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) at z~0.6 for a representative sample of65 galaxies with emission lines. we confirm that the scatter in the z~0.6 tfris caused by galaxies with anomalous kinematics, and find a positive and strongcorrelation between the complexity of the kinematics and the scatter that theycontribute to the tfr. considering only relaxed-rotating disks, the scatter,and possibly also the slope of the tfr, do not appear to evolve with z. wedetect an evolution of the k-band tfr zero point between z~0.6 and z=0, which,if interpreted as an evolution of the k-band luminosity of rotating disks,would imply that a brightening of 0.66+/-0.14 mag occurs between z~0.6 and z=0.any disagreement with the results of flores et al. (2006) are attributed toboth an improvement of the local tfr and the more detailed accurate measurementof the rotation velocities in the distant sample. most of the uncertainty canbe explained by the relatively coarse spatial-resolution of the kinematicaldata. because most rotating disks at z~0.6 are unlikely to experience furthermerging events, one may assume that their rotational velocity does not evolvedramatically. if true, our result implies that rotating disks observed at z~0.6are rapidly transforming their gas into stars, to be able to double theirstellar masses and be observed on the tfr at z=0. the rotating disks observedare indeed emission-line galaxies that are either starbursts or lirgs, whichimplies that they are forming stars at a high rate. thus, a significantfraction of the rotating disks are forming the bulk of their stars within 6 to8 gyr, in good agreement with former studies of the evolution of the m-zrelation.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

1409.8292	galaxy mass assembly with vlt &amp; hst and lessons for e-elt/mosaic	the fraction of distant disks and mergers is still debated, while3d-spectroscopy is revolutionizing the field. however its limited spatialresolution imposes a complimentary hst imagery and a robust analysis procedure.when applied to observations of images galaxies at z=0.4-0.8, it reveals thathalf of the spiral progenitors were in a merger phase, 6 billion year ago. theexcellent correspondence between methodologically-based classifications ofmorphologies and kinematics definitively probes a violent origin of diskgalaxies as proposed by hammer et al. (2005). examination of nearby galaxyoutskirts reveals fossil imprints of such ancient merger events, under the formof well organized stellar streams. perhaps our neighbor, m31, is the bestillustration of an ancient merger, which modeling in 2010 leads to predict thegigantic plane of satellites discovered by ibata et al.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

0808.1196	coupling moao with integral field spectroscopy: specifications for the  vlt and the e-elt	[abridged] we have developed an end-to-end simulation to specify the sciencerequirements of a moao-fed integral field spectrograph on either an 8m or 42mtelescope. our simulations re-scales observations of local galaxies or resultsfrom numerical simulations of disk or interacting galaxies. for the currentanalysis, we limit ourselves to a local disk galaxy which exhibits simplerotation and a simulation of a merger. we have attempted to generalize ourresults by introducing the simple concepts of "psf contrast" which is theamount of light polluting adjacent spectra which we find drives the smallest eeat a given spatial scale. the choice of the spatial sampling is driven by the"scale-coupling", i.e., the relationship between the ifu pixel scale and thesize of the features that need to be recovered by 3d spectroscopy in order tounderstand the nature of the galaxy and its substructure. because the dynamicalnature of galaxies are mostly reflected in their large-scale motions, arelatively coarse spatial resolution is enough to distinguish between arotating disk and a major merger. although we used a limited number ofmorpho-kinematic cases, our simulations suggest that, on a 42m telescope, thechoice of an ifu pixel scale of 50-75 mas seems to be sufficient. such a coarsesampling has the benefit of lowering the exposure time to reach a specificsignal-to-noise as well as relaxing the performance of the moao system. on theother hand, recovering the full 2d-kinematics of z~4 galaxies requires highsignal-to-noise and at least an ee of 34% in 150 mas (2 pixels of 75 mas).finally, we carried out a similar study at z=1.6 with a moao-fed spectrographfor an 8m, and find that at least an ee of 30% at 0.25 arcsec spatial samplingis required to understand the nature of disks and mergers.

astro-ph;0011218	luminous compact galaxies at intermediate redshifts: progenitors of  bulges of massive spirals ?	vlt spectra of 14 luminous compact galaxies (lcgs) reveal strong metallicabsorption line sytems as well as narrow and intense emission lines. their gasextinction is found to be large (av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision oftheir star formation rate (sfr) to an average value of ~ 40 mo/yr. largeextinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in onefield observed by iso. gas metal abundances in lcgs have about half the solarvalue. we argue that lcgs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.lcgs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-daybulges. as in present-day galactic bulges, lcg stars show a wide range ofabundances. thus, observing lcgs allows us to directly witness an importantstage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior tothat of the disk. the gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likelyto be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled outfrom interacting companion galaxies. some lcgs also show evidence for thebeginning of a disk formation. if the above scenario holds for most lcgs, weestimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulkof their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 gyr, atredshifts less than ~ 1. since they are heavily extincted, we predict their irluminosities to be relatively large, around lir = 10^11 lsun, i.e. near orslightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by iso in the sameredshift range. taking into account the integrated ir luminosity of the lcggalaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic sfrdensity in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1.

astro-ph;0112249	hidden star-formation in the cluster of galaxies abell 1689	at a redshift of 0.18, abell 1689 is so far the most distant cluster ofgalaxies for which substantial mid-infrared (mir) data have been published. wepresent here the follow-up optical photometric and spectroscopic observationswhich were used to study the individual properties of the galaxies members ofa1689. sources with a low [15 micron] / [6.75 micron] flux ratio typicallyconsist of luminous passive early-type galaxies while those with a high mircolor index are mainly luminous, blue, emission-line, morphologically disturbedspirals, i.e. the star-forming galaxies usually associated with the'butcher-oemler' effect. on the other hand, at least 30% of the 15 micronsources have optical counterparts showing no evidence of current star-formationactivity, while their 15 micron emission is most likely due to obscured starformation. we argue that the lw3 luminosity measured in the cluster members isa reliable tracer of the total infrared luminosity, l(ir). we derive from l(ir)a star-formation rate free of dust extinction, sfr(ir), which we compare withthat determined in the optical from the flux of the [oii] emission line,sfr(opt). the highest total star formation rates (11 msun/yr) and dustextinction are measured in those galaxies exhibiting in their optical spectruma signature of a dusty starburst. in contrast, none of the galaxies withpost-starburst optical spectra has been detected by isocam. we find a mediansfr(ir) of the lw3-detected galaxies of 2 msun/yr, that is ten times higherthan the median sfr(opt) of the [oii] detected galaxies. the ratiosfr(ir)/sfr(opt) is in fact very high, ranging between 10 and 100 forlw3-detected galaxies with [oii] emission. we conclude that a major part, atleast 90%, of the star formation activity taking place in abell 1689 is hidden.

(1999), no dramatic change of the bar frequencyis detected up to redshift ~0.8. the bar frequency of the distant spirals issimilar to (and may be higher than) the present-day spirals in the rest-frame$b$ band. we conclude that bar-driven secular evolution is not a majormechanism to drive morphological evolution of field galaxies, especially theirbulge formation, which is more likely related to multiple intense starformation episodes during which the galaxies appear as lirgs (hammer et al.2005).

astro-ph;0604461	detection of wolf-rayet stars in host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts  (grbs): are grbs produced by runaway massive stars ejected from high stellar  density regions ?	we have obtained deep spectroscopic observations of several nearby gamma-rayburst (grb) host galaxies revealing for the first time the presence ofwolf-rayet (wr) stars and numerous o stars located in rich and compact clustersor star forming regions. surprisingly, high spatial resolution imaging showsthat the grbs and the associated supernovae did not occur in these regions, butseveral hundreds of parsec away. considering various scenarios for grbprogenitors, we do not find any simple explanation of why they should bepreferentially born in regions with low stellar densities. all the examinedgrbs and associated sne have occurred 400 to 800 pc from very high densitystellar environments including large numbers of wr stars. such distances can betravelled through at velocities of 100 km/s or larger, assuming the travel timeto be the typical life time of wr stars. it leads us to suggest that grbprogenitors may be runaway massive stars ejected from compact massive starclusters. the ejection from such super star clusters may lead to a spin-up ofthese stars, producing the loss of the hydrogen and/or helium envelopes leadingto the origin of the type ibc supernovae associated with grbs. if this scenarioapplies tocd text/sc all grbs, it provides a natural explanation of the verysmall fraction of massive stars that emit a grb at the end of their life. analternative to this scenario could be a binary origin for grbs, but this stillrequires an explanation of why it would preferentially occur in low stellardensity regions.

astro-ph;0605642	the star formation history of luminous infrared galaxies	we constrain the past star formation histories of a sample of 25 distant(z~0.7) luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) detected with the mid infraredcameras isocam and mips onboard the iso and spitzer satellites.  we use high resolution vlt-fors2 spectroscopy in addition to a comprehensivelibrary of 200,000 model optical spectra to derive bayesian likelihoodestimates of the star formation histories of these galaxies based on theanalysis of balmer absorption lines and the 4000 a break.  the locus of distant lirgs in the diagram defined by hdelta_a and d4000 isroughly comparable to that of local lirgs observed with iras, suggesting thatno trend for an evolution is detected between the local and distant lirgs. weobtain similar results when using either the h8 or the h$\delta_a$ balmerabsorption-line indices in combination with d4000.  we compute a birthrate parameter (b=sfr/&lt;sfr&gt;) of 4\pm1, confirming that thedistant lirgs are currently experiencing a major phase of star formation. themost likely duration of the bursts is 0.10 gyr, during which the lirgs produce5-10 % of their current stellar mass. no evidence is found for successivestarbursts on the scale of a few times $10^7$ yr, such as those predicted bysome numerical simulations of major mergers. however, the large number densityof those galaxies suggest that they could experience between two and four lirgphases until the present epoch.

astro-ph;0607074	the oxygen abundance calibrations and n/o abundance ratios of ~40,000  sdss star-forming galaxies	using a large sample of 38,478 star-forming galaxies selected from the seconddata release of the sloan digital sky survey database (sdss-dr2), we deriveanalytical calibrations for oxygen abundances from severalmetallicity-sensitive emission-line ratios: [n ii]/h_alpha, [o iii]/[n ii], [nii]/[o ii], [n ii]/[s ii], [s ii]/h_alpha, and [o iii]/h_beta. this consistentset of strong-line oxygen abundance calibrations will be useful for futureabundance studies. among these calibrations, [n ii]/[o ii] is the best formetal-rich galaxies due to its independence on ionization parameter and lowscatter. dust extinction must be considered properly at first. thesecalibrations are more suitable for metal-rich galaxies (8.4&lt;12+log(o/h)&lt;9.3),and for the nuclear regions of galaxies. the observed relations are consistentwith those expected from the photoionization models of kewley &amp; dopita (2002).however, most of the observational data spread in a range of ionizationparameter q from 1*10^7 to 8*10^7 cm s^{-1}, corresponding to logu= -3.5 to-2.5, narrower than that suggested by the models. we also estimate the (n/o)abundance ratios of this large sample of galaxies, and these are consistentwith the combination of a "primary" and a dominant "secondary" components ofnitrogen.

astro-ph;0612152	531 new spectroscopic redshifts from the cdfs and a test on the  cosmological relevance of the goods-south field	(abbrev.) this paper prepares a series of papers analysing the intermediatemass galaxy evolution sequence (images) up to z=1. intermediate mass galaxies(mj &lt;=-20.3) are selected from the chandra deep field south (cdfs) for which weidentify a serious lack of spectroscopically determined redshifts..... we havespectroscopically identified 691 objects including 580 gal., 7 qsos, and 104stars. this study provides 531 new redshifts in the cdfs. it confirms thepresence of several large scale structures in the cdfs. to test the impact ofthese structures in the goods-south field, we ... compare the evolution ofrest-frame u, b, v and k galaxy luminosity densities to that derived from thecfrs. the cdfs field shows a significant excess of luminosity densities in thez=0.5-0.75 range, which increases with the wavelength, reaching up to 0.5 dexat 2.1 um. stellar mass and specific star formation evolutions might besignificantly affected by the presence of the peculiar large scale structuresat z= 0.668 and at z= 0.735, that contain a significant excess of evolved,massive galaxies when compared to other fields. this leads to a clear warningto results based on the cdfs/goods south fields, especially those related tothe evolution of red luminosity densities, i.e. stellar mass density andspecific star formation rate. photometric redshift techniques, when applied tothat field, are producing quantities which are apparently less affected bycosmic variance (0.25 dex at 2.1 um), however at the cost of the difficulty indisentangling between evolutionary and cosmic variance effects.

astro-ph;0701723	3d spectroscopy with vlt/giraffe - iv: angular momentum and dynamical  support of intermediate redshift galaxies	[abridged] one of the most outstanding problems related to numerical modelsof galaxy formation is the so-called ``angular momentum catastrophe''. we studythe evolution of the angular momentum from z~0.6 to z=0 to further ourunderstanding of the mechanisms responsible for the large angular momenta ofdisk galaxies observed today. this study is based on a complete sample of 32,0.4&lt;z&lt;0.75 galaxies observed with flames/giraffe at the vlt. their kinematicshad been classified as rotating disks, perturbed rotators, or complexkinematics .we have computed the specific angular momentum of disks (j_disk)and the dynamical support of rotating disks through the v/sigma ratio. to studyhow angular momentum can be acquired dynamically, we have compared theproperties of distant and local galaxies. we find that distant rotating diskshave essentially the same properties (j_disk and r_d) as local disks, whiledistant galaxies with more complex kinematics have a significantly higherscatter in the j_disk--v_max and r_d--v_max planes. on average, distantgalaxies show lower values of v/sigma than local galaxies. we foundobservational evidence for a non-linear random walk evolution of the angularmomentum in galaxies during the last 8 gyr. the evolution related to galaxieswith complex kinematics can be attributed to mergers. if galaxies observed atintermediate redshift are related to present-day spirals, then our results fitquite well with the ``spiral rebuilding'' scenario proposed by hammer et al.(2005)

astro-ph;0702585	the milky way: an exceptionally quiet galaxy; implications for the  formation of spiral galaxies	[abridged]we compare both the milky way and m31 galaxies to local externaldisk galaxies within the same mass range, using their relative locations in theplanes formed by v_flat versus m_k, j_disk, and the average fe abundance ofstars in the galaxy outskirts. we find, for all relationships, that the mw issystematically offset by ~ 1 sigma, showing a significant deficiency in stellarmass, in angular momentum, in disk radius and [fe/h] in the stars in itsoutskirts at a given v_flat. on the basis of their location in the m_k, v_flat,and r_d volume, the fraction of spirals like the mw is 7+/-1%, while m31appears to be a "typical'' spiral. our galaxy appears to have escaped anysignificant merger over the last ~10 gyrs which may explain why it is deficientby a factor 2 to 3 in stellar mass, angular momentum and outskirts metallicityand then, unrepresentative of the typical spiral. as with m31, most localspirals show evidence for a history shaped mainly by relatively recent merging.we conclude that the standard scenario of secular evolution is generally unableto reproduce the properties of most (if not all) spiral galaxies. however, theso-called "spiral rebuilding'' scenario proposed by hammer et al. 2005 isconsistent with the properties of both distant galaxies and of theirdescendants - the local spirals.

astro-ph;9612071	cfrs xiv: spectral properties of field galaxies up to z = 1	the spectral properties of more than 400 cfrs galaxies and their changes overthe redshift interval 0 - 1.3 are investigated. emission line intensities andequivalent widths for accessible lines have been measured, as well as continuumcolor indices based on 200a wide spectral regions. within the cfrs sample, thecomoving fraction of galaxies with significant emission lines (ew(oii) &gt; 15a)increases from ~13% locally to over 50% at z &gt; 0.5. the fraction of luminous (m_{b} &lt; -20) quiescent galaxies (those without [oii] 3727 emission) decreaseswith redshift from 53% at z = 0.3 to 23% at z &gt; 0.5, the latter fraction beingsimilar to that of early type galaxies at that redshift. there is considerableevidence in the data presented here that star formation increases from z = 0 toz &gt; 0.5 in disk galaxies. however, the absence of extremely blue colors and thepresence of significant balmer absorption suggests that the star formation isprimarily taking place over long periods of time, rather than inshort-duration, high-amplitude ``bursts''. there are several indications thatthe average metallicity and dust opacity were lower in emission-line galaxiesat high redshift than those typically seen in luminous galaxies locally. beyondz = 0.7, almost all the emission-line galaxies, including the most luminous (at1mu at rest) ones, have colors approaching those of present-day irregulargalaxies, and a third of them have indications (primarily from the strength ofthe 4000a break) of metallicities significantly less than solar (z &lt; 0.2z_{sun}).

astro-ph;9806184	follow up of the cfrs with hst, iso and vla: the cosmic star formation  rate as derived from the fir luminosity density	properties of cfrs field galaxies up to z=1 are discussed. estimations of thecosmic star formation rate (sfr) lead to serious problems if they not accountfor agn emissions and for light reemitted at ir wavelengths. deep isocam andvla photometries on one cfrs field have been performed. multi-wavelengthanalyses from uv to mid-ir and hence to radio allow us to classify sources fromtheir spectral energy distributions. this provides an estimation of the firluminosity density related to star formation. the deduced sfr density is freeof extinction effects and not contaminated by agn emissions. about 55+/-20% ofthe star formation at z&lt;=1 is related to fir emission. if a non truncatedsalpeter imf is adopted, the derived stellar mass formed from z=0 to z=1 seemstoo high when compared to the present day stellar mass.  an important fraction (30%) of the star formation at z=0.5-1 seems to berelated to the rapidly evolving population of compact/irr galaxies. largersystems found at z=1, show a slower evolution of their star formationproperties.

astro-ph;9811202	15um iso observations of a cfrs field: the cosmic sfr as derived from  uv, optical, mid-ir and radio photometry	the cfrs 1452+52 field has been deeply imaged with the infrared spaceobservatory (iso) using isocam through the lw3 filter (12-18um). careful dataanalysis and comparison to deep optical and radio data have allowed us togenerate a catalog of 78 15um sources with both radio and opticalidentifications. they are redder and lie at higher redshift than i-bandselected galaxies, with most of them being star-forming galaxies. we haveconsidered the galaxies detected at radio and 15$\mu$m wavelengths whichpotentially include all strong and heavily extincted starbursts, up to z=1.spectral energy distributions (sed) for each of the sources have been derivedusing deep radio, mid-ir, near-ir, optical and uv photometry. the sources werethen spectrally classified by comparing to seds of well known nearby galaxies.by deriving their fir luminosities by interpolation, we can estimate their starformation rate (sfr) in a way which does not depend sensitively on theextinction. 75% (-40%, +10%) of the star formation at $z \le 1$ is related toir emission and the global extinction is in the range av=0.5 -- 0.85. whileheavily extincted starbursts, with sfr in excess of 100 mo/yr constitute lessthan a percent of all galaxies, they contribute about 18% of the sfr densityout to z=1. their morphologies range from s0 to sab, and more than a third areinteracting systems. the sfr derived by fir fluxes is likely to be ~2.9 timeshigher than those previously estimated from uv fluxes. the derived stellar massformed since the redshift of 1 could be too high when compared to the presentday stellar mass density. this might be due to an imf in distant star-forminggalaxies different from the solar neighborhood one, or to an underestimate ofthe local stellar mass density.

0810.0272	images iv: strong evolution of the oxygen abundance in gaseous phases of  intermediate mass galaxies since z=0.8	intermediate mass galaxies (logm(msun)&gt;10) at z~0.6 are the likeliestprogenitors of the present-day numerous population of spirals. there is growingevidence that they have evolved rapidly since the last 6 to 8 gyr ago, andlikely have formed a significant fraction of their stellar mass, often showingperturbed morphologies and kinematics. we have gathered a representative sampleof 88 such galaxies and have provided robust estimates of their gas phasemetallicity. for doing so, we have used moderate spectral resolutionspectroscopy at vlt/fors2 with unprecedented high s/n allowing to remove biasescoming from interstellar absorption lines and extinction to establish robustvalues of r23=([oii]3727 + [oiii]4959,5007)/hbeta. we definitively confirm thatthe predominant population of z~0.6 starbursts and luminous ir galaxies (lirgs)are on average, two times less metal rich than the local galaxies at a givenstellar mass. we do find that the metal abundance of the gaseous phase ofgalaxies is evolving linearly with time, from z=1 to z=0 and after comparingwith other studies, from z=3 to z=0. combining our results with the reportedevolution of the tully fisher relation, we do find that such an evolutionrequires that ~30% of the stellar mass of local galaxies have been formedthrough an external supply of gas, thus excluding the close box model. distantstarbursts &amp; lirgs have properties (metal abundance, star formation efficiency&amp; morphologies) similar to those of local lirgs. their underlying physics islikely dominated by gas infall probably through merging or interactions. ourstudy further supports the rapid evolution of z~0.4-1 galaxies. gas exchangesbetween galaxies is likely the main cause of this evolution.

0811.3893	a forming disk at z~0.6: collapse of a gaseous disk or major merger  remnant?	[abridged] we present and analyze observations of j033241.88-274853.9 atz=0.6679, using multi-wavelength photometry and imaging with flames/giraffe 3dspectroscopy. j033241.88-274853.9 is found to be a blue, young (~320myr)stellar disk embedded in a very gas-rich (fgas=73-82% withlog(mstellar/mo)=9.45) and turbulent phase that is found to be rotating onlarge spatial scales. we identified two unusual properties ofj033241.88-274853.9. (1) the spatial distributions of the ionized gaseous andyoung stars show a strong decoupling; while almost no stars can be detected inthe southern part down to the very deep detection limit of acs/udf images,significant emission from the [oii] ionized gas is detected. (2) we detect anexcess of velocity dispersion in the southern part of j033241.88-274853.9 incomparison to expectations from a rotating disk model. we considered two diskformation scenarios, depending on the gaseous phase geometry. in the first one,we examined whether j033241.88-274853.9 could be a young rotating disk that hasbeen recently collapsed from a pre-existing, very gas-rich rotating disk. thisscenario requires two (unknown) additional assumptions to explain thedecoupling between the distribution of stars and gas and the excess of velocitydispersion in the same region. in a second scenario, we examine whetherj033241.88-274853.9 could be a merger remnant of two gas-rich disks. in thiscase, the asymmetry observed between the gas and star distributions, as well asthe excess of velocity dispersion, find a common explanation. shocks producedduring the merger in this region can be ionized easily and heat the gas whilepreventing star formation. this makes this scenario more satisfactory than thecollapse of a pre-existing, gas-rich rotating disk.
