0902.4669	dynamical chern-simons modified gravity i: spinning black holes in the  slow-rotation approximation	the low-energy limit of string theory contains an anomaly-cancelingcorrection to the einstein-hilbert action, which defines an effective theory:chern-simons (cs) modified gravity. the cs correction consists of the productof a scalar field with the pontryagin density, where the former can be treatedas a background field (non-dynamical formulation) or as an evolving field(dynamical formulation). many solutions of general relativity persist in themodified theory; a notable exception is the kerr metric, which has sparked asearch for rotating black hole solutions. here, for the first time, we find asolution describing a rotating black hole within the dynamical framework, andin the small-coupling/slow-rotation limit. the solution is axisymmetric andstationary, constituting a deformation of the kerr metric with dipole scalar"hair," whose effect on geodesic motion is to weaken the frame-dragging effectand shift the location of the inner-most stable circular orbit outwards(inwards) relative to kerr for co-rotating (counter-rotating) geodesics. wefurther show that the correction to the metric scales inversely with the fourthpower of the radial distance to the black hole, suggesting it will escape anymeaningful bounds from weak-field experiments. for example, using binary pulsardata we can only place an initial bound on the magnitude of the dynamicalcoupling constant of $\xi^{1/4} \lesssim 10^{4} {\textrm{km}}$. more stringentbounds will require observations of inherently strong-field phenomena.

0904.4501	extreme- and intermediate-mass ratio inspirals in dynamical chern-simons  modified gravity	[abridged] chern-simons (cs) modified gravity is a 4d effective theory thatdescends both from string theory and loop quantum gravity, and that correctsthe einstein-hilbert action by adding the product of a scalar field and theparity-violating, pontryagin density. in this theory, the gravitational fieldof spinning black holes is described by a modified kerr geometry whosemultipole moments deviate from the kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l =4. we investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational waveemission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive blackholes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. we use thesemi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of themassive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from amultipolar decomposition of the radiative field. the main cs corrections to thewaveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changesto the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulatingdephasing relative to the general relativistic case. we also explore thepropagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory.we find that, although this tensor has the same form as in general relativity,the energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through thestress-energy tensor of the cs scalar field. these balance laws could be usedto describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters,which in turn would enhance the dephasing effect. gravitational-waveobservations of intermediate- or extreme-mass ratio inspirals with advancedground detectors or with lisa could use such dephasing to test the dynamicaltheory to unprecedented levels.

0906.0313	post-circular expansion of eccentric binary inspirals: fourier-domain  waveforms in the stationary phase approximation	we lay the foundations for the construction of analytic expressions forfourier-domain gravitational waveforms produced by eccentric, inspiralingcompact binaries in a post-circular or small-eccentricity approximation. thetime-dependent, "plus" and "cross" polarizations are expanded in besselfunctions, which are then self-consistently re-expanded in a power series aboutzero initial eccentricity to eighth order. the stationary phase approximationis then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the fouriertransform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. we exemplify thisframework by considering newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in thepost-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase andamplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the fourier domainwaveform. such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiralmass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at thetime when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band. using the largestinitial eccentricity allowed by our approximations (e_0 &lt; 0.4), the mass reachis found to be enhanced up to factors of approximately 5 relative to that ofcircular binaries for advanced ligo, lisa, and the proposed einstein telescopeat a signal-to-noise ratio of ten. a post-newtonian generalization of the postcircular scheme is also discussed, which holds the promise to provide"ready-to-use" fourier-domain waveforms for data analysis of eccentricinspirals.

0907.0891	conformally curved binary black hole initial data including tidal  deformations and outgoing radiation	(abridged) by asymptotically matching a post-newtonian (pn) metric to twotidally perturbed schwarzschild metrics, we generate approximate initial data(in the form of a 4-metric) for a nonspinning black hole binary in a circularorbit. we carry out this matching through o(v^4) in the binary's orbitalvelocity v, so the resulting data are conformally curved. far from the holes,we use the appropriate pn metric that accounts for retardation, which weconstruct using the highest-order pn expressions available to compute thebinary's past history. the data set's uncontrolled remainders are thus o(v^5)throughout the timeslice; we also generate an extension to the data set thathas uncontrolled remainders of o(v^6) in the purely pn portion of the timeslice(i.e., not too close to the holes). the resulting data are smooth, since wejoin all the metrics together by smoothly interpolating between them. weperform this interpolation using transition functions constructed to avoidintroducing excessive additional constraint violations. due to their inclusionof tidal deformations and outgoing radiation, these data should substantiallyreduce the initial spurious ("junk") radiation observed in current simulationsthat use conformally flat initial data. such reductions in the nonphysicalcomponents of the initial data will be necessary for simulations to achieve theaccuracy required to supply advanced ligo and lisa with the templates necessaryfor parameter estimation.

0909.3328	fundamental theoretical bias in gravitational wave astrophysics and the  parameterized post-einsteinian framework	we consider the concept of fundamental bias in gravitational waveastrophysics as the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory ofgravity during the entire wave-generation and propagation regime. such anassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments andobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime wheretests are lacking. fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in thedetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to amischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about sourceevent rates and populations. we propose a remedy through the introduction ofthe parameterized post-einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancementof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-einsteinian parameters. theseparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templatesconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories ofgravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoreticalprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. as anexample, we construct parameterized post-einsteinian templates for the binarycoalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circularinspiral. the parametrized post-einsteinian framework should allow matchedfiltered data to select a specific set of post-einsteinian parameters without apriori assuming the validity of the former, thus either verifying generalrelativity or pointing to possible dynamical strong-field deviations.

0912.2736	constraining parity violation in gravity with measurements of  neutron-star moments of inertia	neutron stars are sensitive laboratories for testing general relativity,especially when considering deviations where velocities are relativistic andgravitational fields are strong. one such deviation is described by dynamical,chern-simons modified gravity, where the einstein-hilbert action is modifiedthrough the addition of the gravitational parity-violating pontryagin densitycoupled to a field. this four-dimensional effective theory arises naturallyboth in perturbative and non-perturbative string theory, loop quantum gravity,and generic effective field theory expansions. we calculate here chern-simonsmodifications to the properties and gravitational fields of slowly spinningneutron stars. we find that the chern-simons correction affects only thegravitomagnetic sector of the metric to leading order, thus introducingmodifications to the moment of inertia but not to the mass-radius relation. weshow that an observational determination of the moment of inertia to anaccuracy of 10%, as is expected from near-future observations of the doublepulsar, will place a constraint on the chern-simons coupling constant of\xi^{1/4} &lt; 5 km, which is at least three-orders of magnitude stronger than theprevious strongest bound.

1005.3310	testing gravitational parity violation with coincident gravitational  waves and short gamma-ray bursts	gravitational parity violation is a possibility motivated by particlephysics, string theory and loop quantum gravity. one effect of it is amplitudebirefringence of gravitational waves, whereby left and rightcircularly-polarized waves propagate at the same speed but with differentamplitude evolution. here we propose a test of this effect through coincidentobservations of gravitational waves and short gamma-ray bursts from binarymergers involving neutron stars. such gravitational waves are highly left orright circularly-polarized due to the geometry of the merger. usinglocalization information from the gamma-ray burst, ground-based gravitationalwave detectors can measure the distance to the source with reasonable accuracy.an electromagnetic determination of the redshift from an afterglow or hostgalaxy yields an independent measure of this distance. gravitational parityviolation would manifest itself as a discrepancy between these two distancemeasurements. we exemplify such a test by considering one specific effectivetheory that leads to such gravitational parity-violation, chern-simons gravity.we show that the advanced ligo-virgo network and all-sky gamma-ray telescopescan be sensitive to the propagating sector of chern-simons gravitational parityviolation to a level roughly two orders of magnitude better than currentstationary constraints from the lageos satellites.

1009.6013	extreme mass-ratio inspirals in the effective-one-body approach:  quasi-circular, equatorial orbits around a spinning black hole	we construct effective-one-body waveform models suitable for data analysiswith lisa for extreme-mass ratio inspirals in quasi-circular, equatorial orbitsabout a spinning supermassive black hole. the accuracy of our model isestablished through comparisons against frequency-domain, teukolsky-basedwaveforms in the radiative approximation. the calibration of eight high-orderpost-newtonian parameters in the energy flux suffices to obtain a phase andfractional amplitude agreement of better than 1 radian and 1 % respectivelyover a period between 2 and 6 months depending on the system considered. thisagreement translates into matches higher than 97 % over a period between 4 and9 months, depending on the system. better agreements can be obtained if alarger number of calibration parameters are included. higher-order mass ratioterms in the effective-one-body hamiltonian and radiation-reaction introducephase corrections of at most 30 radians in a one year evolution. thesecorrections are usually one order of magnitude larger than those introduced bythe spin of the small object in a one year evolution. these results suggestthat the effective-one-body approach for extreme mass ratio inspirals is a goodcompromise between accuracy and computational price for lisa data analysispurposes.

1010.1721	the effect of massive perturbers on extreme mass-ratio inspiral  waveforms	extreme mass ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass object merges with asupermassive black hole, are prime sources for space-based gravitational wavedetectors because they will facilitate tests of strong gravity and probe thespacetime around rotating compact objects. in the last few years of suchinspirals, the total phase is in the millions of radians and details of thewaveforms are sensitive to small perturbations. we show that one potentiallydetectable perturbation is the presence of a second supermassive black holewithin a few tenths of a parsec. the acceleration produced by the perturber onthe extreme mass-ratio system produces a steady drift that causes the waveformto deviate systematically from that of an isolated system. if the perturber isa few tenths of a parsec from the extreme-mass ratio system (plausible in asmany as a few percent of cases) higher derivatives of motion might also bedetectable. in that case, the mass and distance of the perturber can be derivedindependently, which would allow a new probe of merger dynamics.

1011.3281	superkicks in ultrarelativistic encounters of spinning black holes	we study ultrarelativistic encounters of two spinning, equal-mass black holesthrough simulations in full numerical relativity. two initial data sequencesare studied in detail: one that leads to scattering and one that leads to agrazing collision and merger. in all cases, the initial black hole spins lie inthe orbital plane, a configuration that leads to the so-called "superkicks". inastrophysical, quasicircular inspirals, such kicks can be as large as ~3,000km/s; here, we find configurations that exceed ~15,000 km/s. we find that themaximum recoil is to a good approximation proportional to the total amount ofenergy radiated in gravitational waves, but largely independent of whether amerger occurs or not. this shows that the mechanism predominantly responsiblefor the superkick is not related to merger dynamics. rather, a consistentexplanation is that the "bobbing" motion of the orbit causes an asymmetricbeaming of the radiation produced by the in-plane orbital motion of the binary,and the net asymmetry is balanced by a recoil. we use our results to formulatesome conjectures on the ultimate kick achievable in any black hole encounter.

1012.3144	effective gravitational wave stress-energy tensor in alternative  theories of gravity	the inspiral of binary systems in vacuum is controlled by the stress-energyof gravitational radiation and any other propagating degrees of freedom. forgravitational waves, the dominant contribution is characterized by an effectivestress-energy tensor at future null infinity. we employ perturbation theory andthe short-wavelength approximation to compute this stress-energy tensor in awide class of alternative theories. we find that this tensor is generally amodification of that first computed by isaacson, where the corrections candominate over the general relativistic term. in a wide class of theories,however, these corrections identically vanish at asymptotically flat, future,null infinity, reducing the stress-energy tensor to isaacson's. we exemplifythis phenomenon by first considering dynamical chern-simons modified gravity,which corrects the action via a scalar field and the contraction of the riemanntensor and its dual. we then consider a wide class of theories with dynamicalscalar fields coupled to higher-order curvature invariants, and show that thegravitational wave stress-energy tensor still reduces to isaacson's. thecalculations presented in this paper are crucial to perform systematic tests ofsuch modified gravity theories through the orbital decay of binary pulsars orthrough gravitational wave observations.

1206.4316	resonant post-newtonian eccentricity excitation in hierarchical  three-body systems	we study the secular, hierarchical three-body problem to first-order in apost-newtonian expansion of general relativity. we expand the first-orderpost-newtonian hamiltonian to leading-order in the ratio of the semi-major axisof the two orbits. in addition to the well-known terms that correspond to thegr precession of the inner and outer orbits, we find a new secularpost-newtonian interaction term that can affect the long-term evolution of thetriple. we explore the parameter space for highly inclined and eccentricsystems, where the kozai-lidov mechanism can produce large-amplitudeoscillations in the eccentricities. the standard lore, i.e., that generalrelativity effects suppress eccentricity, is only consistent with the parts ofphase space where the general relativity timescales are several orders ofmagnitude shorter than the secular newtonian one. in other parts of phasespace, however, post-newtonian corrections combined with the three body ones,can excite eccentricities. in particular, for systems where the generalrelativity timescale is comparable to the secular newtonian timescales, thethree-body interactions give rise to a resonant-like eccentricity excitation.furthermore, for triples with a comparable-mass inner binary, where theeccentric kozai-lidov mechanism is suppressed, post-newtonian corrections canfurther increase the eccentricity and lead to orbital flips even when thetimescale of the former is much longer than the timescale of the secularkozai-lidov quadrupole perturbations.

1206.6130	slowly rotating black holes in dynamical chern-simons gravity:  deformation quadratic in the spin	we derive a stationary and axisymmetric black hole solution to quadraticorder in the spin angular momentum. the previously found, linear-in-spin termsmodify the odd-parity sector of the metric, while the new corrections appear inthe even-parity sector. these corrections modify the quadrupole moment, as wellas the (coordinate-dependent) location of the event horizon and the ergoregion.although the linear-in-spin metric is of petrov type d, the quadratic orderterms render it of type i. the metric does not possess a second-order killingtensor or a carter-like constant. the new metric does not possess closedtimelike curves or spacetime regions that violate causality outside of theevent horizon. the new, even-parity modifications to the kerr metric decay lessrapidly at spatial infinity than the leading-order in spin, odd-parity ones,and thus, the former are more important when considering black holes that arerotating moderately fast. we calculate the modifications to the hamiltonian,binding energy and kepler's third law. these modifications are crucial for theconstruction of gravitational wave templates for black hole binaries, whichwill enter at second post-newtonian order, just like dissipative modificationsfound previously.

1211.1686	tidal heating and torquing of a kerr black hole to next-to-leading order  in the tidal coupling	we calculate the linear vacuum perturbations of a kerr black hole surroundedby a slowly-varying external spacetime to third order in the ratio of theblack-hole mass to the radius of curvature of the external spacetime. thisexpansion applies to two relevant physical scenarios: (i) a small kerr blackhole immersed in the gravitational field of a much larger external black hole,and (ii) a kerr black hole moving slowly around another external black hole ofcomparable mass. this small-hole/slow-motion approximation allows us toparametrize the perturbation through slowly-varying, time-dependent electricand magnetic tidal tensors, which then enables us to separate the teukolskyequation and compute the newman-penrose scalar analytically to third order inour expansion parameter. we obtain generic expressions for the mass and angularmomentum flux through the perturbed black hole horizon, as well as the rate ofchange of the horizon surface area, in terms of certain invariants constructedfrom the electric and magnetic tidal tensors. we conclude by applying theseresults to the two scenarios described above.

0712.1028	perturbations of schwarzschild black holes in chern-simons modified  gravity	we study perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole in chern-simons modifiedgravity. we begin by showing that birkhoff's theorem holds for a wide family ofchern-simons coupling functions, a scalar field present in the theory thatcontrols the strength of the chern-simons correction to the einstein-hilbertaction. after decomposing the perturbations in spherical harmonics, we studythe linearized modified field equations and find that axial and polar modes arecoupled, in contrast to general relativity. the divergence of the modifiedequations leads to the pontryagin constraint, which forces the vanishing of thecunningham-price-moncrief master function associated with axial modes. weanalyze the structure of these equations and find that the appearance of thepontryagin constraint yields an overconstrained system that does not allow forgeneric black hole oscillations. we illustrate this situation by studying thecase characterized by a canonical choice of the coupling function andpure-parity perturbative modes. we end with a discussion of how to extendchern-simons modified gravity to bypass the pontryagin constraint and thesuppression of perturbations.

1301.2627	stealth bias in gravitational-wave parameter estimation	inspiraling binaries of compact objects are primary targets for current andfuture gravitational-wave observatories. waveforms computed in generalrelativity are used to search for these sources, and will probably be used toextract source parameters from detected signals. however, if a different theoryof gravity happens to be correct in the strong-field regime, source-parameterestimation may be affected by a fundamental bias: that is, by systematic errorsinduced due to the use of waveforms derived in the incorrect theory. if thedeviations from general relativity are not large enough to be detectable ontheir own and yet these systematic errors remain significant (i.e., larger thanthe statistical uncertainties in parameter estimation), fundamental bias cannotbe corrected in a single observation, and becomes stealth bias. in this articlewe develop a scheme to determine in which cases stealth bias could be presentin gravitational-wave astronomy. for a given observation, the answer depends onthe detection signal-to-noise ratio and on the strength of the modified-gravitycorrection. as an example, we study three representative stellar-mass binarysystems that will be detectable with second-generation ground-basedobservatories. we find that significant systematic bias can occur whether ornot modified gravity can be positively detected, for correction strengths thatare not currently excluded by any other experiment. thus, stealth bias may be ageneric feature of gravitational-wave detections, and it should be consideredand characterized, using expanded models such as the parametrized post-einsteinframework, when interpreting the results of parameter-estimation analyses.

0712.2542	a gravitational-wave probe of effective quantum gravity	the green-schwarz anomaly-cancelling mechanism in string theories requires achern-simons term in the einstein-hilbert action, which leads to an amplitudebirefringence of spacetime for the propagation of gravitational waves. whilethe degree of birefringence may be intrinsically small, its effects on agravitational wave will accumulate as the wave propagates. the proposed laserinterferometer space antenna (lisa) will be sensitive enough to observe thegravitational waves from sources at cosmological distances great enough thatinteresting bounds on the chern-simons may be found. here we evaluate theeffect of a chern-simons induced spacetime birefringence to the propagation ofgravitational waves from such systems. we find that gravitational waves from incoalescing binary black hole system are imprinted with a signature ofchern-simons gravity. this signature appears as a time-dependent change in theapparent orientation of the binary's orbital angular momentum with respect tothe observer line-of-sight, with the change magnitude reflecting the integratedhistory of the chern-simons coupling over the worldline of a radiationwavefront. while spin-orbit coupling in the binary system will also lead to anevolution of the system's orbital angular momentum, the time dependence andother details of this \emph{real} effect are different than the \emph{apparent}effect produced by chern-simons birefringence, allowing the two effects to beseparately identified.

1303.1185	gravitational wave tests of strong field general relativity with binary  inspirals: realistic injections and optimal model selection	we study generic tests of strong-field general relativity using gravitationalwaves emitted during the inspiral of compact binaries. previous studies haveconsidered simple extensions to the standard post-newtonian waveforms thatdiffer by a single term in the phase. here we improve on these studies by (i)increasing the realism of injections and (ii) determining the optimal waveformfamilies for detecting and characterizing such signals. we construct waveformsthat deviate from those in general relativity through a series ofpost-newtonian terms, and find that these higher-order terms can affect ourability to test general relativity, in some cases by making it easier to detecta deviation, and in some cases by making it more difficult. we find that simplesingle-phase post-einsteinian waveforms are sufficient for detecting deviationsfrom general relativity, and there is little to be gained from using morecomplicated models with multiple phase terms. the results found here will helpguide future attempts to test general relativity with advanced ground-baseddetectors.

1303.1528	i-love-q relations in neutron stars and their applications to  astrophysics, gravitational waves and fundamental physics	the exterior gravitational field of a slowly-rotating neutron star can becharacterized by its multipole moments, the first few being the neutron starmass, moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment to quadratic order in spin. inprinciple, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internalstructure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energydensities. we here find relations between the moment of inertia, the lovenumbers and the quadrupole moment (i-love-q relations) that do not dependsensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. three importantconsequences derive from these i-love-q relations. on an observationalastrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the i-love-q triowould automatically provide information about the other two, even when thelatter may not be observationally accessible. on a gravitational wave front,the i-love-q relations break the degeneracy between the quadrupole moment andthe neutron-star spins in binary inspiral waveforms, allowing second-generationground-based detectors to determine the (dimensionless) averaged spin to$\mathcal{o}(10)%$, given a sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratio detection.on a fundamental physics front, the i-love-q relations allow for tests ofgeneral relativity in the neutron-star strong-field that are both theory- andinternal structure-independent. as an example, by combining gravitational-waveand electromagnetic observations, one may constrain dynamical chern-simonsgravity in the future by more than 6 orders of magnitude more stringently thansolar system and table-top constraints.

1311.4898	mis-modelling in gravitational wave astronomy: the trouble with  templates	waveform templates are a powerful tool for extracting and characterizinggravitational wave signals, acting as highly restrictive priors on the signalmorphologies that allow us to extract weak events buried deep in theinstrumental noise. the templates map the waveform shapes to physicalparameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions forthese parameters. however, there are attendant dangers in using highlyrestrictive signal priors. if strong field gravity is not accurately describedby general relativity (gr), then using gr templates may result in fundamentalbias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detectsignals. here we study such dangers, concentrating on three distinctpossibilities. first, we show that there exist modified theories compatiblewith all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the ligo/virgonetwork using searches based on gr templates, but which would be detected usinga one parameter post-einsteinian extension. second, we study modified theoriesthat produce departures from gr that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency,producing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterizedpost-einsteinian (ppe) scheme. we show that even the simplest ppe templates arestill capable of picking up these strange signals and diagnosing a departurefrom gr. third, we study whether using inspiral-only ppe waveforms for signalsthat include merger and ringdown can lead to problems in misidentifying a grdeparture. we present an easy technique that allows us to self-consistentlyidentify the inspiral portion of the signal, and thus remove these potentialbiases, allowing gr tests to be performed on higher mass signals that mergewithin the detector band. we close by studying a parameterized waveform modelthat may allow us to test gr using the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal.

1311.7144	constraints on einstein-\ae ther theory and horava gravity from binary  pulsar observations	binary pulsars are ideal to test the foundations of general relativity, suchas lorentz symmetry, which requires that experiments produce the same resultsin all free-falling (i.e.inertial) frames. we here break this symmetry in thegravitational sector by specifying a preferred time direction, and thus apreferred frame, at each spacetime point. we then examine the consequences ofthis gravitational lorentz symmetry breaking in the orbital evolution of binarypulsars, focusing on the dissipative effects. we find that lorentz symmetrybreaking modifies these effects, and thus the orbital dynamics, in twodifferent ways. first, it generically causes the emission of dipolar radiation,which makes the orbital separation decrease faster than in general relativity.second, the quadrupole component of the emission is also modified. the orbitalevolution depends critically on the sensitivities of the stars, which measurehow their binding energies depend on the motion relative to the preferredframe. we calculate the sensitivities numerically and compute the predictedorbital decay rate of binary pulsars in lorentz-violating gravity. by testingthese predictions against observations, we place very stringent constraints ongravitational lorentz violation.

1403.6243	effective no-hair relations for neutron stars and quark stars:  relativistic results	astrophysical charge-free black holes are known to satisfy no-hair relationsthrough which all multipole moments can be specified in terms of just theirmass and spin angular momentum. we here investigate the possible existence ofno-hair-like relations among multipole moments for neutron stars and quarkstars that are independent of their equation of state. we calculate themultipole moments of these stars up to hexadecapole order by constructinguniformly-rotating and unmagnetized stellar solutions to the einsteinequations. for slowly-rotating stars, we construct stellar solutions to quarticorder in spin in a slow-rotation expansion, while for rapidly-rotating stars,we solve the einstein equations numerically with the lorene and rns codes. wefind that the multipole moments extracted from these numerical solutions areconsistent with each other. we confirm that the current-dipole is related tothe mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of state independent fashion,which does not break for rapidly rotating neutron stars or quark stars. wefurther find that the current-octupole and the mass-hexadecapole moments arerelated to the mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of stateindependent way to $\sim 10%$, worsening in the hexadecapole case. all of ourfindings are in good agreement with previous work that considered stellarsolutions to leading-order in a weak-field expansion. the quartic in spin,slowly-rotating solutions found here allow us to estimate the systematic errorsin the measurement of the neutron star's mass and radius with future x-rayobservations, such as nicer and loft. we find that the effect of thesequartic-in-spin terms on the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments and stellareccentricity may dominate the error budget for very rapidly-rotating neutronstars. the new universal relations found here should help to reduce suchsystematic errors.

1404.0092	a parametrized post-einsteinian framework for gravitational wave bursts	the population of stellar-mass, compact object binaries that merge withnon-negligible eccentricity may be large enough to motivate searches withground-based gravitational wave detectors. such events could be exceptionallaboratories to test general relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime,as a larger fraction of the energy is emitted at high-velocities, compared toquasi-circular inspirals. a serious obstacle here, however, is the challenge ofcomputing theoretical waveforms for eccentric systems with the requisiteaccuracy for use in a matched-filter search. the corresponding waveforms aremore a sequence of concentrated bursts of energy emitted near periapse than acontinuous waveform. based on this, an alternative approach, stacking excesspower over the set of time-frequency tiles coincident with the bursts, wasrecently suggested as a more practical (though sub-optimal) detection strategy.the leading-order "observable" that would be inferred from such a detectionwould be a sequence of discrete numbers characterizing the position and size ofeach time-frequency tile. in general relativity, this (possibly large) sequenceof numbers is uniquely determined by the small set of parameters describing thebinary at formation. in this work, following the spirit of the parameterizedpost-einsteinian framework developed for quasi-circular inspiral, we propose asimple, parameterized deformation of the baseline general relativistic burstalgorithm for eccentric inspiral events that would allow for model-independenttests of einstein's theory in this high-velocity, strong-field regime.

1404.3180	detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from compact  binary inspirals with analytical double-precessing templates	we study the performance of various analytical frequency-domain templates fordetection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from spin-precessing,quasi-circular, compact binary inspirals. we begin by assessing the extent towhich non-spinning, spin-aligned, and the new (analytical, frequency-domain,small-spin) double-precessing frequency-domain templates can be used to detectsignals from such systems. for effective, dimensionless spin values above$0.2$, the use of non-spinning or spin-aligned templates for detection purposeswill result in a loss of up to $30%$ of all events, while in the case of thedouble-precessing model, this never exceeds $6%$. moreover, even for signalsfrom systems with small spins, non-spinning and spin-aligned templatesintroduce large biases in the extracted masses and spins. the use of a modelthat encodes spin-induced precession effects, such as the double-precessingmodel, improves the mass and spin extraction by up to an order of magnitude.the additional information encoded in the spin-orbit interaction is invaluableif one wishes to extract the maximum amount of information from gravitationalwave signals.

0803.1853	accuracy of the post-newtonian approximation: optimal asymptotic  expansion for quasi-circular, extreme-mass ratio inspirals	we study the accuracy of the post-newtonian (pn) approximation and its formalregion of validity, by investigating its optimal asymptotic expansion for thequasi-circular, adiabatic inspiral of a point particle into a schwarzschildblack hole. by comparing the pn expansion of the energy flux to numericalcalculations in the perturbative teukolsky formalism, we show that (i) theinclusion of higher multipoles is necessary to establish the accuracy ofhigh-order pn terms, and (ii) the region of validity of pn theory is largest atrelative o(1/c^6) (3pn order). the latter result suggests that the seriesdiverges beyond 3pn order, at least in the extreme mass-ratio limit, probablydue to the appearance of logarithmic terms in the energy flux. the studypresented here is a first formal attempt to determine the region of validity ofthe pn approximation using asymptotic analysis. therefore, it should serve as atemplate to perform similar studies on other systems, such as comparable-massquasi-circular inspirals computed by high-accuracy numerical relativisticsimulations.

1406.7135	toward realistic and practical no-hair relations for neutron stars in  the non-relativistic limit	the gravitational properties of astrophysical objects depend sensitively ontheir internal structure. in newtonian theory, the gravitational potential of arotating star can be fully described by an infinite number of multipole momentsof its mass distribution. recently, this infinite number of moments foruniformly-rotating stars were shown semi-analytically to be expressible interms of just the first three: the mass, the spin, and the quadrupole moment ofthe star. the relations between the various lower multipole moments wereadditionally shown to depend weakly on the equation of state, when consideringneutron stars and assuming single polytropic equations of state. here we extendthis result in two ways. first, we show that the universality also holds forrealistic equations of state, thus relaxing the need to use single polytropes.second, we derive purely analytical universal relations by perturbing theequations of structure about an $n=0$ polytrope that reproduce semi-analyticresults to $\mathcal{o}(1\%)$. we also find that the linear-order perturbationvanishes in some cases, which provides further evidence and a deeperunderstanding of the universality.

1406.7587	why i-love-q	black holes are said to have no hair because all of their multipole momentscan be expressed in terms of just their mass, charge and spin angular momentum.the recent discovery of approximately equation-of-state-independent relationsamong certain multipole moments in neutron stars suggests that they are alsoapproximately bald. we here explore the yet unknown origin for thisuniversality. first, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interiorand of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. we findthat the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupolemoment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of thetotal radius, which corresponds to the density range$(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. second, we study the impact on the universalityof approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. ananalytical calculation in the newtonian limit reveals that the shape of theellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing theself-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. third, we investigate theeccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that theellipticity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly (20-30)% in theregion that matters to the universal relations. fourth, we repeat the aboveanalysis for non-compact, regular stars and find that the ellipticity is notconstant, with variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost.these findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximatesymmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from non-compactstar region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation insidestars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensitycontours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exteriormultipole moments.

1407.7038	projected constraints on scalarization with gravitational waves from  neutron star binaries	certain scalar-tensor theories have the property of endowing stars withscalar hair, sourced either by the star's own compactness (spontaneousscalarization) or, for binary systems, by the companion's scalar hair (inducedscalarization) or by the orbital binding energy (dynamical scalarization).scalarized stars in binaries present different conservative dynamics than ingeneral relativity, and can also excite a scalar mode in the metricperturbation that carries away dipolar radiation. as a result, the binary orbitshrinks faster than predicted in general relativity, modifying the rate ofdecay of the orbital period. in spite of this, scalar-tensor theories can passexisting binary pulsar tests, because observed pulsars may not be compactenough or sufficiently orbitally bound to activate scalarization. gravitationalwaves emitted during the last stages of compact binary inspirals are thus idealprobes of scalarization effects. for the standard projected sensitivity ofadvanced ligo, we here show that, if neutron stars are sufficiently compact toenter the detector's sensitivity band already scalarized, then gravitationalwaves could place constraints at least comparable to binary pulsars. if thestars dynamically scalarize while inspiraling in band, then constraints arestill possible provided the scalarization occurs sufficiently early in theinspiral, roughly below an orbital frequency of 50hz. in performing thesestudies, we derive an easy-to-calculate data analysis measure, an integratedphase difference between a general relativistic and a modified signal, thatmaps directly to the bayes factor so as to determine whether a modified gravityeffect is detectable. finally, we find that custom-made templates are equallyeffective as model-independent, parameterized post-einsteinian waveforms atdetecting such modified gravity effects at realistic signal-to-noise ratios.

1408.3406	accurate and efficient waveforms for compact binaries on eccentric  orbits	compact binaries that emit gravitational waves in the sensitivity band ofground-based detectors can have non-negligible eccentricities just prior tomerger, depending on the formation scenario. we develop a purely analytic,frequency-domain model for gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries onorbits with small eccentricity, which reduces to the quasi-circularpost-newtonian approximant taylorf2 at zero eccentricity and to thepost-circular approximation of yunes et al. (2009) at small eccentricity. ourmodel uses a spectral approximation to the (post-newtonian) kepler problem tomodel the orbital phase as a function of frequency, accounting for eccentricityeffects up to ${\cal{o}}(e^8)$ at each post-newtonian order. our approachaccurately reproduces an alternative time-domain eccentric waveform model foreccentricities $e\in [0, 0.4]$ and binaries with total mass less than 12 solarmasses. as an application, we evaluate the signal amplitude that eccentricbinaries produce in different networks of existing and forthcominggravitational waves detectors. assuming a population of eccentric systemscontaining black holes and neutron stars that is uniformly distributed inco-moving volume, we estimate that second generation detectors like advancedligo could detect approximately 0.1-10 events per year out to redshift $z\sim0.2$, while an array of einstein telescope detectors could detect hundreds ofevents per year to redshift $z \sim 2.3$.

1412.4132	projected constraints on lorentz-violating gravity with gravitational  waves	gravitational waves are excellent tools to probe the foundations of generalrelativity in the strongly dynamical and non-linear regime. one such foundationis lorentz symmetry, which can be broken in the gravitational sector by theexistence of a preferred time direction, and thus, a preferred frame at eachspacetime point. this leads to a modification in the orbital decay rate ofbinary systems, and also in the generation and chirping of their associatedgravitational waves. we here study whether waves emitted in the late,quasi-circular inspiral of non-spinning, neutron star binaries can placecompetitive constraints on two proxies of gravitational lorentz-violation:einstein-\ae{}ther theory and khronometric gravity. we model the waves in thesmall-coupling (or decoupling) limit and in the post-newtonian approximation,by perturbatively solving the field equations in small deformations fromgeneral relativity and in the small-velocity/weak-gravity approximation. weassume a gravitational wave consistent with general relativity has beendetected with second- and third-generation, ground-based detectors, and withthe proposed space-based mission, decigo, with and without coincidentelectromagnetic counterparts. without a counterpart, a detection consistentwith general relativity of neutron star binaries can only place competitiveconstraints on gravitational lorentz violation when using future,third-generation or space-based instruments. on the other hand, a singlecounterpart is enough to place constraints that are 10 orders of magnitude morestringent than current binary pulsar bounds, even when using second-generationdetectors. this is because lorentz violation forces the group velocity ofgravitational waves to be different from that of light, and this difference canbe very accurately constrained with coincident observations.

1502.04131	relating follicly-challenged compact stars to bald black holes	compact stars satisfy certain no-hair relations through which their multipolemoments are given by their mass, spin and quadrupole moment. these relationsare approximately independent of their equation of state, relating pressure todensity. such relations are similar to the black hole no-hair theorems, butthese possess event horizons inside which information that led to theirformation can hide. compact stars do not possess horizons, so whether theirno-hair relations are related to the black hole ones is unclear. we investigatehow the two relations are related by studying relations among multipole momentsfor compact stars with anisotropic pressure as a toy model, which allows suchstars to be more compact than those with isotropic pressure. we here shownumerically that the compact star no-hair relations approach the black holeones as the compactness approaches that of a black hole. we also proveanalytically that the current dipole moment exactly reaches the black holelimit quadratically in compactness as strongly-anisotropic stars approach theblack hole limit. we moreover show that compact stars become progressivelyoblate in this limit, even if prolate at low compactness due to stronganisotropies.

1507.02278	four-hair relations for differentially rotating neutron stars in the  weak-field limit	the opportunity to study physics at supra-nuclear densities through x-rayobservations of neutron stars has led to in-depth investigations of certainapproximately universal relations that can remove degeneracies in pulse profilemodels. one such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of aneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipoleand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation ofstate. these three-hair relations were found to hold in neutron stars thatrotate rigidly, as is the case in old pulsars, but neutron stars can alsorotate differentially, as is the case for proto-neutron stars and hypermassivetransient remnants of binary mergers. we here extend the three-hair relationsto differentially rotating stars for the first time with a generic rotation lawusing two approximations: a weak-field scheme (an expansion in powers of theneutron star compactness) and a perturbative differential rotation scheme (anexpansion about rigid rotation). these approximations allow us to analyticallyderive approximately universal relations that allow us to determine all of themultipole moments of a (perturbative) differentially rotating star in terms ofonly the first four moments. these new four-hair relations for differentiallyrotating neutron stars are found to be approximately independent of theequation of state to a higher degree than the three-hair relations foruniformly rotating stars. our results can be instrumental in the development offour-hair relations for rapidly differentially rotating stars in full generalrelativity using numerical simulations.

1508.02062	probing the internal composition of neutron stars with gravitational  waves	gravitational waves from neutron star binary inspirals contain informationabout the equation of state of supranuclear matter. in the absence ofdefinitive experimental evidence that determines the correct equation of state,a number of diverse models that give the pressure in a neutron star as functionof its density have been proposed. these models differ not only in theapproximations and techniques they use to solve the many-body schr\"odingerequation, but also in the neutron star composition they assume. we studywhether gravitational wave observations of neutron star binaries inquasicircular inspirals will allow us to distinguish between equations of stateof differing internal composition, thereby providing important informationabout the properties of extremely high density matter. we carry out a bayesianmodel selection analysis, and find that second generation gravitational wavedetectors can heavily constrain equations of state that contain only quarkmatter, but hybrid stars containing both normal and quark matter are harder todistinguish from normal matter stars. a gravitational wave detection with asignal-to-noise ratio of 30 and masses around $1.4m_{\odot}$ could eitherdetect or rule out strange quark stars with a 20 to 1 confidence. the presenceof kaon condensates or hyperons in neutron star inner cores cannot be easilyconfirmed. for example, for the equations of state studied in this paper, evena gravitational wave signal with a signal-to-noise ratio as high as 60 wouldnot allow us to claim a detection of kaon condensates or hyperons withconfidence greater than 5 to 1. on the other hand, if kaon condensates andhyperons do not form in neutron stars, a gravitational wave signal with similarsignal-to-noise ratio would be able to constrain their existence with an 11 to1 confidence for high-mass systems.

1510.02152	challenging the presence of scalar charge and dipolar radiation in  binary pulsars	corrections to general relativity that introduce long-ranged scalar fieldswhich are non-minimally coupled to curvature typically predict that neutronstars possess a non-trivial scalar field profile. an observer far from a staris most sensitive to the spherically-symmetric piece of this profile thatdecays linearly with the inverse of the distance, the so-called scalar charge,which is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binaries.the presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to very strongly constrainextended theories of gravity. these facts may lead people to believe thatgravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already beenconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. here we challenge this"lore" by investigating the decoupling limit of gauss-bonnet gravity as anexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the gauss-bonnet densityin the action. we prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannotpossess a scalar charge. thus gauss-bonnet gravity evades the strong binarypulsar constraints on dipole radiation. we discuss the astrophysical systemsyielding the best constraints on gauss-bonnet gravity and related quadraticgravity theories. to achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge forslowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. in generic case,either neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used toconstrain the theory, but gauss-bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binaryconstraints. however, black holes in gauss-bonnet gravity do anchor scalarcharge. the best constraints on gauss-bonnet gravity will thus come from blackhole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries. we estimatethese constraints to be ten times better than the current estimated bound, andalso include estimated constraints on generic quadratic gravity theories.

0807.2652	the barbero-immirzi parameter as a scalar field: k-inflation from loop  quantum gravity?	we consider a loop-quantum gravity inspired modification of generalrelativity, where the holst action is generalized by making the barbero-immirzi(bi) parameter a scalar field, whose value could be dynamically determined. themodified theory leads to a non-zero torsion tensor that corrects the fieldequations through quadratic first-derivatives of the bi field. such acorrection is equivalent to general relativity in the presence of a scalarfield with non-trivial kinetic energy. this stress-energy of this field isautomatically covariantly conserved by its own dynamical equations of motion,thus satisfying the strong equivalence principle. every general relativisticsolution remains a solution to the modified theory for any constant value ofthe bi field. for arbitrary time-varying bi fields, a study of cosmologicalsolutions reduces the scalar field stress-energy to that of a pressurelessperfect fluid in a comoving reference frame, forcing the scale factor dynamicsto be equivalent to those of a stiff equation of state. upon ultravioletcompletion, this model could provide a natural mechanism for k-inflation, wherethe role of the inflaton is played by the bi field and inflation is driven byits non-trivial kinetic energy instead of a potential.

astro-ph;0404434	universality of the subsolar mass distribution from critical  gravitational collapse	self-similarity induced by critical gravitational collapse is used as aparadigm to probe the mass distribution of subsolar objects. at large mass(solar mass and above) there is widespread agreement as to both the form andparameter values arising in the mass distribution of stellar objects. atsubsolar mass there is still considerable disagreement as to the qualitativeform of the mass distribution, let alone the specific parameter valuescharacterizing that distribution.  for the first time, the paradigm of critical gravitational collapse isapplied to several concrete astrophysical scenarios to derive robustqualitative features of the subsolar mass distribution. we further contrastthese theoretically derived ideas with the observational situation. inparticular, we demonstrate that at very low mass the distribution is given by apower law, with an exponent opposite in sign to that observed in the high-massregime. the value of this low-mass exponent is in principle calculable viadynamical systems theory applied to gravitational collapse. qualitativeagreement between theory, numerical experiments, and observational data isgood, though quantitative issues remain troublesome.

astro-ph;0608600	gravitational recoil from binary black hole mergers: the close-limit  approximation	[abridged] the coalescence of a binary black hole system is one of the mainsources of gravitational waves that present and future detectors will study.apart from the energy and angular momentum that these waves carry, forunequal-mass binaries there is also a net flux of linear momentum that impliesa recoil velocity of the resulting final black hole in the opposite direction.we present a computation of the recoil velocity based on the close-limitapproximation scheme, which gives excellent results for head-on and grazingcollisions of black holes when compared to full numerical relativisticcalculations. we obtain a maximum recoil velocity of ~ 64 km/s for a symmetricmass ratio eta = m_1 m_2/(m_1+m_2)^2 ~ 0.19 and an initial proper separation of4 m, where m is the total adm mass of the system. this separation is themaximum at which the close-limit approximation is expected to provide accurateresults. if we supplement this estimate with pn calculations up to theinnermost stable circular orbit, we obtain a lower bound for the recoilvelocity, with a maximum around 84 km/s. this is a lower bound because itneglects the initial merger phase. we can however obtain a rough estimate byusing pn methods or the close-limit approximation. since both methods are knownto overestimate the amount of radiation, we obtain in this way an upper boundfor the recoil with maxima in the range of 220-265 km/s. we also providenon-linear fits to these estimated upper and lower bounds. these estimates aresubject to uncertainties related to issues such as the choice of initial dataand higher effects in perturbation theory. nonetheless, our estimates areconsistent with previous results in the literature and suggest a narrower rangeof possible recoil velocities.

astro-ph;0611110	gravitational recoil velocities from eccentric binary black hole mergers	the formation and growth of supermassive black holes is a key issue to unveilthe secrets of galaxy formation. in particular, the gravitational recoilproduced in the merger of unequal mass black hole binaries could have a numberof astrophysical implications, such as the ejection of black holes from thehost galaxy or globular cluster. we present estimates of the recoil velocitythat include the effect of small eccentricities. the approach is speciallysuited for the last stage of the merger, where most of the emission of linearmomentum in gravitational waves takes place. supplementing our estimates withpost-newtonian approximations, we obtain lower and upper bounds that constrainprevious recoil velocities estimates as well as a best estimate that agreeswith numerical simulations in the quasi-circular case. for eccentricities e &lt;=0.1, the maximum recoil is found for mass ratios of m_1/m_2 ~ 0.38 with a bestestimate of ~ 167 (1 + e) km/s and upper and lower bounds of 79 (1 + e) km/sand 216 (1 + e) km/s respectively.

0811.0181	constraining effective quantum gravity with lisa	all modern routes leading to a quantum theory of gravity -- i.e.,perturbative quantum gravitational one-loop exact correction to the globalchiral current in the standard model, string theory, and perhaps even loopquantum gravity -- require supplementing the einstein-hilbert action with aparity-violating chern-simons term. such a term leads to amplitude-birefringentgravitational wave propagation: i.e., one (circular) polarization stateamplified with propagation while the other is attenuated. the proposed laserinterferometer space antenna (lisa) is capable of observing gravitational wavesources at cosmological distances, suggesting the possibility that lisaobservations may place a strong bound on this manifestation of quantum gravity.here we report on a calculation of the effect that spacetime amplitudebirefringence has on the signal lisa is capable of observing from inspiralingsupermassive black hole binaries at large redshift. we find that thebirefringence manifests itself in the observations as an anomalous precessionof the binary's orbital angular momentum as it evolves toward coalescence,whose magnitude depends on the integrated history of the chern-simons couplingover the worldline of radiation wavefront. we estimate that lisa could placebounds on chern-simons modified gravity that are several orders of magnitudestronger than the present solar system constraints, thus providing a probe ofthe quantum structure of spacetime.

gr-qc;0211001	power laws, scale invariance, and generalized frobenius series:  applications to newtonian and tov stars near criticality	we present a self-contained formalism for analyzing scale invariantdifferential equations. we first cast the scale invariant model into itsequidimensional and autonomous forms, find its fixed points, and then obtainpower-law background solutions. after linearizing about these fixed points, wefind a second linearized solution, which provides a distinct collection ofpower laws characterizing the deviations from the fixed point. we prove thatgenerically there will be a region surrounding the fixed point in which thecomplete general solution can be represented as a generalized frobenius-likepower series with exponents that are integer multiples of the exponents arisingin the linearized problem. this frobenius-like series can be viewed as avariant of liapunov's expansion theorem. as specific examples we apply theseideas to newtonian and relativistic isothermal stars and demonstrate (bothnumerically and analytically) that the solution exhibits oscillatory power-lawbehaviour as the star approaches the point of collapse. these series solutionsextend classical results. (lane, emden, and chandrasekhar in the newtoniancase; harrison, thorne, wakano, and wheeler in the relativistic case.) we alsoindicate how to extend these ideas to situations where fixed points may notexist -- either due to ``monotone'' flow or due to the presence of limitcycles. monotone flow generically leads to logarithmic deviations from scaling,while limit cycles generally lead to discrete self-similar solutions.

gr-qc;0403100	testing alternative theories of gravity using lisa	we investigate the possible bounds which could be placed on alternativetheories of gravity using gravitational wave detection from inspirallingcompact binaries with the proposed lisa space interferometer. specifically, weestimate lower bounds on the coupling parameter \omega of scalar-tensortheories of the brans-dicke type and on the compton wavelength of the graviton\lambda_g in hypothetical massive graviton theories. in these theories,modifications of the gravitational radiation damping formulae or of thepropagation of the waves translate into a change in the phase evolution of theobserved gravitational waveform. we obtain the bounds through the technique ofmatched filtering, employing the lisa sensitivity curve generator (scg),available online. for a neutron star inspiralling into a 10^3 m_sun black holein the virgo cluster, in a two-year integration, we find a lower bound \omega &gt;3 * 10^5. for lower-mass black holes, the bound could be as large as 2 * 10^6.the bound is independent of lisa arm length, but is inversely proportional tothe lisa position noise error. lower bounds on the graviton compton wavelengthranging from 10^15 km to 5 * 10^16 km can be obtained from one-yearobservations of massive binary black hole inspirals at cosmological distances(3 gpc), for masses ranging from 10^4 to 10^7 m_sun. for the highest-masssystems (10^7 m_sun), the bound is proportional to (lisa arm length)^{1/2} andto (lisa acceleration noise)^{-1/2}. for the others, the bound is independentof these parameters because of the dominance of white-dwarf confusion noise inthe relevant part of the frequency spectrum. these bounds improve and extendearlier work which used analytic formulae for the noise curves.

gr-qc;0503011	binary black hole initial data from matched asymptotic expansions	we present an approximate metric for a binary black hole spacetime toconstruct initial data for numerical relativity. this metric is obtained byasymptotically matching a post-newtonian metric for a binary system to aperturbed schwarzschild metric for each hole. in the inner zone near each hole,the metric is given by the schwarzschild solution plus a quadrupolarperturbation corresponding to an external tidal gravitational field. in thenear zone, well outside each black hole but less than a reduced wavelength fromthe center of mass of the binary, the metric is given by a post-newtonianexpansion including the lowest-order deviations from flat spacetime. when thenear zone overlaps each inner zone in a buffer zone, the post-newtonian andperturbed schwarzschild metrics can be asymptotically matched to each other. bydemanding matching (over a 4-volume in the buffer zone) rather than patching(choosing a particular 2-surface in the buffer zone), we guarantee that theerrors are small in all zones. the resulting piecewise metric is made formally$c^\infty$ with smooth transition functions so as to obtain the finiteextrinsic curvature of a 3-slice. in addition to the metric and extrinsiccurvature, we present explicit results for the lapse and the shift, which canbe used as initial data for numerical simulations. this initial data is notaccurate all the way to the asymptotically flat ends inside each hole, andtherefore must be used with evolution codes which employ black hole excisionrather than puncture methods. this paper lays the foundations of a method thatcan be sraightforwardly iterated to obtain initial data to higher perturbativeorder.

gr-qc;0510076	metric of a tidally perturbed spinning black hole	we explicitly construct the metric of a kerr black hole that is tidallyperturbed by the external universe in the slow-motion approximation. thisapproximation assumes that the external universe changes slowly relative to therotation rate of the hole, thus allowing the parameterization of thenewman-penrose scalar $\psi_0$ by time-dependent electric and magnetic tidaltensors. this approximation, however, does not constrain how big the spin ofthe background hole can be and, in principle, the perturbed metric can modelrapidly spinning holes. we first generate a potential by acting with adifferential operator on $\psi_0$. from this potential we arrive at the metricperturbation by use of the chrzanowski procedure in the ingoing radiationgauge. we provide explicit analytic formulae for this metric perturbation inspherical kerr-schild coordinates, where the perturbation is finite at thehorizon. this perturbation is parametrized by the mass and kerr spin parameterof the background hole together with the electric and magnetic tidal tensorsthat describe the time evolution of the perturbation produced by the externaluniverse. in order to take the metric accurate far away from the hole, thesetidal tensors should be determined by asymptotically matching this metric toanother one valid far from the hole. the tidally perturbed metric constructedhere could be useful in initial data constructions to describe the metric nearthe horizons of a binary system of spinning holes. this perturbed metric couldalso be used to construct waveforms and study the absorption of mass andangular momentum by a kerr black hole when external processes generategravitational radiation.

gr-qc;0601046	improved initial data for black hole binaries by asymptotic matching of  post-newtonian and perturbed black hole solutions	we construct approximate initial data for non-spinning black hole binarysystems by asymptotically matching the 4-metrics of two tidally perturbedschwarzschild solutions in isotropic coordinates to a resummed post-newtonian4-metric in admtt coordinates. the specific matching procedure used hereclosely follows the calculation in gr-qc/0503011, and is performed in the socalled buffer zone where both the post-newtonian and the perturbedschwarzschild approximations hold. the result is that both metrics agree in thebuffer zone, up to the errors in the approximations. however, since isotropiccoordinates are very similar to admtt coordinates, matching yields betterresults than in the previous calculation, where harmonic coordinates were usedfor the post-newtonian 4-metric. in particular, not only does matching improvein the buffer zone, but due to the similarity between admtt and isotropiccoordinates the two metrics are also close to each other near the black holehorizons. with the help of a transition function we also obtain a global smooth4-metric which has errors on the order of the error introduced by the moreaccurate of the two approximations we match. this global smoothed out 4-metricis obtained in admtt coordinates which are not horizon penetrating. inaddition, we construct a further coordinate transformation that takes the4-metric from global admtt coordinates to new coordinates which are similar tokerr-schild coordinates near each black hole, but which remain admtt furtheraway from the black holes. these new coordinates are horizon penetrating andlead, for example, to a lapse which is everywhere positive on the t=0 slice.such coordinates may be more useful in numerical simulations.

gr-qc;0611128	frankenstein's glue: transition functions for approximate solutions	approximations are commonly employed to find approximate solutions to theeinstein equations. these solutions, however, are usually only valid in somespecific spacetime region. a global solution can be constructed by gluingapproximate solutions together, but this procedure is difficult becausediscontinuities can arise, leading to large violations of the einsteinequations. in this paper, we provide an attempt to formalize this gluing schemeby studying transition functions that join approximate solutions together. inparticular, we propose certain sufficient conditions on these functions andproof that these conditions guarantee that the joined solution still satisfiesthe einstein equations to the same order as the approximate ones. an example isalso provided for a binary system of non-spinning black holes, where theapproximate solutions are taken to be given by a post-newtonian expansion and aperturbed schwarzschild solution. for this specific case, we show that if thetransition functions satisfy the proposed conditions, the joined solution doesnot contain any violations to the einstein equations larger than those alreadyinherent in the approximations. we further show that if these functions violatethe proposed conditions, then the matter content of the spacetime is modifiedby the introduction of a matter-shell, whose stress-energy tensor depends onderivatives of these functions.
