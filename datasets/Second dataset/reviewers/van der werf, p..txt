0905.1058	spitzer-irs study of the antennae galaxies ngc 4038/39	using the infrared spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope, we observedthe antennae galaxies obtaining spectral maps of the entire central region andhigh signal-to-noise 5-38 um spectra of the two galactic nuclei and sixinfrared-luminous regions. the total infrared luminosity of our six ir peaksplus the two nuclei is l_ir = 3.8x10^10 l_o, with their derived star formationrates ranging between 0.2 and 2 m_o/yr, with a total of 6.6 m_o/yr. the hardestand most luminous radiation originates from two compact clusters in thesouthern part of the overlap region, which also have the highest dusttemperatures. pah emission and other tracers of softer radiation are spatiallyextended throughout and beyond the overlap region, but regions with harder andintenser radiation field show a reduced pah strength. the strong h_2 emissionis rather confined around the nucleus of ngc 4039, where shocks appear to bethe dominant excitation mechanism, and the southern part of the overlap region,where it traces the most recent starburst activity. the luminosity ratiobetween the warm molecular gas (traced by the h_2 lines) and the total far-iremission is ~1.6x10^-4, similar to that found in many starburst and ulirgs. thetotal mass of warm h_2 in the antennae is 2.5x10^7 m_o, with a fraction of warmto total h_2 gas mass of about 0.35%. the average warm h_2 temperature is302+/-26 k and appears anti-correlated with the radiation field hardness,possibly due to an evolution of the pdr morphology. the previously reportedtight correlation between the h_2 and pah emission was not found but highertotal pah emission to continuum ratios were found in pdrs with warmer gas.

0707.4484	hst and spitzer imaging of red and blue galaxies at z~2.5: a correlation  between size and star formation activity from compact quiescent galaxies to  extended star forming galaxies	we present hst nicmos+acs and spitzer irac+mips observations of 41 galaxiesat 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 in the fires ms1054 field with red and blue rest-frame opticalcolors. about half of the galaxies are very compact (effective radii r_e &lt; 1kpc) at rest-frame optical wavelengths, the others are extended (1&lt; r_e &lt; 10kpc). for reference, 1 kpc corresponds to 0.12 arcsec at z=2.5 in the adoptedcosmology. we separate actively star forming galaxies from quiescent galaxiesby modeling their rest-frame uv-nir seds. the star forming galaxies span thefull range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r_e&lt;2kpc. in theredshift range where mips 24 micron imaging is a sensitive probe of re-radiateddust emission (z&lt;2.5), the 24 micron fluxes confirm that the light of the smallquiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded starformation or agn activity. the inferred surface mass densities and velocitydispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in localgalaxies. the galaxies follow a kormendy relation (between surface brightnessand size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brightersurface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift ofz_f~5. this paper demonstrates a direct relation between star formationactivity and size at z~2.5, and the existence of a significant population ofmassive, extremely dense, old stellar systems without readily identifiablecounterparts in the local universe.

1005.2182	100 mum and 160 mum emission as resolved star-formation rate estimators  in m33 (herm33es)	over the past few years several studies have provided estimates of the sfr(star-formation rate) or the total infrared luminosity from just one infraredband. however these relations are generally derived for entire galaxies, whichare known to contain a large scale diffuse emission that is not necessarilyrelated to the latest star-formation episode. we provide new relations toestimate the sfr from resolved star-forming regions at 100 mum and 160 mum. weselect individual star-forming regions in the nearby (840 kpc) galaxy m33. weestimate the sfr combining the emission in halpha and at 24 mum to calibratethe emission at 100 mum and 160 mum as sfr estimators, as mapped withpacs/herschel. the data are obtained in the framework of the herm33es open timekey project. there is less emission in the hii regions at 160 mum than at 100mum. over a dynamic range of almost 2 dex in sigma(sfr) we find that the 100mum emission is a nearly linear estimator of the sfr, whereas that at 160 mumis slightly superlinear. the behaviour of individual star-forming regions issurprisingly similar to that of entire galaxies. at high sigma(sfr), starformation drives the dust temperature, whereas uncertainties and variations inradiation-transfer and dust-heated processes dominate at low sigma(sfr).detailed modelling of both galaxies and individual star forming regions will beneeded to interpret similarities and differences between the two and assess thefraction of diffuse emission in galaxies.

1005.2297	properties of compact 250 \mu m emission and hii regions in m33  (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, using the high resolutionand sensitivity of the herschel photometric data, we study the compact emissionin the local group spiral galaxy m33 to investigate the nature of the compactspire emission sources. we extracted a catalogue of sources at 250um in orderto investigate the nature of this compact emission. taking advantage of theunprecedented herschel resolution at these wavelengths, we also focus on a moreprecise study of some striking halpha shells in the northern part of thegalaxy. we present a catalogue of 159 compact emission sources in m33identified by sextractor in the 250um spire band that is the one that providesthe best spatial resolution. we also measured fluxes at 24um and halpha forthose 159 extracted sources. the morphological study of the shells alsobenefits from a multiwavelength approach including halpha, far-uv from galex,and infrared from both spitzer irac 8um and mips 24um in order to makecomparisons. for the 159 compact sources selected at 250um, we find a verystrong pearson correlation coefficient with the mips 24um emission (r24 = 0.94)and a rather strong correlation with the halpha emission, although with morescatter (rha = 0.83). the morphological study of the halpha shells shows adisplacement between far-ultraviolet, halpha, and the spire bands. the cooldust emission from spire clearly delineates the halpha shell structures. thevery strong link between the 250um compact emission and the 24um and halphaemissions, by recovering the star formation rate from standard recipes for hiiregions, allows us to provide star formation rate calibrations based on the250um compact emission alone. the different locations of the halpha andfar-ultraviolet emissions with respect to the spire cool dust emission leads toa dynamical age of a few myr for the halpha shells and the associated cooldust.

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1005.3422	cool gas and dust in m33: results from the herschel m33 extended survey  (herm33es)	we present an analysis of the first space-based far-ir-submm observations ofm 33, which measure the emission from the cool dust and resolve the giantmolecular cloud complexes. with roughly half-solar abundances, m33 is a firststep towards young low-metallicity galaxies where the submm may be able toprovide an alternative to co mapping to measure their h$_2$ content. in thisletter, we measure the dust emission cross-section $\sigma$ using spire andrecent co and \hi\ observations; a variation in $\sigma$ is present from anear-solar neighborhood cross-section to about half-solar with the maximumbeing south of the nucleus. calculating the total h column density from themeasured dust temperature and cross-section, and then subtracting the \hi\column, yields a morphology similar to that observed in co. the h$_2$/\hi\ massratio decreases from about unity to well below 10% and is about 15% averagedover the optical disk. the single most important observation to reduce thepotentially large systematic errors is to complete the co mapping of m 33.

1005.3642	herschel observations of water vapour in markarian 231	the ultra luminous infrared galaxy mrk 231 reveals up to seven rotationallines of water (h2o) in emission, including a very high-lying (e_{upper}=640 k)line detected at a 4sigma level, within the herschel/spire wavelength range,whereas pacs observations show one h2o line at 78 microns in absorption, asfound for other h2o lines previously detected by iso. the absorption/emissiondichotomy is caused by the pumping of the rotational levels by far-infraredradiation emitted by dust, and subsequent relaxation through lines at longerwavelengths, which allows us to estimate both the column density of h2o and thegeneral characteristics of the underlying far-infrared continuum source.radiative transfer models including excitation through both absorption offar-infrared radiation emitted by dust and collisions are used to calculate theequilibrium level populations of h2o and the corresponding line fluxes. thehighest-lying h2o lines detected in emission, with levels at 300-640 k abovethe ground state, indicate that the source of far-infrared radiationresponsible for the pumping is compact (radius=110-180 pc) and warm(t_{dust}=85-95 k), accounting for at least 45% of the bolometric luminosity.the high column density, n(h2o)~5x10^{17} cm^{-2}, found in this nuclearcomponent, is most probably the consequence of shocks/cosmic rays, an xdrchemistry, and/or an "undepleted chemistry" where grain mantles are evaporated.a more extended region, presumably the inner region of the 1-kpc disk observedin other molecular species, could contribute to the flux observed in low-lyingh2o lines through dense hot cores, and/or shocks. the h2o 78 micron lineobserved with pacs shows hints of a blue-shifted wing seen in absorption,possibly indicating the occurrence of h2o in the prominent outflow detected inoh (fischer et al., this volume).

1008.4058	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey v: the co(j=3-2) distribution and  molecular outflow in ngc~4631	we have made the first map of co(j=3-2) emission covering the disk of theedge-on galaxy, ngc~4631, which is known for its spectacular gaseous halo. thestrongest emission, which we model with a gaussian ring,occurs within a radiusof 5 kpc. weaker disk emission is detected out to radii of 12 kpc, the mostextensive molecular component yet seen in this galaxy. from comparisons withinfrared data, we find that co(j=3-2) emission more closely follows the hotdust component, rather than the cold dust,consistent with it being a goodtracer of star formation. the first maps of $r_{3-2/1-0}$, h$_2$ mass surfacedensity and sfe have been made for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region. only 20\%of the sf occurs in this region and excitation conditions are typical of galaxydisks, rather than of central starbursts. the sfe suggests long gas consumptiontimescales ($&gt;$ $10^9$ yr).  the velocity field is dominated by a steeply rising rotation curve in theregion of the central molecular ring followed by a flatter curve in the disk. avery steep gradient in the rotation curve is observed at the nucleus, providingthe first evidence for a central concentration of mass:m$_{dyn}\,=\,5\,\times\,10^7$ m$_\odot$ within a radius of 282 pc. the velocityfield shows anomalous features indicating the presence of molecular outflows;one of them is associated with a previously observed co(j=1-0) expanding shell.consistent with these outflows is the presence of a thick ($z$ up to $1.4$ kpc)co(j=3-2) disk. we suggest that the interaction between ngc~4631 and itscompanion(s) has agitated the disk and also initiated star formation which waslikely higher in the past than it is now. these may be necessary conditions forseeing prominent halos.

1009.3279	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey iv. velocity dispersions in the  molecular interstellar medium in spiral galaxies	an analysis of large-area co j=3-2 maps from the james clerk maxwelltelescope for 12 nearby spiral galaxies reveals low velocity dispersions in themolecular component of the interstellar medium. the three lowest luminositygalaxies show a relatively flat velocity dispersion as a function of radiuswhile the remaining nine galaxies show a central peak with a radial fall-offwithin 0.2-0.4 r(25). correcting for the average contribution due to theinternal velocitydispersions of a population of giant molecular clouds, theaverage cloud-cloud velocity dispersion across the galactic disks is 6.1 +/-1.0 km/s (standard deviation 2.9 km/s), in reasonable agreement with previousmeasurements for the galaxy andm33. the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion derivedfrom the co data is on average two times smaller than the hi velocitydispersion measured in the same galaxies. the low cloud-cloudvelocitydispersion implies that the molecular gas is the critical component determiningthe stability of the galactic disk against gravitational collapse, especiallyin those regions of the disk which are h2 dominated. the cloud-cloud velocitydispersion shows a significant positivecorrelation with both the far-infraredluminosity, which traces the star formation activity, and the k-band absolutemagnitude, which traces the total stellar mass. for three galaxies in the virgocluster, smoothing the data to a resolution of 4.5 kpc (to match the typicalresolution of high redshift co observations) increases the measured velocitydispersion by roughly a factor of two, comparable to the dispersion measuredrecently in a normal galaxy at z=1. this comparison suggests that the mass andstar formation rate surface densities may be similar in galaxies from z=0-1 andthat the high star formation rates seen at z=1 may be partly due to thepresence of physically larger molecular gas disks.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1101.2122	molecules as tracers of galaxy evolution: an emir survey. i.  presentation of the data and first results	we investigate the molecular gas properties of a sample of 23 galaxies inorder to find and test chemical signatures of galaxy evolution and to comparethem to ir evolutionary tracers. observation at 3 mm wavelengths were obtainedwith the emir broadband receiver, mounted on the iram 30 m telescope on picoveleta, spain. we compare the emission of the main molecular species withexisting models of chemical evolution by means of line intensity ratiosdiagrams and principal component analysis. we detect molecular emission in 19galaxies in two 8 ghz-wide bands centred at 88 and 112 ghz. the main detectedtransitions are the j=1-0 lines of co, 13co, hcn, hnc, hco+, cn, and c2h. wealso detect hc3n j=10-9 in the galaxies iras 17208, ic 860, ngc 4418, ngc 7771,and ngc 1068. the only hc3n detections are in objects with hco+/hcn&lt;1 and warmiras colours. galaxies with the highest hc3n/hcn ratios have warm iras colours(60/100 {\mu}m&gt;0.8). the brightest hc3n emission is found in ic 860, where wealso detect the molecule in its vibrationally excited state.we find low hnc/hcnline ratios (&lt;0.5), that cannot be explained by existing pdr or xdr chemicalmodels. bright hc3n emission in hco+-faint objects may imply that these are notdominated by x-ray chemistry. thus the hcn/hco+ line ratio is not, by itself, areliable tracer of xdrs. bright hc3n and faint hco+ could be signatures ofembedded starformation, instead of agn activity.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1106.5464	the herschel m33 extended survey (herm33es): pacs spectroscopy of the  star forming region bclmp 302	context: the emission line of [cii] at 158 micron is one of the strongestcooling lines of the interstellar medium (ism) in galaxies. aims: disentanglingthe relative contributions of the different ism phases to [cii] emission, is amajor topic of the herm33es program, a herschel key project to study the ism inthe nearby spiral galaxy m33. methods: using pacs, we have mapped the emissionof [cii] 158 micron, [oi] 63 micron, and other fir lines in a 2'x2' region ofthe northern spiral arm of m33, centered on the hii region bclmp302. at thepeak of h-alpha emission, we have observed in addition a velocity resolved[cii] spectrum using hifi. we use scatterplots to compare these data with pacs160 micron continuum maps, and with maps of co and hi data, at a commonresolution of 12 arcsec or 50 pc. maps of h-alpha and 24 micron emissionobserved with spitzer are used to estimate the sfr. we have created maps of the[cii] and [oi] 63 micron emission and detected [nii] 122 micron and niii 57micron at individual positions. results: the [cii] line observed with hifi issignificantly broader than that of co, and slightly blue-shifted. in addition,there is little spatial correlation between [cii] observed with pacs and coover the mapped region. there is even less spatial correlation between [cii]and the atomic gas traced by hi. detailed comparison of the observedintensities towards the hii region with models of photo ionization and photondominated regions, confirms that a significant fraction, 20--30%, of theobserved [cii] emission stems from the ionized gas and not from the molecularcloud. the gas heating efficiency, using the ratio between [cii] and the tir asa proxy, varies between 0.07 and 1.5%, with the largest variations foundoutside the hii region.

1106.6195	the environment and characteristics of low redshift galaxies detected by  the herschel-atlas	we investigate the ultraviolet and optical properties and environment of lowredshift galaxies detected in the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) science demonstration data. we use the sloan digital skysurvey seventh release and the galaxy and mass assembly database to selectgalaxies with r_petro &lt; 19.0 mag in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and lookfor their submillimeter counterparts in h-atlas. our results show that at lowredshift, h-atlas detects mainly blue/star-forming galaxies with a minorcontribution from red systems which are highly obscured by dust. in addition wefind that the colour of a galaxy rather than the local density of itsenvironment determines whether it is detectable by h-atlas. the average dusttemperature of galaxies that are simultaneously detected by both pacs and spireis 25k \pm 4k, independent of environment. this analysis provides a glimpse ofthe potential of the h-atlas data to investigate the submillimeter propertiesof galaxies in the local universe.

1107.2396	dust heating sources in galaxies: the case of m33 (herm33es)	dust emission is one of the main windows to the physics of galaxies and tostar formation as the radiation from young, hot stars is absorbed by the dustand reemitted at longer wavelengths. the recently launched herschel satellitenow provides a view of dust emission in the far-infrared at an unequaledresolution and quality up to 500 \mu m. in the context of the herschel herm33esopen time key project, we are studying the moderately inclined scd local groupgalaxy m33 which is located only 840 kpc away. in this article, using spitzerand herschel data ranging from 3.6 \mu m to 500 \mu m, along with hi, h\alpha\maps, and galex ultraviolet data we have studied the emission of the dust atthe high spatial resolution of 150 pc. combining spitzer and herschel bands, wehave provided new, inclination corrected, resolved estimators of the totalinfrared brightness and of the star formation rate from any combination ofthese bands. the study of the colors of the warm and cold dust populationsshows that the temperature of the former is, at high brightness, dictated byyoung massive stars but, at lower brightness, heating is taken over by theevolved populations. conversely, the temperature of the cold dust is tightlydriven by the evolved stellar populations.

1107.2924	gas and dust in a submillimeter galaxy at z = 4.24 from the herschel  atlas	we report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source,id141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the h-atlas cosmologicalsurvey. id141 was observed using the iram 30-meter telescope and plateau debure interferometer (pdbi), the submillimeter array (sma) and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) submillimeter telescope to measure the dustcontinuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon([c i] and [c ii]). the detection of strong co emission lines with the pdbiconfirms that id141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). the strength ofthe continuum and emission lines suggests that id141 is gravitationally lensed.the width (delta v (fwhm) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the co andcarbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. the propertiesderived for id141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (l_fir ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x10^13/mu_l lsun, where mu_l is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)and warm (t_kin ~ 40k) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rateof (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_l msun/yr. the carbon emission lines indicate a dense(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) photo-dominated region, illuminated by a far-uv radiationfield a few thousand times more intense than that in our galaxy. in conclusion,the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, id141, are remarkably similar tothose of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.2406	far infrared constraints on the contamination by dust obscured galaxies  of high-z dropout searches	the spectral energy distributions (sed) of dusty galaxies at intermediateredshift may look similar to very high redshift galaxies in the optical/nearinfrared (nir) domain. this can lead to the contamination of high redshiftgalaxy searches based on broad band optical/nir photometry by lower redshiftdusty galaxies as both kind of galaxies cannot be distinguished. thecontamination rate could be as high as 50%. {this work shows how the farinfrared (fir) domain can help to recognize likely low-z interlopers in anoptical/nir search for high-z galaxies.} we analyse the fir seds of twogalaxies proposed as very high redshift ($z&gt;7$) dropout candidates based ondeep hawk-i/vlt observations. the fir seds are sampled with pacs/herschel at100 and 160\,$\mu$m, with spire/herschel at 250, 350 and 500\,$\mu$m and withlaboca/apex at 870\,$\mu$m. we find that redshifts $&gt;7$ would imply extreme firseds (with dust temperatures $&gt;100$\,k and fir luminosities$&gt;10^{13}$\,$l_{\odot}$). at z$\sim$2, instead, the seds of both sources wouldbe compatible with that of typical ulirgs/smgs. considering all the dataavailable for these sources from visible to fir we re-estimate the redshiftsand we find $z\sim$1.6--2.5. due to the strong spectral breaks observed inthese galaxies, standard templates from the literature fail to reproduce thevisible-near ir part of the seds even when additional extinction is included.these sources resemble strongly dust obscured galaxies selected in spitzerobservations with extreme visible-to-fir colors, and the galaxy gn10 at $z=4$.galaxies with similar seds could contaminate other high redshift surveys.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1111.6762	detection of hcn, hco+ and hnc in the mrk231 molecular outflow - dense  molecular gas in the agn wind	we detect luminous emission from hcn, hco+ and hnc 1--0 in the qso ulirgmrk~231 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer at 1."55 by 1."28resolution. all three lines show broad line wings - which are particularlyprominent for hcn. velocities are found to be similar (750 km/s) to those foundfor co 1-0. this is the first time bright hcn, hco+ and hnc emission has beendetected in a large-scale galactic outflow. we find that both the blue- andred-shifted line wings are spatially extended by at least 0."75 (700 pc) in anorth-south direction. the line wings are brighter (relative to the line centerintensity) in hcn than in co 1-0 and line ratios suggest that the molecularoutflow consists of dense (n&gt;10e4 cme-3) and clumpy gas with a high hcnabundance x(hcn)&gt;10e-8. these properties are consistent with the molecular gasbeing compressed and fragmented by shocks in the outflow. alternatively, hcn isinstead pumped by mid-ir continuum, but we propose that this effect is notstrong for the spatially extended outflowing gas. in addition, we find that therotation of the main disk, in east-west direction, is also evident in the hcn,hco+ and hnc line emission. an unexpectedly bright hc3n 10-9 line is detectedinside the central 400 pc of mrk231. this hc3n emission may emerge from ashielded, dust-enshrouded region within the inner 40-50 pc where the gas isheated to high temperatures (200 - 300 k) by the agn.

1112.0321	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: clustering  of submillimetre galaxies	we present a measurement of the spatial clustering of submillimetre galaxies(smgs) at z = 1-3. using data from the 870 micron less survey, we employ anovel technique to measure the cross-correlation between smgs and galaxies,accounting for the full probability distributions for photometric redshifts ofthe galaxies. from the observed projected two-point cross-correlation functionwe derive the linear bias and characteristic dark matter (dm) halo masses forthe smgs. we detect clustering in the cross-correlation between smgs andgalaxies at the &gt; 4 sigma level. for the smg autocorrelation we obtain r_0 =7.7 (+1.8,-2.3) h^-1 mpc, and derive a corresponding dm halo mass of log(m_halo[h^-1 m_sun]) = 12.8 (+0.3,-0.5). based on the evolution of dm haloes derivedfrom simulations, we show that that the z = 0 descendants of smgs are typicallymassive (~2-3 l*) elliptical galaxies residing in moderate- to high-mass groups(log(m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) = 13.3 (+0.3,-0.5). from the observed clustering weestimate an smg lifetime of ~100 myr, consistent with lifetimes derived fromgas consumption times and star-formation timescales, although with considerableuncertainties. the clustering of smgs at z ~ 2 is consistent with measurementsfor optically-selected quasi-stellar objects (qsos), supporting evolutionaryscenarios linking starbursts and qsos. given that smgs reside in haloes ofcharacteristic mass ~ 6 x 10^12 h^-1 m_sun, we demonstrate that the redshiftdistribution of smgs can be described remarkably well by the combination of twoeffects: the cosmological growth of structure and the evolution of themolecular gas fraction in galaxies. we conclude that the powerful starbursts insmgs likely represent a short-lived but universal phase in massive galaxyevolution, associated with the transition between cold gas-rich, star-forminggalaxies and passively evolving systems.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1201.2558	dust and gas power-spectrum in m33 (herm33es)	power spectra of de-projected images of late-type galaxies in gas and/or dustemission are very useful diagnostics of the dynamics and stability of theirinterstellar medium. previous studies have shown that the power spectra can beapproximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500pc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the twocorresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. we present athorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at severalwavelengths in the nearby galaxy m33. in particular, we use the recentlyobtained images at five wavelengths by pacs and spire onboard herschel. thelarge dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determineclearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations withwavelength. the break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24and 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in athicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined tothe plane. the slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. numericalsimulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,like m33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.varying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain arange of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicelybracket the data. the small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3dbehaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes thestructures, by increasing the gas turbulence. m33 appears to correspond to afiducial model with an sfr of $\sim$ 0.7 mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energycoupled to the gas kinematics.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1207.3243	spectrally resolved cii emission in m~33 ({\tt herm33es}): physical  conditions and kinematics around bclmp 691	this work presents high spectral resolution observations of the \cii\ line at158 \micron, one of the major cooling lines of the interstellar medium, takenwith the hifi heterodyne spectrometer on the herschel satellite. in bclmp 691,an \hii\ region far north (3.3 kpc) in the disk of m 33, the \cii\ and co lineprofiles show similar velocities within $0.5 \kms$, while the \hi\ linevelocities are systematically shifted towards lower rotation velocities by$\sim 5\kms$. observed at the same $12"$ angular resolution, the \cii\ linesare broader than those of co by about 50% but narrower than the \hi\ lines. the\cii\ line to far-infrared continuum ratio suggests a photoelectric heatingefficiency of 1.1%. the data, together with published models indicate a uvfield $g_0 \sim 100$ in units of the solar neighborhood value, a gas density$n_h \sim 1000 \cc$, and a gas temperature $t\sim 200$ k. adopting thesevalues, we estimate the c$^+$ column density to be $n_{c^+} \approx 1.3 \times10^{17} \cmt$. the \cii\ emission comes predominantly from the warm neutralregion between the \hii\ region and the cool molecular cloud behind it. frompublished abundances, the inferred c$^+$ column corresponds to a hydrogencolumn density of $n_h \sim 2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$. the co observations suggestthat $n_h = 2 n_{h_2} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ and 21cm measurements, alsoat $12"$ resolution, yield $n_\hi \approx 1.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ within the\cii\ velocity range. thus, some h$_2$ not detected in co must be present, inagreement with earlier findings based on the spire 250 -- 500 $\mu$m emission.

1208.3079	herschel-atlas: multi-wavelength seds and physical properties of 250  micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5	we present a pan-chromatic analysis of an unprecedented sample of 1402 250micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5 (mean z = 0.24) from the herschel-atlassurvey. we complement our herschel 100-500 micron data with uv-k-bandphotometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey and apply themagphys energy-balance technique to produce pan-chromatic seds for arepresentative sample of 250 micron selected galaxies spanning the most recent5 gyr of cosmic history. we derive estimates of physical parameters, includingstar formation rates, stellar masses, dust masses and infrared luminosities.the typical h-atlas galaxy at z &lt; 0.5 has a far-infrared luminosity in therange 10^10 - 10^12 lsolar (sfr: 1-50 msolar/yr) thus is broadly representativeof normal star forming galaxies over this redshift range. we show that 250micron-selected galaxies contain a larger mass of dust at a given infra-redluminosity or star formation rate than previous samples selected at 60 micronfrom iras. we derive typical seds for h-atlas galaxies, and show that theemergent sed shape is most sensitive to specific star formation rate. theoptical-uv seds also become more reddened due to dust at higher redshifts. ourtemplate seds are significantly cooler than existing infra-red templates. theymay therefore be most appropriate for inferring total ir luminosities frommoderate redshift submillimetre selected samples and for inclusion in models ofthe lower redshift submillimetre galaxy populations.

1210.3263	dense gas in m33 (herm33es)	we aim to better understand the emission of molecular tracers of the diffuseand dense gas in giant molecular clouds and the influence that metallicity,optical extinction, density, far-uv field, and star formation rate have onthese tracers. using the iram 30m telescope, we detected hcn, hco+, 12co, and13co in six gmcs along the major axis of m33 at a resolution of ~ 114pc and outto a radial distance of 3.4kpc. optical, far-infrared, and submillimeter datafrom herschel and other observatories complement these observations. tointerpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of modelsof photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for m33-type subsolarmetallicity. the observed hco+/hcn line ratios range between 1.1 and 2.5.similarly high ratios have been observed in the large magellanic cloud. thehcn/co ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of m33. the 12co/13coline ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffusegas and the centers of gmcs of the milky way. stacking of all spectra allowedhnc and c2h to be detected. the resulting hco+/hnc and hcn/hnc ratios of ~ 8and 6, respectively, lie at the high end of ratios observed in a large set of(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. hcn abundances are lower in the subsolarmetallicity pdr models, while hco+ abundances are enhanced. for hcn this effectis more pronounced at low optical extinctions. the observed hco+/hcn and hcn/coline ratios are naturally explained by subsolar pdr models of low opticalextinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -3x10^4 cm^-3, while the fuv field strength only has a small effect on themodeled line ratios. the line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by thesolar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play aminor role in influencing these line ratios.

1308.6707	an extended herschel drop-out source in the center of as1063, a 'normal'  dusty galaxy at z=6.1 or sz substructures?	in the course of our 870um apex/laboca follow up of the herschel lensingsurvey we have detected a source in as1063 (rxc j2248.7-4431), that has nocounterparts in any of the herschel pacs/spire bands, it is a herschel'drop-out' with s_870/s_500&gt;0.5. the 870um emission is extended and centered onthe brightest cluster galaxy suggesting either a multiply imaged backgroundsource or substructure in the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) increment due toinhomogeneities in the hot cluster gas of this merging cluster. we discuss bothinterpretations with emphasis on the putative lensed source. based on theobserved properties and on our lens model we find that this source could be thefirst smg with a moderate far infrared luminosity (l_fir&lt;10^12 l_sol) detectedso far at z&gt;4. in deep hst observations we identified a multiply imaged z~6source and we measured its spectroscopic redshift z=6.107 with vlt/fors. thissource could be associated with the putative smg but it is most likely offsetspatially by 10-30kpc and they could be interacting galaxies. with a firluminosity in the range [5-15]x10^{11} l_sol corresponding to a star formationrate in the range [80-260]m_sol/yr, this smg would be more representative thanthe extreme starbursts usually detected at z&gt;4. with a total magnification of~25 it would open a unique window to the 'normal' dusty galaxies at the end ofthe epoch of reionization.

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

1309.4102	isothermal dust models of herschel-atlas galaxies	we use galaxies from the herschel-atlas survey, and a suite of ancillarysimulations based on an isothermal dust model, to study our ability todetermine the effective dust temperature, luminosity and emissivity index of250um selected galaxies in the local universe (z &lt; 0.5). as well as simplefar-infrared sed fitting of individual galaxies based on chi^2 minimisation, weattempt to derive the best global isothermal properties of 13,826 galaxies withreliable optical counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts. using oursimulations, we highlight the fact that applying traditional sed fittingtechniques to noisy observational data in the herschel space observatory bandsintroduces artificial anti-correlation between derived values of dusttemperature and emissivity index. this is true even for galaxies with the mostrobust detections in our sample, making the results hard to interpret. we applya method to determine the best-fit global values of isothermal effectivetemperature and emissivity index for z &lt; 0.5 galaxies in h-atlas, deriving t =22.3 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.98 +/- 0.02 (or t = 23.5 +/- 0.1k and beta = 1.82+/- 0.02 if we attempt to correct for bias by assuming that t and beta areindependent and normally distributed). we use our technique to test for anevolving emissivity index, finding only weak evidence. the median dustluminosity of our sample is log(ldust/lsolar) = 10.72 +/- 0.05 which (unlike t)shows little dependence on the choice of beta used in our analysis, includingwhether it is variable or fixed. we use a further suite of simulations toemphasise the importance of the h-atlas pacs data for deriving dusttemperatures at these redshifts, even though they are less sensitive than thespire data. the majority of galaxies detected by h-atlas are normalstar-forming galaxies, though a substantial minority (~31%) fall in theluminous infrared galaxy category.

1310.6364	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the agn fraction and x-ray properties of submillimeter galaxies	the large gas and dust reservoirs of submm galaxies (smgs) could potentiallyprovide ample fuel to trigger an active galactic nucleus (agn), but previousstudies of the agn fraction in smgs have been controversial largely due to theinhomogeneity and limited angular resolution of the available submillimetersurveys. here we set improved constraints on the agn fraction and x-rayproperties of the smgs with alma and chandra observations in the extendedchandra deep field-south (e-cdf-s). this study is the first among similar worksto have unambiguously identified the x-ray counterparts of smgs; this isaccomplished using the fully submm-identified, statistically reliable smgcatalog with 99 smgs from the alma laboca e-cdf-s submillimeter survey (aless).we found 10 x-ray sources associated with smgs (median redshift z = 2.3), ofwhich 8 were identified as agns using several techniques that enablecross-checking. the other 2 x-ray detected smgs have levels of x-ray emissionthat can be plausibly explained by their star-formation activity. 6 of the 8smg-agns are moderately/highly absorbed, with n_h &gt; 10e23 cm-2. an analysis ofthe agn fraction, taking into account the spatial variation of x-raysensitivity, yields an agn fraction of 17+16-6% for agns with rest-frame 0.5-8kev absorption-corrected luminosity &gt;7.8x10e42 erg s-1; we provide estimatedagn fractions as a function of x-ray flux and luminosity. alma's high angularresolution also enables direct x-ray stacking at the precise positions of smgsfor the first time, and we found 4 potential smg-agns in our stacking sample.

1311.2604	an alma survey of sub-millimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: sub-millimeter properties of color-selected galaxies	we study the sub-mm properties of color-selected galaxies via a stackinganalysis applied for the first time to interferometric data at sub-mmwavelengths. we base our study on 344 ghz alma continuum observations of~20''-wide fields centered on 86 sub-mm sources detected in the laboca extendedchandra deep field south sub-mm survey (less). we select various classes ofgalaxies (k-selected, star-forming sbzk galaxies, extremely red objects anddistant red galaxies) according to their optical/nir fluxes. we find clear,&gt;10-sigma detections in the stacked images of all these galaxy classes. weinclude in our stacking analysis herschel/spire data to constrain the dust sedof these galaxies. we find that their dust emission is well described by amodified black body with tdust~30 k and beta=1.6 and ir luminosities of(5-11)x10^{11} lsun, or implied star formation rates of 75-140 msun/yr. wecompare our results with those of previous studies based on single-dishobservations at 870 micron and find that our flux densities are a factor 2-3higher than previous estimates. the discrepancy is observed also after removingsources individually detected in aless maps. we report a similar discrepancy byrepeating our analysis on 1.4\,ghz observations of the whole ecdfs. hence wefind tentative evidence that galaxies that are associated in projected andredshift space with sub-mm bright sources are brighter than the averagepopulation. finally, we put our findings in the context of the cosmic starformation rate density as a function of redshift.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1402.4668	the heating of mid-infrared dust in the nearby galaxy m33: a testbed for  tracing galaxy evolution	because the 8 {\mu}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission has beenfound to correlate with other well-known star formation tracers, it has widelybeen used as a star formation rate (sfr) tracer. there are, however, studiesthat challenge the accuracy and reliability of the 8 {\mu}m emission as a sfrtracer. our study, part of the herschel m33 extended survey (herm33es) opentime key program, aims at addressing this issue by analyzing the infraredemission from the nearby spiral galaxy m33 at the high spatial scale of 75 pc.combining data from the herschel space observatory and the spitzer spacetelescope we find that the 8 {\mu}m emission is better correlated with the 250{\mu}m emission, which traces cold interstellar gas, than with the 24 {\mu}memission. the l(8)/l(24) ratio is highly depressed in 24 {\mu}m luminousregions, which correlate with known hii regions. we also compare our resultswith the dust emission models by draine &amp; li (2007). we confirm that thedepression of 8 {\mu}m pah emission near star-forming regions is higher thanwhat is predicted by models; this is possibly an effect of increased stellarradiation from young stars destroying the dust grains responsible for the 8{\mu}m emission as already suggested by other authors. we find that themajority of the 8 {\mu}m emission is fully consistent with heating by thediffuse interstellar medium, similar to what recently determined for the dustemission in m31 by draine at al. (2013). we also find that the fraction of 8{\mu}m emission associated with the diffuse interstellar radiation field rangesbetween 60% and 80% and is 40% larger than the diffuse fraction at 24 {\mu}m.

1402.6335	a submillimeter galaxy illuminating its circumgalactic medium: ly-alpha  scattering in a cold, clumpy outflow	we report the detection at 850um of the central source in ssa22-lab1, thearchetypal lyman-alpha blob (lab), a 100kpc-scale radio-quiet emission-linenebula at z=3.1. the flux density of the source, $s_{850}=4.6\pm1.1$mjy impliesthe presence of a galaxy, or group of galaxies, with a total luminosity of$l_{\rm ir}\approx10^{12}l_\odot$. the position of an active source at thecenter of a ~50kpc-radius ring of linearly polarized ly-alpha emission detectedby hayes et al. (2011) suggests that the central source is leaking ly-alphaphotons preferentially in the plane of the sky, which undergo scattering in hiclouds at large galactocentric radius. the ly-alpha morphology around thesubmillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow, and the averagely-alpha line profiles of the two `lobes' are dominated by a red peak, expectedfor a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient thatis outflowing relative to the line center. taken together, these observationsprovide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy (or galaxies) isresponsible for a large fraction of the extended ly-alpha emission andmorphology. less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalacticmedium being traced by ly-alpha: is it mainly pristine material accreting intothe halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium (ism),now being blown back as it encounters an outflow, or does it mainly comprisegas that has been swept-up within the ism and expelled from the galaxy?

1403.2995	the dust budget crisis in high-redshift submillimetre galaxies	we apply a chemical evolution model to investigate the sources and evolutionof dust in a sample of 26 high-redshift ($z&gt;1$) submillimetre galaxies (smgs)from the literature, with complete photometry from ultraviolet to thesubmillimetre. we show that dust produced only by low-intermediate mass starsfalls a factor 240 short of the observed dust masses of smgs, the well-known`dust-budget crisis'. adding an extra source of dust from supernovae canaccount for the dust mass in 19 per cent of the smg sample. even afteraccounting for dust produced by supernovae the remaining deficit in the dustmass budget provides support for higher supernova yields, substantial graingrowth in the interstellar medium or a top-heavy imf. including efficientdestruction of dust by supernova shocks increases the tension between our modeland observed smg dust masses. the models which best reproduce the physicalproperties of smgs have a rapid build-up of dust from both stellar andinterstellar sources and minimal dust destruction. alternatively, invoking atop-heavy imf or significant changes in the dust grain properties can solve thedust budget crisis only if dust is produced by both low mass stars andsupernovae and is not efficiently destroyed by supernova shocks.

1502.01347	measuring star formation with resolved observations: the test case of  m33	context. measuring star formation at a local scale is important to constrainstar formation laws. yet, it is not clear whether and how the measure of starformation is affected by the spatial scale at which a galaxy is observed. aims.we want to understand the impact of the resolution on the determination of thespatially resolved star formation rate (sfr) and other directly associatedphysical parameters such as the attenuation. methods. we have carried out amulti-scale, pixel-by-pixel study of the nearby galaxy m33. assembling fuv,halpha, 8, 24, 70, and 100 micron maps, we have systematically compared theemission in individual bands with various sfr estimators from a resolution of33 pc to 2084 pc. results. we have found that there are strong,scale-dependent, discrepancies up to a factor 3 between monochromatic sfrestimators and halpha+24 micron. the scaling factors between individual irbands and the sfr show a strong dependence on the spatial scale and on theintensity of star formation. finally, strong variations of the differentialreddening between the nebular emission and the stellar continuum are seen,depending on the specific sfr (ssfr) and on the resolution. at the finestspatial scales, there is little differential reddening at high ssfr. thedifferential reddening increases with decreasing ssfr. at the coarsest spatialscales the differential reddening is compatible with the canonical value foundfor starburst galaxies. conclusions. our results confirm that monochromaticestimators of the sfr are unreliable at scales smaller than 1 kpc. furthermore,the extension of local calibrations to high redshift galaxies presentsnon-trivial challenges as the properties of these systems may be poorly known.

1504.08005	neutral carbon and co in 76 (u)lirgs and starburst galaxy centers a  method to determine molecular gas properties in luminous galaxies	we present fluxes in both neutral carbon [ci] lines at the centers of 76galaxies with fir luminosities between 10^{9} and 10^{12} l(o) obtained withherschel-spire and with ground-based facilities, along with the j=7-6, j=4-3,j=2-1 12co and j=2-1 13co line fluxes. we investigate whether these lines canbe used to characterize the molecular ism of the parent galaxies in simple waysand how the molecular gas properties define the model results. in moststarburst galaxies, the [ci]/13co flux ratio is much higher than in galacticstar-forming regions, and it is correlated to the total fir luminosity. the[ci](1-0)/co(4-3), the [ci](2-1) (2-1)/co(7-6), and the [ci] (2-1)/(1-0) fluxratios are also correlated, and trace the excitation of the molecular gas. inthe most luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs), the ism is fully dominated bydense and moderately warm gas clouds that appear to have low [c]/[co] and[13co]/[12co] abundances. in less luminous galaxies, emission from gas cloudsat lower densities becomes progressively more important, and a multiple-phaseanalysis is required to determine consistent physical characteristics. neitherthe co nor the [ci] velocity-integrated line fluxes are good predictors of h2column densities in individual galaxies, and x(ci) conversion factors are notsuperior to x(co) factors. the methods and diagnostic diagrams outlined in thispaper also provide a new and relatively straightforward means of deriving thephysical characteristics of molecular gas in high-redshift galaxies up to z=5,which are otherwise hard to determine.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

1512.04854	evidence for a chemically differentiated outflow in mrk 231	aims: our goal is to study the chemical composition of the outflows of activegalactic nuclei and starburst galaxies.  methods: we obtained high-resolution interferometric observations of hcn andhco$^+$ $j=1\rightarrow0$ and $j=2\rightarrow1$ of the ultraluminous infraredgalaxy mrk~231 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer. we also usepreviously published observations of hcn and hco$^+$ $j=1\rightarrow0$ and$j=3\rightarrow2$, and hnc $j=1\rightarrow0$ in the same source.  results: in the line wings of the hcn, hco$^+$, and hnc emission, we findthat these three molecular species exhibit features at distinct velocitieswhich differ between the species. the features are not consistent with emissionlines of other molecular species. through radiative transfer modelling of thehcn and hco$^+$ outflow emission we find an average abundance ratio$x(\mathrm{hcn})/x(\mathrm{hco}^+)\gtrsim1000$. assuming a clumpy outflow,modelling of the hcn and hco$^+$ emission produces strongly inconsistentoutflow masses.  conclusions: both the anti-correlated outflow features of hcn and hco$^+$ andthe different outflow masses calculated from the radiative transfer models ofthe hcn and hco$^+$ emission suggest that the outflow is chemicallydifferentiated. the separation between hcn and hco$^+$ could be an indicator ofshock fronts present in the outflow, since the hcn/hco$^+$ ratio is expected tobe elevated in shocked regions. our result shows that studies of the chemistryin large-scale galactic outflows can be used to better understand the physicalproperties of these outflows and their effects on the interstellar medium (ism)in the galaxy.

astro-ph;0408077	a substantial population of red galaxies at z &gt; 2: modeling of the  spectral energy distributions of an extended sample	we investigate the nature of the substantial population of high-z galaxieswith js-ks&gt;2.3 discovered as part of our fires survey. this colour cutefficiently isolates z&gt;2 galaxies with red rest-frame optical colors ("distantred galaxies" or drgs). we select objects in the 2.5'x2.5' hdf-south (hdf-s)and 5'x5' field around the ms1054-03 cluster; the surface densities at ks&lt;21are 1.6+-0.6 and 1.0+-0.2 arcmin^-2. we discuss the 34 drgs at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5: 11 atks&lt;22.5 in hdf-s and 23 at ks&lt;21.7 in the ms1054-03 field. we analyze the sedsconstructed from our deep near-infrared (nir) and optical imaging from the esovlt and hst. we develop diagnostics involving i-js, js-h, and h-ks to arguethat the red nir colors of drgs cannot be attributed solely to extinction andrequire for many an evolved stellar population with prominent balmer/4000abreak. in the rest-frame, the optical colours of drgs fall within the envelopeof normal nearby galaxies and the uv colours suggest a wide range in starformation activity and/or extinction. this contrasts with the much bluer andmore uniform seds of lyman break galaxies (lbgs). from evolutionary synthesismodels with constant star formation, solar metallicity, salpeter imf, andcalzetti et al. extinction law, we derive for the hdf-s (ms1054-03 field) drgsmedian ages of 1.7(2.0) gyr, a_v = 2.7(2.4) mag, stellar masses 0.8(1.6)x10^11msun, m/l_v = 1.2(2.3) msun/lvsun, and sfr = 120(170) msun/yr. models assumingdeclining sfrs with e-folding timescales of 10myr-1gyr generally imply youngerages, lower a_v's and sfrs, but similar stellar masses within a factor of two.compared to lbgs at similar redshifts and rest-frame l_v's, drgs are older,more massive, and more obscured for any given star formation history.[abridged]

astro-ph;0504219	irac mid-infrared imaging of the hubble deep field south: star formation  histories and stellar masses of red galaxies at z&gt;2	we present deep 3.6 - 8 micron imaging of the hubble deep field south withirac on the spitzer space telescope. we study distant red galaxies (drgs) atz&gt;2 selected by js - ks &gt; 2.3 and compare them to a sample of lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) at z=2-3. the observed uv-to-8 micron spectral energydistributions are fit with stellar population models to constrain starformation histories and derive stellar masses. we find that 70% of the drgs arebest described by dust-reddened star forming models and 30% are very well fitwith old and ``dead'' models. using only the i - ks and ks - 4.5 micron colorswe can effectively separate the two groups. the dead systems are among the mostmassive at z~2.5 (mean stellar mass &lt;m*&gt; = 0.8 x 10^11 msun) and likely formedmost of their stellar mass at z&gt;5. to a limit of 0.5 x 10^11 msun their numberdensity is ~10 x lower than that of local early-type galaxies. furthermore, weuse the irac photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared j, h, and k fluxes.the drgs and lbgs together show a large variation (a factor of 6) in therest-frame k-band mass-to-light ratios (m/l_k), implying that even a spitzer 8micron-selected sample would be very different from a mass-selected sample. theaverage m/l_k of the drgs is about three times higher than that of the lbgs,and drgs dominate the high-mass end. the m/l_k ratios and ages of the twosamples appear to correlate with derived stellar mass, with the most massivegalaxies being the oldest and having the highest mass-to-light ratios, similaras found in the low-redshift universe.

astro-ph;0509104	submillimeter observations of distant red galaxies: uncovering the 1mjy  850um-population	we present a study of the submillimeter (submm) emission of distant redgalaxies (drgs). the drgs are selected by the criterion (j-k)&gt;2.3, and aregenerally massive galaxies at redshifts higher than 2, with red rest-frameoptical colors. using a deep scuba submm image of a field centred on thecluster ms1054-03, we obtain a statistical detection of the drgs at redshiftz=2-3.5, with an average 850um flux density of 1.11+-0.28mjy. the detectionimplies an average star formation rate (sfr) of 127+-34 m_sun/yr (lensingcorrected), assuming that the far-infrared (fir) spectral energy distribution(sed) is well-described by a modified blackbody. the sfr derived from the submmagrees well with sfrs derived from sed fitting of optical-near-infrared dataand average x-ray emission. constant star formation models imply ages of 2gyr,extinction a_v=2.4 mag, which is consistent with the fir to rest-frame opticalluminosity ratio of ~15. drgs are older and have lower sfrs relative to opticalluminosity than (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies, although their firluminosities are similar. the drgs at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 and the extremely red objects((i-k)&gt;4) at 1&lt;z&lt;2, which were also investigated, contribute 5.7 and 5.9 jydeg^-2 respectively to the submm background. simple estimates suggest thatthese populations contribute ~50% of the flux from sources with 0.5 &lt; f_850 &lt; 5mjy, which is where the peak of energy is produced. we have therefore uncoveredone of the most important populations of galaxies contributing to the sub-mmbackground.

astro-ph;0611245	nicmos imaging of drgs in the hdf-s: a relation between star-formation  and size at z ~ 2.5	we present deep, high angular-resolution hst/nicmos imaging in the hubbledeep field south (hdf-s), focusing on a subset of 14 distant red galaxies(drgs) at z ~ 2.5 galaxies that have been pre-selected to have j-k &gt; 2.3. wefind a clear trend between the rest-frame optical sizes of these sources andtheir luminosity-weighted stellar ages as inferred from their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds). galaxies whose seds are consistent withbeing dusty and actively star forming generally show extended morphologies inthe nicmos images (r_e &gt;~ 2 kpc), while the 5 sources which are not vigorouslyforming stars are extremely compact (r_e &lt;~ 1 kpc). this trend suggests adirect link between the mean ages of the stars and the size and density of thegalaxies and supports the conjecture that early events quench star-formationand leave compact remnants. furthermore, the compact galaxies have stellarsurface mass densities which exceed those of local galaxies by more than anorder of magnitude. the existence of such massive dense galaxies presents aproblem for models of early-type galaxy formation and evolution. larger samplesof drgs and higher spatial resolution imaging will allow us to determine theuniversality of the results presented here for a small sample.

astro-ph;0611272	a narrow-band search for ly alpha emitting galaxies at z = 8.8	aims: the first star forming galaxies in the early universe should be copiously alpha emitters, and may play a significant role in ionizing theintergalactic medium (igm). it has been proposed that the luminosity functionof lya emitting galaxies beyond z~6 may be used to constrain the neutralfraction of the igm during this epoch. in this work we report on a search forly alpha emitters at redshift 8.8.  methods: we performed a narrow band imaging programme using isaac at the esovlt. seven fields, covering a total area of 31sq. arcmin and for which opticaland broad band infra-red images have been obtained in the goods survey, wereimaged to a limiting flux (respectively luminosity) of ~ 1.3 x 10^{-17}ergs.s^{-1}.cm^{-2} (respectively ~ 1.3 x 10^{43} ergs.s^{-1} in a narrow bandfilter centered in a region of low oh sky emission at 1.19 micron. candidatelyman alpha emitters are objects that are detected in the isaac nb images andundetected in the visible broad band images.  results: no z=8.8 ly alpha emitting galaxies were detected to a limitapproaching recent estimates of the luminosity function at z ~ 6. our resultsdo suggest, however, that detections or substantial constraints could beachieved by this method in the near future with larger field instrumentsplanned for various telescopes.

0812.1718	the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey i. star forming molecular gas in  virgo cluster spiral galaxies	we present large-area maps of the co j=3-2 emission obtained at the jamesclerk maxwell telescope for four spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster. wecombine these data with published co j=1-0, 24 micron, and halpha images tomeasure the co line ratios, molecular gas masses, and instantaneous gasdepletion times. for three galaxies in our sample (ngc 4254, ngc4321, and ngc4569), we obtain molecular gas masses of 7e8-3e9 msun and disk-averagedinstantaneous gas depletion times of 1.1-1.7 gyr. we argue that the co j=3-2line is a better tracer of the dense star forming molecular gas than the coj=1-0 line, as it shows a better correlation with the star formation ratesurface density both within and between galaxies. ngc 4254 appears to have alarger star formation efficiency(smaller gas depletion time), perhaps becauseit is on its first passage through the virgo cluster. ngc 4569 shows alarge-scale gradient in the gas properties traced by the co j=3-2/j=1-0 lineratio, which suggests that its interaction with the intracluster medium isaffecting the dense star-forming portion of the interstellar medium directly.the fourth galaxy in our sample, ngc 4579, has weak co j=3-2 emission despitehaving bright 24 micron emission; however, much of the central luminosity inthis galaxy may be due to the presence of a central agn.
