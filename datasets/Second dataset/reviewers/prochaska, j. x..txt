0812.4231	the connection between a lyman limit system, a very strong ovi absorber,  and galaxies at z~0.203	with a column density log n(ovi) = 14.95+/-0.05, the ovi absorber atz_abs~0.2028 observed toward the qso pks0312-77 (z_em=0.223) is the strongestyet detected at z&lt;0.5. at nearly identical redshift (z_abs=0.2026), we alsoidentify a lyman limit system (lls, log n(hi)=18.22). combining fuv and nuvspectra of pks0312-77 with optical observations of galaxies in the surroundingfield (15'x32'), we present an analysis of these absorbers and their connectionto galaxies. the observed oi/hi ratio and photoionization modelling of otherlow ions indicate the metallicity of the lls is [z/h]_lls=-0.6 and that the llsis nearly 100% photoionized. in contrast, the ovi-bearing gas is collisionallyionized at t~(3-10)x10^5 k as derived from the high-ion ratios and profilebroadenings. our galaxy survey reveals 13 (0.3&lt;l/l*&lt;1.6) galaxies at \rho&lt;2h^{-1}_{70} mpc and |\delta v|&lt;1100 km/s from the lls. a probable origin forthe lls is debris from a galaxy merger, which led to a 0.7l* galaxy([z/h]_gal=+0.15) at\rho~38 h^{-1}_{70} kpc. outflow from this galaxy may alsobe responsible for the supersolar ([z/h]_abs=+0.15), fully ionized absorber atz_abs=0.2018 (-190 km/s from the lls). the hot ovi absorber likely probescoronal gas about the 0.7 l* galaxy and/or (~0.1 kev) intragroup gas of aspiral-rich system. the association of other strong ovi absorbers with llssuggests they trace galactic and not intergalactic structures.

0901.0556	the first positive detection of molecular gas in a grb host galaxy	we report on strong h2 and co absorption from gas within the host galaxy ofgamma-ray burst (grb) 080607. analysis of our keck/lris afterglow spectrumreveals a very large hi column density (nhi = 10^22.70 cm^-2) and strongmetal-line absorption at z_grb = 3.0363 with a roughly solar metallicity. wedetect a series of a-x bandheads from co and estimate n(co) = 10^16.5 cm^-2 andt_ex^co &gt; 100k. we argue that the high excitation temperature results from uvpumping of the co gas by the grb afterglow. similarly, we observe h2 absorptionvia the lyman-werner bands and estimate n(h2) = 10^21.2 cm^-2 with t_ex^h2 =10--300k. the afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with r_v=4 anda_v=3.2 mag and requires the presence of a modest 2175a bump. additionally,modeling of the swift/xrt x-ray spectrum confirms a large column density withn(h) = 10^22.58 cm^-2. remarkably, this molecular gas has extinctionproperties, metallicity, and a co/h2 ratio comparable to those of translucentmolecular clouds of the milky way, suggesting that star formation at high zproceeds in similar environments as today. however, the integrateddust-to-metals ratio is sub-galactic, suggesting the dust is primarilyassociated with the molecular phase while the atomic gas has a much lowerdust-to-gas ratio. sightlines like grb 080607 serve as powerful probes ofnucleosynthesis and star-forming regions in the young universe and contributeto the population of "dark" grb afterglows.

0902.3661	an imaging and spectroscopic study of four strong mgii absorbers  revealed by grb060418	we present results from an imaging and spectroscopic study of four strongmgii absorbers of w(2796) &gt;~ 1 ang revealed by the afterglow of grb060418 atz_grb=1.491. these absorbers, at z=0.603,0.656,1.107 and z_grb, exhibit largeion abundances that suggest neutral gas column densities characteristic ofdamped lya systems. the imaging data include optical images obtained using lrison the keck i telescope and using acs on board hst, and near-infrared h-bandimages obtained using panic on the magellan baade telescope and k'-band imagesobtained using nirc2 with lgsao on the keck ii telescope. these images revealsix distinct objects at &lt;~ 3.5'' of the afterglow's position, two of whichexhibit well-resolved mature disk morphology, one shows red colors, and threeare blue compact sources. follow-up spectroscopic observations using lrisconfirm that one of the disk galaxies coincides with the mgii absorber atz=0.656. the observed broad-band spectral energy distributions of the seconddisk galaxy and the red source indicate that they are associated with theabsorbers at z=0.603 and z=1.107, respectively. these results show that strongmgii absorbers identified in grb afterglow spectra are associated with typicalgalaxies of luminosity ~ (0.1-1) l* at impact parameter &lt;~ 10 h^-1 kpc. theclose angular separation would preclude easy detections toward a bright quasar.finally, we associate the remaining three blue compact sources with the grbhost galaxy, noting that they are likely star-forming knots located atprojected distances 2-12 h^-1 kpc from the afterglow. at the afterglow'sposition, we derive a 2-sigma upper limit to the underlying sfr intensity of0.0074 m_sun yr^-1 kpc^-2.

0706.2364	super star cluster ngc1705-1: a local analogue to the birthsite of  long-duration gamma-ray bursts	recent observations suggest that global properties of the host galaxies forlong-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are particularly well-suited for creatingthe massive star progenitors of these grbs. motivated by the hypothesis thatmassive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-metallicity galaxies area natural birthsite for grb progenitors, we present a comparison study of theism properties along the sightline toward the super star cluster, ngc1705-1,and those in distant grb hosts. using the same set of metal transitions in theuv and applying known ism structures in ngc1705, we find that ngc1705-1resembles distant grb host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, lowmolecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dustdepletion. the lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced uv radiation fieldin the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for grbprogenitors. in addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds atr&lt;500 pc from ngc1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of c^+, si^+, and fe^+ions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow uv radiation field toproduce excited lines commonly seen in grb host ism. we further argue that theapparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionizationtransitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers importantclues for related starburst episodes in grb host galaxies. our study shows thata statistical comparison between the ism around star clusters and high-redshiftgrb progenitors is important for identifying the key physical parameters thatfacilitate the formation of grbs.

0902.4717	how do galaxies accrete gas and form stars?	great strides have been made in the last two decades in determining howgalaxies evolve from their initial dark matter seeds to the complex structureswe observe at z=0. the role of mergers has been documented through bothobservations and simulations, numerous satellites that may represent theseinitial dark matter seeds have been discovered in the local group, highredshift galaxies have been revealed with monstrous star formation rates, andthe gaseous cosmic web has been mapped through absorption line experiments.despite these efforts, the dark matter simulations that include baryons arestill unable to accurately reproduce galaxies. one of the major problems is ourincomplete understanding of how a galaxy accretes its baryons and subsequentlyforms stars. galaxy formation simulations have been unable to accuratelyrepresent the required gas physics on cosmological timescales, and observationshave only just begun to detect the star formation fuel over a range ofredshifts and environments. how galaxies obtain gas and subsequently form starsis a major unsolved, yet tractable problem in contemporary extragalacticastrophysics. in this paper we outline how progress can be made in this area inthe next decade.

0903.4487	a search for hi 21cm absorption in strong mgii absorbers in the redshift  desert	we report results from a deep search for redshifted hi 21cm absorption in 55strong mgii$\lambda$2796 absorbers (having $w (mgii) &gt; 0.5 \aa$) atintermediate redshifts, $0.58 &lt; z_{\rm abs} &lt; 1.70$, with the green banktelescope (gbt) and the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt). nine detectionsof hi 21cm absorption were obtained, all at $1.17 &lt; z_{\rm abs} &lt; 1.68$,including three systems reported earlier by gupta et al. (2007). absorption wasnot detected at $&gt; 3\sigma$ significance in 32 other mgii absorbers, with 26 ofthese providing strong upper limits to the hi 21cm optical depth,$\tau_{3\sigma} &lt; 0.013$ per $\sim 10$ km/s. for the latter 26 systems, thespin temperature $t_s$ of the absorber must be $&gt; [800 \times f]$ k (where $f$is the covering factor), if the hi column density is $\ge 2 \times 10^{20}$cm$^{-2}$, i.e. if the absorber is a damped lyman-$\alpha$ system (dla). dataon the remaining 13 systems of the sample were affected by radio frequencyinterference and were hence not useful.  excluding "associated" systems (within 3000 km/s of the quasar redshift), thedetection rate of hi 21cm absorption in strong mgii absorbers is $x_{\rm21,mgii} ({\bar z} = 1.1) = 25^{+11}_{-8}$%, at a $3\sigma$ optical depthsensitivity of $\sim 0.013$ per 10 km/s. comparing the detection rates of hi21cm and damped lyman-$\alpha$ absorption in strong mgii absorber samplesyields a detection rate of hi 21cm absorption in dlas of $x_{\rm 21,dla} ({\barz} = 1.1) = (73 \pm 27)$%, consistent with the detection rate of hi 21cmabsorption in low-$z$ dlas. since hi 21cm absorption arises in cold neutralgas, this indicates that most gas-rich galaxies contain significant fractionsof cold hi by $z \sim 1$.

0905.0001	the host galaxies of swift dark gamma-ray bursts: observational  constraints on highly obscured and very high-redshift grbs	in this work we present the first results of our imaging campaign at keckobservatory to identify the host galaxies of "dark" gamma-ray bursts (grbs),events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical fluxsignificantly fainter than expected from the observed x-ray afterglow. we findthat out of a uniform sample of 29 swift bursts rapidly observed by the palomar60-inch telescope through march 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), allevents have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxydetection, or both. our results constrain the fraction of swift grbs comingfrom very high redshift (z &gt; 7), such as the recent grb 090423, to between0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. in contrast, a significant fraction of thesample requires large extinction columns (host-frame a_v &gt; 1 mag, with severalevents showing a_v &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominantcause of the dark grb phenomenon. we infer that a significant fraction of grbs(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscuredregions. however, the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal opticalcolors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinityof the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

0906.2201	new observations of the very luminous supernova 2006gy: evidence for  echoes	supernova (sn) 2006gy was a hydrogen-rich core-collapse sn that remains oneof the most luminous optical supernovae ever observed. the total energy budget(&gt; 2 x 10^51 erg radiated in the optical alone) poses many challenges forstandard sn theory. we present new ground-based near-infrared (nir)observations of sn 2006gy, as well as a single epoch of hubble space telescope(hst) imaging obtained more than two years after the explosion. our nir datataken around peak optical emission show an evolution that is largely consistentwith a cooling blackbody, with tentative evidence for a growing nir excessstarting at day ~100. our late-time keck adaptive optics (ao) nir image, takenon day 723, shows little change from previous nir observations taken around day400. furthermore, the optical hst observations show a reduced decline rateafter day 400, and the sn is bluer on day 810 than it was at peak. thislate-time decline is inconsistent with co56 decay, and thus is problematic forthe various pair-instability sn models used to explain the nature of sn 2006gy.the slow decline of the nir emission can be explained with a light echo, and weconfirm that the late-time nir excess is the result of a massive (&gt;10 msun)dusty shell heated by the sn peak luminosity. the late-time opticalobservations require the existence of a scattered light echo, which may begenerated by the same dust that contributes to the nir echo. both the nir andoptical echoes originate in the proximity of the progenitor, ~10^18 cm for thenir echo and &lt;~10-40 pc for the optical echo, which provides further evidencethat the progenitor of sn 2006gy was a very massive star.

0907.1285	the discovery of vibrationally-excited h_2 in the molecular cloud near  grb 080607	grb 080607 has provided the first strong observational signatures ofmolecular absorption bands toward any galaxy hosting a gamma-ray burst. despitethe identification of dozens of features as belonging to various atomic andmolecular (h_2 and co) carriers, many more absorption features remainedunidentified. here we report on a search among these features for absorptionfrom vibrationally-excited h_2, a species that was predicted to be produced bythe uv flash of a grb impinging on a molecular cloud. following a detailedcomparison between our spectroscopy and static, as well as dynamic, models ofh_2* absorption, we conclude that a column density of 10^{17.5+-0.2} cm^{-2} ofh_2* was produced along the line of sight toward grb 080607. depending on theassumed amount of dust extinction between the molecular cloud and the grb, themodel distance between the two is found to be in the range 230--940 pc. such arange is consistent with a conservative lower limit of 100 pc estimated fromthe presence of mg i in the same data. these distances show that substantialmolecular material is found within hundreds of pc from grb 080607, part of thedistribution of clouds within the grb host galaxy.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

1003.0444	probing fundamental constant evolution with neutral atomic gas lines	we have detected narrow hi 21cm and ci absorption at $z \sim 1.4 - 1.6$towards q0458$-$020 and q2337$-$011, and use these lines to test for possiblechanges in the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the proton-electron mass ratio$\mu$, and the proton gyromagnetic ratio $g_p$. a comparison between the hi21cm and ci line redshifts yields $\delta x/x = [+6.8 \pm 1.0] \times 10^{-6}$over $0 &lt; &lt;z&gt; \le 1.46$, where $x = g_p \alpha^2/\mu$, and the errors arepurely statistical, from the gaussian fits. the simple line profiles and thehigh sensitivity of the spectra imply that statistical errors in thiscomparison are an order of magnitude lower than in previous studies. further,the ci lines arise in cold neutral gas that also gives rise to hi 21cmabsorption, and both background quasars are core-dominated, reducing thelikelihood of systematic errors due to local velocity offsets between thehyperfine and resonance lines. the dominant source of systematic error lies inthe absolute wavelength calibration of the optical spectra, which appearsuncertain to $\sim 2$ km/s, yielding a maximum error in $\delta x/x$ of $\sim6.7 \times 10^{-6}$. including this, we obtain $\delta x/x = [+6.8 \pm 1.0(statistical) \pm 6.7 (max. systematic)] \times 10^{-6}$ over $0 &lt; &lt;z&gt; \le1.46$. using literature constraints on $\delta \mu/\mu$, this is inconsistentwith claims of a smaller value of $\alpha$ from the many-multiplet method,unless fractional changes in $g_p$ are larger than those in $\alpha$ and $\mu$.

1004.2900	afterglow observations of fermi-lat gamma-ray bursts and the emerging  class of hyper-energetic events	we present broadband (radio, optical, and x-ray) light curves and spectra ofthe afterglows of four long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs 090323, 090328,090902b, and 090926a) detected by the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) and largearea telescope (lat) instruments on the fermi satellite. with its wide spectralbandpass, extending to gev energies, fermi is sensitive to grbs with very largeisotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). although rare, these events areparticularly important for testing grb central-engine models. when combinedwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are ableto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburstmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of theoutflows. in agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativisticenergy budget of at least one of these events (grb 090926a) exceeds thecanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. such energies pose asevere challenge for models in which the grb is powered by a magnetar orneutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectationsfor magneto-hydrodynamical (mhd) collapsar models. our jet opening angles(theta) are similar to those found for pre-fermi grbs, but the large initiallorentz factors (gamma_0) inferred from the detection of gev photons implytheta gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in mhd models ofjet acceleration. finally, we find that these fermi-lat events preferentiallyoccur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that thismight result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicityprogenitor stars. future studies of fermi-lat afterglows in the radio with theorder-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the evla shoulddefinitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events.

0709.2382	a direct precision measurement of the intergalactic lyman-alpha opacity  at 2&lt;z&lt;4.2	we directly measure the evolution of the intergalactic lya effective opticaldepth, tau_eff, over the redshift range 2&lt;z&lt;4.2 from a sample of 86high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise quasar spectra obtained with the esi andhires spectrographs on keck, and with the mike spectrograph on magellan. thisrepresents an improvement over previous analyses of the lya forest fromhigh-resolution spectra in this redshift interval of a factor of two in thesize of the data set alone. we pay particular attention to robust errorestimation and extensively test for systematic effects. we find that ourestimates of the quasar continuum levels in the lya forest obtained by splinefitting are systematically biased low, with the magnitude of the biasincreasing with redshift, but that this bias can be accounted for using mockspectra. the mean fractional error is &lt;1% at z=2, 4% at z=3, and 12% at z=4.previous measurements of tau_eff at z&gt;~3 based on directly fitting the quasarcontinua in the lya forest, which have generally neglected this effect, aretherefore likely biased low. we provide estimates of the level of absorptionarising from metals in the lya forest based on both direct and statisticalmetal removal results in the literature, finding that this contribution is~6-9% at z=3 and decreases monotonically with redshift. the high precision ofour measurement, attaining 3% in redshift bins of width delta z=0.2 around z=3,indicates significant departures from the best-fit power-law redshift evolution(tau_eff=0.0018(1+z)^3.92, when metals are left in), particularly near z=3.2.the observed downward departure is statistically consistent with a similarfeature detected in a precision statistical measurement using sloan digital skysurvey spectra by bernardi and coworkers using an independent approach.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1105.4601	the gas-galaxy connection at z = 0.35: ovi and hi absorption towards  j0943+0531	we present observations of hi and ovi absorption systems proximate to agalaxy at z_gal = 0.3529. the absorption was detected serendipitously in cosmicorigins spectrograph observations of the low-z qso j0943+0531 (z_qso = 0.564).the data show two separate clouds along the sightline at an impact parameter of95kpc from the galaxy. the first is likely low-metallicity gas falling onto thegalaxy. this assessment is based on the high velocity offset of the cloud fromthe galaxy (delta_v = 365kms) and the weak metal line absorption, combined withphotoionization modeling. the second cloud, with only a modest velocityseparation from the galaxy (delta_v = 85kms), exhibits very strong oviabsorption qualitatively similar to ovi absorption seen in the milky way halo.collisional ionization equilibrium models are ruled out by the metal linecolumn density ratios. photoionization modeling implies a length-scale for theovi cloud of ~0.1-1.2mpc, which indicates the absorbing gas most likely resideswithin the local filamentary structure. this system emphasizes that kinematicassociation alone is not sufficient to establish a physical connection togalaxies, even at small impact parameters and velocity separations.observations such as these, connecting galaxies with their gaseousenvironments, are becoming increasingly important for understanding galaxyevolution and provide constraints for cosmological simulations.

1107.3352	constraining grb emission physics with extensive early-time, multiband  follow-up	understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible forgamma-ray bursts (grbs) remains a pressing challenge. while prompt andcontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to testpredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaginghas been conducted for only a few grbs. we present rich, early-time, multibanddatasets for two \swift\ events, grb 110205a and grb 110213a. the former showsoptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by thesteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\alpha}$ with$\alpha=-6.13 \pm 0.75$). we discuss this feature in the context of thereverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay asbeing forward-shock dominated. polarization measurements, obtained with theringo2 instrument mounted on the liverpool telescope, also provide hints on thenature of the emitting ejecta. the latter event, instead, displays a verypeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. inthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,signifying a late-time activity of the central engine.

1109.1813	multiwavelength observations of a0620-00 in quiescence	[abridged.] we present multiwavelength observations of the black hole binarysystem, a0620-00. using the cosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble spacetelescope, we have obtained the first fuv spectrum of a0620-00. the observedspectrum is flat in the fuv and very faint (with continuum fluxes \simeq 1e -17 ergs/cm^2/s/a). we compiled the dereddened, broadband spectral energydistribution of a0620-00 and compared it to previous seds as well astheoretical models. the seds show that the source varies at all wavelengths forwhich we have multiple samples. contrary to previous observations, theoptical-uv spectrum does not continue to drop to shorter wavelengths, butinstead shows a recovery and an increasingly blue spectrum in the fuv. wecreated an optical-uv spectrum of a0620-00 with the donor star contributionremoved. the non-stellar spectrum peaks at \simeq3000 {\deg}a. the peak can befit with a t=10,000 k blackbody with a small emitting area, probablyoriginating in the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the outer disk.however, one or more components in addition to the blackbody are needed to fitthe fuv upturn and the red optical fluxes in the optical-uv spectrum. bycomparing the mass accretion rate determined from the hot spot luminosity tothe mean accretion rate inferred from the outburst history, we find that thelatter is an order of magnitude smaller than the former, indicating that\sim90% of the accreted mass must be lost from the system if the predictions ofthe disk instability model and the estimated interoutburst interval arecorrect. the mass accretion rate at the hot spot is 10^5 the accretion rate atthe black hole inferred from the x-ray luminosity. to reconcile these requiresthat outflows carry away virtually all of the accreted mass, a very low rate ofmass transfer from the outer cold disk into the inner hot region, and/orradiatively inefficient accretion.

1110.4557	the first observations of low-redshift damped lyman-{\alpha} systems  with the cosmic origins spectrograph: chemical abundances and affiliated  galaxies	we present cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) measurements of metal abundancesin eight 0.083&lt;z&lt;0.321 damped lyman-\alpha (dla) and sub-damped ly-\alpha\absorption systems serendipitously discovered in the cos-halos survey. we findthat these systems show a large range in metallicities, with -1.10&lt;[z/h]&lt;0.31,similar to the spread found at higher redshifts. these low-redshift systems onaverage have subsolar metallicities, but do show a rise in metallicity overcosmic time when compared to higher-redshift systems. we find the averagesub-dla metallicity is higher than the average dla metallicity at allredshifts. nitrogen is underabundant with respect to \alpha-group elements inall but perhaps one of the absorbers. in some cases, [n/\alpha] issignificantly below the lowest nitrogen measurements in nearby galaxies.systems for which depletion patterns can be studied show little, if any,depletion, which is characteristic of milky way halo-type gas. we also identifyaffiliated galaxies for 3 of the sub-dlas using spectra obtained fromkeck/lris. none of these sub-dlas arise in the stellar disks of luminousgalaxies; instead, these absorbers may exist in galaxy halos at impactparameters ranging from 38 to 92 kpc. multiple galaxies are present near two ofthe sub-dlas, and galaxy interactions may play a role in the dispersal of thegas. many of these low-redshift absorbers exhibit simple kinematics, but onesub-dla has a complicated mix of at least 13 components spread over 150 km/s.we find three galaxies near this sub-dla, which also suggests that galaxyinteractions roil the gas. this study reinforces the view that dlas have avariety of origins, and low-redshift studies are crucial for understandingabsorber-galaxy connections.

1211.6528	an independent measurement of the incidence of mgii absorbers along  gamma-ray burst sightlines: the end of the mystery?	in 2006, prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement ofvery strong mg ii absorption systems intervening the sightlines to gamma-raybursts (grbs) relative to the in- cidence of such absorption along quasarsightlines. this counterintuitive result, has inspired a diverse set ofastrophysical explanations (e.g. dust, gravitational lensing) but none of thesehas obviously resolved the puzzle. using the largest set of grb afterglowspectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. in an independentsample of grb spectra with a survey path 3 times larger than prochter et al.,we measure the incidence per unit redshift of $\geq 1$\aa rest-frame equivalentwidth mg ii absorbers at $z \approx 1$ to be l(z)= 0.18 $\pm$ 0.06. this isfully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbersalong quasar sightlines. therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancementand suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. signatures of theoriginal result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an $\approx 1.5$enhancement over l(z)qso), but the statistical significance now lies at$\approx 90%$ c.l. restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolutionspectra of grb afterglows (which overlaps substantially with prochter et al.),we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of mg ii absorption.the reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is noconnection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (orechellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong mg ii doublets. onlya larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on thismatter.

1301.5903	a population of massive, luminous galaxies hosting heavily dust-obscured  gamma-ray bursts: implications for the use of grbs as tracers of cosmic star  formation	we present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavilydust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swift satellite duringthe years 2005-2009, representing all grbs with an unambiguous host-frameextinction of a_v&gt;1 mag from this period. deep observations with keck, gemini,vlt, hst, and spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establishspectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us toprovide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellarmasses, and mean extinctions. compared to the hosts of unobscured grbs atsimilar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured grbs are (onaverage) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidlystar-forming and dust-obscured. while this demonstrates that grbs populate alltypes of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems atz~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall grb population continues to show ahighly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference forlow-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely sfr-selectedgalaxy sample. this supports the notion that the grb rate is strongly dependenton metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the universeunderwent a transition in their chemical properties ~9 gyr ago. we alsoconclude that, based on the absence of unobscured grbs in massive galaxies andthe absence of obscured grbs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions ofthe lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, whileintermediate-mass galaxies (~10^9 m_sun) have diverse internal properties.

1312.3640	the spin temperature of high-redshift damped lyman-$\alpha$ systems	we report results from a programme aimed at investigating the temperature ofneutral gas in high-redshift damped lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (dlas). thisinvolved (1) hi 21cm absorption studies of a large dla sample, (2) vlbi studiesto measure the low-frequency quasar core fractions, and (3) optical/ultravioletspectroscopy to determine dla metallicities and velocity widths.  including literature data, our sample consists of 37 dlas with estimates ofthe spin temperature $t_s$ and the covering factor. we find a strong $4\sigma$)difference between the $t_s$ distributions in high-z (z&gt;2.4) and low-z (z&lt;2.4)dla samples. the high-z sample contains more systems with high $t_s$ values,$\gtrsim 1000$ k. the $t_s$ distributions in dlas and the galaxy are alsoclearly (~$6\sigma$) different, with more high-$t_s$ sightlines in dlas than inthe milky way. the high $t_s$ values in the high-z dlas of our sample arise dueto low fractions of the cold neutral medium.  for 29 dlas with metallicity [z/h] estimates, we confirm the presence of ananti-correlation between $t_s$ and [z/h], at $3.5\sigma$ significance via anon-parametric kendall-tau test. this result was obtained with the assumptionthat the dla covering factor is equal to the core fraction. monte carlosimulations show that the significance of the result is only marginallydecreased if the covering factor and the core fraction are uncorrelated, or ifthere is a random error in the inferred covering factor.  we also find evidence for redshift evolution in dla $t_s$ values even for thez&gt;1 sub-sample. since z&gt;1 dlas have angular diameter distances comparable to orlarger than those of the background quasars, they have similar efficiency incovering the quasars. low covering factors in high-z dlas thus cannot accountfor the observed redshift evolution in spin temperatures.

(2008) suggested that this grb came from thecollapse of a massive star and that the grb site was a region with propertiesdifferent from the rest of the galaxy. we reobserved the galaxy in high spatialresolution using the vimos integral-field unit (ifu) at the vlt with a spaxelsize of 0.67 arcsec. furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data fromhires/keck at two different slit positions covering the grb site, the center ofthe galaxy and an hii region next to the grb region. we compare the propertiesof different hii regions in the galaxy with the grb site and study the globaland local kinematic properties of this galaxy. the resolved data show that thegrb site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 z_solar, butits specific sfr (ssfr) of 7.4 m_solar/yr/l/l* and age (determined by thehalpha ew) are similar to other hii regions in the host. the galaxy shows agradient in metallicity and ssfr from the bulge to the outskirts as it iscommon for spiral galaxies. this gives further support to the theory that grbsprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in s-typegalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.kinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for largeperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. this studyconfirms the collapsar origin of grb060505 but reveals that the properties ofthe hii region surrounding the grb were not unique to that galaxy. spatiallyresolved observations are key to know the implications and interpretations ofunresolved grb hosts observations at higher redshifts.

0705.1650	a new comprehensive set of elemental abundances in dlas iii. star  formation histories	we obtained comprehensive sets of elemental abundances for eleven dampedly-alpha systems (dlas) at z_dla=1.7-2.5. in paper i of this series, we showedfor three dla galaxies that we can derive their star formation histories andages from a detailed comparison of their intrinsic abundance patterns withchemical evolution models. we determine in this paper the star formationproperties of six additional dla galaxies. the derived results confirm that nosingle star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patternsin dlas. we demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducingthe dla abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst andquiescent spiral galaxies. independent of the star formation history, the dlashave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models withhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. all the derived dla starformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 &lt;log sfr &lt; -1.1 m_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. the dla abundance patterns require alarge spread in ages ranging from 20 myr up to 3 gyr. the oldest dla in oursample is observed at z_dla=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 gyr; itnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f&gt;10. but, most of thedlas show ages much younger than that of the universe at the epoch ofobservation. young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift universe atz&gt;2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for mosthigh-redshift galaxies. the dla star formation properties are compared withthose of other high-redshift galaxies identified in deep imaging surveys withthe aim of obtaining a global picture of high-redshift objects.

1412.6530	a detailed study of the optical attenuation of gamma-ray bursts in the  swift era	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry of 28 gamma-ray bursts(grbs) detected by the \textit{swift} satellite and rapidly observed by thereionization and transients infrared/optical (ratir) camera. we compare theoptical flux at fiducial times of 5.5 and 11 hours after the high-energytrigger to that in the x-ray regime to quantify optical darkness. 46$\pm$9 percent (13/28) of all bursts in our sample and 55$\pm$10 per cent (13/26) of longgrbs are optically dark, which is statistically consistently with previousstudies. fitting ratir optical and nir spectral energy distributions (seds) of19 grbs, most (6/7) optically dark grbs either occur at high-redshift ($z&gt;4.5$)or have a high dust content in their host galaxies ($a_{\rm v} &gt; 0.3$).performing k-s tests, we compare the ratir sample to those previously presentedin the literature, finding our distributions of redshift, optical darkness,host dust extinction and x-ray derived column density to be consistent. the onereported discrepancy is with host galaxy dust content in the bat6 sample, whichappears inconsistent with our sample and other previous literature. comparingx-ray derived host galaxy hydrogen column densities to host galaxy dustextinction, we find that grbs tend to occur in host galaxies with a highermetal-to-dust ratio than our own galaxy, more akin to the large and smallmagellanic clouds. finally, to mitigate time evolution of optical darkness, wemeasure $\beta_{\rm ox,rest}$ at a fixed rest frame time, $t_{\rm rest}=1.5$hours and fixed rest frame energies in the x-ray and optical regimes. choosingto evaluate optical flux at $\lambda_{\rm rest}=0.25~\mu$m, we removehigh-redshift as a source of optical darkness, demonstrating that opticaldarkness must result from either high-redshift, dust content in the host galaxyalong the grb sight line, or a combination of the two.

1503.02075	the first ultraviolet quasar stacked spectrum at z=2.4 from wfc3	the ionising continuum from active galactic nuclei (agn) is fundamental forinterpreting their broad emission lines and understanding their impact on thesurrounding gas. furthermore, it provides hints on how matter accretes ontosupermassive black holes. using hst's wide field camera 3 we have constructedthe first stacked ultraviolet (rest-frame wavelengths 600-2500\aa) spectrum of53 luminous quasars at z=2.4, with a state-of-the-art correction for theintervening lyman forest and lyman continuum absorption. the continuum slope($f_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha_\nu}$) of the full sample shows a break at ~912\aa\with spectral index $\alpha_\nu=-0.61\pm0.01$ at $\lambda&gt;912$\aa\ and asoftening at shorter wavelengths ($\alpha_\nu=-1.70 \pm 0.61$ at $\lambda\leq912$\aa). our analysis proves that a proper intergalactic medium absorptioncorrection is required to establish the intrinsic continuum emission ofquasars. we interpret our average ultraviolet spectrum in the context ofphotoionisation, accretion disk models, and quasar contribution to theultraviolet background. we find that observed broad line ratios are consistentwith those predicted assuming an ionising slope of $\alpha_\mathrm{ion}=$-2.0,similar to the observed ionising spectrum in the same wavelength range. thecontinuum break and softening are consistent with accretion disk plus x-raycorona models when black hole spin is taken into account. our spectral energydistribution yields a 30% increase to previous estimates of the specific quasaremissivity, such that quasars may contribute significantly to the totalspecific lyman limit emissivity estimated from the ly$\alpha$ forest at z&lt;3.2.

1509.07515	a highly-ionized region surrounding sn refsdal revealed by muse	supernova (sn) refsdal is the first multiply-imaged, highly-magnified, andspatially-resolved sn ever observed. the sn exploded in a highly-magnifiedspiral galaxy at z=1.49 behind the frontier fields cluster macs1149, andprovides a unique opportunity to study the environment of sne at high z. weexploit the time delay between multiple images to determine the properties ofthe sn and its environment, before, during, and after the sn exploded. we usethe integral-field spectrograph muse on the vlt to simultaneously target allobserved and model-predicted positions of sn refsdal. we find mgii emission atall positions of sn refsdal, accompanied by weak feii* emission at twopositions. the measured ratios of [oii] to mgii emission of 10-20 indicate ahigh degree of ionization with low metallicity. because the same high degree ofionization is found in all images, and our spatial resolution is too coarse toresolve the region of influence of sn refsdal, we conclude that this highdegree of ionization has been produced by previous sne or a young and hotstellar population. we find no variability of the [oii] line over a period of57 days. this suggests that there is no variation in the [oii] luminosity ofthe sn over this period, or that the sn has a small contribution to theintegrated [oii] emission over the scale resolved by our observations.

1509.09234	the central engine of grb 130831a and the energy breakdown of a  relativistic explosion	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most luminous explosions in the universe, yetthe nature and physical properties of their energy sources are far fromunderstood. very important clues, however, can be inferred by studying theafterglows of these events. we present optical and x-ray observations of grb130831a obtained by swift, chandra, skynet, ratir, maidanak, ison, not, lt andgtc. this burst shows a steep drop in the x-ray light-curve at $\simeq 10^5$ safter the trigger, with a power-law decay index of $\alpha \sim 6$. such a rarebehaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (fs) model andindicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at $10^5$ s, must be of"internal origin", produced by a dissipation process within anultrarelativistic outflow. we propose that the source of such an outflow, whichmust produce the x-ray flux for $\simeq 1$ day in the cosmological rest frame,is a newly born magnetar or black hole. after the drop, the faint x-rayafterglow continues with a much shallower decay. the optical emission, on theother hand, shows no break across the x-ray steep decrease, and the late-timedecays of both the x-ray and optical are consistent. using both the x-ray andoptical data, we show that the emission after $\simeq 10^5$ s can be explainedwell by the fs model. we model our data to derive the kinetic energy of theejecta and thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a grb withemission of internal origin visible for a long time. furthermore, we break downthe energy budget of this grb into the prompt emission, the late internaldissipation, the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it withthe energy of the associated supernova, sn 2013fu.

0807.0930	probing feedback in protogalaxies: multiphase gas in a dla at z~2.4	we investigate the physical processes occuring in the multiphase gas of adamped ly\alpha system (dla). we base our analysis on a high quality keck hiresspectrum of the qso j1211+0422 in which a dla is detected at z=2.377. there islittle contamination of the high-ion (ovi, nv, civ, siiv) absorption, allowingus to explore the properties of the highly ionized gas and its connection toother gas-phases. the metallicity ([z/h]=-1.41+/-0.08), hi column density (logn(hi)=20.80+/-0.10), full-width velocity (\delta(v_ neut)=70 km/s) and relativeabundances ([si/fe]=+0.23+/-0.05 and [n/si]=-0.88+/-0.07) of this dla are notunusual. however, we derive the lowest cii* cooling rate in a dla, l_c &lt;10^{-27.8} erg/s per h atom (3\sigma). using this stringent limit, we show thatthe neutral gas (confined at |v|&lt;+39 km/s) must be warm and the star formationrate is &lt;7.1x10^{-3} m_odot/yr/kpc^2. surprisingly, the gas shows strong,complex absorption profiles from highly ionized gas whose kinematics appearconnected to each other and the low ions. the total amount of highly and weaklyionized gas is very large with n(hii)/n(hi)&gt;1.5. at |v|&gt;+39 km/s, the gas isfully and highly ionized (h+/h~1, n(civ)&gt;&gt;n(cii), n(siiv)&gt;&gt;n(siii)). based onionization models, ovi and nv are generally difficult to produce by hardphotons, while siiv and civ can be photoionized to a large extent. there is,however, no evidence of ovi-bearing gas at t~10^6 k associated with this dla.in contrast, there is some evidence for narrow ovi, nv, and civ components(unexplained by photoionization), implying too low temperatures (t &lt; 10^5 k)for simple collisional ionization models to produce their observed columndensities. stellar feedback is a possible source for producing the high ions,but we cannot rule out accretion of non-pristine material onto the protogalaxy.

astro-ph;0012419	possible evidence for a variable fine structure constant from qso  absorption lines: motivations, analysis and results	an experimental search for variation in the fundamental coupling constants isstrongly motivated by modern high-energy physics theories. comparison of quasarabsorption line spectra with laboratory spectra provides a sensitive probe forvariability of the fine structure constant, alpha, over cosmologicaltime-scales. we have previously developed and applied a new method providing anorder of magnitude gain in precision over previous optical astrophysicalconstraints. here we extend that work by including new quasar spectra of dampedlyman-alpha absorption systems. we also re-analyse our previous lower redshiftdata and confirm our initial results. the constraints on alpha come fromsimultaneous fitting of absorption lines of subsets of the following species:mg i, mg ii, al ii, al iii, si ii, cr ii, fe ii, ni ii and zn ii. we present adetailed description of our methods and results based on an analysis of 49quasar absorption systems (towards 28 qsos) covering the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z&lt; 3.5. there is statistical evidence for a smaller alpha at earlier epochs:da/a = (-0.72 +/- 0.18) * 10^{-5}. the new and original samples are independentbut separately yield consistent and significant non-zero values of da/a. wesummarise the results of a thorough investigation of systematic effectspublished in a companion paper. the value we quote above is the raw value, notcorrected for any of these systematic effects. the only significant systematiceffects so far identified, if removed from our data, would lead to a moresignificant deviation of da/a from zero.

astro-ph;0505480	closing in on a short-hard burst progenitor: constraints from early-time  optical imaging and spectroscopy of a possible host galaxy of grb 050509b	the localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 050509b was awatershed event. thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the grb position byswift, we began imaging the grb field 8 minutes after the burst and continuedfor the following 8 days. no convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow orsupernova was found for the object. we present a re-analysis of the xrtafterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4" to the west of the xrtposition reported previously. close to this position is a bright ellipticalgalaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster ofgalaxies. based on positional coincidences, the grb and the bright ellipticalare likely to be physically related. we thus have discovered evidence that atleast some short-duration, hard-spectra grbs arise at cosmological distances.however, while grb 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration grbs, wedemonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy isconsistent with that of long-duration grbs. based on this analysis, on thelocation of the grb (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there isnow observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts ariseduring the merger of a compact binary. we limit the properties of ali-paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' other progenitor models are still viable, andadditional rapidly localized bursts from the swift mission will undoubtedlyhelp to further clarify the progenitor picture.

astro-ph;0510022	the galaxy hosts and large-scale environments of short-hard gamma-ray  bursts	the rapid succession of discovery of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs hasled to unprecedented insights into the energetics of the explosion and natureof the progenitors. yet short of the detection of a smoking gun, like a burstof coincident gravitational radiation or a li-paczynski mini-supernova, it isunlikely that a definitive claim can be made for the progenitors. as was thecase with long--duration soft--spectrum grbs, however, the expectation is thata systematic study of the hosts and the locations of short grbs could begin toyield fundamental clues about their nature. we present the first aggregatestudy of the host galaxies of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs. inparticular, we present the gemini--north and keck discovery spectra of thegalaxies that hosted three short grbs and a moderate--resolution (r~6000)spectrum of a fourth host. we find that these short--hard grbs originate in avariety of low-redshift (z&lt;1) environments that differ substantially from thoseof long--soft grbs, both on individual galaxy scales and on galaxy--clusterscales. specifically, three of the bursts are found to be associated with oldand massive galaxies with no current (&lt; 0.1 msol/hr) or recent star formation.two of these galaxies are located within a cluster environment. theseobservations support an origin from the merger of compact stellar remnants,such as double neutron stars of a neutron star--black hole binary. the fourthevent, in contrast, occurred within a dwarf galaxy with a star formation rateexceeding 0.5 msol/yr. therefore, it appears that like supernovae of type ia,the progenitors of short--hard bursts are created in all galaxy types,suggesting a corresponding class with a wide distribution of delay timesbetween formation and explosion.

astro-ph;0511031	a new comprehensive set of elemental abundances in dlas - ii. data  analysis and chemical variation studies	we present new elemental abundance studies of seven damped lyman-alphasystems (dlas). together with the four dlas analyzed in dessauges-zavadsky etal. (2004), we have a sample of eleven dla galaxies with uniquely comprehensiveand homogeneous abundance measurements. these observations allow one to studythe abundance patterns of 22 elements and the chemical variations in theinterstellar medium of galaxies outside the local group. comparing thegas-phase abundance ratios of these high redshift galaxies, we found that theyshow low rms dispersions, reaching only up 2-3 times the statistical errors forthe majority of elements. this uniformity is remarkable given that the quasarsightlines cross gaseous regions with hi column densities spanning over oneorder of magnitude and metallicities ranging from 1/55 to 1/5 solar. thegas-phase abundance patterns of interstellar medium clouds within the dlagalaxies detected along the velocity profiles show, on the other hand, a highdispersion in several abundance ratios, indicating that chemical variationsseem to be more confined to individual clouds within the dla galaxies than tointegrated profiles. the analysis of the cloud-to-cloud chemical variationswithin seven individual dlas reveals that five of them show statisticallysignificant variations, higher than 0.2 dex at more than 3 sigma. the sourcesof these variations are both the differential dust depletion and/or ionizationeffects; however, no evidence for variations due to different star formationhistories could be highlighted. these observations place large constraints onthe mixing timescales of protogalaxies and on scenarios of galaxy formationwithin the cdm hierarchical theory. finally, we provide an astrophysicaldetermination of the oscillator strength of the niii 1317 transition.

astro-ph;0512081	grb 050408: an atypical gamma-ray burst as a probe of an atypical  galactic environment	the bright grb 050408 was localized by hete-ii near local midnight, enablingan impressive ground-based followup effort as well as space-based followup fromswift. the swift data from the x-ray telescope (xrt) and our own opticalphotometry and spectrum of the afterglow provide the cornerstone for ouranalysis. under the traditional assumption that the visible waveband was abovethe peak synchrotron frequency and below the cooling frequency, the opticalphotometry from 0.03 to 5.03 days show an afterglow decay corresponding to anelectron energy index of p_lc = 2.05 +/- 0.04, without a jet break as suggestedby others. a break is seen in the x-ray data at early times (at ~12600 secafter the grb). the spectral slope of the optical spectrum is consistent withp_lc assuming a host-galaxy extinction of a_v = 1.18 mag. the optical-nirbroadband spectrum is also consistent with p = 2.05, but prefers a_v = 0.57mag. the x-ray afterglow shows a break at 1.26 x 10^4 sec, which may be theresult of a refreshed shock. this burst stands out in that the optical andx-ray data suggest a large h i column density of n_hi ~ 10^22 cm^-2; it is verylikely a damped lyman alpha system and so the faintness of the host galaxy (m_v&gt; -18 mag) is noteworthy. moreover, we detect extraordinarily strong ti iiabsorption lines with a column density through the grb host that exceeds thelargest values observed for the milky way by an order of magnitude.furthermore, the ti ii equivalent width is in the top 1% of mg iiabsorption-selected qsos. this suggests that the large-scale environment of grb050408 has significantly lower ti depletion than the milky way and a largevelocity width (delta v &gt; 200 km/s).

astro-ph;0601655	where is the molecular hydrogen in damped lyman-alpha absorbers?	we show in this paper why molecular millimeter absorption line searches indlas have been unsuccessful. we use co emission line maps of local galaxies toderive the h2 column density distribution function f(n_h2) at z=0. we show thatit forms a natural extension to f(n_hi): the h2 distribution exceeds f(n_hi) atn_h ~ 10^22 cm^-2 and exhibits a power law drop-off with slope ~ -2.5.approximately 97% of the h2 mass density rho_h2 is in systems above n_h2=10^21cm^-2. we derive a value rho_h2 = 1.1 x 10^7 h_70 m_sun mpc^-3, which is ~25%the mass density of atomic hydrogen. yet, the redshift number density of h2above this n_h2 limit is only ~3 x 10^-4, a factor 150 lower than that for hiin dlas at z=0. furthermore, we show that the median impact parameter between an_h2&gt;10^21 cm^-2 absorber and the centre of the galaxy hosting the h2 gas isonly 2.5 kpc. based on arguments related to the schmidt law, we argue that h2gas above this column density limit is associated with a large fraction of theintegral star formation rate density. even allowing for an increased molecularmass density at higher redshifts, the derived cross-sections indicate that itis very unlikely to identify the bulk of the molecular gas in present quasarabsorption lines samples. we discuss the prospects for identifying thismolecular mass in future surveys.

astro-ph;0605075	on the incidence of strong mgii absorbers along grb sightlines	we report on a survey for strong (rest equivalent width w_r &gt;= 1a),intervening mgii systems along the sightlines to long-duration gamma-ray bursts(grbs). the grb spectra which comprise the survey have a heterogeneous mix ofresolution and wavelength coverage, but we implement a strict, uniform set ofsearch criteria to derive a well-defined statistical sample. we identify 15strong mgii absorbers along 14 grb sightlines (nearly every sightline exhibitsat least one absorber) with spectra covering a total pathlength delta z = 15.5at a mean redshift &lt;z&gt; = 1.1. in contrast, the predicted incidence of suchabsorber systems along the same path length to quasar sightlines is only 3.8.the roughly four times higher incidence along grb sightlines is inconsistentwith a statistical fluctuation at greater than 99.9% c.l. several effects couldexplain the result: (i) dust within the mgii absorbers obscures faint quasarsgiving a lower observed incidence along quasar sightlines; (ii) the gas isintrinsic to the grb event; (iii) the grb are gravitationally lensed by theseabsorbers. we present strong arguments against the first two effects and alsoconsider lensing to be an unlikely explanation. the results suggest that atleast one of our fundamental beliefs on absorption line research is flawed.

astro-ph;0606763	when do internal shocks end and external shocks begin? early-time  broadband modelling of grb 051111	even with the renaissance in gamma-ray burst (grb) research fostered by theswift satellite, few bursts have both contemporaneous observations at longwavelengths and exquisite observations at later times across theelectromagnetic spectrum. we present here contemporaneous imaging with the kaitrobotic optical telescope, dense optical sampling with lulin, and supplementedwith infrared data from pairitel and radio to gamma-ray data from theliterature. for the first time, we can test the constancy of microphysicalparameters in the internal-external shock paradigm and carefully trace the flowof energy from the grb to the surrounding medium. kait data taken &lt;~1 minuteafter the start of grb051111 and coinciding with the fading gamma-ray tail ofthe prompt emission indicate a smooth re-injection of energy into the shock. nocolor change is apparent in observations beginning ~1.5 minutes after the grband lasting for the first hour after the burst. there are achromatic fluxmodulations about the best-fit model at late (t~10^4 s) times, possibly due tovariations in the external density. we find that the host-galaxy extinction iswell fit by a curve similar to that ofthe small magellanic cloud. low visualextinction, a_v~0.2 mag, combined with high column densities determined fromthe x-ray and optical spectroscopy (n_h&gt; 10^21 cm^-2), indicate a lowdust-to-metals ratio and a possible over-abundance of the light metals. anapparent small ratio of total to selective extinction (r_v~2) argues againstdust destruction by the grb. time constancy of both the ir/optical/uv spectralenergy distribution and the soft x-ray absorption suggests that the absorbingmaterial is not local to the grb.

astro-ph;0607223	a putative early-type host galaxy for grb 060502b: implications for the  progenitors of short-duration hard-spectrum bursts	starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-durationhard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (shb) by swift last year, a growing body ofevidence has suggested that shbs are associated with an older andlower-redshift galactic population than long-soft grbs and, in a few cases,with large (&gt;~ 10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putativehost galaxies. here we present observations of the field of grb 060502b, a shbdetected by swift and localized by the x-ray telescope (xrt). we find a massivered galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1 arcsec fromour revised xrt position. using associative and probabilistic arguments wesuggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of grb 060502b. if true, thisoffset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73 +- 19 kpc inprojection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any shb to date andalmost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset.spectra and modeling of the star-formation history of this possible host showit to have undergone a large ancient starburst. if the progenitor of grb060502b was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the grb explosionsince birth is tau = 1.3 +- 0.2 gyr and the minimum kick velocity of the shbprogenitor is v_kick = 55 +- 15 km/s.

astro-ph;0703538	the troublesome broadband evolution of grb 061126: does a grey burst  imply grey dust?	we report on observations of a gamma-ray burst (grb 061126) with an extremelybright (r ~ 12 mag at peak) early-time optical afterglow. the optical afterglowis already fading as a power law 22 seconds after the trigger, with nodetectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident witha large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. the optical--infrared photometricspectral energy distribution is an excellent fit to a power law, but itexhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 safter the burst. this color change is contemporaneous with a switch from arelatively fast decay to slower decay. the rapidly decaying early afterglow isbroadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a brightforward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time x-rayobservations under the assumptions of standard afterglow models is notobserved. indeed, despite its remarkable early-time brightness, this burstwould qualify as a dark burst at later times on the basis of its nearly flatoptical-to-x-ray spectral index. our photometric spectral energy distributionprovides no evidence of host-galaxy extinction, requiring either largequantities of grey dust in the host system (at redshift 1.1588 +/- 0.0006,based upon our late-time keck spectroscopy) or separate physical origins forthe x-ray and optical afterglows.

0809.2608	high-redshift starbursting dwarf galaxies revealed by grb afterglows	we present a study of 15 long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies atz&gt;2. the grbs are selected with available early-time afterglow spectra in orderto compare interstellar medium (ism) absorption-line properties with stellarproperties of the host galaxies. in addition to five previously studied hosts,we consider new detections for the host galaxies of grb050820 and grb060206 andplace 2-sigma upper limits to the luminosities of the remaining unidentifiedhosts. we examine the nature of the host galaxy population and find that (1)the uv luminosity distribution of grb host galaxies is consistent withexpectations from a uv luminosity weighted random galaxy population with amedian luminosity of &lt;l(uv)&gt;=0.1 l*; (2) there exists a moderate correlationbetween uv luminosity and siii 1526 absorption width, which together with theobserved large line widths of w(1526)&gt;1.5 ang for a large fraction of theobjects suggests a galactic outflow driven velocity field in the host galaxies;(3) there is tentative evidence for a trend of declining ism metallicity withdecreasing galaxy luminosity in the star-forming galaxy population at z=2-4;(4) the interstellar uv radiation field is found ~ 35-350 times higher in grbhosts than the galactic mean value; and (5) additional galaxies are found at &lt;2" from the grb host in all fields with known presence of strong mgiiabsorbers, but no additional faint galaxies are found at &lt; 2" in fields withoutstrong mgii absorbers. our study confirms that the grb host galaxies (withknown optical afterglows) are representative of unobscured star-forminggalaxies at z&gt;2, and demonstrates that high spatial resolution images arenecessary for an accurate identification of grb host galaxies in the presenceof strong intervening absorbers.

0810.2897	dust extinction in high-z galaxies with grb afterglow spectroscopy - the  2175{\aa} feature at z=2.45	we report the clear detection of the 2175a dust absorption feature in theoptical afterglow spectrum of the gamma-ray burst (grb) grb070802 at a redshiftof z=2.45. this is the highest redshift for a detected 2175a dust bump to date,and it is the first clear detection of the 2175a bump in a grb host galaxy,while several tens of optical afterglow spectra without the bump have beenrecorded in the past decade. the derived extinction curve gives a_v=0.8-1.5depending on the assumed intrinsic slope. of the three local extinction laws,an lmc type extinction gives the best fit to the extinction curve of the hostof grb070802. besides the 2175a bump we find that the spectrum of grb070802 ischaracterized by unusually strong low-ionization metal lines and possibly ahigh metallicity for a grb sightline ([si/h]=-0.46+/-0.38,[zn/h]=-0.50+/-0.68). in particular, the spectrum of grb070802 is unique for agrb spectrum in that it shows clear ci absorption features, leading us topropose a correlation between the presence of the bump and ci. the gas to dustratio for the host galaxy is found to be significantly lower than that of othergrb hosts with n(hi)/a_v=(2.4+/-1.0)x10^21 cm^-2 mag^-1, which lies betweentypical mw and lmc values. our results are in agreement with the tentativeconclusion reached by gordon et al. 2003 that the shape of the extinctioncurve, in particular the presence of the bump, is affected by the uv fluxdensity in the environment of the dust.

0811.1044	grb 080503: implications of a naked short gamma-ray burst dominated by  extended emission	we report on observations of grb 080503, a short gamma-ray burst with verybright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initialspike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short swift events.in spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart isextraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at~1 hr after the bat trigger. the optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and thenfalls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of li &amp; paczynski (1998)for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. however, ashallow spectral index and similar evolution in x-rays inferred from chandraobservations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. the extremefaintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emissionargues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a "naked" grb),consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deephst imaging. our observations reinforce the notion that short grbs generallyoccur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in somecases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that ofthe short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this classof events. because most previous bat short bursts without observed extendedemission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if itwere present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observedpresence or absence of extended emission in the existing swift sample arepremature.

0811.1591	constraining the star formation histories of grb host galaxies from  their observed abundance patterns	long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) are linked to the collapse of massivestars and their hosts are exclusively identified as active, star forminggalaxies. four long grbs observed at high spectral resolution at redshift 1.5&lt;z &lt; 4 allowed the determination of the elemental abundances for a set ofdifferent chemical elements. in this paper, for the first time, by means ofdetailed chemical evolution models taking into account also dust production, weattempt to constrain the star formation history of the host galaxies of thesegrbs from the study of the chemical abundances measured in their ism. we arealso able to provide constraints on the age and on the dust content of grbhosts. our results support the hypothesis that long duration grbs occurpreferentially in low metallicity, star forming galaxies. we compare thespecific star formation rate, namely the star formation rate per unit stellarmass, predicted for the hosts of these grbs with observational values for grbhosts distributed across a large redshift range. our models predict a decreaseof the specific star formation rate (ssfr) with redshift, consistent with theobserved decrease of the comoving cosmic sfr density between z ~2 and z=0. onthe other hand, observed grb hosts seems to follow an opposite trend in thessfr vs redshift plot, with an increase of the ssfr with decreasing redshift.finally, we compare the ssfr of grb050730 host with values derived for a sampleof quasar damped lyman alpha systems. our results indicate that the abundancepattern and the specific star formation rates of the host galaxies of thesegrbs are basically compatible with the ones determined in quasar damped lymanalpha systems, suggesting similar chemical evolution paths.
