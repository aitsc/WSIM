0707.2782	mass-selection and the evolution of the morphology-density relation from  z=0.8 to z=0	we examined the morphology-density relations for galaxy samples selected byluminosity and by mass in each of five massive x-ray clusters from z=0.023 to0.83 for 674 spectroscopically-confirmed members. rest-frame optical colors andvisual morphologies were obtained primarily from hubble space telescope images.morphology-density relations (mdr) are derived in each cluster from a complete,luminosity-selected sample of 452 galaxies with a magnitude limit m_v &lt;m^{*}_{v} + 1. the change in the early-type fraction with redshift matchesprevious work for massive clusters of galaxies. we performed a similaranalysis, deriving mdrs for complete, mass-selected samples of 441 galaxieswith a mass-limit of 10^{10.6} m_{\sun}. our mass limit includes faint objects,the equivalent of =~1 mag below l^{*} for the red cluster galaxies, andencompasses =~70% of the stellar mass in cluster galaxies. the mdrs in themass-selected sample at densities of sigma &gt; 50 galaxies mpc^{-2} are similarto those in the luminosity-selected sample but show larger early-typefractions. however, the trend with redshift in the fraction of elliptical ands0 galaxies with masses &gt; 10^{10.6} m_{\sun} differs significantly between themass- and luminosity-selected samples. the clear trend seen in the early-typefraction from z=0 to z=~ 0.8 is not found in mass-selected samples. theearly-type galaxy fraction changes much less, and is consistent with beingconstant at 92% +/- 4% at \sigma&gt; 500 galaxies mpc^{-2} and 83 +/- 3% at 50 &lt;\sigma &lt; 500 galaxies mpc^{-2}. this suggests that galaxies of mass lower than&gt; 10^{10.6} m_{\sun} play a significant role in the evolution of the early-typefraction in luminosity-selected samples.

0707.2787	the evolution of the field and cluster morphology-density relation for  mass-selected samples of galaxies	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and photometric/spectroscopic surveys inthe goods-south field (the chandra deep field-south, cdfs) are used toconstruct volume-limited, stellar mass-selected samples of galaxies atredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. the cdfs sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 contains 207 galaxies completedown to m=4x10^10 msol (for a ``diet'' salpeter imf), corresponding to aluminosity limit for red galaxies of m_b=-20.1. the sdss sample at0.020&lt;z&lt;0.045 contains 2003 galaxies down to the same mass limit, whichcorresponds to m_b=-19.3 for red galaxies. morphologies are determined with anautomated method, using the sersic parameter n and a measure of the residualfrom the model fits, called ``bumpiness'', to distinguish differentmorphologies. these classifications are verified with visual classifications.in agreement with previous studies, 65-70% of the galaxies are located on thered sequence, both at z~0.03 and at z~0.8. similarly, 65-70% of the galaxieshave n&gt;2.5. the fraction of e+s0 galaxies is 43+/-3%$ at z~0.03 and 48+/-7% atz~0.8, i.e., it has not changed significantly since z~0.8. when combined withrecent results for cluster galaxies in the same redshift range, we find thatthe morphology-density relation for galaxies more massive than 0.5m* hasremained constant since at least z~0.8. this implies that galaxies evolve inmass, morphology and density such that the morphology-density relation does notchange. in particular, the decline of star formation activity and theaccompanying increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies since z~1must happen without large changes in the early-type galaxy fraction in a givenenvironment.

0707.4484	hst and spitzer imaging of red and blue galaxies at z~2.5: a correlation  between size and star formation activity from compact quiescent galaxies to  extended star forming galaxies	we present hst nicmos+acs and spitzer irac+mips observations of 41 galaxiesat 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 in the fires ms1054 field with red and blue rest-frame opticalcolors. about half of the galaxies are very compact (effective radii r_e &lt; 1kpc) at rest-frame optical wavelengths, the others are extended (1&lt; r_e &lt; 10kpc). for reference, 1 kpc corresponds to 0.12 arcsec at z=2.5 in the adoptedcosmology. we separate actively star forming galaxies from quiescent galaxiesby modeling their rest-frame uv-nir seds. the star forming galaxies span thefull range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r_e&lt;2kpc. in theredshift range where mips 24 micron imaging is a sensitive probe of re-radiateddust emission (z&lt;2.5), the 24 micron fluxes confirm that the light of the smallquiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded starformation or agn activity. the inferred surface mass densities and velocitydispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in localgalaxies. the galaxies follow a kormendy relation (between surface brightnessand size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brightersurface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift ofz_f~5. this paper demonstrates a direct relation between star formationactivity and size at z~2.5, and the existence of a significant population ofmassive, extremely dense, old stellar systems without readily identifiablecounterparts in the local universe.

1009.3986	star formation histories in a cluster environment at z~0.84	we present a spectrophotometric analysis of galaxies belonging to thedynamically young, massive cluster rx j0152.7-1357 at z~0.84, aimed atunderstanding the effects of the cluster environment on the star formationhistory (sfh) of cluster galaxies and the assembly of the red-sequence (rs). weuse vlt/fors spectroscopy, acs/wfc optical and ntt/sofi near-ir data tocharacterize sfhs as a function of color, luminosity, morphology, stellar mass,and local environment from a sample of 134 spectroscopic members. in order toincrease the signal-to-noise, individual galaxy spectra are stacked accordingto these properties. moreover, the d4000, balmer, cn3883, fe4383 and c4668indices are also quantified. the sfh analysis shows that galaxies in the bluefaint-end of the rs have on average younger stars (delta t ~ 2 gyr) than thosein the red bright-end. we also found, for a given luminosity range, differencesin age (delta t ~ 0.5 - 1.3 gyr) as a function of color, indicating that theintrinsic scatter of the rs may be due to age variations. passive galaxies inthe blue faint-end of the rs are preferentially located in the low densityareas of the cluster, likely being objects entering the rs from the "bluecloud". it is likely that the quenching of the star formation of these rsgalaxies is due to interaction with the intracluster medium. furthermore, thesfh of galaxies in the rs as a function of stellar mass reveals signatures of"downsizing" in the overall cluster.

1103.0259	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. ii. masses and ages of early-type galaxies  in different environments and their dependence on stellar population model  assumptions	we have derived masses and ages for 79 early-type galaxies (etgs) indifferent environments at z~1.3 in the lynx supercluster and in the goods/cdf-sfield using multiwavelength (0.6-4.5 $\mu$m; kpno, palomar, keck, hst, spitzer)datasets. at this redshift the contribution of the tp-agb phase is importantfor etgs, and the mass and age estimates depend on the choice of the stellarpopulation model used in the spectral energy distribution fits. we describe indetail the differences among model predictions for a large range of galaxyages, showing the dependence of these differences on age. current models stillyield large uncertainties. while recent models from maraston and charlot &amp;bruzual offer better modeling of the tp-agb phase with respect to less recentbruzual &amp; charlot models, their predictions do not often match. the modeling ofthis tp-agb phase has a significant impact on the derived parameters forgalaxies observed at high-redshift. some of our results do not depend on thechoice of the model: for all models, the most massive galaxies are the oldestones, independent of the environment. when using maraston and charlot &amp; bruzualmodels, the mass distribution is similar in the clusters and in the groups,whereas in our field sample there is a deficit of massive (m $\gtrsim$ 10^11msun) etgs. according to those last models, etgs belonging to the clusterenvironment host on average older stars with respect to group and fieldpopulations. this difference is less significant than the age difference ingalaxies of different masses.

1109.0284	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. iv. scaling relations in different  environments	we present the kormendy and mass-size relations for early-type galaxies(etgs) as a function of environment at z~1.3. our sample includes 76 visuallyclassified etgs with masses 10^10 &lt; m/msun &lt; 10^11.5, selected in the lynxsupercluster and in the goods/cdf-s field, 31 etgs in clusters, 18 in groupsand 27 in the field, all with multi-wavelength photometry and hst/acsobservations. the kormendy relation, in place at z~1.3, does not depend on theenvironment. the mass-size relation reveals that etgs overall appear to be morecompact in denser environments: cluster etgs have sizes on average around30-50% smaller than those of the local universe, and a distribution with asmaller scatter, whereas field etgs show a mass-size relation with a similardistribution than the local one. our results imply that (1) the mass-sizerelation in the field did not evolve overall from z ~ 1.3 to present; this isinteresting and in contrast to the trend found at higher masses from previousworks; (2) in denser environments, either etgs have increased their size by30-50%, on average, and spread their distributions, or more etgs have beenformed within the dense environment from not etg progenitors or larger galaxieshave been accreted to a pristine compact population to reproduce the mass-sizerelation observed in the local universe. our results are driven by galaxieswith masses m&lt;2*10^11msun and those with masses m~10^11msun follow the sametrends that the entire sample. following valentinuzzi et al. definition ofsuperdense etgs, around 35-45% of our cluster sample is made of superdenseetgs.

0710.3192	the environment of m85 optical transient 2006-1: constraints on the  progenitor age and mass	m85 optical transient 2006-1 (m85 ot 2006-1) is the most luminous member ofthe small family of v838 mon-like objects, whose nature is still a mystery.this event took place in the virgo cluster of galaxies and peaked at anabsolute magnitude of i~-13. here we present hubble space telescope images ofm85 ot 2006-1 and its environment, taken before and after the eruption, alongwith a spectrum of the host galaxy at the transient location. we find that theprogenitor of m85 ot 2006-1 was not associated with any star forming region.the g and z-band absolute magnitudes of the progenitor were fainter than about-4 and -6 mag, respectively. therefore, we can set a lower limit of ~50 myr onthe age of the youngest stars at the location of the progenitor thatcorresponds to a mass of &lt;7 solar mass. previously published line indicessuggest that m85 has a mean stellar age of 1.6+/-0.3 gyr. if this mean age isrepresentative of the progenitor of m85 ot 2006-1, then we can furtherconstrain its mass to be less than 2 solar mass. we compare the energetics andmass limit derived for the m85 ot 2006-1 progenitor with those expected from asimple model of violent stellar mergers. combined with further modeling, thesenew clues may ultimately reveal the true nature of these puzzling events.

0710.5560	principal component analysis of the time- and position-dependent point  spread function of the advanced camera for surveys	we describe the time- and position-dependent point spread function (psf)variation of the wide field channel (wfc) of the advanced camera for surveys(acs) with the principal component analysis (pca) technique. the time-dependentchange is caused by the temporal variation of the $hst$ focus whereas theposition-dependent psf variation in acs/wfc at a given focus is mainly theresult of changes in aberrations and charge diffusion across the detector,which appear as position-dependent changes in elongation of the astigmatic coreand blurring of the psf, respectively. using &gt;400 archival images of starcluster fields, we construct a acs psf library covering diverse environments ofthe $hst$ observations (e.g., focus values). we find that interpolation of asmall number ($\sim20$) of principal components or ``eigen-psfs'' per exposurecan robustly reproduce the observed variation of the ellipticity and size ofthe psf. our primary interest in this investigation is the application of thispsf library to precision weak-lensing analyses, where accurate knowledge of theinstrument's psf is crucial. however, the high-fidelity of the model judgedfrom the nice agreement with observed psfs suggests that the model ispotentially also useful in other applications such as crowded field stellarphotometry, galaxy profile fitting, agn studies, etc., which similarly demand afair knowledge of the psfs at objects' locations. our psf models, applicable toany wfc image rectified with the lanczos3 kernel, are publicly available.

1204.1054	globular cluster systems of early-type galaxies in low-density  environments	deep images of 10 early-type galaxies in low-density environments have beenobtained with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble spacetelescope. the global properties of the globular cluster (gc) systems of thegalaxies have been derived in order to investigate the role of the environmentin galaxy formation and evolution. using the acs virgo cluster survey (acsvcs)as a high-density counterpart, the similarities and differences between the gcproperties in high- and low-density environments are presented. we find astrong correlation of the gc mean colours and the degree of colour bimodalitywith the host galaxy luminosity in low-density environments, in good agreementwith high-density environments. in contrast, the gc mean colours at a givenhost luminosity are somewhat bluer (\delta(g-z) ~ 0.05) than those for clustergalaxies, indicating more metal-poor (\delta[fe/h] ~ 0.10-0.15) and/or younger(\delta age &gt; 2 gyr) gc systems than those in dense environments. furthermore,with decreasing host luminosity, the colour bimodality disappears faster, whencompared to galaxies in cluster environments. our results suggest that: (1) inboth high- and low-density environments, the mass of the host galaxy has thedominant effect on gc system properties, (2) the local environment has only asecondary effect on the history of gc system formation, (3) gc formation mustbe governed by common physical processes across a range of environments.

1208.4060	globular cluster systems in fossil groups: ngc6482, ngc1132 and  eso306-017	we study the globular cluster (gc) systems in three representative fossilgroup galaxies: the nearest (ngc6482), the prototype (ngc1132) and the mostmassive known to date (eso306-017). this is the first systematic study of gcsystems in fossil groups. using data obtained with the hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys in the f475w and f850lp filters, we determine thegc color and magnitude distributions, surface number density profiles, andspecific frequencies. in all three systems, the gc color distribution isbimodal, the gcs are spatially more extended than the starlight, and the redpopulation is more concentrated than the blue. the specific frequencies seem toscale with the optical luminosities of the central galaxy and span a rangesimilar to that of the normal bright elliptical galaxies in rich environments.we also analyze the galaxy surface brightness distributions to look fordeviations from the best-fit s\'ersic profiles; we find evidence of recentdynamical interaction in all three fossil group galaxies. using x-ray data fromthe literature, we find that luminosity and metallicity appear to correlatewith the number of gcs and their mean color, respectively. interestingly,although ngc6482 has the lowest mass and luminosity in our sample, its gcsystem has the reddest mean color, and the surrounding x-ray gas has thehighest metallicity.

1308.1958	the rich globular cluster system of abell 1689 and the radial dependence  of the globular cluster formation efficiency	we study the rich globular cluster (gc) system in the center of the massivecluster of galaxies abell 1689 (z=0.18), one of the most powerful gravitationallenses known. with 28 hst/acs orbits in the f814w bandpass, we reach magnitudei_814=29 with &gt;90% completeness and sample the brightest ~5% of the gc system.assuming the well-known gaussian form of the gc luminosity function (gclf), weestimate a total population of n(gc_total) = 162,850 gcs within a projectedradius of 400kpc. as many as half may comprise an intracluster component. evenwith the sizable uncertainties, which mainly result from the uncertain gclfparameters, this is by far the largest gc system studied to date. the specificfrequency s_n is high, but not uncommon for central galaxies in massiveclusters, rising from s_n~5 near the center to ~12 at large radii. passivegalaxy fading would increase s_n by ~20% at z=0. we construct the radial massprofiles of the gcs, stars, intracluster gas, and lensing-derived total mass,and we compare the mass fractions as a function of radius. the estimated massin gcs, m(gc_total)=3.9x10^10 msun, is comparable to ~80% of the total stellarmass of the milky way. the shape of the gc mass profile appears intermediatebetween those of the stellar light and total cluster mass. despite the extremenature of this system, the ratios of the gc mass to the baryonic and totalmasses, and thus the gc formation efficiency, are typical of those in otherrich clusters when comparing at the same physical radii. the gc formationefficiency is not constant, but varies with radius, in a manner that appearssimilar for different clusters; we speculate on the reasons for this similarityin profile.

0802.2095	the nascent red sequence at z~2	we present new constraints on the evolution of the early-type galaxycolor-magnitude relation (cmr) based on deep near-infrared imaging of a galaxyprotocluster at z=2.16 obtained using nicmos on-board the hubble spacetelescope. this field contains a spectroscopically confirmed space-overdensityof lyman-alpha and h-alpha emitting galaxies which surrounds the powerful radiogalaxy mrc 1138-262. using these nicmos data we identify a significantsurface-overdensity (= 6.2x) of red j-h galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram(when compared with deep nicmos imaging from the hdf-n and udf). theoptical-nir colors of these prospective red-sequence galaxies indicate thepresence of on-going dust-obscured star-formation or recently formed (&lt;~ 1.5gyr)stellar populations in a majority of the red galaxies. we measure the slopeand intrinsic scatter of the cmr for three different red galaxy samplesselected by a wide color cut, and using photometric redshifts both with andwithout restrictions on rest-frame optical morphology. in all three cases boththe rest-frame $u-b$ slope and intrinsic color scatter are considerably higherthan corresponding values for lower redshift galaxy clusters. these resultssuggest that while some relatively quiescent galaxies do exist in thisprotocluster both the majority of the galaxy population and hence thecolor-magnitude relation are still in the process of forming, as expected.

1409.2900	characterizing sl2s galaxy groups using the einstein radius	we analyzed the einstein radius, $\theta_e$, in our sample of sl2s galaxygroups, and compared it with $r_a$ (the distance from the arcs to the center ofthe lens), using three different approaches: 1.- the velocity dispersionobtained from weak lensing assuming a singular isothermal sphere profile($\theta_{e,i}$), 2.- a strong lensing analytical method ($\theta_{e,ii}$)combined with a velocity dispersion-concentration relation derived fromnumerical simulations designed to mimic our group sample, 3.- strong lensingmodeling ($\theta_{e,iii}$) of eleven groups (with four new models presented inthis work) using hst and cfht images. finally, $r_a$ was analyzed as a functionof redshift $z$ to investigate possible correlations with l, n, and therichness-to-luminosity ratio (n/l). we found a correlation between $\theta_{e}$and $r_a$, but with large scatter. we estimate $\theta_{e,i}$ = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.9)+ (0.7 $\pm$ 0.2)$r_a$, $\theta_{e,ii}$ = (0.4 $\pm$ 1.5) + (1.1 $\pm$0.4)$r_a$, and $\theta_{e,iii}$ = (0.4 $\pm$ 1.5) + (0.9 $\pm$ 0.3)$r_a$ foreach method respectively. we found a weak evidence of anti-correlation between$r_a$ and $z$, with log$r_a$ = (0.58$\pm$0.06) - (0.04$\pm$0.1)$z$, suggestinga possible evolution of the einstein radius with $z$, as reported previously byother authors. our results also show that $r_a$ is correlated with l and n(more luminous and richer groups have greater $r_a$), and a possiblecorrelation between $r_a$ and the n/l ratio. our analysis indicates that $r_a$is correlated with $\theta_e$ in our sample, making $r_a$ useful tocharacterize properties like l and n (and possible n/l) in galaxy groups.additionally, we present evidence suggesting that the einstein radius evolveswith $z$.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

astro-ph;0110344	early-type galaxies in the sdss	a sample of nearly 9000 early-type galaxies, in the redshift range0.01&lt;z&lt;0.3, was selected from the sloan digital sky survey using morphologicaland spectral criteria. the sample was used to study how early-type galaxyobservables, including luminosity l, effective radius r, surface brightness i,color, and velocity dispersion v, are correlated with one another. measurementbiases are understood with mock catalogs which reproduce all of the observedscaling relations. at any given redshift, the intrinsic distribution ofluminosities, sizes and velocity dispersions in our sample are allapproximately gaussian. in the r* band l ~ v^3.91, l ~ r^1.58, r ~ i^(-0.75),and the fundamental plane relation is r ~ v^(1.49) i^(-0.75). these relationsare approximately the same in the g*, i* and z* bands. at fixed luminosity, themass-to-light ratio scales as m/l ~ l^0.14. the g*-r* color scales as v^0.25.color also correlates with magnitude and size, but these correlations areentirely due to the l-v and r-v relations. chemical evolution and starformation histories are investigated using co-added spectra of similar objectsin our sample. chemical abundances correlate primarily with velocitydispersion. at fixed v, the higher redshift population is bluer, is weaker inmg2, and is stronger in hbeta than the population nearby. in addition, thepopulation at higher redshifts is slightly more luminous. these differences areconsistent with that of a passively evolving population which formed the bulkof its stars about 9 gyrs ago. the fundamental plane suggests that galaxies indense regions are slightly different from those in less dense regions, but theco-added spectra and color--magnitude relations show no statisticallysignificant dependence on environment.

astro-ph;0211371	advanced camera for surveys observations of young star clusters in the  interacting galaxy ugc 10214	we present the first advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of youngstar clusters in the colliding/merging galaxy ugc 10214. the observations weremade as part of the early release observation (ero) program for the newlyinstalled acs during service mission sm3b for the hubble space telescope (hst).many young star clusters can be identified in the tails of ugc 10214, with agesranging from ~3 myr to 10 myr. the extreme blue v-i (f606w-f814w) colors of thestar clusters found in the tail of ugc 10214 can only be explained if strongemission lines are included with a young stellar population. this has beenconfirmed by our keck spectroscopy of some of these bright blue stellar knots.the most luminous and largest of these blue knots has an absolute magnitude ofm_v = -14.45, with a half-light radius of 161 pc, and if it is a single starcluster, would qualify as a super star cluster (ssc). alternatively, it couldbe a superposition of multiple scaled ob associations or clusters. with anestimated age of ~ 4-5 myr, its derived mass is &lt; 1.3 x 10^6 solar masses. thusthe young stellar knot is unbound and will not evolve into a normal globularcluster. the bright blue clusters and associations are much younger than thedynamical age of the tail, providing strong evidence that star formation occursin the tail long after it was ejected. ugc 10214 provides a nearby example ofprocesses that contributed to the formation of halos and intra-cluster media inthe distant and younger universe.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0311323	discovery of globular clusters in the proto-spiral ngc2915: implications  for hierarchical galaxy evolution	we have discovered three globular clusters beyond the holmberg radius inhubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys images of the gas-rich darkmatter dominated blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc2915. the clusters, all of whichstart to resolve into stars, have m_{v606} = -8.9 to -9.8 mag, significantlybrighter than the peak of the luminosity function of milky way globularclusters. their colors suggest a metallicity [fe/h] ~ -1.9 dex, typical ofmetal-poor galactic globular clusters. the specific frequency of clusters is ata minimum normal, compared to spiral galaxies. however, since only a smallportion of the system has been surveyed it is more likely that the luminosityand mass normalized cluster content is higher, like that seen in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters. this suggests that ngc2915 resembles a key phasein the early hierarchical assembly of galaxies - the epoch when much of the oldstellar population has formed, but little of the stellar disk. depending on thesubsequent interaction history, such systems could go on to build-up largerelliptical galaxies, evolve into normal spirals, or in rare circumstancesremain suspended in their development to become systems like ngc2915.

astro-ph;0403167	star formation at z~6: the udf-parallel acs fields	we report on the i-dropouts detected in two exceptionally deep acs fields(b_{435}, v_{606}, i_{775}, and z_{850} with 10 sigma limits of 28.8, 29.0,28.5, and 27.8, respectively) taken in parallel with the udf nicmosobservations. using an i-z&gt;1.4 cut, we find 30 i-dropouts over 21 arcmin^2 downto z_ab=28.1, or 1.4 i-dropouts arcmin^{-2}, with significant field-to-fieldvariation (as expected from cosmic variance). this extends i-dropout searchessome ~0.9^m further down the luminosity function than was possible in the goodsfield, netting a ~7x increase in surface density. an estimate of the sizeevolution for uv bright objects is obtained by comparing the composite radialflux profile of the bright i-dropouts (z&lt;27.2) with scaled versions of thehdf-n + hdf-s u-dropouts. the best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-1.57_{-0.53}^{+0.50}} scaling in size (for fixed luminosity), extending lower redshift(1&lt;z&lt;5) trends to z~6. adopting this scaling and the brighter i-dropouts fromboth goods fields, we make incompleteness estimates and construct a z~6 lf inthe rest-frame continuum uv (~1350 a) over a 3.5 magnitude baseline, finding ashape consistent with that found at lower redshift. to evaluate the evolutionin the lf from z~3.8, we make comparisons against different scalings of a lowerredshift b-dropout sample. though a strong degeneracy is found betweenluminosity and density evolution, our best-fit model scales as (1+z)^{-2.8} innumber and (1+z)^0.1 in luminosity, suggesting a rest-frame continuum uvluminosity density at z~6 which is just 0.38_{-0.07} ^{+0.09}x that at z~3.8.our inclusion of size evolution makes the present estimate lower than previousz~6 estimates.

astro-ph;0406562	galaxy size evolution at high redshift and surface brightness selection  effects: constraints from the hubble ultra deep field	we use the exceptional depth of the ultra deep field (udf) and udf-parallelacs fields to study the sizes of high redshift (z~2-6) galaxies and addresslong-standing questions about possible biases in the cosmic star formation ratedue to surface brightness dimming. contrasting b, v, and i-dropout samplesculled from the deeper data with those obtained from the shallower goodsfields, we demonstrate that the shallower data are essentially complete atbright magnitudes to z&lt;5.5 and that the principal effect of depth is to addobjects at the magnitude limit. this indicates that high redshift galaxies arecompact in size (~0.1-0.3") and that large (&gt;0.4", &gt;3 kpc) low surfacebrightness galaxies are rare. a simple comparison of the half-light radii ofthe hdf-n + hdf-s u-dropouts with b, v, and i-dropouts from the udf shows thatthe sizes follow a (1+z)^{-1.05+/-0.21} scaling towards high redshift. a morerigorous measurement compares different scalings of our u-dropout sample withthe mean profiles for a set of intermediate magnitude (26.0&lt;z_{850,ab}&lt;27.5)i-dropouts from the udf. the best-fit is found with a (1+z)^{-0.94_{-0.25}^{+0.19}} size scaling (for fixed luminosity). this result is then verified byrepeating this experiment with different size measures, low redshift samples,and magnitude ranges. very similar scalings are found for all comparisons. arobust measurement of size evolution is thereby demonstrated for galaxies fromz~6 to z~2.5 using data from the udf.

astro-ph;0406613	ultra compact dwarf galaxies in abell 1689: a photometric study with the  acs	the properties of ultra compact dwarf (ucd) galaxy candidates in abell 1689(z=0.183) are investigated, based on deep high resolution acs images. a ucdcandidate has to be unresolved, have i&lt;28 (m_v&lt;-11.5) mag and satisfy colorlimits derived from bayesian photometric redshifts. we find 160 ucd candidateswith 22&lt;i&lt;28 mag. it is estimated that about 100 of these are cluster members,based on their spatial distribution and photometric redshifts. for i&gt;26.8 mag,the radial and luminosity distribution of the ucd candidates can be explainedwell by abell 1689's globular cluster (gc) system. for i&lt;26.8 mag, there is anoverpopulation of 15 +/- 5 ucd candidates with respect to the gc luminosityfunction. for i&lt;26 mag, the radial distribution of ucd candidates is moreconsistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the gc system of abell1689. the ucd candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar tothat of abell 1689's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter byabout 2-3 mag. two of the three brightest ucd candidates (m_v ~ -17 mag) areslightly resolved. at the distance of abell 1689, these two objects would haveking-profile core radii of ~35 pc and r_eff ~300 pc, implying luminosities andsizes 2-3 times those of m32's bulge. additional photometric redshifts obtainedwith late type stellar and elliptical galaxy templates support the assignmentof these two resolved sources to abell 1689. our findings imply that in abell1689 there are at least 10 ucds with m_v&lt;-12.7 mag. compared to the ucds in thefornax cluster they are brighter, larger and have colors closer to normal dwarfgalaxies. this suggests that they may be in an intermediate stage of thestripping process. spectroscopy is needed to definitely confirm the existenceof ucds in abell 1689.

astro-ph;0407644	the luminosity function of early-type galaxies at z~0.75	we measure the luminosity function of morphologically selected e/s0 galaxiesfrom $z=0.5$ to $z=1.0$ using deep high resolution advanced camera for surveysimaging data. our analysis covers an area of $48\box\arcmin$ (8$\times$ thearea of the hdf-n) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ($i\sim24$ mag) than waspossible in the deep groth strip survey (dgss). at $0.5&lt;z&lt;0.75$, we find$m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.1\pm0.3$ and $\alpha=-0.53\pm0.2$, and at$0.75&lt;z&lt;1.0$, we find $m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.4\pm0.2$. these luminosityfunctions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosityfunction using morphological selection (e.g., dgss), but are much steeper thanthe luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies likethe color or spectral energy distribution (e.g., cfrs, cadis, or combo-17). thedifference is due to the `blue', $(u-v)_0&lt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies, which make up to$\sim30%$ of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faintgalaxies. we thereby demonstrate the need for {\it both morphological andstructural information} to constrain the evolution of galaxies.  we find that the `blue' e/s0 galaxies have the same average sizes and sersicparameters as the `red', $(u-v)_0&gt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies at brighter luminosities($m_b&lt;-20.1$), but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where`blue' galaxies are both smaller and have lower sersic parameters. fits of thecolors to stellar population models suggest that most e/s0 galaxies have shortstar-formation time scales ($\tau&lt;1$ gyr), and that galaxies have formed at anincreasing rate from $z\sim8$ until $z\sim2$ after which there has been agradual decline.

astro-ph;0408165	the evolutionary status of clusters of galaxies at z ~ 1	combined hst, x-ray, and ground-based optical studies show that clusters ofgalaxies are largely "in place" by $z \sim 1$, an epoch when the universe wasless than half its present age. high resolution images show that elliptical,s0, and spiral galaxies are present in clusters at redshifts up to $z \sim1.3$. analysis of the cmds suggest that the cluster ellipticals formed theirstars several gyr earlier, near redshift 3. the morphology--density relation iswell established at $z\sim1$, with star-forming spirals and irregulars residingmostly in the outer parts of the clusters and e/s0s concentrated in denseclumps. the intracluster medium has already reached the metallicity ofpresent-day clusters. the distributions of the hot gas and early-type galaxiesare similar in $z\sim1$ clusters, indicating both have largely virialized inthe deepest potentials wells. in spite of the many similarities between$z\sim1$ and present-day clusters, there are significant differences. themorphologies revealed by the hot gas, and particularly the early-type galaxies,are elongated rather than spherical. we appear to be observing the clusters atan epoch when the sub-clusters and groups are still assembling into a singleregular cluster. support for this picture comes from cl0152 where the gasappears to be lagging behind the luminous and dark mass in two mergingsub-components. moreover, the luminosity difference between the first andsecond brightest cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$ is smaller than in 93% ofpresent-day abell clusters, which suggests that considerable luminosityevolution through merging has occurred since that epoch. evolution is also seenin the bolometric x-ray luminosity function.

astro-ph;0409304	weak lensing analysis of the z~0.8 cluster cl 0152-1357 with the  advanced camera for surveys	we present a weak lensing analysis of the x-ray luminous cluster cl 0152-1357at z~0.84 using hst/acs observations. the unparalleled resolution andsensitivity of acs enable us to measure weakly distorted, faint backgroundgalaxies to the extent that the number density reaches ~175 arcmin^-2. the psfof acs has a complicated shape that also varies across the field. we constructa psf model for acs from an extensive investigation of 47 tuc stars in amodestly crowded region. we show that this model psf excellently describes thepsf variation pattern in the cluster observation when a slight adjustment ofellipticity is applied. the high number density of source galaxies and theaccurate removal of the psf effect through moment-based deconvolution allow usto restore the dark matter distribution of the cluster in great detail. thedirect comparison of the mass map with the x-ray morphology from chandraobservations shows that the two peaks of intracluster medium traced by x-rayemission are lagging behind the corresponding dark matter clumps, indicative ofan on-going merger. the overall mass profile of the cluster can be welldescribed by an nfw profile with a scale radius of r_s =309+-45 kpc and aconcentration parameter of c=3.7+-0.5. the mass estimates from the lensinganalysis are consistent with those from x-ray and sunyaev-zeldovich analyses.the predicted velocity dispersion is also in good agreement with thespectroscopic measurement from vlt observations. in the adopted wmap cosmology,the total projected mass and the mass-to-light ratio within 1 mpc are estimatedto be 4.92+-0.44 10^14 solar mass and 95+-8 solar mass/solar luminosity,respectively.

astro-ph;0509308	clustering of star-forming galaxies near a radio galaxy at z=5.2	we present hst/acs observations of the most distant radio galaxy known, tnj0924-2201 at z=5.2. this radio galaxy has 6 spectroscopically confirmed lyaemitting companion galaxies, and appears to lie within an overdense region. theradio galaxy is marginally resolved in i_775 and z_850 showing continuumemission aligned with the radio axis, similar to what is observed for lowerredshift radio galaxies. both the half-light radius and the uv star formationrate are comparable to the typical values found for lyman break galaxies atz~4-5. the lya emitters are sub-l* galaxies, with deduced star formation ratesof 1-10 msun/yr. one of the lya emitters is only detected in lya. based on thestar formation rate of ~3 msun/yr calculated from lya, the lack of continuumemission could be explained if the galaxy is younger than ~2 myr and isproducing its first stars.  observations in v_606, i_775, and z_850 were used to identify additionallyman break galaxies associated with this structure. in addition to the radiogalaxy, there are 22 v-break (z~5) galaxies with z_850&lt;26.5 (5sigma), two ofwhich are also in the spectroscopic sample. we compare the surface density of2/arcmin^2 to that of similarly selected v-dropouts extracted from goods andthe udf parallel fields. we find evidence for an overdensity to very highconfidence (&gt;99%), based on a counts-in-cells analysis applied to the controlfield. the excess is suggestive of the v-break objects being associated with aforming cluster around the radio galaxy.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.
