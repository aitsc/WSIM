0901.4121	host galaxies, clustering, eddington ratios, and evolution of radio,  x-ray, and infrared-selected agns	we explore the connection between different classes of active galactic nuclei(agns) and the evolution of their host galaxies, by deriving host galaxyproperties, clustering, and eddington ratios of agns selected in the radio,x-ray, and infrared. we study a sample of 585 agns at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 usingredshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages) and data in the radio(wsrt 1.4 ghz), x-rays (chandra xbootes), and mid-ir (irac shallow survey). theradio, x-ray, and ir agn samples show modest overlap, indicating that to theflux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of agns. wederive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as eddington ratios(lambda), for obscured or optically faint agns. we also measure the two-pointcross-correlation between agns and galaxies on scales of 0.3-10 h^-1 mpc, andderive typical dark matter halo masses. we find that: (1) radio agns are mainlyfound in luminous red galaxies, are strongly clustered (with m_halo ~ 3x10^13h^-1 m_sun), and have very low lambda &lt;~ 10^-3; (2) x-ray-selected agns arepreferentially found in galaxies in the "green valley" of color-magnitude spaceand are clustered similarly to typical ages galaxies (m_halo ~ 10^13 h^-1m_sun), with 10^-3 &lt;~ lambda &lt;~ 1; (3) ir agns reside in slightly bluer, lessluminous galaxies than x-ray agns, are weakly clustered (m_halo &lt;~ 10^12 h^-1m_sun), and have lambda &gt; 10^-2. we interpret these results in terms of asimple model of agn and galaxy evolution, whereby a "quasar" phase and thegrowth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches acritical mass between ~10^12 and 10^13 m_sun. subsequently, star formationceases and agn accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and ir-bright) to radiatively inefficient (optically-faint, radio-bright) modes.

0903.2219	the star formation and nuclear accretion histories of normal galaxies in  the ages survey	we combine ir, optical and x-ray data from the overlapping, 9.3 square degreenoao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs), agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages),and xbootes survey to measure the x-ray evolution of 6146 normal galaxies as afunction of absolute optical luminosity, redshift, and spectral type over thelargely unexplored redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. because only the closest orbrightest of the galaxies are individually detected in x-rays, we use astacking analysis to determine the mean properties of the sample. our resultssuggest that x-ray emission from spectroscopically late-type galaxies isdominated by star formation, while that from early-type galaxies is dominatedby a combination of hot gas and agn emission. we find that the mean starformation and supermassive black hole accretion rate densities evolve like(1+z)^3, in agreement with the trends found for samples of bright, individuallydetectable starburst galaxies and agn. our work also corroborates the resultsof many previous stacking analyses of faint source populations, with improvedstatistics.

0904.0275	detection of a companion lens galaxy using the mid-infrared flux ratios  of the gravitationally lensed quasar h1413+117	we present the first resolved mid-ir (11 micron) observations of thefour-image quasar lens h1413+117 using the michelle camera on gemini north. allprevious observations (optical, near-ir, and radio) of this lens show a "fluxanomaly," where the image flux ratios cannot be explained by a simple, centrallens galaxy. we attempt to reproduce the mid-ir flux ratios, which areinsensitive to extinction and microlensing, by modeling the main lens as asingular isothermal ellipsoid. this model fails to reproduce the flux ratios.however, we can explain the flux ratios simply by adding to the model a nearbygalaxy detected in the h-band by hst/nicmos-nic2. this perturbing galaxy lies4.0" from the main lens and it has a critical radius of 0.63" +/- 0.02" whichis similar to that of the main lens, as expected from their similar h-bandfluxes. more remarkably, this galaxy is not required to obtain a good fit tothe system astrometry, so this represents the first clear detection of anobject through its effect on the image fluxes of a gravitational lens. this isa parallel to the detections of visible satellites from astrometric anomalies,and provides a proof of the concept of searching for substructure in galaxiesusing anomalous flux ratios.

0907.0230	a spitzer/irs spectrum of the 2008 luminous transient in ngc 300:  connection to proto-planetary nebulae	we present a spitzer/irs low-resolution mid-infrared spectrum (5-14 micron)of the luminous transient discovered in the nearby galaxy ngc 300 in may 2008.the spectrum, obtained three months after discovery, shows that the transientis very luminous in the mid-ir. furthermore, the spectrum shows strong, broademission features at 8 and 12 micron that are observed in galactic carbon-richproto-planetary nebulae. combining these data with published optical andnear-ir photometry obtained at the same epoch, we find that the mid-ir excesstraced by the spitzer spectrum accounts for ~20% of the total energy output.this component can be well explained by emission from ~3x10^-4 msun ofpre-existing progenitor dust at temperature ~400 k. the spectral energydistribution of the transient also shows a near-ir excess that can be explainedby emission from newly-formed dust in the ejecta. alternatively, both thenear-ir and mid-ir excesses can together be explained by a single pre-existinggeometrically thick dust shell. in light of the new observations obtained withspitzer, we revisit the analysis of the optical spectra and kinematics, whichwere compared to the massive yellow-hypergiant irc+10420 in previous studies.we show that proto-planetary nebulae share many properties with the ngc 300transient and sn 2008s. we conclude that even though the explosion of a massivestar (&gt; 10 msun) cannot be ruled out, an explosive event on a massive (6-10msun) carbon-rich agb/super-agb or post-agb star is consistent with allobservations of the transients and their progenitors presented thus far.

0911.2230	on the baryon fractions in clusters and groups of galaxies	we present the baryon fractions of 2mass groups and clusters as a function ofcluster richness using total and gas masses measured from stacked rosat x-raydata and stellar masses estimated from the infrared galaxy catalogs. we detectx-ray emission even in the outskirts of clusters, beyond r_200 for richnessclasses with x-ray temperatures above 1 kev. this enables us to more accuratelydetermine the total gas mass in these groups and clusters. we find that theoptically selected groups and clusters have flatter temperature profiles andhigher stellar-to-gas mass ratios than the individually studied, x-ray brightclusters. we also find that the stellar mass in poor groups with temperaturesbelow 1 kev is comparable to the gas mass in these systems. combining theseresults with individual measurements for clusters, groups, and galaxies fromthe literature, we find a break in the baryon fraction at ~1 kev. above thistemperature, the baryon fraction scales with temperature as f_b \proptot^0.20\pm0.03. we see significantly smaller baryon fractions below thistemperature, and the baryon fraction of poor groups joins smoothly onto that ofsystems with still shallower potential wells such as normal and dwarf galaxieswhere the baryon fraction scales with the inferred velocity dispersion as f_b\propto \sigma^1.6. the small scatter in the baryon fraction at any givenpotential well depth favors a universal baryon loss mechanism and a preheatingmodel for the baryon loss. the scatter is, however, larger for less massivesystems. finally, we note that although the broken power-law relation can beinferred from data points in the literature alone, the consistency between thebaryon fractions for poor groups and massive galaxies inspires us to fit thetwo categories of objects (galaxies and clusters) with one relation.

1002.3126	the effect of a time-varying accretion disk size on quasar microlensing  light curves	microlensing perturbations to the magnification of gravitationally lensedquasar images are dependent on the angular size of the quasar. if quasarvariability at visible wavelengths is caused by a change in the area of theaccretion disk, it will affect the microlensing magnification. we derive theexpected signal, assuming that the luminosity scales with some power of thedisk area, and estimate its amplitude using simulations. we discuss theprospects for detecting the effect in real-world data and for using it toestimate the logarithmic slope of the luminosity's dependence on disk area.such an estimate would provide a direct test of the standard thin accretiondisk model. we tried fitting six seasons of the light curves of the lensedquasar he 0435-1223 including this effect as a modification to the kochanek etal. (2006) approach to estimating time delays. we find a dramatic improvementin the goodness of fit and relatively plausible parameters, but a robustestimate will require a full numerical calculation in order to correctly modelthe strong correlations between the structure of the microlensing magnificationpatterns and the magnitude of the effect. we also comment briefly on the effectof this phenomenon for the stability of time delay estimates.

1006.4359	the evolution of the star formation rate of galaxies at 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2	we present the 24 micron rest-frame luminosity function (lf) of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 constructed from 4047spectroscopic redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey of 24 micronselected sources in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. thissample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe theevolution of the 24 micron lf of galaxies at low and intermediate redshiftswhile minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. in order to use the observed24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei(agns) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified andexcluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions or the detection of x-ray emission. the evolution of the24 micron lf of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z &lt; 0.65 is consistentwith a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosityevolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). we extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0&lt; z &lt; 1.2 by combining our data with that of the far-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey. over this entire redshift range the evolution ofthe characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallowerpower law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). we find a local star formation rate density of(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 msun/yr/mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)over 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. these estimates are in good agreement with the rates usingoptical and uv fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in theobserved sources. this agreement confirms that star formation at z &lt;~ 1.2 isrobustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs inobscured regions of galaxies.

1102.1977	the cosmic core-collapse supernova rate does not match the massive-star  formation rate	we identify a "supernova rate problem": the measured cosmic core-collapsesupernova rate is a factor of ~ 2 smaller (with significance ~ 2 sigma) thanthat predicted from the measured cosmic massive-star formation rate. thecomparison is critical for topics from galaxy evolution and enrichment to theabundance of neutron stars and black holes. we systematically explore possibleresolutions. the accuracy and precision of the star formation rate data andconversion to the supernova rate are well supported, and proposed changes wouldhave far-reaching consequences. the dominant effect is likely that manysupernovae are missed because they are either optically dim (low-luminosity) ordark, whether intrinsically or due to obscuration. we investigate supernovaetoo dim to have been discovered in cosmic surveys by a detailed study of allsupernova discoveries in the local volume. if possible supernova impostors areincluded, then dim supernovae are common enough by fraction to solve thesupernova rate problem. if they are not included, then the rate of dark corecollapses is likely substantial. other alternatives are that there aresurprising changes in our understanding of star formation or supernova rates,including that supernovae form differently in small galaxies than in normalgalaxies. these possibilities can be distinguished by upcoming supernovasurveys, star formation measurements, searches for disappearing massive stars,and measurements of supernova neutrinos.

1102.4850	clustering of obscured and unobscured quasars in the bootes field:  placing rapidly growing black holes in the cosmic web	we present the first measurement of the spatial clustering of mid-infraredselected obscured and unobscured quasars, using a sample in the redshift range0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 selected from the 9 deg^2 bootes multiwavelength survey. recentlythe spitzer space telescope and x-ray observations have revealed largepopulations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of thex-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. to date, little isknown about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the massesof their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolutionof black holes and galaxies. in this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infraredselected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxycross-correlation function w_p(r). the observed clustering yieldscharacteristic dark matter halo masses of log (m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) =12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (qso-1s) and obscuredquasars (obs-qsos), respectively. the results for qso-1s are in excellentagreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while weconclude that the obs-qsos are at least as strongly clustered as the qso-1s. wetest for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faintobs-qsos, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on theclustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clusteringamplitude of the obs-qsos by at most ~20%. we compare our results to previousstudies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering forobscured quasars.

1104.2356	the microlensing properties of a sample of 87 lensed quasars	gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool for probing the physicalproperties of quasar accretion disks and properties of the lens galaxy such asits dark matter fraction and mean stellar mass. unfortunately the number oflensed quasars ($\sim 90$) exceeds our monitoring capabilities. thus,estimating their microlensing properties is important for identifying goodmicrolensing candidates as well as for the expectations of future surveys. inthis work we estimate the microlensing properties of a sample of 87 lensedquasars. while the median einstein radius crossing time scale is 20.6 years,the median source crossing time scale is 7.3 months. broadly speaking, thismeans that on $\sim 10$ year timescales roughly half the lenses will bequiescent, with the source in a broad demagnified valley, and roughly half willbe active with the source lying in the caustic ridges. we also found that thelocation of the lens system relative to the cmb dipole has a modest effect onmicrolensing timescales, and in theory microlensing could be used to confirmthe kinematic origin of the dipole. as a corollary of our study we analyzed theaccretion rate parameters in a sub-sample of 32 lensed quasars. at fixed blackhole mass, it is possible to sample a broad range of luminosities (i.e.,eddington factors) if it becomes feasible to monitor fainter lenses.

1105.3944	the structure of 2mass galaxy clusters	we use a sample of galaxies from the two micron all sky survey (2mass)extended source catalog to refine a matched filter method of finding galaxyclusters that takes into account each galaxy's position, magnitude, andredshift if available. the matched filter postulates a radial density profile,luminosity function, and line-of-sight velocity distribution for clustergalaxies. we use this method to search for clusters in the galaxy catalog,which is complete to an extinction-corrected k-band magnitude of 13.25 and hasspectroscopic redshifts for roughly 40% of the galaxies, including nearly allbrighter than k = 11.25. we then use a stacking analysis to determine theaverage luminosity function, radial distribution, and velocity distribution ofcluster galaxies in several richness classes, and use the results to update theparameters of the matched filter before repeating the cluster search. we alsoinvestigate the correlations between a cluster's richness and its velocitydispersion and core radius, using these relations to refine priors that areapplied during the cluster search process. after the second cluster searchiteration, we repeat the stacking analysis. we find a cluster galaxy luminosityfunction that fits a schechter form, with parameters m_k* - 5 log h =-23.64\pm0.04 and \alpha = -1.07\pm0.03. we can achieve a slightly better fitto our luminosity function by adding a gaussian component on the bright end torepresent the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) population. the radial numberdensity profile of galaxies closely matches a projected navarro-frenk-white(nfw) profile at intermediate radii, with deviations at small radii due towell-known cluster centering issues and outside the virial radius due tocorrelated structure. the velocity distributions are gaussian in shape, withvelocity dispersions that correlate strongly with richness.

1106.3115	the impact of metallicity on the rate of type ia supernovae	the metallicity of a star strongly affects both its evolution and theproperties of the stellar remnant that results from its demise. it is generallyaccepted that stars with initial masses below ~8 m_sun leave behind whitedwarfs and that some sub-population of these lead to type ia supernovae.however, it is often tacitly assumed that metallicity has no effect on the rateof sne ia. we propose that a consequence of the effects of metallicity is tosignificantly increase the sn ia rate in lower-metallicity galaxies, incontrast to previous expectations. this is because lower-metallicity starsleave behind higher-mass white dwarfs, which should be easier to bring toexplosion. we first model sn ia rates in relation to galaxy masses and agesalone, finding that the elevation in the rate of sne ia in lower-mass galaxiesmeasured by loss is readily explained. however, we then see that modelsincorporating this effect of metallicity agree just as well. using the sameparameters to estimate the cosmic sn ia rate, we again find good agreement withdata up to z~2. we suggest that this degeneracy warrants more detailedexamination of host galaxy metallicities. we discuss additional implications,including for hosts of high-z sne ia, the sn ia delay time distribution,super-chandrasekhar sne, and cosmology.

1112.0679	a description of quasar variability measured using repeated sdss and  poss imaging	we provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of theoptical continuum variability of quasars. the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)has obtained repeated imaging in five uv-to-ir photometric bands for 33,881spectroscopically confirmed quasars. about 10,000 quasars have an average of 60observations in each band obtained over a decade along stripe 82 (s82), whereasthe remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. the observedtime lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasarvariability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-framewavelengths from 1000a to 6000a. we publicly release a user-friendly catalog ofquasars from the sdss data release 7 that have been observed at least twice insdss or once in both sdss and the palomar observatory sky survey, and we use itto analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability. based on a dampedrandom walk (drw) model defined by a characteristic time scale and anasymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black holemass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in s82, we canfully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-s82 quasars suchas the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. all available dataare consistent with the drw model as a viable description of the opticalcontinuum variability of quasars on time scales of ~5-2000 days in the restframe. we use these models to predict the incidence of quasar contamination intransient surveys such as those from ptf and lsst.

1201.2988	the boss emission-line lens survey. ii. investigating mass-density  profile evolution in the slacs+bells strong gravitational lens sample	we present an analysis of the evolution of the central mass-density profileof massive elliptical galaxies from the slacs and bells strong gravitationallens samples over the redshift interval z ~ 0.1-0.6, based on the combinationof strong-lensing aperture mass and stellar velocity-dispersion constraints. wefind a significant trend towards steeper mass profiles (parameterized by thepower-law density model with rho ~ r^[-gamma]) at later cosmic times, withmagnitude d&lt;gamma&gt;/dz = -0.60 +/- 0.15. we show that the combined lens-galaxysample is consistent with a non-evolving distribution of stellar velocitydispersions. considering possible additional dependence of &lt;gamma&gt; onlens-galaxy stellar mass, effective radius, and sersic index, we find marginalevidence for shallower mass profiles at higher masses and larger sizes, butwith a significance that is sub-dominant to the redshift dependence. using theresults of published monte carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys, weverify that our mass-profile evolution result cannot be explained by lensingselection biases as a function of redshift. interpreted as a true evolutionarysignal, our result suggests that major dry mergers involving off-axistrajectories play a significant role in the evolution of the averagemass-density structure of massive early-type galaxies over the past 6 gyr. wealso consider an alternative non-evolutionary hypothesis based on variations inthe strong-lensing measurement aperture with redshift, which would imply thedetection of an "inflection zone" marking the transition between thebaryon-dominated and dark-matter halo-dominated regions of the lens galaxies.further observations of the combined slacs+bells sample can constrain thispicture more precisely, and enable a more detailed investigation of themultivariate dependences of galaxy mass structure across cosmic time.

1202.1645	the chandra view of the largest quasar lens sdss j1029+2623	we present results from chandra observations of the cluster lens sdssj1029+2623 at z_l=0.58, which is a gravitationally lensed quasar with thelargest known image separation. we clearly detect x-ray emission both from thelensing cluster and the three lensed quasar images. the cluster has an x-raytemperature of kt = 8.1 (+2.0, -1.2) kev and bolometric luminosity of l_x =9.6e44 erg s^-1. its surface brightness is centered near one of the brightestcluster galaxies, and it is elongated east-west. we identify a subpeaknorth-west of the main peak, which is suggestive of an ongoing merger. even so,the x-ray mass inferred from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption appears tobe consistent with the lensing mass from the einstein radius of the system. wefind significant absorption in the soft x-ray spectrum of the faintest quasarimage, which can be caused by an intervening material at either the lens orsource redshift. the x-ray flux ratios between the quasar images (aftercorrecting for absorption) are in reasonable agreement with those at opticaland radio wavelengths, and all the flux ratios are inconsistent with thosepredicted by simple mass models. this implies that microlensing effect is notsignificant for this system and dark matter substructure is mainly responsiblefor the anomalous flux ratios.

1203.1088	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. vi. constraints on dark  energy and the evolution of massive galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the final lens sample from the sloandigital sky survey quasar lens search (sqls). the number distribution of acomplete subsample of 19 lensed quasars selected from 50,836 source quasars iscompared with theoretical expectations, with particular attention to theselection function. assuming that the velocity function of galaxies does notevolve with redshift, the sqls sample constrains the cosmological constant to\omega_\lambda=0.79^{+0.06}_{-0.07}(stat.)^{+0.06}_{-0.06}(syst.) for a flatuniverse. the dark energy equation of state is found to be consistent with w=-1when the sqls is combined with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) measurements or results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap). we also obtain simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters andredshift evolution of the galaxy velocity function, finding no evidence forredshift evolution at z&lt;1 in any combinations of constraints. for instance,number density evolution quantified as \nu_n=d\ln\phi_*/d\ln(1+z) and thevelocity dispersion evolution \nu_\sigma=d\ln\sigma_*/d\ln(1+z) are constrainedto \nu_n=1.06^{+1.36}_{-1.39}(stat.)^{+0.33}_{-0.64}(syst.) and\nu_\sigma=-0.05^{+0.19}_{-0.16}(stat.)^{+0.03}_{-0.03}(syst.) respectivelywhen the sqls result is combined with bao and wmap for flat models with acosmological constant. we find that a significant amount of dark energy ispreferred even after fully marginalizing over the galaxy evolution parameters.thus the statistics of lensed quasars robustly confirm the accelerated cosmicexpansion.

1204.5478	the observed neutron star mass distribution as a probe of the supernova  explosion mechanism	the observed distribution of neutron star (ns) masses reflects the physics ofcore-collapse supernova explosions and the structure of the massive stars thatproduce them at the end of their evolution. we present a bayesian analysis thatdirectly compares the ns mass distribution observed in double ns systems totheoretical models of ns formation. we find that models with standard binarymass ratio distributions are strongly preferred over independently picking themasses from the initial mass function, although the strength of the inferencedepends on whether current assumptions for identifying the remnants of theprimary and secondary stars are correct. second, ns formation models with nomass fallback are favored because they reduce the dispersion in ns masses. thedouble ns system masses thus directly point to the mass coordinate where thesupernova explosion was initiated, making them an excellent probe of thesupernova explosion mechanism. if we assume no fallback and simply vary themass coordinate separating the remnant and the supernova ejecta, we find thatfor solar metallicity stars the explosion most likely develops at the edge ofthe iron core at a specific entropy of about 2.8 k_b. the primary limitationsof our study are the poor knowledge of the supernova explosion mechanism andthe lack of broad range of sn model explosions of lmc to solar metallicity.

1207.5776	a two-year time delay for the lensed quasar sdss j1029+2623	we present 279 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 5.4 years from 2007january to 2012 june for the largest image separation (22.6 arcsec)gravitationally lensed quasar, sdss j1029+2623. we find that image a leads theimages b and c by dt_ab = (744+-10) days (90% confidence); the uncertaintyincludes both statistical uncertainties and systematic differences due to thechoice of models. with only a ~1% fractional error, the interpretation of thedelay is limited primarily by cosmic variance due to fluctuations in the meanline-of-sight density. we cannot separate the fainter image c from image b, butsince image c trails image b by only 2-3 days in all models, the estimate ofthe time delay between image a and b is little affected by combining the fluxesof images b and c. there is weak evidence for a low level of microlensing,perhaps created by the small galaxy responsible for the flux ratio anomaly inthis system. interpreting the delay depends on better constraining the shape ofthe gravitational potential using the lensed host galaxy, other lensed arcs andthe structure of the x-ray emission.

1209.0458	the hidden fortress: structure and substructure of the complex strong  lensing cluster sdss j1029+2623	we present hubble space telescope (hst) acs and wfc3 observations of sdssj1029+2623, a three-image quasar lens system produced by a foreground clusterat z=0.584. our strong lensing analysis reveals 6 additional multiply imagedgalaxies. we confirm the complex nature of the mass distribution of the lensingcluster, with a bimodal distribution which deviates from the chandra x-ray sbdistribution. the einstein radius is estimated to be \theta_e=15.2" \pm 0.5"for the quasar redshift of z=2.197. we derive a radial mass distribution fromthe combination of strong lensing, hst/acs weak lensing, and subaru/suprime-camweak lensing analysis results, finding a best-fit virial mass ofm_vir=(1.5+0.40-0.35) \times 10^14 h^-1 m_sun and a concentration parameter ofc_vir=25.7+14.1-7.5. the lensing mass estimate at the outer radius is smallerthan the x-ray mass estimate by a factor of ~2. we ascribe this large massdiscrepancy to shock heating of the intracluster gas during a merger, which isalso suggested by the complex mass and gas distributions and the high value ofthe concentration parameter. in the hst image, we also identify a probablegalaxy, gx, in the vicinity of the faintest quasar image c. the inclusion of gxexplains the anomalous flux ratios between the quasar images. the morphology ofthe highly elongated quasar host galaxy is also well reproduced. the best-fitmodel suggests large total magnifications of 30 for the quasar and 35 for thequasar host galaxy, and has an ab time delay consistent with the measuredvalue.

1209.3770	characterizing the optical variability of bright blazars:  variability-based selection of fermi agn	we investigate the use of optical photometric variability to select andidentify blazars in large-scale time-domain surveys, in part to aid in theidentification of blazar counterparts to the ~30% of gamma-ray sources in thefermi 2fgl catalog still lacking reliable associations. using data from theoptical linear asteroid survey, we characterize the optical variability ofblazars by fitting a damped random walk model to individual light curves withtwo main model parameters, the characteristic timescales of variability (tau),and driving amplitudes on short timescales (sigma). imposing cuts on minimumtau and sigma allows for blazar selection with high efficiency e andcompleteness c. to test the efficacy of this approach, we apply this method tooptically variable linear objects that fall within the several-arcminute errorellipses of gamma-ray sources in the fermi 2fgl catalog. despite the extremestellar contamination at the shallow depth of the linear survey, we are able torecover previously-associated optical counterparts to fermi agn with e &gt; 88%and c = 88% in fermi 95% confidence error ellipses having semimajor axis r &lt;8'. we find that the suggested radio counterpart to fermi source 2fglj1649.6+5238 has optical variability consistent with other gamma-ray blazars,and is likely to be the gamma-ray source. our results suggest that thevariability of the non-thermal jet emission in blazars is stochastic in nature,with unique variability properties due to the effects of relativistic beaming.after correcting for beaming, we estimate that the characteristic timescale ofblazar variability is ~3 years in the rest-frame of the jet, in contrast withthe ~320 day disk flux timescale observed in quasars. the variability-basedselection method presented will be useful for blazar identification intime-domain optical surveys, and is also a probe of jet physics.

1209.6055	mid-infrared selection of active galactic nuclei with the wide-field  infrared survey explorer. ii. properties of wise-selected active galactic  nuclei in the ndwfs bo\"otes field	stern et al.(2012) presented a study of wise selection of agn in the 2 deg^2cosmos field, finding that a simple criterion w1-w2&gt;=0.8 provides a highlyreliable and complete agn sample for w2&lt;15.05, where the w1 and w2 passbandsare centered at 3.4 and 4.6 microns, respectively. here we extend this studyusing the larger 9 deg^2 noao deep wide-field survey bootes field which alsohas considerably deeper wise observations than the cosmos field, and find thatthis simple color-cut significantly loses reliability at fainter fluxes. wedefine a modified selection criterion combining the w1-w2 color and the w2magnitude to provide highly reliable or highly complete agn samples for fainterwise sources. in particular, we define a color-magnitude cut that finds 130+/-4deg^-2 agn candidates for w2&lt;17.11 with 90% reliability. using the extensive uvthrough mid-ir broad-band photometry available in this field, we study thespectral energy distributions of wise agn candidates. as expected, the wise agnselection is biased towards objects where the agn dominates the bolometricluminosity output, and that it can identify highly obscured agn. we study thedistribution of reddening in the agn sample and discuss a formalism to accountfor sample incompleteness based on the step-wise maximum-likelihood method ofefstathiou et al.(1988). the resulting dust obscuration distributions dependstrongly on agn luminosity, consistent with the trend expected for a simpson(2005) receding torus. at l_agn~3x10^44 erg/s, 29+/-7% of agn are observed astype 1, while at ~4x10^45 erg/s the fraction is 64+/-13%. the distribution ofobscuration values suggests that dust in the torus is present as both a diffusemedium and in optically thick clouds.

1210.6031	a measurement of the intrahalo light fraction with near-infrared  background anisotropies	unresolved near-infrared background anisotropies are expected to havecontributions from the earliest galaxies during reionization and faint, dwarfgalaxies at intermediate redshifts. previous measurements were unable toconclusively pinpoint the dominant origin because they did not sample spatialscales that were sufficiently large to distinguish between these twopossibilities. here we report a measurement of the anisotropy power spectrumfrom sub-arcminute to one degree angular scales and find the clusteringamplitude to be larger than the model predictions involving the two existingexplanations. as the shot-noise level of the power spectrum is consistent withthat expected from faint galaxies, a new source population on the sky is notnecessary to explain the observations. a physical mechanism that increases theclustering amplitude, however, is needed. motivated by recent results relatedto the extended stellar light profile in dark matter halos, we consider thepossibility that the fluctuations originate from diffuse intrahalo stars of allgalaxies. we find that the measured power spectrum can be explained by anintrahalo light fraction of 0.07 to 0.2 % relative to the total luminosity indark matter halos of masses log(m/m_sun) ~ 9 to 12 at redshifts of ~ 1 to 4.

1212.2166	detection of substructure in the gravitationally lensed quasar  mg0414+0534 using mid-infrared and radio vlbi observations	we present 11.2 micron observations of the gravitationally lensed, radio-loudz_s=2.64 quasar mg0414+0534, obtained using the michelle camera on gemininorth. we find a flux ratio anomaly of a2/a1= 0.93 +/- 0.02 for the quasarimages a1 and a2. when combined with the 11.7 micron measurements from minezakiet al. (2009), the a2/a1 flux ratio is nearly 5-sigma from the expected ratiofor a model based on the two visible lens galaxies. the mid-ir flux ratioanomaly can be explained by a satellite (substructure), 0.3" northeast of imagea2, as can the detailed vlbi structures of the jet produced by the quasar. whenwe combine the mid-ir flux ratios with high-resolution vlbi measurements, wefind a best-fit mass between 10^(6.2) and 10^(7.5) m_sol inside the einsteinradius for a satellite substructure modeled as a singular isothermal sphere atthe redshift of the main lens (z_l=0.96). we are unable to set an interestinglimit on the mass to light ratio due to its proximity to the quasar image a2.while the observations used here were technically difficult, surveys of fluxanomalies in gravitational lenses with the james webb space telescope will besimple, fast, and should well constrain the abundance of substructure in darkmatter haloes.

1303.3889	civ line-width anomalies: the perils of low s/n spectra	comparison of six high-redshift quasar spectra obtained with the largebinocular telescope with previous observations from the sloan digital skysurvey shows that failure to correctly identify absorption and other problemswith accurate characterization of the civ emission line profile in low s/n datacan severely limit the reliability of single-epoch mass estimates based on theciv emission line. we combine the analysis of these new high-quality data witha reanalysis of three other samples based on high s/n spectra of the civemission line region. we find that a large scatter between the hbeta- andciv-based masses remains even for this high s/n sample when using the fwhm tocharacterize the blr velocity dispersion and the standard virial assumption tocalculate the mass. however, we demonstrate that using high-quality data andthe line dispersion to characterize the civ line width leads to a high level ofconsistency between civ- and hbeta-based masses, with &lt;0.3 dex of observedscatter, and an estimated ~0.2 dex intrinsic scatter, in the mass residuals.

1304.1620	the structure of he 1104-1805 from infrared to x-ray	the gravitationally lensed quasar he 1104-1805 has been observed at a varietyof wavelengths ranging from the mid-infrared to x-ray for nearly 20 years. wecombine flux ratios from the literature, including recent chandra data, withnew observations from the smarts telescope and hst, and use them to investigatethe spatial structure of the central regions using a bayesian monte carloanalysis of the microlensing variability. the wide wavelength coverage allowsus to constrain not only the accretion disk half-light radius r_1/2, but thepower-law slope \xi\ of the size-wavelength relation r_1/2 ~ \lambda^\xi. witha logarithmic prior on the source size, the (observed-frame) r-band half-lightradius log(r_1/2/cm) is 16.0+0.3-0.4, and the slope \xi\ is 1.0+0.30-0.56. weput upper limits on the source size in soft (0.4-1.2 kev) and hard (1.2-8 kev)x-ray bands, finding 95% upper limits on log (r_1/2/cm) of 15.33 in both bands.a linear prior yields somewhat larger sizes, particularly in the x-ray bands.for comparison, the gravitational radius, using a black hole mass estimatedusing the h\beta\ line, is log(r_g/cm) = 13.94. we find that the accretion diskis probably close to face-on, with cos i = 1.0 being four times more likelythan cos i = 0.5. we also find probability distributions for the mean mass ofthe stars in the foreground lensing galaxy, the direction of the transversepeculiar velocity of the lens, and the position angle of the projectedaccretion disk's major axis (if not face-on).

1308.0334	reconciling 56ni production in type ia supernovae with double degenerate  scenarios	binary white dwarf (wd) coalescences driven by gravitational waves orcollisions in triple systems are potential progenitors of type ia supernovae(sne ia). we combine the distribution of 56ni inferred from observations of sneia with the results of both sub-chandrasekhar detonation models and directcollision calculations to estimate what mass wds should be exploding in eachscenario to reproduce the observations. these wd mass distributions are thencompared with the observed galactic wd mass distribution and monte carlosimulations of wd-wd binary populations. for collisions, we find that theaverage mass of the individual components of the wd-wd binary must be peaked at~0.75msun, significantly higher than the average wd mass in binaries or in thefield of ~0.55-0.60msun. thus, if collisions produce a large fraction of sneia, then a mechanism must exist that favors large mass wds. on the other hand,in an old stellar population, collisions would naturally result in a class oflow luminosity sne ia, and we suggest these may be related to 1991bg-likeevents. for sub-chandrasekhar detonations, we find that the average mass of theexploding wds must be peaked at ~1.1msun. this is interestingly similar to theaverage sum of the masses in wd-wd binaries, but it is not clear (and should befurther explored) whether double degenerate mergers would be sufficientlyefficient at synthesizing 56ni to match the observed yields. if not, thenactual ~1.1msun wds would be needed for sub-chandrasekhar detonations. sincesuch high mass wds are produced relatively quickly in comparison to the age ofthe environments where sne ia are found, this would require either accretiononto lower mass wds prior to ignition or a long timescale between formation ofthe ~1.1msun wd and ignition (such as set by gravitational wave emission orbinary interactions).

0801.3432	difference imaging of lensed quasar candidates in the sdss supernova  survey region	difference imaging provides a new way to discover gravitationally lensedquasars because few non-lensed sources will show spatially extended, timevariable flux. we test the method on lens candidates in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) supernova survey region from the sdss quasar lens search (sqls)and their surrounding fields. starting from 20768 sources, including 49 sdssquasars and 36 candidate lenses/lensed images, we find that 21 sourcesincluding 15 sdss qsos and 7 candidate lenses/lensed images are non-periodicvariable sources. we can measure the spatial structure of the variable flux for18 of these sources and identify only one as a non-point source. this sourcedoes not display the compelling spatial structure of the variable flux of knownlensed quasars, so we reject it as a lens candidate. none of the lenscandidates from the sqls survive our cuts. given our effective survey area oforder 0.71 square degrees, this indicates a false positive rate of order oneper square degree for themethod. the fraction of quasars not found to bevariable and the false positive rate should both fall if we analyze the full,later data releases for the sdss fields. while application of the method to thesdss is limited by the resolution, depth, and sampling of the survey, severalfuture surveys such as pan-starrs, lsst, and snap will avoid these limitations.

1408.5970	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: technical  overview	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project (sdss-rm) is adedicated multi-object rm experiment that has spectroscopically monitored asample of 849 broad-line quasars in a single 7 deg$^2$ field with the sdss-iiiboss spectrograph. the rm quasar sample is flux-limited to i_psf=21.7 mag, andcovers a redshift range of 0.1&lt;z&lt;4.5. optical spectroscopy was performed during2014 jan-jul dark/grey time, with an average cadence of ~4 days, totaling morethan 30 epochs. supporting photometric monitoring in the g and i bands wasconducted at multiple facilities including the cfht and the steward observatorybok telescopes in 2014, with a cadence of ~2 days and covering all lunarphases. the rm field (ra, dec=14:14:49.00, +53:05:00.0) lies within the cfht-lsw3 field, and coincides with the pan-starrs 1 (ps1) medium deep field md07,with three prior years of multi-band ps1 light curves. the sdss-rm 6-monthbaseline program aims to detect time lags between the quasar continuum andbroad line region (blr) variability on timescales of up to several months (inthe observed frame) for ~10% of the sample, and to anchor the time baseline forcontinued monitoring in the future to detect lags on longer timescales and athigher redshift. sdss-rm is the first major program to systematically explorethe potential of rm for broad-line quasars at z&gt;0.3, and will investigate theprospects of rm with all major broad lines covered in optical spectroscopy.sdss-rm will provide guidance on future multi-object rm campaigns on largerscales, and is aiming to deliver more than tens of blr lag detections for ahomogeneous sample of quasars. we describe the motivation, design andimplementation of this program, and outline the science impact expected fromthe resulting data for rm and general quasar science.

astro-ph;0312136	the central image of a gravitationally lensed quasar	a galaxy can act as a gravitational lens, producing multiple images of abackground object. theory predicts there should be an odd number of images but,paradoxically, almost all observed lenses have 2 or 4 images. the missing imageshould be faint and appear near the galaxy's center. these ``central images''have long been sought as probes of galactic cores too distant to resolve withordinary observations. there are five candidates, but in one case the thirdimage is not necessarily a central image, and in the others, the centralcomponent might be a foreground source rather than a lensed image. here wereport the most secure identification of a central image, based on radioobservations of pmn j1632-0033, one of the latter candidates. lens modelsincorporating the central image show that the mass of the lens galaxy's centralblack hole is less than 2 x 10^8 m_sun, and the galaxy's surface density at thelocation of the central image is more than 20,000 m_sun per square parsec, inagreement with expectations based on observations of galaxies hundreds of timescloser to the earth.

astro-ph;0410523	mid-infrared selection of active galaxies	mid-infrared photometry provides a robust technique for identifying activegalaxies. while the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of normal galaxies isdominated by the composite stellar black body curve and peaks at approximately1.6 microns, the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of active galaxies isdominated by a power law. consequently, with sufficient wavelength baseline,one can easily distinguish agn from stellar populations. mirroring the tendencyof agn to be bluer than galaxies in the ultraviolet, where galaxies (and stars)sample the blue, rising portion of stellar spectra, agn tend to be redder thangalaxies in the mid-infrared, where galaxies sample the red, falling portion ofthe stellar spectra. we report on spitzer space telescope mid-infrared colors,derived from the irac shallow survey, of nearly 10,000 spectroscopicallyidentified sources from the agn and galaxy evolution survey. based on thisspectroscopic sample, we find that simple mid-infrared color criteria provideremarkably robust separation of active galaxies from normal galaxies andgalactic stars, with over 80% completeness and less than 20% contamination.considering only broad-lined agn, these mid-infrared color criteria identifyover 90% of spectroscopically identified quasars and seyfert 1s. applying thesecolor criteria to the full imaging data set, we discuss the implied surfacedensity of agn and find evidence for a large population of optically obscuredactive galaxies.

astro-ph;0507360	discovery of multiply imaged galaxies behind the cluster and lensed  quasar sdss j1004+4112	we have identified three multiply imaged galaxies in hubble space telescopeimages of the redshift z=0.68 cluster responsible for the large-separationquadruply lensed quasar, sdss j1004+4112. spectroscopic redshifts have beensecured for two of these systems using the keck i 10m telescope. the mostdistant lensed galaxy, at z=3.332, forms at least four images, and an einsteinring encompassing 3.1 times more area than the einstein ring of the lensed qsoimages at z=1.74, due to the greater source distance. for a second multiplyimaged galaxy, we identify ly_alpha emission at a redshift of z=2.74. thecluster mass profile can be constrained from near the center of the brightestcluster galaxy, where we observe both a radial arc and the fifth image of thelensed quasar, to the einstein radius of the highest redshift galaxy, ~110 kpc.our preliminary modeling indicates that the mass approximates an ellipticalbody, with an average projected logarithmic gradient of ~-0.5. the system ispotentially useful for a direct measurement of world models in a previouslyuntested redshift range.

astro-ph;0507615	the xbootes chandra survey paper ii: the x-ray source catalog	we present results from a chandra survey of the nine square degree bootesfield of the noao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs). this xbootes survey consistsof 126 separate contiguous acis-i observations each of approximately 5000seconds in duration. these unique chandra observations allow us to search forlarge scale structure and to calculate x-ray source statistics o ver a wide,contiguous field of view with arcsecond angular resolution and uniformcoverage. optical spectroscopic follow-up observations and the rich ndwfs dataset will allow us to identify and classify these x-ray selected sources.  using wavelet decomposition, we detect 4642 point sources with n $\ge$ 2counts. in order to keep our detections ~99% reliable, we limit our list tosources with n $\ge$ 4 counts.  the full 0.5--7 kev band n $\ge$ 4 count list has 3293 point sources. inaddition to the point sources, 43 extended sources have been detectedconsistent, with the depth of these observations and the number counts ofclusters. we present here the x-ray catalog for the xbootes survey, includingsource positions, x-ray fluxes, hardness ratios and their uncertainties.  we calculate and present the differential number of sources per flux densit yinterval, $n(s)$, for the point sources.

astro-ph;0508657	black hole masses and eddington ratios at 0.3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the distribution of eddington luminosity ratios, l_bol/l_edd, ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) discovered in the agn and galaxy evolution survey(ages). we combine h-beta, mgii, and civ line widths with continuumluminosities to estimate black hole (bh) masses in 407 agns, covering theredshift range z~0.3-4 and the bolometric luminosity range l_bol~10^45-10^47erg/s. the sample consists of x-ray or mid-infrared (24 micron) point sourceswith optical magnitude r&lt;=21.5 mag and optical emission line spectracharacteristic of agns. for the range of luminosity and redshift probed byages, the distribution of estimated eddington ratios is well described aslog-normal with a peak at l_bol/l_edd ~ 1/4 and a dispersion of 0.3 dex. sinceadditional sources of scatter are minimal, this dispersion must account forcontributions from the scatter between estimated and true bh mass and thescatter between estimated and true bolometric luminosity. therefore, weconclude that: (1) neither of these sources of error can contribute more than\~0.3 dex rms; and (2) the true eddington ratios of optically luminous agns areeven more sharply peaked. because the mass estimation errors must be smallerthan ~0.3 dex, we can also investigate the distribution of eddington ratios atfixed bh mass. we show for the first time that the distribution of eddingtonratios at fixed bh mass is peaked, and that the dearth of agns at a factor ~10below eddington is real and not an artifact of sample selection. these resultsprovide strong evidence that supermassive bhs gain most of their mass whileradiating close to the eddington limit, and they suggest that the fueling ratesin luminous agns are ultimately determined by bh self-regulation of theaccretion flow rather than galactic scale dynamical disturbances.

astro-ph;0510504	the 1&lt;z&lt;5 infrared luminosity function of type i quasars	we determine the rest-frame 8 micron luminosity function of type i quasarsover the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;5. our sample consists of 292 24 micron sourcesbrighter than 1 mjy selected from 7.17 square degrees of the spitzer spacetelescope mips survey of the noao deep wide-field survey bootes field. the agnand galaxy evolution survey (ages) has measured redshifts for 270 of the r&lt;21.7sources and we estimate that the contamination of the remaining 22 sources bystars and galaxies is low. we are able to select quasars missed by ultra-violetexcess quasar surveys, including reddened type i quasars and 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.0 quasarswith optical colors similar to main sequence stars. we find reddened type iquasars comprise 20% of the type i quasar population. nonetheless, the shape,normalization, and evolution of the rest-frame 8 micron luminosity function iscomparable to that of quasars selected from optical surveys. the 8 micronluminosity function of type i quasars is well approximated by a power-law withindex -2.75(+/-0.14). we directly measure the peak of the quasar space densityto be at z=2.6(+/-0.3).

astro-ph;0511001	halo structures of gravitational lens galaxies	we explore the halo structure of four gravitational lenses withwell-observed, thin einstein rings. we find that the gravitational potentialsare well described by ellipsoidal density distributions in the sense that thebest-fit nonellipsoidal models have parameters consistent with theirellipsoidal counterparts. we find upper limits on the standard parameters forthe deviation from an ellipse of |a_3/a_0|&lt;0.023, 0.019, 0.037, and 0.035, and|a_4/a_0|&lt;0.034, 0.041, 0.051, and 0.064 for sdss j0924+0219, he0435-1223,b1938+666, and pg1115+080, respectively. we find that the lens galaxies are atthe centers of their dark matter halos, and obtain upper limits for the offsetof each center of mass from the center of light of |delta x|&lt;0.004, 0.005,0.009, and 0.005 arcsec, corresponding to 22, 29, 70, and 23 pc. these limitsalso exclude the possibility of any significant lopsidednessof the dark matterhalos and set an upper limit of f_sat&lt;sqrt(n)% on the mass fraction of massivesubstructures inside the einstein ring if they are divided over n satellites.we also explore the properties of galaxies as substructures in groups for thelens pg1115+080, finding evidence for dark matter halos associated with thegalaxies but no evidence for a clear distinction between satellite and centralgalaxies.

astro-ph;0512343	the chandra xbootes survey - iii: optical and near-ir counterparts	the xbootes survey is a 5-ks chandra survey of the bootes field of the noaodeep wide-field survey (ndwfs). this survey is unique in that it is the largest(9.3 deg^2), contiguous region imaged in x-ray with complementary deep opticaland near-ir observations. we present a catalog of the optical counterparts tothe 3,213 x-ray point sources detected in the xbootes survey. using a bayesianidentification scheme, we successfully identified optical counterparts for 98%of the x-ray point sources. the optical colors suggest that the opticallydetected galaxies are a combination of z&lt;1 massive early-type galaxies andbluer star-forming galaxies whose optical agn emission is faint or obscured,whereas the majority of the optically detected point sources are likely quasarsover a large redshift range. our large area, x-ray bright, optically deepsurvey enables us to select a large sub-sample of sources (773) with high x-rayto optical flux ratios (f_x/f_o&gt;10). these objects are likely high redshiftand/or dust obscured agn. these sources have generally harder x-ray spectrathan sources with 0.1&lt;f_x/f_o&lt;10. of the 73 x-ray sources with no opticalcounterpart in the ndwfs catalog, 47 are truly optically blank down to r~25.5(the average 50% completeness limit of the ndwfs r-band catalogs). thesesources are also likely to be high redshift and/or dust obscured agn.

astro-ph;0605030	the discovery of three new z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolution  survey	we present the discovery of three z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey (ages) spectroscopic observations of the noao deep wide-field survey(ndwfs) bootes field. these quasars were selected as part of a larger spitzermid-infrared quasar sample with no selection based on optical colors. thehighest redshift object, ndwfs j142516.3+325409, z=5.85, is thelowest-luminosity z&gt;5.8 quasar currently known. we compare mid-infraredtechniques for identifying z&gt;5 quasars to more traditional optical techniquesand show that mid-infrared colors allow for selection of high-redshift quasarseven at redshifts where quasars lie near the optical stellar locus and at z&gt;7where optical selection is impossible. using the superb multi-wavelengthcoverage available in the ndwfs bootes field, we construct the spectral energydistributions (seds) of high-redshift quasars from observed bw-band to 24microns (rest-frame 600 angstroms - 3.7 microns). we show that the threehigh-redshift quasars have quite similar seds, and the rest-frame composite sedof low-redshift quasars from the literature shows little evolution compared toour high-redshift objects. we compare the number of z&gt;5 quasars we havediscovered to the expected number from published quasar luminosity functions.while analyses of the quasar luminosity function are tenuous based on onlythree objects, we find that a relatively steep luminosity function with psil^(-3.2) provides the best agreement with the number of high-redshift quasarsdiscovered in our survey.

astro-ph;0605321	time-delay measurement for the quadruple lens rx j1131-1231	we have measured the three time delays for the quadruple gravitational lensrx j1131-1231 using two seasons of monitoring data. the short delays betweencusp images are a-b = 11.98 +1.52,-1.27 days and a-c = 9.61 +1.97,-1.57 days.the long a-d delay for the counter image is not as precisely determined becauseof the season gaps, but the data suggest a delay of -87 +- 8 days. the shortdelays are difficult to explain using standard isothermal halo models of thelensing potential, which instead prefer a-b and a-c delays of ~1 day forreasonable values of the hubble constant. matching the cusp delays is possibleby adding a significant (~5 x 10^10 m_sun) amount of matter nearly coincident(~0.05" south-east) with the a image. adding such a satellite also helpsimprove the quasar and lens astrometry of the model, reduces the velocitydispersion of the main lens and shifts it closer to the fundamental plane. thisis suggestive of a satellite galaxy to the primary lens, but its expectedluminosity and proximity to both image a and the system's bright einstein ringmake visual identification impossible even with the existing hst data. we alsofind evidence for significant structure along the line of sight toward thelens. archival chandra observations show two nearby regions of extended x-rayemission, each with bolometric x-ray luminosities of 2-3 x 10^43 ergs/s. thebrighter region is located 153" from the lens and centered on a z=0.1foreground cd galaxy, and the fainter and presumably more distant region is 4-5times closer (in angular separation) to the lens and likely corresponds to theweaker of two galaxy red sequences (which includes the lens galaxy) previouslydetected at optical wavelengths.

astro-ph;0606002	the x-ray properties of optically-selected galaxy clusters	we stacked the x-ray data from the rosat all sky survey for over 4,000clusters selected from the 2mass catalog and divided into five richnessclasses. we detected excess x-ray emission over background at the center of thestacked images in all five richness bins. the interrelationships between themass, x-ray temperature and x-ray luminosity of the stacked clusters agree wellwith those derived from catalogs of x-ray clusters. poisson variance in thenumber of galaxies occupying halos of a given mass leads to significantdifferences between the average richness at fixed mass and the average mass atfixed richness that we can model relatively easily using a simple model of thehalo occupation distribution. these statistical effects probably explain recentresults in which optically-selected clusters lie on the same x-rayluminosity-temperature relations as local clusters but have lower opticalrichnesses than observed for local clusters with the same x-ray properties.when we further binned the clusters by redshift, we did not find significantredshift-dependent biases in the sense that the x-ray luminosities for massiveclusters of fixed optical richness show little dependence on redshift beyondthat expected from the effects of poisson fluctuations. our results demonstratethat stacking of rass data from optically selected clusters can be a powerfultest for biases in cluster selection algorithms.

astro-ph;9305015	gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts	coalescing binaries in distant galaxies are one of the most promising sourcesof gravitational waves detectable by the ligo project.$^{[1-5]}$ they are alsoa copious source of neutrinos,$^{[1]}$ however these neutrino pulses are fartoo weak to be detected on earth. several years ago eichler \etal$\,$$^{[6]}$suggested that they are also sources of $\gamma$-ray bursts (grbs). recently itwas found$^{[7]}$ that grbs are likely to be cosmological in origin, andcoalescing binary systems$^{[6,8-11]}$ are probably the most promisingcosmological sources. the current estimates of the burst and ligo rates from acosmologically distributed population are based on the systems observed in ourgalaxy.$^{[12-14]}$ these estimates are based on only three binarys so thereare large statistical uncertainties in the coalescence rate. if we accept thecosmological/coalescing binary hypothesis for grbs, then we get a more accurateestimate of the rate at which binaries coalesce and hence of the predicted ligosignal. the association between grbs and binaries can significantly improve theperformance of ligo. the detection of gravitational radiation from a grb sourcenot only confirms the coalescing binary model, but it will also provideinformation on the geometry and energy generation mechanism of the burst.

astro-ph;9411082	gravitational lensing limits on cold dark matter and its variants	standard $\omega_0=1$ cold dark matter (cdm) needs $0.27 &lt; \sigma_8 &lt; 0.63$($2\sigma$) to fit the observed number of large separation lenses, and theconstraint is nearly independent of $h_0=100h^{-1}\kms$ mpc$^{-1}$. this rangeis strongly inconsistent with the cobe estimate of $\sigma_8=(2.8\pm0.2)h$.tilting the primordial spectrum $\propto k^n$ from $n=1$ to $0.3 \ltorder n\ltorder 0.7$, using an effective hubble constant of $0.15 \ltorder \gamma=h\ltorder 0.30$, or reducing the matter density to $0.15 \ltorder \omega_0 h\ltorder 0.3$ either with no cosmological constant ($\lambda_0=0$) or in a flatuniverse with a cosmological constant ($\omega_0+\lambda_0=1$) can bring thelensing estimate of $\sigma_8$ into agreement with the cobe estimates. themodels and values for $\sigma_8$ consistent with both lensing and cobe matchthe estimates from the local number density of clusters and correlationfunctions. the conclusions are insensitive to systematic errors except for theassumption that cluster core radii are singular. if clusters with$\rho\propto(r^2+s^2)^{-1}$ have core radii exceeding $s = 15h^{-1}\sigma_3^2$kpc for a cluster with velocity dispersion $\sigma=10^3\sigma_3 \kms$ then theestimates are invalid. there is, however, a fine tuning problem in making thecluster core radii large enough to invalidate the estimates of $\sigma_8$ whileproducing several lenses that do not have central or ``odd images.'' theestimated completeness of the current samples of lenses larger than $5\parcs0$is 20\%, because neither quasar surveys nor lens surveys are optimized to thisclass of lenses.

astro-ph;9505068	the mass of the milky way galaxy	we use the jaffe model as a global mass distribution for the galaxy anddetermine the circular velocity $v_c$ and the jaffe radius $r_j$ using thesatellites of the galaxy, estimates of the local escape velocity of stars, theconstraints imposed by the known rotation curve of the disk, and the localgroup timing model. the models include the systematic uncertainties in theisotropy of the satellite orbits, the form of the stellar distribution functionnear the escape velocity, and the ellipticity of the m31/galaxy orbit. if weinclude the local group timing constraint, then leo i is bound,$v_c=230\pm30\kms$, and $r_j=180$ kpc (110 kpc $\ltorder r_j \ltorder $ 300kpc) at 90\% confidence. the satellite orbits are nearly isotropic with$\beta=1-\sigma_\theta^2/\sigma_r^2=0.07$ ($-0.7 \ltorder \beta \ltorder 0.6$)and the stellar distribution function near the escape velocity is$f(\epsilon)\propto \epsilon^k$ with $k_r=3.7$ ($0.8 \ltorder k_r \ltorder7.6$) where $k_r=k+5/2$. while not an accurate measurement of $k$, it isconsistent with models of violent relaxation ($k=3/2$). the mass inside 50 kpcis $(5.4\pm1.3)\times 10^{11} m_\odot$. higher mass models require that m31 ison its second orbit and that the halo is larger than the classical tidal limitof the binary. such models must have a significant fraction of the local groupmass in an extended local group halo. lower mass models require that both m31and leo i are unbound, but there is no plausible mechanism to produce theobserved deviations of m31 and leo i from their expected velocities in anunbound system. if we do not use the local group timing model, the median massof the galaxy {\it increases} significantly, and the error bars broaden. usingonly the satellite, escape velocity, and disk rotation curve constraints, the

0811.1398	the origin of the 24-micron excess in red galaxies	observations with the spitzer space telescope have revealed a population ofred-sequence galaxies with a significant excess in their 24-micron emissioncompared to what is expected from an old stellar population. we identify 900red galaxies with 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages)selected from the noao deep wide-field survey bootes field. using spitzer/mips,we classify 89 (~10%) with 24-micron infrared excess (f24&gt;0.3 mjy). wedetermine the prevalence of agn and star-formation activity in all the agesgalaxies using optical line diagnostics and mid-ir color-color criteria. usingthe irac color-color diagram from the irac shallow survey, we find that 64% ofthe 24-micron excess red galaxies are likely to have strong pah emissionfeatures in the 8-micron irac band. this fraction is significantly larger thanthe 5% of red galaxies with f24&lt;0.3 mjy that are estimated to have strong pahemission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due tostar-formation processes. only 15% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies haveoptical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64% are classifiedas agn and 21% are unclassifiable). the difference between the optical andinfrared results suggest that both agn and star-formation activity is occurringsimultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. these resultsshould serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical linediagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared andother bands. we find that ~40% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-onspiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. the remaining sources are likelyto be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination ofobscured agn and star-formation activity.
