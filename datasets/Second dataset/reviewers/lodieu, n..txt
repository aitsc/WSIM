0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0902.1812	the discovery of an m4+t8.5 binary system	we report the discovery of a t8.5 dwarf, which is a companion to the m4 dwarfwolf 940. at a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 au. the m4 primarydisplays no halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of west etal. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 gyr. weak halphaabsorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limitof 6 gyr. we apply the relations of bonfils et al for v-ks and m_ks todetermine the metallicity, [fe/h] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for wolf~940a, and byextension the t8.5 secondary, wolf 940b. we have obtained jhk niri spectroscopyand jhkl' photometry of wolf 940b, and use these data, in combination withtheoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18e-16 wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(l*/lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. using the ageconstraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of baraffe etal. we determine teff = 570 +/- 25k and log g = 4.75-5.00 for wolf940b, basedon its bolometric luminosity. this represents the first determination of theseproperties for a t8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of t-dwarfspectral models. this object represents the first system containing a t8+ dwarffor which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compareits spectra with those of the latest very cool bt-settl models. this clearlydemonstrates that the use of the (w_j,k/j) spectral ratios (used previously toconstrain teff and log g) would have over-estimated teff by ~100k.

0706.2234	a wide deep infrared look at the pleiades with ukidss: new constraints  on the substellar binary fraction and the low mass imf	we present the results of a deep wide-field near-infrared survey of 12 squaredegrees of the pleiades conducted as part of the ukidss deep infrared skysurvey (ukidss) galactic cluster survey (gcs). we have extracted over 340 highprobability proper motion members down to 0.03 solar masses using a combinationof ukidss photometry and proper motion measurements obtained bycross-correlating the gcs with data from the two micron all sky survey (2mass),the isaac newton (int) and the canada-france-hawai'i (cfht) telescopes.additionally, we have unearthed 73 new candidate brown dwarf members on thebasis of five band ukidss photometry alone. we have identified 23 substellarmultiple system candidates out of 63 candidate brown dwarfs from the (y-k,y)and (j-k,j) colour-magnitude diagrams, yielding a binary frequency of 28-44% inthe 0.075-0.030 msun mass range. our estimate is three times larger than thebinary fractions reported from high-resolution imaging surveys of fieldultracool dwarfs and pleiades brown dwarfs. however, it is marginallyconsistent with our earlier ``peculiar'' photometric binary fraction of50+/-10% presented in pinfield et al. (2003), in good agreement with the 32-45%binary fraction derived from the recent monte-carlo simulations of maxted &amp;jeffries (2005) and compatible with the 26+/-10% frequency recently estimatedby basri &amp; reiners (2006). a tentative estimate of the mass ratios fromphotometry alone seems to support the hypothesis that binary brown dwarfs tendto reside in near equal-mass ratio systems.

0903.4057	lucky imaging of m subdwarfs	the knowledge of the binary properties of metal-poor and solar-metallicitystars can shed light on the potential differences between the formationprocesses responsible for both types of objects.  the aim of the project is to determine the binary properties (separation,mass ratio, frequency of companions) for m subdwarfs, the low-metallicitycounterparts of field m dwarfs, and investigate any potential differencesbetween both populations.  we have obtained high-resolution imaging in the optical for a sample of 24early-m subdwarfs and nine extreme subdwarfs with the ``lucky imaging''technique using the astralux instrument on the calar alto 2.2-m telescope.  we are sensitive to companions at separations larger than 0.1 arcsec anddifferences of ~2 magnitudes at 0.1 arcsec and ~5 mag at 1 arcsec. we havefound no companion around the 24 subdwarfs under study and one close binary outof nine extreme subdwarfs. a second image of lhs 182 taken three months laterwith the same instrument confirms the common proper motion of the binaryseparated by about 0.7 arcsec. moreover, we do not confirm the common propermotion of the faint source reported by riaz and collaborators at ~2 arcsec fromlhs 1074. we derive a binary frequency of 3+/-3% for m subdwarfs from oursample of 33 objects for separations larger than about five astronomical units.adding to our sample the additional 28 metal-poor early-m dwarfs observed withthe hubble space telescope by riaz and collaborators, we infer a binaryfraction of 3.7+/-2.6% (with a 1 sigma confidence limit), significantly lowerthan the fraction of resolved binary m dwarfs (~20%) over the same mass andseparation ranges (abridged).

1204.4328	new ultracool subdwarfs identified in large-scale surveys using virtual  observatory tools: part i: ukidss las dr5 vs sdss dr7	the aim of the project is to improve our knowledge on the low-mass andlow-metallicity population to investigate the influence of metallicity of thestellar (and substellar) mass function.  we present the results of a photometric and proper motion search aimed atunearthing ultracool subdwarfs in large-scale surveys. we employed and combinedthe ukidss las dr5 and the sdss dr7 complemented with ancillary data from2mass, denis and supercosmos.  the sdss dr7 vs ukidss las dr5 search returned a total of 32 ultracoolsubdwarf candidates, only two being recognised as a subdwarf in the literature.twenty-seven candidates were followed-up spectroscopically in the opticalbetween 600 and 1000 nm. we confirmed 20 candidates as subdwarfs, extremesubdwarfs or ultra-subdwarfs with spectral types later than m5; this representsa success rate of ~60%. among those 20 new subdwarfs, we identified 2 early-lsubdwarfs very likely located within 100 pc that we propose as templates forfuture searches because they are the first examples of their subclass. another7 sources are solar-metallicity m dwarfs with spectral types between m4 and m7without halpha emission, suggesting that they are old m dwarfs. the remaining 5candidates do not have spectroscopic follow-up yet; only 1 remains as abona-fide ultracool subdwarf after revision of their proper motions. weassigned spectral types based on the current classification schemes and, whenpossible, we measured their radial velocities. using the limited number ofsubdwarfs with trigonometric parallaxes, we estimated distances between 90 and600 for the new subdwarfs. we provide mid-infrared photometry from wise for twosubdwarfs and discuss their colours. finally, we estimate a lower limit of thesurface density of ultracool subdwarfs of the order of 5000-5700 times lowerthan that of solar-metallicity late-m dwarfs (shortened).

1206.2773	discovery and characterisation of detached m-dwarf eclipsing binaries in  the wfcam transit survey	we report the discovery of 16 detached m-dwarf eclipsing binaries with j&lt;16mag and provide a detailed characterisation of three of them, usinghigh-precision infrared light curves from the wfcam transit survey (wts). suchsystems provide the most accurate and model-independent method for measuringthe fundamental parameters of these poorly understood yet numerous stars, whichcurrently lack sufficient observations to precisely calibrate stellar evolutionmodels. we fully solve for the masses and radii of three of the systems,finding orbital periods in the range 1.5&lt;p&lt;4.9 days, with masses spanning0.35-0.50 msun and radii between 0.38-0.50 rsun, with uncertainties of~3.5-6.4% in mass and ~2.7-5.5% in radius. close-companions in short-periodbinaries are expected to be tidally-locked into fast rotational velocities,resulting in high levels of magnetic activity. this is predicted to inflatetheir radii by inhibiting convective flow and increasing star spot coverage.the radii of the wts systems are inflated above model predictions by ~3-12%, inagreement with the observed trend, despite an expected lower systematiccontribution from star spots signals at infrared wavelengths. we searched forcorrelation between the orbital period and radius inflation by combining ourresults with all existing m-dwarf radius measurements of comparable precision,but we found no statistically significant evidence for a decrease in radiusinflation for longer period, less active systems. radius inflation continues toexists in non-synchronised systems indicating that the problem remains even forvery low activity m-dwarfs. resolving this issue is vital not only forunderstanding the most populous stars in the universe, but also forcharacterising their planetary companions, which hold the best prospects forfinding earth-like planets in the traditional habitable zone.

1402.1584	new constraints on the formation and settling of dust in the atmospheres  of young m and l dwarfs	we obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra of seven young m9.5-l3dwarfs classified in the optical. we aim to confirm the low surface gravity ofthe objects in the nir. we also test whether atmospheric models correctlyrepresent the formation and the settling of dust clouds in the atmosphere ofyoung late-m and l dwarfs. we used isaac at vlt to obtain the spectra of thetargets. we compared them to those of mature and young bd, and young late-typecompanions to nearby stars with known ages, in order to identify and studygravity-sensitive features. we computed spectral indices weakly sensitive tothe surface gravity to derive near-infrared spectral types. finally, we foundthe best fit between each spectrum and synthetic spectra from the bt-settl 2010and 2013 models. using the best fit, we derived the atmospheric parameters ofthe objects and identify which spectral characteristics the models do notreproduce. we confirmed that our objects are young bd and we found nir spectraltypes in agreement with the ones determined at optical wavelengths. thespectrum of the l2-gamma dwarf 2massj2322-6151 reproduces well the spectrum ofthe planetary mass companion 1rxs j1609-2105b. bt-settl models fit the spectraand the 1-5 $\mu$m sed of the l0-l3 dwarfs for temperatures between 1600-2000k. but the models fail to reproduce the shape of the h band, and the nir slopeof some of our targets. this fact, and the best fit solutions found withsuper-solar metallicity are indicative of a lack of dust, in particular at highaltitude, in the cloud models. the modeling of the vertical mixing and of thegrain growth will be revised in the next version of the bt-settl models. theserevisions may suppress the remaining non-reproducibilities.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1505.06858	a search for lithium in metal-poor l dwarfs	the aim of the project is to search for lithium in absorption at 6707.8angstroms to constrain the nature and the mass of the brightest low-metallicityl-type dwarfs (refered to as l subdwarfs) identified in large-scale surveys.  we obtained low- to intermediate-resolution (r~2500-9000) optical (~560-770nm) spectra of two mid-l subdwarfs, sdssj125637.13-022452.4 (sdss1256; sdl3.5)and 2massj162620.14+392519.5 (2mass1626; sdl4) with spectrographs on theeuropean southern observatory very large telescope and the gran telescopio decanarias.  we report the presence of a feature at the nominal position of the lithiumabsorption doublet at 6707.8 angstroms in the spectrum of sdss1256, with anequivalent width of 66+/-27 angstroms at 2.4 sigma, which we identify asarising from a cah molecular transition based on atmosphere models. we do notsee any feature at the position of the lithium feature in the spectrum of2mass1626. the existence of overlapping molecular absorption sets a confusiondetection limit of [li/h]=-3 for equivalently-typed l subdwarfs. we providedimproved radial velocity measurements of -126+/-10 km/s and -239+/-12 km/s forsdss1256 and 2mass1626, respectively, as well as revised galactic orbits. weimplemented adjusting factors for the cah molecule in combination with thenextgen atmosphere models to fit the optical spectrum of sdss1256 in the6200-7300 angstroms range. we also estimate the expected li abundance frominterstellar accretion ([li/h]=-5), place limits on circumstellar accretion(10^9 g/yr), and discuss the prospects of li searches in cooler l and tsubdwarfs.

1506.01861	optical spectroscopy of candidate alpha persei white dwarfs	as part of an investigation into the high mass end of the initial mass-finalmass relation we performed a search for new white dwarf members of the nearby(172.4 pc), young (80-90 myr) $\alpha$ persei open star cluster. thephotometric and astrometric search using the ukirt infrared deep sky survey andsupercosmos sky surveys discovered 14 new white dwarf candidates. we haveobtained medium resolution optical spectra of the brightest 11 candidates usingthe william herschel telescope and confirmed that while 7 are da white dwarfs,3 are db white dwarfs and one is an sdob star, only three have cooling ageswithin the cluster age, and from their position on the initial mass-final massrelation, it is likely none are cluster members. this result is disappointing,as recent work on the cluster mass function suggests that there should be atleast one white dwarf member, even at this young age. it may be that any whitedwarf members of $\alpha$ per are hidden within binary systems, as is the casein the hyades cluster, however the lack of high mass stars within the clusteralso makes this seem unlikely. one alternative is that a significant level ofdetection incompleteness in the legacy optical image survey data at thisgalactic latitude has caused some white dwarf members to be overlooked. if thisis the case, gaia will find them.

(...) the late-type(m7) dwarf ssspm j2003$-$4433 and the ultracool subdwarf ssspm j1930$-$4311(sdm7) sharing the same very large proper motion of about 860 mas/yr were foundin the same sky region with an angular separation of about 6\degr. from thecomparison with other high proper motion catalogues we have estimated theprobability of a chance alignment of the two new large proper motions to beless than 0.3%. from the individually estimated spectroscopic distances ofabout $38^{+10}_{-7}$ pc and $72^{+21}_{-16}$ pc, respectively for the m7 dwarfand the sdm7 subdwarf, and in view of the accurate agreement in their largeproper motions we assume a common distance of about 50 pc and a projectedphysical separation of about 5 pc. the mean heliocentric space velocity of thepair $(u,v,w)=(-232, -170, +74)$ km/s, based on the correctness of thepreliminary radial velocity measurement for only one of the components and onthe assumption of a common distance and velocity vector, is typical of thegalactic halo population. the large separation and the different metallicitiesof dwarfs and subdwarfs make a common formation scenario as a wide binary(later disrupted) improbable, although there remains some uncertainty in thespectroscopic classification scheme of ultracool dwarfs/subdwarfs so that adissolved binary origin cannot be fully ruled out yet. it seems more likelythat this wide pair is part of an old halo stream.

astro-ph;0608671	on the origin of the ultramassive white dwarf gd50	we argue on the basis of astrometric and spectroscopic data that theultramassive white dwarf gd50 is associated with the star formation event thatcreated the pleiades and is possibly a former member of this cluster. itscooling age (~60myrs) is consistent with it having evolved essentially as asingle star from a progenitor with a mass m&gt;6msun so we find no need to invokea white dwarf-white dwarf binary merger scenario to account for its existence.this result may represent the first direct observational evidence that singlestar evolution can produce white dwarfs with m&gt;1.1msun, as predicted by somestellar evolutionary theories. on the basis of its tangential velocity we alsoprovisionally identify the ultramassive (m~1.2msun) white dwarf pg0136+251 asbeing related to the pleiades. these findings may help to alleviate thedifficulties in reconciling the observed number of hot nearby ultramassivewhite dwarfs with the smaller number predicted by binary evolution models underthe assumption that they are the products of white dwarf mergers.

astro-ph;0609532	new members in the upper sco association from the ukidss early data  release	we present the results of a 9.3 square degree infrared (zyjhk) survey in theupper scorpius association extracted from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey(ukidss) galactic cluster survey early data release. we have selected a totalof 112 candidates from the ($z-j$,$z$) colour-magnitude diagram over thez=12.5-20.5 magnitude range, corresponding to m = 0.25-0.01 msun at an age of 5myr and a distance of 145 pc. additional photometry in j and k filters revealedmost of them as reddened stars, leaving 32 possible members. among them, 15have proper motion consistent with higher mass members from hipparcos andoptical spectra with strong halpha in emission and weak gravity features. wehave also extracted two lower mass candidate members for which no opticalspectra are in hand. three members exhibit strong halpha equivalent widths (&gt;20angstroms), suggesting that they could still undergo accretion whereas twoother dwarfs show signs of chromospheric activity. the likelihood of thebinarity of a couple of new stellar and substellar members is discussed aswell.

astro-ph;0610140	new brown dwarfs in upper sco using ukidss galactic cluster survey  science verification data	we present first results from a deep (j = 18.7), wide-field (6.5 squaredegrees) infrared (zyjhk) survey in the upper sco association conducted withinthe science verification phase of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey galacticcluster survey (gcs). cluster members define a sequence well separated fromfield stars in the (z-j,z) colour-magnitude diagram. we have selected a totalof 164 candidates with j = 10.5-18.7 mag from the (z-j,z) and (y-j,y) diagrams.we further investigated the location of those candidates in the othercolour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams to weed out contaminants. thecross-correlation of the gcs catalogue with the 2mass database confirms themembership of 116 photometric candidates down to 20 jupiter masses as they liewithin a 2 sigma circle centred on the association mean motion. the final listof cluster members contains 129 sources with masses between 0.3 and 0.007 msun.we extracted a dozen new low-mass brown dwarfs below 20 mjup, the limit ofprevious surveys in the region. finally, we have derived the mass function inupper sco over the 0.3-0.01 msun mass range, best fit by a single segment witha slope of index alpha = 0.6+/-0.1, in agreement with previous determination inopen clusters.

astro-ph;0702534	two t dwarfs from the ukidss early data release	we report on the first ultracool dwarf discoveries from the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) large area survey early data release (las edr), inparticular the discovery of t dwarfs which are fainter and more distant thanthose found using the 2mass and sdss surveys. we aim to show that ourmethodologies for searching the ~27 sq degs of the las edr are successful forfinding both l and t dwarfs $via$ cross-correlation with the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) dr4 release. while the area searched so far is small, the numbersof objects found shows great promise for near-future releases of the las andgreat potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. ultracool dwarfs areselected by combinations of their yjh(k) ukidss colours and sdss dr4 z-j andi-z colours, or, lower limits on these red optical/infrared colours in the caseof dr4 dropouts. after passing visual inspection tests, candidates have beenfollowed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.our main result is the discovery following ch4 imaging and spectroscopy of at4.5 dwarf, ulasj 1452+0655, lying ~80pc distant. a further t dwarf candidate,ulasj 1301+0023, has very similar ch4 colours but has not yet been confirmedspectroscopically. we also report on the identification of a brighter l0 dwarf,and on the selection of a list of las objects designed to probe for t-likedwarfs to the survey j-band limit. our findings indicate that the combinationof the ukidss las and sdss surveys provide an excellent tool for identifying land t dwarfs down to much fainter limits than previously possible. ourdiscovery of one confirmed and one probable t dwarf in the edr is consistentwith expectations from the previously measured t dwarf density on the sky.

0810.4011	cool white dwarfs identified in the second data release of the ukirt  infrared deep sky survey	we have paired the second data release of the large area survey of the ukirtinfrared deep sky survey with the fifth data release of the sloan digital skysurvey to identify ten cool white dwarf candidates, from their photometry andastrometry. of these ten, one was previously known to be a very cool whitedwarf. we have obtained optical spectroscopy for seven of the candidates usingthe gmos-n spectrograph on gemini north, and have confirmed all seven as whitedwarfs. our photometry and astrometry indicates that the remaining two objectsare also white dwarfs. model analysis of the photometry and availablespectroscopy shows that the seven confirmed new white dwarfs, and the two newlikely white dwarfs, have effective temperatures in the range teff = 5400-6600k. our analysis of the previously known white dwarf confirms that it is cool,with teff = 3800 k. the cooling age for this dwarf is 8.7 gyr, while that ofthe nine ~6000 k white dwarfs is 1.8-3.6 gyr. we are unable to determine themasses of the white dwarfs from the existing data, and therefore we cannotconstrain the total ages of the white dwarfs. the large cooling age for thecoolest white dwarf in the sample, combined with its low estimated tangentialvelocity, suggests that it is an old member of the thin disk, or a member ofthe thick disk of the galaxy, with an age 10-11 gyr. the warmer white dwarfsappear to have velocities typical of the thick disk or even halo; these may bevery old remnants of low-mass stars, or they may be relatively young thin diskobjects with unusually high space motion.

0812.2358	identifying nearby field t dwarfs in the ukidss galactic clusters survey	we present the discovery of two new late-t dwarfs identified in the ukirtinfrared deep sky survey (ukidss) galactic clusters survey (gcs) data release 2(dr2). these t dwarfs are nearby old t dwarfs along the line of sight tostar-forming regions and open clusters targeted by the ukidss gcs. they arefound towards the alpha per cluster and orion complex, respectively, from asearch in 54 square degrees surveyed in five filters. photometric candidateswere picked up in two-colour diagrams, in a very similar manner to candidatesextracted from the ukidss large area survey (las) but taking advantage of the zfilter employed by the gcs. both candidates exhibit near-infrared j-bandspectra with strong methane and water absorption bands characteristic of late-tdwarfs. we derive spectral types of t6.5+/-0.5 and t7+/-1 and estimatephotometric distances less than 50 pc for ugcs j030013.86+490142.5 and ugcsj053022.52-052447.4, respectively. the space density of t dwarfs found in thegcs seems consistent with discoveries in the larger areal coverage of theukidss large area survey, indicating one t dwarf in 6-11 square degrees. thefinal area surveyed by the gcs, 1000 square degrees in five passbands, willallow expansion of the las search area by 25%, increase the probability offinding ultracool brown dwarfs, and provide optimal estimates of contaminationby old field brown dwarfs in deep surveys to identify such objects in openclusters and star-forming regions.
