0901.1262	the dust condensation sequence in red super-giant stars	context: red super-giant (rsg) stars exhibit significant mass loss through aslow and dense wind. they are often considered to be the more massive counterparts of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. while the agb mass loss is linkedto their strong pulsations, the rsg are often only weakly variable. aim: tostudy the conditions at the base of the wind, by determining the dustcomposition in a sample of rsg. the dust composition is thought to be sensitiveto the density, temperature and acceleration at the base of the wind. method:we compile a sample of 27 rsg infrared spectra (iso-sws) and supplement thesewith photometric measurements to obtain the full spectral energy distribution(sed). these data are modelled using a dust radiative transfer code. theresults are scrutinised for correlations. results: we find (1) strongcorrelations between dust composition, mass-loss rate and stellar luminosity,roughly in agreement with the theoretical dust condensation sequence, (2) theneed for a continuous (near-)ir dust opacity and tentatively propose amorphouscarbon, and (3) significant differences with agb star winds: presence of pahs,absence of 'the' 13 micron band, and a lack of strong water bands. conclusions:dust condensation in rsg is found to experience a similar freeze-out process asin agb stars. together with the positive effect of the stellar luminosity onthe mass-loss rate, this suggests that radiation pressure on dust grains is animportant ingredient in the driving mechanism. still, differences with agbstars are manifold and thus the winds of rsg deserve separate studies.

0903.5213	long-term photometric monitoring with the mercator telescope.  frequencies and multicolour amplitudes of $\gamma$ doradus stars	gamma doradus stars are excellent targets for asteroseismology since thegravity modes present in these stars probe the deep stellar interiors. modeidentification will improve the knowledge of these stars considerably. aselected group of gamma doradus stars and some candidates were observed withthe mercator telescope to find and/or confirm the periodicities in the lightvariations and to derive reliable amplitude ratios in different pass bands. afrequency analysis was performed on all new data obtained in the genevaphotometric system. in order to have more reliable and accurate frequencies,the new data were combined with similar data from the literature and withhipparcos observations. a set of frequencies that minimized the the residualsin a harmonic fit was searched for while allowing means and amplitudes to varyfrom one observation set to another. frequencies and amplitudes in thephotometric passbands of the geneva system are given for 21 gamma doradusstars. we report the discovery of hd 74504 as a newly found gamma doradus star.our study provides the first extensive multicolour database for theunderstanding of gravity modes in f-type stars.

0905.1240	structure of the outer layers of cool standard stars	context: among late-type red giants, an interesting change occurs in thestructure of the outer atmospheric layers as one moves to later spectral typesin the hertzsprung-russell diagram: a chromosphere is always present, but thecoronal emission diminishes and a cool massive wind steps in.  aims: where most studies have focussed on short-wavelength observations, thisarticle explores the influence of the chromosphere and the wind onlong-wavelength photometric measurements.  methods: the observational spectral energy distributions are compared withthe theoretical predictions of the marcs atmosphere models for a sample of 9 k-and m-giants. the discrepancies found are explained using basic models for fluxemission originating from a chromosphere or an ionized wind.  results: for 7 out of 9 sample stars, a clear flux excess is detected at(sub)millimeter and/or centimeter wavelengths. the precise start of the excessdepends upon the star under consideration. the flux at wavelengths shorter thanabout 1 mm is most likely dominated by an optically thick chromosphere, wherean optically thick ionized wind is the main flux contributor at longerwavelengths.  conclusions: although the optical to mid-infrared spectrum of the studied k-and m-giants is well represented by a radiative equilibrium atmospheric model,the presence of a chromosphere and/or ionized stellar wind at higher altitudesdominates the spectrum in the (sub)millimeter and centimeter wavelength ranges.the presence of a flux excess also has implications on the role of these starsas fiducial spectrophotometric calibrators in the (sub)millimeter andcentimeter wavelength range.

0906.3365	the long-lived disks in the eta chamaeleontis cluster	we present irs spectra and revised mips photometry for the 18 members of theeta chamaeleontis cluster. aged 8 myr, the eta cha cluster is one of the fewnearby regions within the 5-10 myr age range, during which the disk fractiondecreases dramatically and giant planet formation must come to an end. for the15 low-mass members, we measure a disk fraction ~50%, high for their 8 myr age,and 4 of the 8 disks lack near-ir excesses, consistent with the empiricaldefinition of "transition'' disks. most of the disks are comparable togeometrically flat disks. the comparison with regions of different agessuggests that at least some of the "transition" disks may represent the normaltype of disk around low-mass stars. therefore, their flattened structure andinner holes may be related to other factors (initial masses of the disk and thestar, environment, binarity), rather than to pure time evolution. we analyzethe silicate dust in the disk atmosphere, finding moderate crystallinefractions (~10-30%) and typical grain sizes ~1-3 micron, without anycharacteristic trend in the composition. these results are common to otherregions of different ages, suggesting that the initial grain processing occursvery early in the disk lifetime (&lt;1 myr). large grain sizes in the diskatmosphere cannot be used as a proxy for age, but are likely related to higherdisk turbulence. the dust mineralogy varies between the 8-12micron and the20-30 micron features, suggesting high temperature dust processing and littleradial mixing. finally, the analysis of ir and optical data on the b9 star etacha reveals that it is probably surrounded by a young debris disk with a largeinner hole, instead of being a classical be star.

1004.1967	when an old star smolders: on the detection of hydrocarbon emission from  s-type agb stars	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) produce characteristic infraredemission bands that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysicalenvironments, where carbonaceous material is subjected to ultraviolet (uv)radiation. although pahs are expected to form in carbon-rich agb stars, theyhave up to now only been observed in binary systems where a hot companionprovides a hard radiation field. in this letter, we present low-resolutioninfrared spectra of four s-type agb stars, selected from a sample of 90 s-typeagb stars observed with the infrared spectrograph aboard the spitzer satellite.the spectra of these four stars show the typical infrared features of pahmolecules. we confirm the correlation between the temperature of the centralstar and the centroid wavelength of the 7.9 {\mu}m feature, present in a widevariety of stars spanning a temperature range from 3 000 to 12 000 k. three offour sources presented in this paper extend this relation towards lowertemperatures. we argue that the mixture of hydrocarbons we see in these s-starshas a rich aliphatic component. the fourth star, bz cma, deviates from thiscorrelation. based on the similarity with the evolved binary tu tau, we predictthat bz cma has a hot companion as well.

1005.4579	the herschel-spire submillimetre spectrum of mars	we have obtained the first continuous disk averaged spectrum of mars from 450to 1550 ghz using the herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer. thespectrum was obtained at a constant resolution of 1.4 ghz across the wholeband. the flux from the planet is such that the instrument was operated in"bright source" mode to prevent saturation of the detectors. this was the firstsuccessful use of this mode and in this work we describe the method used forobserving mars together with a detailed discussion of the data reductiontechniques required to calibrate the spectrum. we discuss the calibrationaccuracy obtained and describe the first comparison with surface andatmospheric models. in addition to a direct photometric measurement of theplanet the spectrum contains the characteristic transitions of 12co from j 5-4to j 13-12 as well as numerous h2o transitions. together these allow thecomparison to global atmospheric models allowing the mean mixing ratios ofwater and 12co to be investigated. we find that it is possible to match theobserved depth of the absorption features in the spectrum with a fixed watermixing ratio of 1 x 10-4 and a 12co mixing ratio of 9 x 10-4

1007.0905	polarisation observations of vy canis majoris water vapour 5{32}-4{41}  620.701 ghz maser emission with hifi	context: water vapour maser emission from evolved oxygen-rich stars remainspoorly understood. additional observations, including polarisation studies andsimultaneous observation of different maser transitions may ultimately lead togreater insight. aims: we have aimed to elucidate the nature and structure ofthe vy cma water vapour masers in part by observationally testing a theoreticalprediction of the relative strengths of the 620.701 ghz and the 22.235 ghzmaser components of ortho water vapour. methods: in its high-resolution mode(hrs) the herschel heterodyne instrument for the infrared (hifi) offers afrequency resolution of 0.125 mhz, corresponding to a line-of-sight velocity of0.06 km/s, which we employed to obtain the strength and linear polarisation ofmaser spikes in the spectrum of vy cma at 620.701 ghz. simultaneous groundbased observations of the 22.235 ghz maser with the max-planck-institut f\"urradioastronomie 100-meter telescope at effelsberg, provided a ratio of 620.701ghz to 22.235 ghz emission. results:we report the first astronomical detectionto date of water vapour maser emission at 620.701 ghz. in vy cma both the620.701 and the 22.235 ghz polarisation are weak. at 620.701 ghz the maserpeaks are superposed on what appears to be a broad emission component, jointlyejected asymmetrically from the star. we observed the 620.701 ghz emission attwo epochs 21 days apart, both to measure the potential direction of linearlypolarised maser components and to obtain a measure of the longevity of thesecomponents. although we do not detect significant polarisation levels in thecore of the line, they rise up to approximately 6% in its wings.

1007.1102	water content and wind acceleration in the envelope around the  oxygen-rich agb star ik tau as seen by herschel/hifi	during their asymptotic giant branch, evolution low-mass stars lose asignificant fraction of their mass through an intense wind, enriching theinterstellar medium with products of nucleosynthesis. we observed the nearbyoxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch star ik tau using the high-resolution hifispectrometer onboard herschel. we report on the first detection of h_2^{16}oand the rarer isotopologues h_2^{17}o and h_2^{18}o in both the ortho and parastates. we deduce a total water content (relative to molecular hydrogen) of6.6x10^{-5}, and an ortho-to-para ratio of 3:1. these results are consistentwith the formation of h_2o in thermodynamical chemical equilibrium atphotospheric temperatures, and does not require pulsationally inducednon-equilibrium chemistry, vaporization of icy bodies or grain surfacereactions. high-excitation lines of 12co, 13co, 28sio, 29sio, 30sio, hcn, andso have also been detected. from the observed line widths, the accelerationregion in the inner wind zone can be characterized, and we show that the windacceleration is slower than hitherto anticipated.

1007.1235	discovery of water vapour in the carbon star v cygni from observations  with herschel/hifi	we report the discovery of water vapour toward the carbon star v cygni. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the1(11) - 0(00) para-water transition at 1113.3430 ghz in the upper sideband ofthe band 4b receiver. the observed spectral line profile is nearly parabolic,but with a slight asymmetry associated with blueshifted absorption, and theintegrated antenna temperature is 1.69 \pm 0.17 k km/s. this detection ofthermal water vapour emission, carried out as part of a small survey of waterin carbon-rich stars, is only the second such detection toward a carbon-richagb star, the first having been obtained by the submillimeter wave astronomysatellite toward irc+10216. for an assumed ortho-to-para ratio of 3 for water,the observed line intensity implies a water outflow rate ~ (3 - 6) e-5 earthmasses per year and a water abundance relative to h2 of ~ (2-5) e-6. this valueis a factor of at least 1e+4 larger than the expected photospheric abundance ina carbon-rich environment, and - as in irc+10216 - raises the intriguingpossibility that the observed water is produced by the vapourisation oforbiting comets or dwarf planets. however, observations of the single lineobserved to date do not permit us to place strong constraints upon the spatialdistribution or origin of the observed water, but future observations ofadditional transitions will allow us to determine the inner radius of theh2o-emitting zone, and the h2o ortho-to-para ratio, and thereby to placeimportant constraints upon the origin of the observed water emission.

1008.1083	probing the mass-loss history of agb and red supergiant stars from co  rotational line profiles - ii. co line survey of evolved stars: derivation of  mass-loss rate formulae	we aim to (1) set up simple and general analytical expressions to estimatemass-loss rates of evolved stars, and (2) from those calculate estimates forthe mass-loss rates of asymptotic giant branch (agb), red supergiant (rsg), andyellow hypergiant stars in our galactic sample. rotationally excited lines ofco are a very robust diagnostic in the study of circumstellar envelopes (cses).when sampling different layers of the cse, observations of these molecularlines lead to detailed profiles of kinetic temperature, expansion velocity, anddensity. a state-of-the-art, nonlocal thermal equilibrium, and co-moving frameradiative transfer code that predicts co line intensities in the cses oflate-type stars is used in deriving relations between stellar andmolecular-line parameters, on the one hand, and mass-loss rate, on the other.we present analytical expressions for estimating the mass-loss rates of evolvedstellar objects for 8 rotational transitions of the co molecule, apply them toour extensive co data set covering 47 stars, and compare our results to thoseof previous studies. our expressions account for line saturation and resolvingof the envelope, thereby allowing accurate determination of very high mass-lossrates. we argue that, for estimates based on a single rotational line, theco(2-1) transition provides the most reliable mass-loss rate. the mass-lossrates calculated for the agb stars range from 4x10^-8 msun/yr up to 8x10^-5msun/yr. for rsgs they reach values between 2x10^-7 msun/yr and 3x10^-4msun/yr. the estimates for the set of co transitions allow time variability tobe identified in the mass-loss rate. possible mass-loss-rate variability istraced for 7 of the sample stars. we find a clear relation between thepulsation periods of the agb stars and their derived mass-loss rates, with alevelling off at approx. 3x10^-5 msun/yr for periods exceeding 850 days.

0708.4107	the variable mass loss of the agb star wx psc as traced by the co j=1-0  through 7-6 lines and the dust emission	low and intermediate mass stars lose a significant fraction of their massthrough a dust-driven wind during the asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase.recent studies show that winds from late-type stars are far from being smooth.mass-loss variations occur on different time scales, from years to tens ofthousands of years. the variations appear to be particularly prominent towardsthe end of the agb evolution. the occurrence, amplitude and time scale of thesevariations are still not well understood.  the goal of our study is to gain insight into the structure of thecircumstellar envelope (cse) of wx psc and map the possible variability of thelate-agb mass-loss phenomenon.  we have performed an in-depth analysis of the extreme infrared agb star wxpsc by modeling (1) the co j=1-0 through 7-6 rotational line profiles and thefull spectral energy distribution (sed) ranging from 0.7 to 1300 micron. wehence are able to trace a geometrically extended region of the cse.  both mass-loss diagnostics bear evidence of the occurrence of mass-lossmodulations during the last ~2000 yr. in particular, wx psc went through a highmass-loss phase (mdot~5e-5 msun/yr) some 800 yr ago. this phase lasted about600 yr and was followed by a long period of low mass loss (mdot~5e-8 msun/yr).the present day mass-loss rate is estimated to be ~6e-6 msun/yr.  the agb star wx psc has undergone strong mass-loss rate variability on a timescale of several hundred years during the last few thousand years. thesevariations are traced in the strength and profile of the co rotational linesand in the sed. we have consistently simulated the behaviour of both tracersusing radiative transfer codes that allow for non-constant mass-loss rates.

0708.4120	theoretical model atmosphere spectra used for the calibration of  infrared instruments	one of the key ingredients in establishing the relation between input signaland output flux from a spectrometer is accurate determination of thespectrophotometric calibration. in the case of spectrometers onboardsatellites, the accuracy of this part of the calibration pedigree is ultimatelylinked to the accuracy of the set of reference seds that the spectrophotometriccalibration is built on. in this paper, we deal with the spectrophotometriccalibration of infrared (ir) spectrometers onboard satellites in the 2 to 200micron range. we aim at comparing the different reference seds used for the irspectrophotometric calibration. the emphasis is on the reference seds ofstellar standards with spectral type later than a0, with special focus on thetheoretical model atmosphere spectra. using the marcs model atmosphere code,spectral reference seds were constructed for a set of ir stellar standards (adwarfs, solar analogs, g9-m0 giants). a detailed error analysis was performedto estimate proper uncertainties on the predicted flux values. it is shown thatthe uncertainty on the predicted fluxes can be as high as 10%, but in casehigh-resolution observational optical or near-ir data are available, and irexcess can be excluded, the uncertainty on medium-resolution seds can bereduced to 1-2% in the near-ir, to ~3% in the mid-ir, and to ~5% in the far-ir.moreover, it is argued that theoretical stellar atmosphere spectra are at themoment the best representations for the ir fluxes of cool stellar standards.when aiming at a determination of the spectrophotometric calibration of irspectrometers better than 3%, effort should be put into constructing anappropriate set of stellar reference seds based on theoretical atmospherespectra for some 15 standard stars with spectral types between a0v and m0iii.

1012.1698	the 9.7 and 18 um silicate absorption profiles towards diffuse and  molecular cloud lines-of-sight	studying the composition of dust in the interstellar medium (ism) is crucialin understanding the cycle of dust in our galaxy. the mid-infrared spectralsignature of amorphous silicates, the most abundant dust species in the ism, isstudied in different lines-of-sight through the galactic plane, thus probingdifferent conditions in the ism. we have analysed 10 spectra from the spitzerarchive, of which 6 lines-of-sight probe diffuse interstellar medium materialand 4 probe molecular cloud material. the 9.7 um silicate absorption featuresin 7 of these spectra were studied in terms of their shape and strength. inaddition, the shape of the 18 um silicate absorption features in 4 of thediffuse sightline spectra were analysed. the 9.7 um silicate absorption bandsin the diffuse sightlines show a strikingly similar band shape. this is alsothe case for all but one of the 18 um silicate absorption bands observed indiffuse lines-of-sight. the 9.7 um bands in the 4 molecular sightlines showsmall variations in shape. these modest variations in the band shape areinconsistent with the interpretation of the large variations in{\tau}_9.7/e(j-k) between diffuse and molecular sightlines in terms of silicategrain growth. instead, we suggest that the large changes in {\tau}_9.7 / e(j-k)must be due to changes in e(j-k).

1101.2486	ice and dust in the quiescent medium of isolated dense cores	the relation between ices in the envelopes and disks surrounding ysos andthose in the quiescent interstellar medium is investigated. for a sample of 31stars behind isolated dense cores, ground-based and spitzer spectra andphotometry in the 1-25 um wavelength range are combined. the baseline for thebroad and overlapping ice features is modeled, using calculated spectra ofgiants, h2o ice and silicates. the adopted extinction curve is derivedempirically. its high resolution allows for the separation of continuum andfeature extinction. the extinction between 13-25 um is ~50% relative to that at2.2 um. the strengths of the 6.0 and 6.85 um absorption bands are in line withthose of ysos. thus, their carriers, which, besides h2o and ch3oh, may includenh4+, hcooh, h2co and nh3, are readily formed in the dense core phase, beforestars form. the 3.53 um c-h stretching mode of solid ch3oh was discovered. thech3oh/h2o abundance ratios of 5-12% are larger than upper limits in the taurusmolecular cloud. the initial ice composition, before star formation occurs,therefore depends on the environment. signs of thermal and energetic processingthat were found toward some ysos are absent in the ices toward backgroundstars. finally, the peak optical depth of the 9.7 um band of silicates relativeto the continuum extinction at 2.2 um is significantly shallower than in thediffuse interstellar medium. this extends the results of chiar et al.

1104.2316	warm water vapour in the sooty outflow from a luminous carbon star	in 2001, the discovery of circumstellar water vapour around the ageing carbonstar irc+10216 was announced. this detection challenged the currentunderstanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to beabsent in carbon-rich stars. several explanations for the occurrence of watervapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets ordwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, andphotochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. however, the only waterline detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, byitself, between the different mechanisms proposed. here we report on thedetection by the herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in thefar-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of irc+10216, including somehigh-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 k. the emission ofthese high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour ispresent in the warm inner region of the envelope. a plausible explanation forthe formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet(uv) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. this mechanism triggersalso the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observedabundances are much higher than hitherto predicted.

1106.3645	x her and tx psc: two cases of ism interaction with stellar winds  observed by herschel	the asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars x her and tx psc have been imaged at70 and 160 microns with the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite, aspart of the large mess (mass loss of evolved stars) guaranteed time keyprogram. the images reveal an axisymmetric extended structure with its axisoriented along the space motion of the stars. this extended structure is verylikely to be shaped by the interaction of the wind ejected by the agb star withthe surrounding interstellar medium (ism). as predicted by numericalsimulations, the detailed structure of the wind-ism interface depends upon therelative velocity between star+wind and the ism, which is large for these twostars (108 and 55 km/s for x her and tx psc, respectively). in both cases,there is a compact blob upstream whose origin is not fully elucidated, but thatcould be the signature of some instability in the wind-ism shock. deconvolvedimages of x her and tx psc reveal several discrete structures along theoutermost filaments, which could be kelvin-helmholtz vortices. finally, tx pscis surrounded by an almost circular ring (the signature of the terminationshock?) that contrasts with the outer, more structured filaments. a similarinner circular structure seems to be present in x her as well, albeit lessclearly.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

(\approx 4.6 stellar radii). this isthe first time that this tio emission band is observed. a search for similaremission features in the sample of s-type stars yielded two additionalcandidates. however, owing to the additional dust emission, the identificationis less stringent. by comparing the stellar characteristics of np aur to thoseof the other stars in our sample, we find that all stars with tio emission showlarge-amplitude pulsations, s-process enrichment, and a low c/o ratio. thesecharacteristics might be necessary requirements for a star to show tio inemission, but they are not sufficient.

0801.1118	detection of `parent' molecules from the inner wind of agb stars as  tracers of non-equilibrium chemistry	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars are typified by strong dust-driven,molecular outflows. for long, it was believed that the molecular setup of thecircumstellar envelope of agb stars is primarily determined by the atmosphericc/o ratio. however, recent observations of molecules such as hcn, sio, and soreveal gas-phase abundances higher than predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium(te) models. uv-photon initiated dissociation in the outer envelope ornon-equilibrium formation by the effect of shocks in the inner envelope may bethe origin of the anomolous abundances. we aim at detecting (i.) a group of`parent' molecules (co, sio, hcn, cs), predicted by the non-equilibrium studyof cherchneff (2006) to form with almost constant abundances independent of thec/o ratio and the stellar evolutionary stage on the asymptotic giant branch(agb), and (ii.) few molecules, such as sis and so,which are sensitive to theo- or c-rich nature of the star. several low and high excitation rotationaltransitions of key molecules are observed at mm and sub-mm wavelengths withjcmt and apex in four agb stars: the oxygen-rich mira wx psc, the s star w aql,and the two carbon stars v cyg and ii lup. a critical density analysis isperformed to determine the formation region of the high-excitation molecularlines. we detect the four `parent' molecules in all four objects, implyingthat, indeed, these chemical species form whatever the stage of evolution onthe agb. high-excitation lines of sis are also detected in three stars withapex, whereas so is only detected in the oxygen-rich star wx psc. this is thefirst multi-molecular observational proof that periodically shocked layersabove the photosphere of agb stars show some chemical homogeneity, whatever thephotospheric c/o ratio and stage of evolution of the star.

1409.0396	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel. ii. the molecular envelope of w  hya	the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass ina stellar wind. understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellarwinds of agb stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products ofnucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining agb evolution and predicting thechemical evolution of galaxies. in a previous paper we have constrained thestructure of the outflowing envelope of w hya using spectral lines of the$^{12}$co molecule. here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set ofh$_{2}$o and $^{28}$sio lines observed by the three instruments on boardherschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfercode. the oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$sio abundance profile can beconnected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formationat the base of the stellar wind, respectively. the modelling of h$_{2}$o and$^{28}$sio confirms the properties of the envelope model of w hya derived from$^{12}$co lines. we find an h$_2$o ortho-to-para ratio of2.5\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an agb wind. theo$^{16}$/o$^{17}$ ratio indicates that w hya has an initial mass of about 1.5m$_\odot$. although the ortho- and para-h$_{2}$o lines observed by hifi appearto trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocityof $0.7\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the hifi lines of both spin isomers and thoseof $^{28}$sio well. the ortho- and para-h$_2^{16}$o and $^{28}$sio abundancesrelative to h$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \times10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. assuming a solarsilicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$sio line emission model is consistent withabout one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.

1412.5063	surprising detection of an equatorial dust lane on the agb star  irc+10216	understanding the formation of planetary nebulae remains elusive because inthe preceding asymtotic giant branch (agb) phase these stars are heavilyenshrouded in an optically thick dusty envelope. to further understand themorphology of the circumstellar environments of agb stars we observe theclosest carbon-rich agb star irc+10216 in scattered light. when imaged inscattered light at optical wavelengths, irc+10216 surprisingly shows a narrowequatorial density enhancement, in contrast to the large-scale spherical ringsthat have been imaged much further out. we use radiative transfer models tointerpret this structure in terms of two models: firstly, an equatorial densityenhancement, commonly observed in the more evolved post-agb stars, andsecondly, in terms of a dust rings model, where a local enhancement ofmass-loss creates a spiral ring as the star rotates. we conclude that bothmodels can be used to reproduce the dark lane in the scattered light images,which is caused by an equatorially density enhancement formed by dense dustrather than a bipolar outflow as previously thought. we are unable to placeconstraints on the formation of the equatorial density enhancement by a binarysystem.

1503.04765	dusty wind of w hya. multi-wavelength modelling of the present-day and  recent mass-loss	low- and intermediate-mass stars go through a period of intense mass-loss atthe end of their lives in a phase known as the asymptotic giant branch (agb).during the agb a significant fraction of their initial mass is expelled in astellar wind. this process controls the final stages of their evolution andcontributes to the chemical evolution of galaxies. however, the wind-drivingmechanism of agb stars is not yet well understood, especially so foroxygen-rich sources. characterizing both the present-day mass-loss and windstructure and the evolution of the mass-loss rate of such stars is paramount toadvancing our understanding of this processes. we modelled the dust envelope ofw hya using an advanced radiative transfer code. the dust model was analysed inthe light of a previously calculated gas-phase wind model and compared tomeasurements available in the literature, such as infrared spectra, infraredimages, and optical scattered light fractions. we find that the dust spectrumof w hya can partly be explained by a gravitationally bound dust shell thatprobably is responsible for most of the amorphous al$_2$o$_3$ emission. thecomposition of the large ($\sim$\,0.3\,$\mu$m) grains needed to explain thescattered light cannot be constrained, but probably is dominated by silicates.silicate emission in the thermal infrared was found to originate from beyond 40au from the star and we find that they need to have substantial near-infraredopacities to be visible at such large distances. the increase in near-infraredopacity of the dust at these distances roughly coincides with a sudden increasein expansion velocity as deduced from the gas-phase co lines. finally, therecent mass loss of w hya is confirmed to be highly variable and we identify astrong peak in the mass-loss rate that occurred about 3500 years ago and lastedfor a few hundred years.

1505.05750	herschel observations of extreme oh/ir stars - the isotopic ratios of  oxygen as a sign-post for the stellar mass	aim: the late stages of stellar evolution are mainly governed by the mass ofthe stars. low- and intermediate-mass stars lose copious amounts of mass duringthe asymptotic giant branch (agb) which obscure the central star making itdifficult to study the stellar spectra and determine the stellar mass. in thisstudy, we present observational data that can be used to determine lower limitsto the stellar mass. method: spectra of nine heavily reddened agb stars takenby the herschel space observatory display numerous molecular emission lines.the strongest emission lines are due to h2o. we search for the presence ofisotopologues of h2o in these objects. result: we detected the 16o and 17oisotopologues of water in these stars, but lines due to h2^{18}o are absent.the lack of 18o is predicted by a scenario where the star has undergonehot-bottom burning which preferentially destroys 18o relative to 16o and 17o.from stellar evolution calculations, this process is thought to occur when thestellar mass is above 5 msun for solar metallicity. hence, observations ofdifferent isotopologues of h2o can be used to help determine the lower limit tothe initial stellar mass. conclusion: from our observations, we deduce thatthese extreme oh/ir stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses of &gt;= 5 msun.their high mass-loss rates of ~ 1.0e-4 msun/yr may affect the enrichment of theinterstellar medium and the overall chemical evolution of our galaxy.

astro-ph;0105045	stellar models in ir calibration	for the astronomical community analyzing iso-sws data, a first point toassess when judging and qualifying the observational data concerns the fluxcalibration accuracy. since the calibration process is not straightforward andsince a wrong calibration may lead to an over- or underestimation of theresults, knowledge on the full calibration process and on the still remainingcalibration problems is crucial when processing the data.  one way to detect calibration problems is by comparing observed data withtheoretical predictions of a whole sample of calibration sources. by using aniterative process in which improvements on both the calibration and thetheoretical modelling are involved, we will demonstrate that a consistenttheoretical data-set of infrared spectra has been constructed. this data-sethas been used to derive the olp10 flux calibration of the iso-sws. we willshown that the relative flux calibration accuracy of (high-flux) iso-swsobservations has reached a 2% level of accuracy in band 1 and that the fluxcalibration accuracy in band 2 has improved significantly with the introductionof the memory-effect corrrection and the use of our synthetic spectra for theflux calibration derivation, reaching a 6% level of accuracy in band 2.

astro-ph;0510486	amorphous alumina in the extended atmosphere of alpha orionis	in this paper we study the extended atmosphere of the late-type supergiantalpha orionis. infrared spectroscopy of red supergiants reveals strongmolecular bands, some of which do not originate in the photosphere but in acooler layer of molecular material above it. lately, these layers have beenspatially resolved by near and mid-ir interferometry. in this paper, we try toreconcile the ir interferometric and iso-sws spectroscopic results on alphaorionis with a thorough modelling of the photosphere, molecular layer(s) anddust shell. from the iso and near-ir interferometric observations, we find thatalpha orionis has only a very low density water layer close above thephotosphere. however, mid-ir interferometric observations and a narrow-slitn-band spectrum suggest much larger extra-photospheric opacity close to thephotosphere at those wavelengths, even when taking into account the detacheddust shell. we argue that this cannot be due to the water layer, and thatanother source of mid-ir opacity must be present. we show that this opacitysource is probably neither molecular nor chromospheric. rather, we presentamorphous alumina (al2o3) as the best candidate and discuss this hypothesis inthe framework of dust-condensation scenarios.

astro-ph;0606299	probing the mass-loss history of agb and red supergiant stars from co  rotational line profiles i. theoretical model -- mass-loss history unravelled  in vy cma	context: mass loss plays a dominant role in the evolution of low mass starswhile they are on the asymptotic giant branch (agb). the gas and dust ejectedduring this phase are a major source in the mass budget of the interstellarmedium. recent studies have pointed towards the importance of variations in themass-loss history of such objects. aims: by modelling the full line profile oflow excitation co lines emitted in the circumstellar envelope, we can study themass-loss history of agb stars. methods: we have developed a non-lte radiativetransfer code, which calculates the velocity structure and gas kinetictemperature of the envelope in a self-consistent way. the resulting structureof the envelope provides the input for the molecular line radiativecalculations which are evaluated in the comoving frame. the code allows for theimplementation of modulations in the mass-loss rate. this code has beenbenchmarked against other radiative transfer codes and is shown to perform welland efficiently. results: we illustrate the effects of varying mass-loss ratesin case of a superwind phase. the model is applied to the well-studied case ofvy cma. we show that both the observed integrated line strengths as thespectral structure present in the observed line profiles, unambiguouslydemonstrate that this source underwent a phase of high mass loss (~ 3.2e-4msun/yr) some 1000 yr ago. this phase took place for some 100 yr, and waspreceded by a low mass-loss phase (~ 1e-6 msun/yr) taking some 800 yr. thecurrent mass-loss rate is estimated to be in the order of 8e-5 msun/yr.conclusions: in this paper, we demonstrate that both the relative strength ofthe co rotational line profiles and the (non)-occurrence of spectral structurein the profile offer strong diagnostics to pinpoint the mass-loss history.

astro-ph;0701449	estimating stellar parameters from spectra using a hierarchical bayesian  approach	a method is developed for fitting theoretically predicted astronomicalspectra to an observed spectrum. using a hierarchical bayesian principle, themethod takes both systematic and statistical measurement errors into account,which has not been done before in the astronomical literature. the goal is toestimate fundamental stellar parameters and their associated uncertainties. thenon-availability of a convenient deterministic relation between stellarparameters and the observed spectrum, combined with the computationalcomplexities this entails, necessitate the curtailment of the continuousbayesian model to a reduced model based on a grid of synthetic spectra. acriterion for model selection based on the so-called predictive squared errorloss function is proposed, together with a measure for the goodness-of-fitbetween observed and synthetic spectra. the proposed method is applied to theinfrared 2.38--2.60 \mic iso-sws data (infrared space observatory - shortwavelength spectrometer) of the star $\alpha$ bootis, yielding estimates forthe stellar parameters: effective temperature \teff = 4230 $\pm$ 83 k, gravity$\log$ g = 1.50 $\pm$ 0.15 dex, and metallicity [fe/h] = $-0.30 \pm 0.21$ dex.

astro-ph;0702628	continuum emission around agb stars at 1.2 mm	it is generally acknowledged that the mass loss of asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars undergoes variations on different time scales. we constructedmodels for the dust envelopes for a sample of agb stars to assess whethermass-loss variations influence the spectral energy distribution (sed). toconstrain the variability, extra observations at millimetre wavelengths (1.2mm) were acquired. from the analysis of the dust models, two indications forthe presence of mass-loss variations can be found, being (1) a dust temperatureat the inner boundary of the dust envelope that is far below the dustcondensation temperature and (2) an altered density distribution with respectto rho(r) \propto r^{-2} resulting from a constant mass-loss rate. for 5 out ofthe 18 studied sources a two-component model of the envelope is required,consisting of an inner region with a constant mass-loss rate and an outerregion with a less steep density distribution. for one source an outer regionwith a steeper density distribution was found. moreover, in a search for timevariability in our data set at 1.2 mm, we found that wx psc shows a largerelative time variation of 34% which might partially be caused by variablemolecular line emission.
