0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

0907.1741	contribution from unresolved discrete sources to the extragalactic  gamma-ray background (egrb)	the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (egrb) is still an openquestion, even after nearly forty years of its discovery. the emission couldoriginate from either truly diffuse processes or from unresolved point sources.although the majority of the 271 point sources detected by egret (energeticgamma ray experiment telescope) are unidentified, of the identified sources,blazars are the dominant candidates. therefore, unresolved blazars may beconsidered the main contributor to the egrb, and many studies have been carriedout to understand their distribution, evolution and contribution to the egrb.considering that gamma-ray emission comes mostly from jets of blazars and thatthe jet emission decreases rapidly with increasing jet to line-of-sight angle,it is not surprising that egret was not able to detect many large inclinationangle active galactic nuclei (agns). though fermi could only detect a few largeinclination angle agns in the first three months' survey, it is expected todetect many such sources in the near future. since non-blazar agns are expectedto have higher density as compared to blazars, these could also contributesignificantly to the egrb. in this paper we discuss contributions fromunresolved discrete sources including normal galaxies, starburst galaxies,blazars and off-axis agns to the egrb.

0912.0941	probing the nature of the unidentified tev gamma-ray source hess  j0632+057 with swift	new generation tev gamma-ray telescopes have discovered many new sources,including several enigmatic unidentified tev objects. hess j0632+057 is aparticularly interesting unidentified tev source since: it is a point source,it has a possible hard-spectrum x-ray counterpart and a positionally consistentbe star, it has evidence of long-term vhe flux variability, and it ispostulated to be a newly detected tev/x-ray binary. we have obtained swiftx-ray telescope observations of this source from mjd 54857 to 54965, in anattempt to ascertain its nature and to investigate the hypothesis that it's apreviously unknown x-ray/tev binary. variability and spectral propertiessimilar to those of the other 3 known x-ray/tev binaries have been observed,with measured flux increases by factors of approximately 3. x-ray variabilityis present on multiple timescales including days to months; however, no clearsignature of periodicity is present on the timescales probed by these data. ifbinary modulation is present and dominating the measured variability, then theperiod of the orbit is likely to be more than 54 days (half of this campaign),or it has a shorter period with a variable degree of flux modulation onsuccessive high states. if the two high states measured to date are due tobinary modulation, then the favored period is approximately 35-40 days. moreobservations are required to determine if this object is truly a binary systemand to determine the extent that the measured variability is due to inter-orbitflaring effects or periodic binary modulation.

1105.0449	veritas observations of the tev binary ls i +61 303 during 2008-2010	we present the results of observations of the tev binary ls i +61 303 withthe veritas telescope array between 2008 and 2010, at energies above 300 gev.in the past, both ground-based gamma-ray telescopes veritas and magic havereported detections of tev emission near the apastron phases of the binaryorbit. the observations presented here show no strong evidence for tev emissionduring these orbital phases; however, during observations taken in late 2010,significant emission was detected from the source close to the phase ofsuperior conjunction (much closer to periastron passage) at a 5.6 standarddeviation (5.6 sigma) post-trials significance. in total, between october 2008and december 2010 a total exposure of 64.5 hours was accumulated with veritason ls i +61 303, resulting in an excess at the 3.3 sigma significance level forconstant emission over the entire integrated dataset. the flux upper limitsderived for emission during the previously reliably active tev phases (i.e.close to apastron) are less than 5% of the crab nebula flux in the same energyrange. this result stands in apparent contrast to previous observations by bothmagic and veritas which detected the source during these phases at &gt;10% of thecrab nebula flux. during the two year span of observations, a large amount ofx-ray data were also accrued on ls i +61 303 by the swift x-ray telescope (xrt)and the rossi x-ray timing explorer timing (rxte) proportional counter array(pca). we find no evidence for a correlation between emission in the x-ray andtev regimes during 20 directly overlapping observations. we also comment ondata obtained contemporaneously by the fermi large area telescope (lat).

1210.4786	search for a correlation between very-high-energy gamma rays and giant  radio pulses in the crab pulsar	we present the results of a joint observational campaign between the greenbank radio telescope and the veritas gamma-ray telescope, which searched for acorrelation between the emission of very-high-energy (vhe) gamma rays($e_{\gamma} &gt;$ 150 gev) and giant radio pulses (grps) from the crab pulsar at8.9 ghz. a total of 15366 grps were recorded during 11.6 hours of simultaneousobservations, which were made across four nights in december 2008 and innovember and december 2009. we searched for an enhancement of the pulsedgamma-ray emission within time windows placed around the arrival time of thegrp events. in total, 8 different time windows with durations ranging from0.033 ms to 72 s were positioned at three different locations relative to thegrp to search for enhanced gamma-ray emission which lagged, led, or wasconcurrent with, the grp event. further, we performed separate searches on mainpulse grps and interpulse grps and on the most energetic grps in our datasample. no significant enhancement of pulsed vhe emission was found in any ofthe preformed searches. we set upper limits of 5-10 times the average vhe fluxof the crab pulsar on the flux simultaneous with interpulse grps onsingle-rotation-period time scales. on $\sim$8-second time scales aroundinterpulse grps, we set an upper limit of 2-3 times the average vhe flux.within the framework of recent models for pulsed vhe emission from the crabpulsar, the expected vhe-grp emission correlations are below the derivedlimits.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1212.4739	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from cta 1 by veritas	we report the discovery of tev gamma-ray emission coincident with theshell-type radio supernova remnant (snr) cta 1 using the veritas gamma-rayobservatory. the source, ver j0006+729, was detected as a 6.5 standarddeviation excess over background and shows an extended morphology, approximatedby a two-dimensional gaussian of semi-major (semi-minor) axis 0.30 degree (0.24degree) and a centroid 5' from the fermi gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 andits x-ray pulsar wind nebula (pwn). the photon spectrum is well described by apower-law dn/de = n_0 (e/3 tev)^(-\gamma), with a differential spectral indexof \gamma = 2.2 +- 0.2_stat +- 0.3_sys, and normalization n_0 = (9.1 +-1.3_stat +- 1.7_sys) x 10^(-14) cm^(-2) s^(-1) tev^(-1). the integral flux,f_\gamma = 4.0 x 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) above 1 tev, corresponds to 0.2%of the pulsar spin-down power at 1.4 kpc. the energetics, co-location with thesnr, and the relatively small extent of the tev emission strongly argue for thepwn origin of the tev photons. we consider the origin of the tev emission incta 1.

1305.6508	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission toward supernova remnant snr  g78.2+2.1	we report the discovery of an unidentified, extended source ofvery-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission, ver j2019+407, within the radioshell of the supernova remnant snr g78.2+2.1, using 21.4 hours of data taken bythe veritas gamma-ray observatory in 2009. these data confirm the preliminaryindications of gamma-ray emission previously seen in a two-year (2007-2009)blind survey of the cygnus region by veritas. ver j2019+407, which is detectedat a post-trials significance of 7.5 standard deviations in the 2009 data, islocalized to the northwestern rim of the remnant in a region of enhanced radioand x-ray emission. it has an intrinsic extent of 0.23^{\circ} \pm 0.03^{\circ}(stat)+0.04^{\circ}_{-0.02}^{\circ}(sys) and its spectrum is well-characterizedby a differential power law (dn/de = n_0 \times (e/tev)^{-\gamma}) with aphoton index of {\gamma} = 2.37 \pm 0.14 (stat) \pm 0.20 (sys) and a fluxnormalization of n0 = 1.5 \pm 0.2 (stat) \pm 0.4(sys) \times 10^-12 ph tev^{-1}cm^{-2} s^{-1}. this yields an integral flux of 5.2 \pm 0.8 (stat) \pm 1.4(sys) \times 10^-12 ph cm^{-2} s^{-1} above 320 gev, corresponding to 3.7% ofthe crab nebula flux. we consider the relationship of the tev gamma-rayemission with the gev gamma-ray emission seen from snr g78.2+2.1 as well asthat seen from a nearby cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays. multiplescenarios are considered as possible origins for the tev gamma-ray emission,including hadronic particle acceleration at the supernova remnant shock.

1310.7913	multiwavelength observations of the tev binary ls i +61 303 with  veritas, fermi-lat and swift-xrt during a tev outburst	we present the results of a multiwavelength observational campaign on the tevbinary system ls i +61 303 with the veritas telescope array (&gt;200 gev),fermi-lat (0.3-300 gev), and swift-xrt (2-10 kev). the data were taken fromdecember 2011 through january 2012 and show a strong detection in all threewavebands. during this period veritas obtained 24.9 hours of quality selectedlivetime data in which ls i +61 303 was detected at a statistical sig-nificance of 11.9 sigma. these tev observations show evidence for nightlyvariability in the tev regime at a post-trial significance of 3.6 sigma. thecombination of the simultaneously obtained tev and x-ray fluxes do notdemonstrate any evidence for a correlation between emission in the two bands.for the first time since the launch of the fermi satellite in 2008, this tevdetection allows the construction of a detailed mev-tev spectral energydistribution from ls i +61 303. this spectrum shows a distinct cutoff inemission near 4 gev, with emission seen by the veritas observations following asimple power-law above 200 gev. this feature in the spectrum of ls i +61 303,obtained from overlapping observations with fermi-lat and veritas, may indicatethat there are two distinct populations of accelerated particles producing thegev and tev emission.

1311.6083	long-term tev and x-ray observations of the gamma-ray binary hess  j0632+057	hess j0632+057 is the only gamma-ray binary known so far whose position inthe sky allows observations with ground-based observatories both in thenorthern and southern hemispheres. here we report on long-term observations ofhess j0632+057 conducted with the veritas and h.e.s.s. cherenkov telescopes andthe x-ray satellite swift, spanning a time range from 2004 to 2012 and coveringmost of the system's orbit. the vhe emission is found to be variable, and iscorrelated with that at x-ray energies. an orbital period of $315 ^{+6}_{-4}$days is derived from the x-ray data set, which is compatible with previousresults, $p = (321 \pm 5$) days. the vhe light curve shows a distinct maximumat orbital phases close to 0.3, or about 100 days after periastron passage,which coincides with the periodic enhancement of the x-ray emission.furthermore, the analysis of the tev data shows for the first time astatistically significant ($&gt; 6.5 \sigma$) detection at orbital phases0.6--0.9. the obtained gamma-ray and x-ray light curves and the correlation ofthe source emission at these two energy bands are discussed in the context ofthe recent ephemeris obtained for the system. our results are compared to thosereported for other gamma-ray binaries.

1312.6592	a three-year multi-wavelength study of the very high energy gamma-ray  blazar 1es 0229+200	the high-frequency-peaked bl lacertae object 1es 0229+200 is a relativelydistant (z = 0.1396), hard-spectrum (gamma ~ 2.5), very-high-energy-emitting (e&gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray blazar. very-high-energy measurements of this activegalactic nucleus have been used to place constraints on the intensity of theextragalactic background light and the intergalactic magnetic field. amulti-wavelength study of this object centered around very-high-energyobservations by veritas is presented. this study obtained, over a period ofthree years, an 11.7 standard deviation detection and an average integral fluxf(e&gt;300 gev) = (23.3 +- 2.8_stat +- 5.8_sys) x 10^-9 photons m^-2 s^-1, or 1.7%of the crab nebula's flux (assuming the crab nebula spectrum measured byh.e.s.s). supporting observations from swift and rxte are analyzed. the swiftobservations are combined with previously published fermi observations and thevery-high-energy measurements to produce an overall spectral energydistribution which is then modeled assuming one-zone synchrotron-self-comptonemission. the chi^2 probability of the tev flux being constant is 1.6%. this,when considered in combination with measured variability in the x-ray band, andthe demonstrated variability of many tev blazars, suggests that the use ofblazars such as 1es 0229+200 for intergalactic magnetic field studies may notbe straightforward and challenges models that attribute hard tev spectra tosecondary gamma-ray production along the line of sight.

1401.2828	observations of the unidentified gamma-ray source tev j2032+4130 by  veritas	tev j2032+4130 was the first unidentified source discovered at very highenergies (vhe; e $&gt;$ 100 gev), with no obvious counterpart in any otherwavelength. it is also the first extended source to be observed in vhe gammarays. following its discovery, intensive observational campaigns have beencarried out in all wavelengths in order to understand the nature of the object,which have met with limited success. we report here on a deep observation oftev j2032+4130, based on 48.2 hours of data taken from 2009 to 2012 by theveritas (very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system) experiment.the source is detected at 8.7 standard deviations ($\sigma$) and is found to beextended and asymmetric with a width of 9.5$^{\prime}$$\pm$1.2$^{\prime}$ alongthe major axis and 4.0$^{\prime}$$\pm$0.5$^{\prime}$ along the minor axis. thespectrum is well described by a differential power law with an index of 2.10$\pm$ 0.14$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 0.21$_{sys}$ and a normalization of (9.5 $\pm$1.6$_{stat}$ $\pm$ 2.2$_{sys}$) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev. we interpret these results in the context of multiwavelengthscenarios which particularly favor the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) interpretation.

1410.5367	constraints on very high energy emission from grb 130427a	prompt emission from the very fluent and nearby (z=0.34) gamma-ray burst grb130427a was detected by several orbiting telescopes and by ground-based,wide-field-of-view optical transient monitors. apart from the intensity andproximity of this grb, it is exceptional due to the extremely long-livedhigh-energy (100 mev to 100 gev) gamma-ray emission, which was detected by thelarge area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope for ~70 ks afterthe initial burst. the persistent, hard-spectrum, high-energy emission suggeststhat the highest-energy gamma rays may have been produced via synchrotronself-compton processes though there is also evidence that the high-energyemission may instead be an extension of the synchrotron spectrum. veritas, aground-based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope array, began follow-upobservations of grb 130427a ~71 ks (~20 hr) after the onset of the burst. thegrb was not detected with veritas; however, the high elevation of theobservations, coupled with the low redshift of the grb, make veritas a verysensitive probe of the emission from grb 130427a for e &gt; 100 gev. thenon-detection and consequent upper limit derived place constraints on thesynchrotron self-compton model of high-energy gamma-ray emission from thisburst.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

astro-ph;0012508	3eg j2016+3657: confirming an egret blazar behind the galactic plane	we recently identified the blazar-like radio source g74.87+1.22 (b2013+370)as the counterpart of the high-energy gamma-ray source 3eg j2016+3657 in thegalactic plane. however, since most blazar identifications of egret sources areonly probabilistic in quality even at high galactic latitude, and since therealso exists a population of unidentified galactic egret sources, we sought toobtain additional evidence to support our assertion that 3eg j2016+3657 is ablazar. these new observations consist of a complete set of classifications forthe 14 brightest rosat x-ray sources in the error circle, of which b2013+370remains the most likely source of the gamma-rays. we also obtained furtheroptical photometry of b2013+370 itself which shows that it is variable,providing additional evidence of its blazar nature. interestingly, this fieldcontains, in addition to the blazar, the plerionic supernova remnant ctb 87,which is too distant to be the egret source, and three newly discoveredcataclysmic variables, all five of these x-ray sources falling within 16' ofeach other. this illustrates the daunting problem of obtaining completeidentifications of egret sources in the galactic plane.

astro-ph;0207355	broad-band continuum and line emission of the gamma-ray blazar pks  0537-441	pks 0537-441, a bright gamma-ray emitting blazar, was observed at radio,optical, uv and x-ray frequencies during various egret pointings, oftenquasi-simultaneously. in 1995 the object was found in an intense emission stateat all wavelengths. bepposax observations made in 1998, non-simultaneously withexposures at other frequencies, allow us to characterize precisely the spectralshape of the high energy blazar component, which we attribute to inversecompton scattering. the optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distributions atthe different epochs show that the gamma-ray luminosity dominates thebolometric output. this, together with the presence of optical and uv lineemission, suggests that, besides the synchrotron self-compton mechanism, thecompton upscattering of photons external to the jet (e.g., in the broad lineregion) may have a significant role for high energy radiation. themultiwavelength variability can be reproduced by changes of the plasma bulklorentz factor. the spectrum secured by iue in 1995 appears to be partiallyabsorbed shortward of ~1700 a. however, this signature is not detected in thehst spectrum taken during a lower state of the source. the presence ofintervening absorbers is not supported by optical imaging and spectroscopy ofthe field.

astro-ph;0208171	predictions of the high-energy emission from bl lac objects: the case of  w comae	spectral fitting of the radio through hard x-ray emission of bl lac objectshas previously been used to predict their level of high-energy (gev - tev)emission. in this paper, we point out that such spectral fitting can have verylarge uncertainties with respect to predictions of the vhe emission. this isdemonstrated with the example of w comae. we show that the best currentlyavailable contemporaneous optical - x-ray spectrum of w comae still allows fora large range of possible parameters, resulting in drastically different &gt; 40gev fluxes. we find that all acceptable leptonic-model fits to the optical -x-ray emission of w comae predict a cut-off of the high-energy emission around~ 100 gev. we suggest that detailed measurements and analysis of the soft x-rayvariability of w comae may be used to break the degeneracy in the choice ofpossible fit parameters, and thus allow a more reliable prediction of the vheemission from this object. using the available soft x-ray variability measuredby bepposax, we predict a &gt; 40 gev flux from w comae of ~ (0.4 - 1) * 10^{-10}photons/(cm^2 s) with no significant emission at e &gt; 100 gev for a leptonic jetmodel. we compare our results concerning leptonic jet models with detailedpredictions of the hadronic synchrotron-proton blazar model. this hadronicmodel predicts &gt; 40 gev fluxes very similar to those found for the leptonicmodels, but results in &gt; 100 gev emission which should be clearly detectablewith future high-sensitivity instruments like veritas. thus, we suggest thisobject as a promising target for vhe gamma-ray and co-ordinated broadbandobservations to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic jet models forblazars.

astro-ph;9901222	high energy gamma-ray emission from blazars: egret observations	we will present a summary of the observations of blazars by the energeticgamma ray experiment telescope (egret) on the compton gamma ray observatory(cgro). egret has detected high energy gamma-ray emission at energies greaterthan 100 mev from more that 50 blazars. these sources show inferred isotropicluminosities as large as $3\times 10^{49}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. one of the mostremarkable characteristics of the egret observations is that the gamma-rayluminosity often dominates the bolometric power of the blazar. a few of theblazars are seen to exhibit variability on very short time-scales of one day orless. the combination of high luminosities and time variations seen in thegamma-ray data indicate that gamma-rays are an important component of therelativistic jet thought to characterize blazars. currently most models forblazars involve a beaming scenario. in leptonic models, where electrons are theprimary accelerated particles, gamma-ray emission is believed to be due toinverse compton scattering of low energy photons, although opinions differ asto the source of the soft photons. hardronic models involve secondaryproduction or photomeson production followed by pair cascades, and predictassociated neutrino production.
