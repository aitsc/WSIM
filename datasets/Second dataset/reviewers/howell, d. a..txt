0901.2476	the mean type ia supernova spectrum over the past 9 gigayears	we examine the possibility of evolution with redshift in the mean rest-frameultraviolet (uv; &lt;4500a) spectrum of type ia supernovae (sne ia) sampling theredshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1.3. we find new evidence for a decrease with redshift inthe strength of intermediate-mass element (ime) features, particularly si iiand to a lesser extent ca ii "h&amp;k" and mg ii blends, indicating lower imeabundances in the higher redshift sne. a larger fraction of luminous, widerlight-curve width (higher "stretch") sne ia are expected at higher redshiftthan locally, so we compare our observed spectral evolution with that predictedby a redshift-evolving stretch distribution (howell et al. 2007) coupled with astretch-dependent sn ia spectrum. we show that the sense of the spectralevolution can be reproduced by this simple model, though the highest redshiftevents seem additionally deficient in si and ca. we also examine the mean sn iauv-optical colors as a function of redshift, thought to be sensitive tovariations in progenitor composition. we find that the expected stretchvariations are sufficient to explain the differences, although improved data atz~0 will enable more precise tests. thus, to the extent possible with theavailable datasets, our results support the continued use of sne ia asstandardized candles.

0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0909.3316	the eso/vlt 3rd year type ia supernova data set from the supernova  legacy survey	we present 139 spectra of 124 type ia supernovae (sneia) that were observedat the eso/vlt during the first three years of the canada-france-hawaitelescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). this homogeneous data set isused to test for redshift evolution of sneia spectra, and will be used in thesnls 3rd year cosmological analyses.  spectra have been reduced and extracted with a dedicated pipeline that usesphotometric information from deep cfht legacy survey (cfht-ls) reference imagesto trace, at sub-pixel accuracy, the position of the supernova on thespectrogram as a function of wavelength. it also separates the supernova andits host light in 60% of cases. the identification of the supernova candidatesis performed using a spectrophotometric snia model.  a total of 124 sneia, roughly 50% of the overall snls spectroscopic sample,have been identified using the eso/vlt during the first three years of thesurvey. their redshifts range from z=0.149 to z=1.031. the average redshift ofthe sample is z=0.63+/-0.02. this constitutes the largest snia spectral set todate in this redshift range. the spectra are presented along with theirbest-fit spectral snia model and a host model where relevant. in the lattercase, a host subtracted spectrum is also presented. we produce average spectrafor pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z&lt;0.5 and z&gt;=0.5sneia. we find that z&lt;0.5 spectra have deeper intermediate mass elementabsorptions than z&gt;= 0.5 spectra. the differences with redshift are consistentwith the selection of brighter and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.

0910.0059	hydrogen-poor superluminous stellar explosions	supernovae (sne) are stellar explosions driven by gravitational orthermonuclear energy, observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeksor more. in all known sne, this radiation comes from internal energy depositedin the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesizedelements (typically 56ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in theenvelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the sn debris andslowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. here we report on a newclass of luminous sne whose observed properties cannot be explained by any ofthese known processes. these include four new sne we have discovered, and twopreviously unexplained events (sn 2005ap; scp 06f6) that we can now identify asmembers. these sne are all ~10 times brighter than sne ia, do not show anytrace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (uv) flux for extended periodsof time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent withradioactivity. our data require that the observed radiation is emitted byhydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~10^15 cm) andexpanding at high velocities (&gt;10^4 km s^-1). these long-lived, uv-luminousevents can be observed out to redshifts z&gt;4 and offer an excellent opportunityto study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distantgalaxies.

1002.1249	gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (snls)	the observed brightness of type ia supernovae is affected by gravitationallensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, whichintroduces an additional dispersion into the hubble diagram. we look forevidence of lensing in the supernova legacy survey 3-year data set. weinvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the hubble diagram andthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution offoreground galaxies. a deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, andwell established mass luminosity relations are used. we find evidence of alensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. the current result is limited bythe number of sne, their redshift distribution, and the other sources ofscatter in the hubble diagram. separating the galaxy population into a red anda blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signaldetection. on the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, theprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the massluminosity relations have little effect. we show that for the full supernovalegacy survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type ia sne and ~200photometrically identified type ia sne), there is an 80% probability ofdetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.

1002.1374	constraining dark matter halo properties using lensed snls supernovae	this paper exploits the gravitational magnification of sne ia to measureproperties of dark matter haloes. the magnification of individual sne ia can becomputed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halomodels. we model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singularisothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeyingluminosity dependent scaling laws. a homogeneously selected sample of 175 sneia from the first 3-years of the supernova legacy survey (snls) in the redshiftrange 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloesassociated with foreground galaxies. the best-fitting velocity dispersionscaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. we furtherfind that the normalisation of the velocity dispersion of passive and starforming galaxies are consistent with empirical faber-jackson and tully-fisherrelations, respectively. if we make no assumption on the normalisation of theserelations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 percent confidence level. using recent models of dust extinction we deduce thatthe impact of this effect on our results is very small. we also investigate thebrightness scatter of sne ia due to gravitational lensing. the gravitationallensing scatter is approximately proportional to the sn ia redshift. we findthe constant of proportionality to be b = 0.055 +0.039 -0.041 mag (b &lt; 0.12 magat the 95 per cent confidence level). if this model is correct, thecontribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of sne ia issmall for the snls sample.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1006.2254	real-time analysis and selection biases in the supernova legacy survey	the supernova legacy survey (snls) has produced a high-quality, homogeneoussample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) out to redshifts greater than z=1. in itsfirst four years of full operation (to june 2007), the snls discovered morethan 3000 transient candidates, 373 of which have been confirmedspectroscopically as sne ia. use of these sne ia in precision cosmologycritically depends on an analysis of the observational biases incurred in thesnls survey due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying sn ia population.this paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures,and uses detailed monte carlo simulations to examine the effects of malmquistbias and spectroscopic sampling. such sampling effects are found to becomeapparent at z~0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of thespectroscopically confirmed sn ia sample towards brighter values for z&gt;0.75. wedescribe our approach to correct for these selection biases in our three-yearsnls cosmological analysis (snls3), and present a breakdown of the systematicuncertainties involved.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

(2011). we use the 472 sne ia in this sample, accounting forrecently discovered correlations between sn ia luminosity and host galaxyproperties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertaintiesdirectly in the cosmological fits. combining the snls3 data with the full wmap7power spectrum, the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy powerspectrum, and a prior on the hubble constant h0 from shoes, in a flat universewe find omega_m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5% measure of thedark energy equation-of-state parameter w. the statistical and systematicuncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertaintiesdominated by the photometric calibration of the sn ia fluxes -- without thesecalibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. whenrelaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega_m=0.271+/-0.015,omega_k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. parameterizing the timeevolution of w as w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), gives w_0=-0.905+/-0.196,w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. all of our results are consistentwith a flat, w=-1 universe. the size of the snls3 sample allows various teststo be performed with the sne segregated according to their light curve and hostgalaxy properties. we find that the cosmological constraints derived from thesedifferent sub-samples are consistent. there is evidence that the coefficient,beta, relating sn ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at&gt;4sigma significance (in addition to the known sn luminosity--host relation);however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and iscurrently a sub-dominant systematic.

1106.4008	constraining type ia supernovae progenitors from three years of snls  data	while it is generally accepted that type ia supernovae are the result of theexplosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting mass in a binary system, thedetails of their genesis still elude us, and the nature of the binary companionis uncertain. kasen (2010) points out that the presence of a non-degeneratecompanion in the progenitor system could leave an observable trace: a fluxexcess in the early rise portion of the lightcurve caused by the ejecta impactwith the companion itself. this excess would be observable only under favorableviewing angles, and its intensity depends on the nature of the companion. wesearched for the signature of a non-degenerate companion in three years ofsupernova legacy survey data by generating synthetic lightcurves accounting forthe effects of shocking and comparing true and synthetic time series withkolmogorov-smirnov tests. our most constraining result comes from noting thatthe shocking effect is more prominent in rest-frame b than v band: we rule outa contribution from white dwarf-red giant binary systems to type ia supernovaexplosions greater than 10% at 2 sigma, and than 20% at 3 sigma level.

1109.0948	photometric selection of type ia supernovae in the supernova legacy  survey	we present a sample of 485 photometrically identified type ia supernovacandidates mined from the first three years of data of the cfht supernovalegacy survey (snls). the images were submitted to a deferred processingindependent of the snls real-time detection pipeline. light curves of alltransient events were reconstructed in the g_m, r_m, i_m and z_m filters andsubmitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possiblesupernovae. pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by lightcurve shape criteria. type ia supernova identification relied on eventcharacteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normalsne ia. the light curve fitter salt2 was used for this purpose, assigning hostgalaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. the selected sample of 485candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the snls spectroscopicidentification. the contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated tobe 4%. testing hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us tomeasure the malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. the resultis fully consistent with the precise monte carlo based estimate used to correctsn ia distance moduli in the snls 3-year cosmological analyses. this paperdemonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshiftsupernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects forcosmological analyses from future large photometric sn ia surveys.

1109.5757	the rise-time of normal and subluminous type ia supernovae	we calculate the average stretch-corrected rise-time of type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the supernova legacy survey. we use the aggregate lightcurves ofspectroscopic and photometrically identified sne ia to fit the rising part ofthe lightcurve with a simple quadratic model. we obtain a lightcurve shapecorrected, i .e. stretch-corrected, fiducial rise-time of 17.02^{+0.18}_{-0.28}(stat) days. the measured rise-time differs from an earlier finding by the snls(conley et al. 2006) due to the use of different sn ia templates. we compare itto nearby samples using the same methods and find no evolution in the earlypart of the lightcurve of sne ia up to z=1. we search for variations amongdifferent populations, particularly subluminous objects, by dividing the samplein stretch. bright and slow decliners (s&gt;1.0) have consistent stretch-correctedrise-times compared to fainter and faster decliners (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0); they areshorter by 0.57^{+0.47}_{-0.50} (stat) days. subluminous sne ia (here definedas objects with s&lt;0.8), although less constrained, are also consistent, with arise-time of 18.03^{+0.81}_{-1.37} (stat) days. we study several systematicbiases and find that the use of different fiducial templates may affect theaverage rise-time but not the intrinsic differences between populations. basedon our results, we estimate that subluminous sne ia are powered by 0.05-0.35solar masses of radioactive nickel synthesized in the explosion. ourconclusions are the same for the single-stretch and two-stretchparameterizations of the lightcurve.

1112.2210	light echoes reveal an unexpectedly cool eta carinae during its  19th-century great eruption	eta carinae (eta car) is one of the most massive binary stars in the milkyway. it became the second-brightest star in the sky during its mid-19th century"great eruption," but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates ofbrightness). its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in thatit exceeded the eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. because it is only 2.3kpc away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejectedmass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, eta carejected more than 10 m_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of atypical core-collapse supernova without destroying the star. here we report thediscovery of light echoes of eta carinae which appear to be from the 1838-1858great eruption. spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, whichare blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansionspeeds. the light-echo spectra correlate best with those of g2-g5 supergiantspectra, which have effective temperatures of ~5000 k. in contrast to the classof extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogs of eta car's great eruption,the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly cooler than allowedby standard opaque wind models. this indicates that other physical mechanismslike an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.

0710.3896	verifying the cosmological utility of type ia supernovae: implications  of a dispersion in the ultraviolet spectra	we analyze the mean rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) spectrum of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and its dispersion using high signal-to-noise keck-i/lris-bspectroscopy for a sample of 36 events at intermediate redshift (z=0.5)discovered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey(snls). we introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in ourspectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the snls sne andtheir host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the uvspectral properties of a large sample of distant sne ia. although the mean snia spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history,precise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparablesample of high quality local spectra. within the high-redshift sample, wediscover significant uv spectral variations and exclude dust extinction as theprimary cause by examining trends with the optical sn color. althoughprogenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we seeare much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expectedpatterns. an interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength ofselected uv features with phase. we also demonstrate systematic differences inthe sn ia spectral features with sn light curve width in both the uv and theoptical. we show that these intrinsic variations could represent a statisticallimitation in the future use of high-redshift sne ia for precision cosmology.we conclude that further detailed studies are needed, both locally and atmoderate redshift where the rest-frame uv can be studied precisely, in orderthat future missions can confidently be planned to fully exploit sne ia ascosmological probes [abridged].

1205.1306	an efficient approach to obtaining large numbers of distant supernova  host galaxy redshifts	we use the wide-field capabilities of the 2df fibre positioner and theaaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope (aat) to obtainredshifts of galaxies that hosted supernovae during the first three years ofthe supernova legacy survey (snls). with exposure times ranging from 10 to 60ksec per galaxy, we were able to obtain redshifts for 400 host galaxies in twosnls fields, thereby substantially increasing the total number of snlssupernovae with host galaxy redshifts. the median redshift of the galaxies inour sample that hosted photometrically classified type ia supernovae (sne ia)is 0.77, which is 25% higher than the median redshift of spectroscopicallyconfirmed sne ia in the three-year sample of the snls. our results demonstratethat one can use wide-field fibre-fed multi-object spectrographs on 4mtelescopes to efficiently obtain redshifts for large numbers of supernova hostgalaxies over the large areas of sky that will be covered by futurehigh-redshift supernova surveys, such as the dark energy survey.

1205.7040	hubble space telescope studies of low-redshift type ia supernovae:  evolution with redshift and ultraviolet spectral trends	we present an analysis of the maximum light, near ultraviolet (nuv; 2900-5500a) spectra of 32 low redshift (0.001&lt;z&lt;0.08) type ia supernovae (sne ia),obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst). we combine this spectroscopicsample with high-quality gri light curves obtained with robotic telescopes tomeasure photometric parameters, such as stretch, optical colour, andbrightness. by comparing our data to a comparable sample of sne ia atintermediate-z (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9), we detect modest spectral evolution (3-sigma), inthe sense that our mean low-z nuv spectrum has a depressed flux compared to itsintermediate-z counterpart. we also see a strongly increased dispersion aboutthe mean with decreasing wavelength, confirming the results of earlier surveys.these trends are consistent with changes in metallicity as predicted bycontemporary sn ia spectral models. we also examine the properties of variousnuv spectral diagnostics in the individual spectra. we find a generalcorrelation between stretch and the velocity (or position) of many nuv spectralfeatures. in particular, we observe that higher stretch sne have larger ca iih&amp;k velocities, that also correlate with host galaxy stellar mass. this lattertrend is probably driven by the well-established correlation between stretchand stellar mass. we find no trends between uv spectral features and opticalcolour. mean spectra constructed according to whether the sn has a positive ornegative hubble residual show very little difference at nuv wavelengths,indicating that the nuv evolution and variation we identify do not directlycorrelate with hubble residuals. our work confirms and strengthens earlierconclusions regarding the complex behaviour of sne ia in the nuv spectralregion, but suggests the correlations we find are more useful in constrainingprogenitor models than improving the use of sne ia as cosmological probes.

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1208.1267	the uv/optical spectra of the type ia supernova sn 2010jn: a bright  supernova with outer layers rich in iron-group elements	radiative transfer studies of type ia supernovae (sne ia) hold the promise ofconstraining both the time-dependent density profile of the sn ejecta and itsstratification by element abundance which, in turn, may discriminate betweendifferent explosion mechanisms and progenitor classes. here we present adetailed analysis of hubble space telescope ultraviolet (uv) and ground-basedoptical spectra and light curves of the sn ia sn 2010jn (ptf10ygu). sn 2010jnwas discovered by the palomar transient factory (ptf) 15 days before maximumlight, allowing us to secure a time-series of four uv spectra at epochs from-11 to +5 days relative to b-band maximum. the photospheric uv spectra areexcellent diagnostics of the iron-group abundances in the outer layers of theejecta, particularly those at very early times. using the method of 'abundancetomography' we have derived iron-group abundances in sn 2010jn with a precisionbetter than in any previously studied sn ia. optimum fits to the data can beobtained if burned material is present even at high velocities, includingsignificant mass fractions of iron-group elements. this is consistent with theslow decline rate (or high 'stretch') of the light curve of sn 2010jn, andconsistent with the results of delayed-detonation models. early-phase uvspectra and detailed time-dependent series of further sne ia offer a promisingprobe of the nature of the sn ia mechanism.

1208.4130	studying the diversity of type ia supernovae in the ultraviolet:  comparing models with observations	in the ultraviolet (uv), type ia supernovae (sne ia) show a much largerdiversity in their properties than in the optical. using a stationarymonte-carlo radiative transfer code, a grid of spectra at maximum light wascreated varying bolometric luminosity and the amount of metals in the outerlayers of the sn ejecta. this model grid is then compared to a sample ofhigh-redshift sne ia in order to test whether the observed diversities can beexplained by luminosity and metallicity changes alone. the dispersion inbroadband uv flux and colours at approximately constant optical spectrum can bereadily matched by the model grid. in particular, the uv1-b colour is found tobe a good tracer of metal content of the outer ejecta, which may in turnreflect on the metallicity of the sn progenitor. the models are less successfulin reproducing other observed trends, such as the wavelengths of key uvfeatures, which are dominated by reverse fluorescence photons from the optical,or intermediate band photometric indices. this can be explained in terms of thegreater sensitivity of these detailed observables to modest changes in therelative abundances. specifically, no single element is responsible for theobserved trends. due to their complex origin, these trends do not appear to begood indicators of either luminosity or metallicity.

1302.2983	pessto monitoring of sn 2012hn: further heterogeneity among faint type i  supernovae	we present optical and infrared monitoring data of sn 2012hn collected by thepublic eso spectroscopic survey for transient objects (pessto). we show that sn2012hn has a faint peak magnitude (mr ~ -15.7) and shows no hydrogen and noclear evidence for helium in its spectral evolution. instead, we detectprominent ca ii lines at all epochs, which relates this transient to previouslydescribed 'ca-rich' or 'gap' transients. however, the photospheric spectra(from -3 to +32 d with respect to peak) of sn 2012hn show a series ofabsorption lines which are unique, and a red continuum that is likely intrinsicrather than due to extinction. lines of ti ii and cr ii are visible. this maybe a temperature effect, which could also explain the red photospheric colour.a nebular spectrum at +150d shows prominent caii, oi, ci and possibly mgi lineswhich appear similar in strength to those displayed by core-collapse sne. toadd to the puzzle, sn 2012hn is located at a projected distance of 6 kpc froman e/s0 host and is not close to any obvious starforming region. overall sn2012hn resembles a group of faint h-poor sne that have been discovered recentlyand for which a convincing and consistent physical explanation is stillmissing. they all appear to explode preferentially in remote locations offsetfrom a massive host galaxy with deep limits on any dwarf host galaxies,favouring old progenitor systems. sn 2012hn adds heterogeneity to this sampleof objects. we discuss potential explosion channels including he-shelldetonations and double detonations of white dwarfs as well as peculiarcore-collapse sne.

0705.0367	is there evidence for a hubble bubble? the nature of type ia supernova  colors and dust in external galaxies	we examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of type iasupernovae (sne ia) for the $\sim 3 \sigma$ detection of a ``hubble bubble'' --a departure of the local value of the hubble constant from its globallyaveraged value \citep{jha:07}. by comparing the mlcs2k2 fits used in that studyto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, wedemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of sn color excesses(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of acolor gradient across the local sample. if the slope of the linear relation($\beta$) between sn color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then thebubble disappears. if, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely frommilky way-like dust, then sn data clearly favors a hubble bubble. wedemonstrate that sn data give $\beta \simeq 2$, instead of the $\beta \simeq 4$one would expect from purely milky-way-like dust. this suggests that either snintrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a singlelight-curve shape parameter, or that dust around sn is unusual. disentanglingthese possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey snia cosmology.

1306.1272	dark energy with gravitational lens time delays	strong lensing gravitational time delays are a powerful and cost effectiveprobe of dark energy. recent studies have shown that a single lens can providea distance measurement with 6-7 % accuracy (including random and systematicuncertainties), provided sufficient data are available to determine the timedelay and reconstruct the gravitational potential of the deflector.gravitational-time delays are a low redshift (z~0-2) probe and thus allow oneto break degeneracies in the interpretation of data from higher-redshift probeslike the cosmic microwave background in terms of the dark energy equation ofstate. current studies are limited by the size of the sample of known lensedquasars, but this situation is about to change. even in this decade, wide fieldimaging surveys are likely to discover thousands of lensed quasars, enablingthe targeted study of ~100 of these systems and resulting in substantial gainsin the dark energy figure of merit. in the next decade, a further order ofmagnitude improvement will be possible with the 10000 systems expected to bedetected and measured with lsst and euclid. to fully exploit these gains, weidentify three priorities. first, support for the development of softwarerequired for the analysis of the data. second, in this decade, small robotictelescopes (1-4m in diameter) dedicated to monitoring of lensed quasars willtransform the field by delivering accurate time delays for ~100 systems. third,in the 2020's, lsst will deliver 1000's of time delays; the bottleneck willinstead be the aquisition and analysis of high resolution imaging follow-up.thus, the top priority for the next decade is to support fast high resolutionimaging capabilities, such as those enabled by the james webb space telescopeand next generation adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

0801.4968	type ia supernovae rates and galaxy clustering from the cfht supernova  legacy survey	the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey (snls) has createda large homogeneous database of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0) type iasupernovae (sne ia). the snls team has shown that correlations exist between snia rates, properties, and host galaxy star formation rates. the snls sn iadatabase has now been combined with a photometric redshift galaxy catalog andan optical galaxy cluster catalog to investigate the possible influence ofgalaxy clustering on the sn ia rate, over and above the expected effect due tothe dependence of sfr on clustering through the morphology-density relation. weidentify three cluster sne ia, plus three additional possible cluster sne ia,and find the sn ia rate per unit mass in clusters at intermediate redshifts isconsistent with the rate per unit mass in field early-type galaxies and the snia cluster rate from low redshift cluster targeted surveys. we also find thenumber of sne ia in cluster environments to be within a factor of two ofexpectations from the two component snia rate model.

1311.6344	the host galaxies of type ia supernovae discovered by the palomar  transient factory	we present spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies of 82 low-redshifttype ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the palomar transient factory (ptf).we determine star-formation rates, gas-phase/stellar metallicities, and stellarmasses and ages of these objects. as expected, strong correlations between thesn ia light-curve width (stretch) and the host age/mass/metallicity are found:fainter, faster-declining events tend to be hosted by older/massive/metal-richgalaxies. there is some evidence that redder sne ia explode in highermetallicity galaxies, but we found no relation between the sn colour and hostgalaxy extinction based on the balmer decrement, suggesting that the colourvariation of these sne does not primarily arise from this source. sne ia inhigher-mass/metallicity galaxies also appear brighter after stretch/colourcorrections than their counterparts in lower mass hosts, and the strongercorrelation is with gas-phase metallicity suggesting this may be the moreimportant variable. we also compared the host stellar mass distribution to thatin galaxy targeted sn surveys and the high-redshift untargeted supernova legacysurvey (snls). snls has many more low mass galaxies, while the targetedsearches have fewer. this can be explained by an evolution in the galaxystellar mass function, coupled with a sn delay-time distribution proportionalto $t^{-1}$. finally, we found no significant difference in themass--metallicity relation of our sn ia hosts compared to field galaxies,suggesting any metallicity effect on the sn ia rate is small.

1401.4064	improved cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the sdss-ii  and snls supernova samples	we present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type iasupernova (sn ia) observations obtained by the sdss-ii and snls collaborations.the data set includes several low-redshift samples (z&lt;0.1), all 3 seasons fromthe sdss-ii (0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.4), and 3 years from snls (0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1) and totals\ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae with high quality lightcurves. we have followed the methods and assumptions of the snls 3-year dataanalysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition ofthe full sdss-ii spectroscopically-confirmed sn ia sample in both the trainingof the salt2 light curve model and in the hubble diagram analysis (\nsdsscsne), 2) inter-calibration of the snls and sdss surveys and reduced systematicuncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect tothe cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errorsassociated with the salt2 modeling of sn ia light-curves. we producerecalibrated sn ia light-curves and associated distances for the sdss-ii andsnls samples. the large sdss-ii sample provides an effective, independent,low-z anchor for the hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error fromcalibration systematics in the low-z sn sample. for a flat lcdm cosmology wefind omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recentcmb measurement from the planck and wmap experiments. our result is 1.8sigma(stat+sys) different than the previously published result of snls 3-year data.the change is due primarily to improvements in the snls photometriccalibration. when combined with cmb constraints, we measure a constantdark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flatuniverse. adding bao distance measurements gives similar constraints:w=-1.027+-0.055.

1401.5426	underluminous type ii plateau supernovae: ii. pointing towards moderate  mass precursors	we present new data for five under-luminous type ii-plateau supernovae (sneiip), namely sn 1999gn, sn 2002gd, sn 2003z, sn 2004eg and sn 2006ov. this newsample of low-luminosity sne iip (ll sne iip) is analyzed together with similarobjects studied in the past. all of them show a flat light curve plateaulasting about 100 days, an under luminous late-time exponential tail, intrinsiccolours that are unusually red, and spectra showing prominent and narrowp-cygni lines. a velocity of the ejected material below 10^3 km/s is inferredfrom measurements at the end of the plateau. the 56ni masses ejected in theexplosion are very small (less than 10^-2 solar masses). we investigate thecorrelations among 56ni mass, expansion velocity of the ejecta and absolutemagnitude in the middle of the plateau, confirming the main findings of hamuy(2003), according to which events showing brighter plateau and larger expansionvelocities are expected to produce more 56ni. we propose that these faintobjects represent the low luminosity tail of a continuous distribution inparameters space of sne iip. the physical properties of the progenitors at theexplosion are estimated through the hydrodynamical modeling of the observablesfor two representative events of this class, namely sn 2005cs and sn 2008in. wefind that the majority of ll sne iip, and quite possibly all, originate in thecore-collapse of intermediate mass stars, in the mass range 10-15 solar masses.

1402.1765	clues to the nature of sn 2009ip from photometric and spectroscopic  evolution to late times	we present time series photometric and spectroscopic data for the transientsn 2009ip from the start of its outburst in september 2012 until november 2013.this data was collected primarily with the new robotic capabilities of the lascumbres observatory global telescope network, a specialized facility for timedomain astrophysics, and includes supporting high-resolution spectroscopy fromthe southern astrophysical research telescope, kitt peak national observatory,and gemini observatory. based on our nightly photometric monitoring, weinterpret the strength and timing of fluctuations in the light curve asinteractions between fast-moving ejecta and an inhomogeneous csm produced bypast eruptions of this massive luminous blue variable (lbv) star. our timeseries of spectroscopy in 2012 reveals that, as the continuum and narrowh-alpha flux from csm interactions declines, the broad component of h-alphapersists with sn-like velocities that are not typically seen in lbvs or snimpostor events. at late times we find that sn 2009ip continues to declineslowly, at &lt;0.01 magnitudes per day, with small fluctuations in slope similarto type iin supernovae (sne iin) or sn impostors, but no further lbv-likeactivity. the late time spectrum features broad calcium lines similar to bothlate time sne and sn impostors. in general, we find that the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of sn 2009ip is more similar to sne iin than eithercontinued eruptions of an lbv star or sn impostors. in this context, we discussthe implications for episodic mass loss during the late stages of massive starevolution.

1403.6708	the rise and fall of the type ib supernova iptf13bvn - not a massive  wolf-rayet star	we investigate iptf13bvn, a core-collapse (cc) supernova (sn) in the nearbyspiral galaxy ngc 5806. this object was discovered by the intermediate palomartransient factory very soon after the explosion and was classified as astripped-envelope cc sn, likely of type ib. a possible progenitor detection inpre-explosion hubble space telescope (hst) images was reported, making this theonly sn ib with such an identification. based on photometry of the progenitorcandidate and on early-time sn data, it was argued that the progenitorcandidate is consistent with a single, massive wolf-rayet (wr) star.  in this work we present follow-up multi-band light-curves and optical spectraof iptf13bvn. we perform spectral line analysis to track the evolution of thesn ejecta, construct a bolometric light curve and perform hydrodynamicalcalculations to model this light curve to constrain the synthesized radioactivenickel mass and the total ejecta mass of the sn. late-time photometry isanalyzed to constrain the amount of oxygen. furthermore, image registration ofpre- and post-explosion hst images is performed.  our hst astrometry confirms the location of the progenitor candidate, andfollow-up spectra securely classify iptf13bvn as a sn ib. our hydrodynamicalmodel indicates an ejecta mass of 1.9 solar masses and radioactive nickel massof 0.05 solar masses. the model fit requires the nickel to be highly mixed outin the ejecta. the late-time nebular r'-band luminosity is not consistent withpredictions based on the expected oxygen nucleosynthesis in very massive stars.  our bolometric light curve of iptf13bvn is not consistent with the previouslyproposed single massive wr-star progenitor scenario. the ejecta mass and thelate-time oxygen emission are both significantly lower than what would beexpected from a single wr progenitor with a main-sequence mass of at least 30solar masses.

1404.1294	the type iip supernova 2012aw in m95: hydrodynamical modelling of the  photospheric phase from accurate spectrophotometric monitoring	we present an extensive optical and near-infrared photometric andspectroscopic campaign of the type iip supernova sn 2012aw. the dataset denselycovers the evolution of sn 2012aw shortly after the explosion up to the end ofthe photospheric phase, with two additional photometric observations collectedduring the nebular phase, to fit the radioactive tail and estimate the$^{56}$ni mass. also included in our analysis is the already published\textit{swift} uv data, therefore providing a complete view of theultraviolet-optical-infrared evolution of the photospheric phase. on the basisof our dataset, we estimate all the relevant physical parameters of sn 2012awwith our radiation-hydrodynamics code: envelope mass $m_{env} \sim 20 m_\odot$,progenitor radius $r \sim 3 \times 10^{13}$ cm ($ \sim 430 r_\odot$), explosionenergy $e \sim 1.5$ foe, and initial $^{56}$ni mass $\sim 0.06$ $m_\odot$.these mass and radius values are reasonably well supported by independentevolutionary models of the progenitor, and may suggest a progenitor mass higherthan the observational limit of $16.5 \pm 1.5 m_\odot$ of the type iip events.

1405.1325	super-luminous supernovae from pessto	we present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poorsuper-luminous supernovae followed by the public eso spectroscopic survey oftransient objects (pessto). time series spectroscopy from a few days aftermaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,with spectra dominated by ca ii, mg ii, fe ii and si ii, which evolve slowlyover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. we determine bolometric lightcurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy inputby magnetar spin-down, 56ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaquecircumstellar shell. we investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of oursample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain thepossible mechanisms behind these events. we have followed these events tobeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fadingsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diversebehaviour at this phase. models powered by radioactivity require unrealisticparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previousstudies. both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to beviable candidates. a large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phaseluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapiddrop in flux. this would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, orthat the x-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. the lightcurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d aftermaximum light. we argue that this could result either from multiple shells ofcircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of theejecta.

1405.1415	a continuum of h- to he-rich tidal disruption candidates with a  preference for e+a galaxies	we present the results of a palomar transient factory (ptf) archival searchfor blue transients which lie in the magnitude range between "normal"core-collapse and superluminous supernovae (i.e. with$-21\,{\leq}m_{r\,(peak)}\,{\leq}-19$). of the six events found after excludingall interacting type~iin and ia-csm supernovae, three (ptf09ge, 09axc and09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offsetfrom the center, and for two (10nuj and 11glr) a precise offset can not bedetermined. all the central events have similar rise times to the he-rich tidaldisruption candidate ps1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curvealso has similar colors and power-law decay. spectroscopically, ptf09ge ishe-rich, while ptf09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peakmagnitude. all three central events are in low star-formation hosts, two ofwhich are e+a galaxies. our spectrum of the host of ps1-10jh displays similarproperties. ptf10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically andspectroscopically from the central events and its host displays a higher starformation rate. finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nucleiactivity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three centraltransients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a super-massiveblack hole. we compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruptioncandidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can beunified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. the accumulated evidenceof this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for thisclass of nuclear transients.

1405.3970	early observations and analysis of the type ia sn 2014j in m82	we present optical and near infrared (nir) observations of the nearby type iasn 2014j. seventeen optical and twenty-three nir spectra were obtained from 10days before ($-$10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum $b$-bandbrightness. the relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns ofdevelopment can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of thisperiod. carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify ci$\lambda$ 1.0693 in the nir spectra. we find that mgii lines with highoscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other mgii lines. weshow that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in opticaldepths due to oscillator strengths. the spectra of sn 2014j show it is a normalsn ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal andhigh-velocity subclasses. the velocities for oi, mgii, siii, sii, caii and feiisuggest that sn 2014j has a layered structure with little or no mixing. thatresult is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models. we alsoreport photometric observations, obtained from $-$10d to +29d, in the $ubvrijh$and $k_s$ bands. sn 2014j is about 3 magnitudes fainter than a normal sn ia atthe distance of m82, which we attribute to extinction in the host. the templatefitting package snoopy is used to interpret the light curves and to derivephotometric parameters. using $r_v$ = 1.46, which is consistent with previousstudies, snoopy finds that $a_v = 1.80$ for $e(b-v)_{host}=1.23 \pm 0.01$ mag.the maximum $b$-band brightness of $-19.19 \pm 0.10$ mag was reached onfebruary 1.74 ut $ \pm 0.13$ days and the supernova had a decline parameter of$\delta m_{15}=1.11 \pm 0.02$ mag.

0803.3441	sifto: an empirical method for fitting sne ia light curves	we present sifto, a new empirical method for modeling type ia supernovae (sneia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. we make use ofhigh-redshift sn observations when training the model, allowing us to extend itbluer than rest frame u. this increases the utility of our high-redshift snobservations by allowing us to use more of the available data. we find thatwhen the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription,applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description.sifto therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies differentstretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter andthe stretch in the rest-frame b band. we compare sifto to other publishedlight-curve models by applying them to the same set of sn photometry, anddemonstrate that sifto and salt2 perform better than the alternatives whenjudged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. wefurther demonstrate that when sifto and salt2 are trained on the same data setthe cosmological results agree.

1410.0091	type ia supernova spectral features in the context of their host galaxy  properties	we analyse spectroscopic measurements of 122 type ia supernovae (sne ia) withz&lt;0.09 discovered by the palomar transient factory, focusing on the propertiesof the si ii 6355 and ca ii `near-infrared triplet' absorptions. we examine thevelocities of the photospheric si ii 6355, and the velocities and strengths ofthe photospheric and high-velocity ca ii, in the context of the stellar mass(mstellar) and star-formation rate (sfr) of the sn host galaxies, as well asthe position of the sn within its host. we find that sne ia with faster si ii6355 tend to explode in more massive galaxies, with the highest velocity eventsonly occuring in galaxies with mstellar &gt; 3*10^9 solar mass. we also find someevidence that these highest velocity sne ia explode in the inner regions oftheir host galaxies, similar to the study of wang et al. (2013), although thetrend is not as significant in our data. we show that these trends areconsistent with some sn ia spectral models, if the host galaxy stellar mass isinterpreted as a proxy for host galaxy metallicity. we study the strength ofthe high-velocity component of the ca ii near-ir absorption, and show that sneia with stronger high-velocity components relative to photospheric componentsare hosted by galaxies with low stellar mass, blue colour, and a high ssfr.such sne are therefore likely to arise from the youngest progenitor systems.this argues against a pure orientation effect being responsible forhigh-velocity features in sn ia spectra and, when combined with other studies,is consistent with a scenario where high-velocity features are related to aninteraction between the sn ejecta and circumstellar medium (csm) local to thesn.

1411.1064	the rising light curves of type ia supernovae	we present an analysis of the early, rising light curves of 18 type iasupernovae (sne ia) discovered by the palomar transient factory (ptf) and thela silla-quest variability survey (lsq). we fit these early data flux using asimple power-law $(f(t) = {\alpha\times t^n})$ to determine the time of firstlight $({t_0})$, and hence the rise-time $({t_{rise}})$ from first light topeak luminosity, and the exponent of the power-law rise ($n$). we find a meanuncorrected rise time of $18.98 {\pm} 0.54$ days, with individual sn rise-timesranging from $15.98$ to $24.7$ days. the exponent n shows significantdepartures from the simple 'fireball model' of $n = 2$ (or ${f(t) \proptot^2}$) usually assumed in the literature. with a mean value of $n = 2.44 {\pm}0.13$, our data also show significant diversity from event to event. thisdeviation has implications for the distribution of 56ni throughout the snejecta, with a higher index suggesting a lesser degree of 56ni mixing. therange of n found also confirms that the 56ni distribution is not standardthroughout the population of sne ia, in agreement with earlier work measuringsuch abundances through spectral modelling. we also show that the duration ofthe very early light curve, before the luminosity has reached half of itsmaximal value, does not correlate with the light curve shape or stretch used tostandardise sne ia in cosmological applications. this has implications for thecosmological fitting of sn ia light curves.

1505.02988	the rise-time of type ii supernovae	we investigate the early-time light-curves of a large sample of 223 type iisupernovae (sne) from the sloan digital sky survey and the supernova legacysurvey. having a cadence of a few days and sufficient non-detections prior toexplosion, we constrain rise-times, i.e. the durations from estimated first tomaximum light, as a function of effective wavelength. at restframe g-band(4722a), we find a distribution of fast rise-times with median of (7.5+/-0.3)days. comparing these durations with analytical shock models of rabinak andwaxman (2013); nakar and sari (2010) and hydrodynamical models of tominaga etal. (2009), which are mostly sensitive to progenitor radius at these epochs, wefind a median characteristic radius of less than 400 solar radii. the inferredradii are on average much smaller than the radii obtained for observed redsupergiants (rsg). investigating the post-maximum slopes as a function ofeffective wavelength in the light of theoretical models, we find that massivehydrogen envelopes are still needed to explain the plateaus of sne ii. wetherefore argue that the sn ii rise-times we observe are either a) the shockcooling resulting from the core collapse of rsg with small and dense envelopes,or b) the delayed and prolonged shock breakout of the collapse of a rsg with anextended atmosphere or embedded within pre-sn circumstellar material.

1506.03115	detection of a type iin supernova in optical follow-up observations of  icecube neutrino events	the icecube neutrino observatory pursues a follow-up program selectinginteresting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagneticfollow-up observations. in march 2012, the most significant neutrino alertduring the first three years of operation was issued by icecube. in thefollow-up observations performed by the palomar transient factory (ptf), a typeiin supernova (sn) ptf12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alertdirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. it has a redshift of$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,\mathrm{mpc}$ and the pan-starrs1 survey shows that its explosion time was atleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that acausal connection is unlikely. the a posteriori significance of the chancedetection of both the neutrinos and the sn at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$within icecube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. also, a complementaryneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.therefore, we consider the sn detection coincidental and the neutrinosuncorrelated to the sn. however, the sn is unusual and interesting by itself:it is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the sn iin 2010jl,and shows signs of interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium. high-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shockacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific sn. in thispaper, we describe the sn ptf12csy and present both the neutrino andelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

0805.3983	clustering of supernova ia host galaxies	for the first time the cross-correlation between type ia supernova hostgalaxies and surrounding field galaxies is measured using the supernova legacysurvey sample. over the z=0.2 to 0.9 redshift range we find that supernovahosts are correlated an average of 60% more strongly than similarly selectedfield galaxies over the 3-100 arcsec range and about a factor of 3 morestrongly below 10 arcsec. the correlation errors are empirically establishedwith a jackknife analysis of the four snls fields. the hosts are morecorrelated than the field at a significance of 99% in the fitted amplitude andslope, with the point-by-point difference of the two correlation functionshaving a reduced $\chi^2$ for 8 degrees of freedom of 4.3, which has aprobability of random occurrence of less than 3x10^{-5}. the correlation angleis 1.5+/-0.5 arcsec, which deprojects to a fixed co-moving correlation lengthof approximately 6.5+/- 2/h mpc. weighting the field galaxies with the mass andstar formation rate supernova frequencies of the simple a+b model produces goodagreement with the observed clustering. we conclude that these supernovaclustering differences are primarily the expected outcome of the dependence ofsupernova rates on galaxy masses and stellar populations with their clusteringenvironment.

1512.00846	flash spectroscopy: emission lines from the ionized circumstellar  material around $&lt;10$-day-old type ii supernovae	supernovae (sne) embedded in dense circumstellar material (csm) may showprominent emission lines in their early-time spectra ($\leq 10$ days after theexplosion), owing to recombination of the csm ionized by the shock-breakoutflash. from such spectra ("flash spectroscopy"), we can measure variousphysical properties of the csm, as well as the mass-loss rate of the progenitorduring the year prior to its explosion. searching through the palomar transientfactory (ptf and iptf) sn spectroscopy databases from 2009 through 2014, wefound 12 type ii sne showing flash-ionized (fi) signatures in their firstspectra. all are younger than 10 days. these events constitute 14\% of all 84sne in our sample having a spectrum within 10 days from explosion, and 18\% ofsne~ii observed at ages $&lt;5$ days, thereby setting lower limits on the fractionof fi events. we classified as "blue/featureless" (bf) those events having afirst spectrum which is similar to that of a black body, without any emissionor absorption signatures. it is possible that some bf events had fi signaturesat an earlier phase than observed, or that they lack dense csm around theprogenitor. within 2 days after explosion, 8 out of 11 sne in our sample areeither bf events or show fi signatures. interestingly, we found that 19 out of21 sne brighter than an absolute magnitude $m_r=-18.2$ belong to the fi or bfgroups, and that all fi events peaked above $m_r=-17.6$ mag, significantlybrighter than average sne~ii.

astro-ph;0211444	the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae as a function of host galaxy  morphology	(abridged) we present new results on the hubble diagram of distant type iasupernovae (sne ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. this makesit possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitlycomparing sne residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with thelarger sample. the cosmological parameters derived from these sne ia hosted bypresumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for acosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and theinternal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (a_b&lt;0.2).thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely tosystematically dim distant sne ia in a manner that would produce a spuriouscosmological constant. we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant snediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) using the combination ofhst stis imaging, keck esi spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.we compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 sne ia. the scatter observed in thesne ia hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. we findthe scatter in the sne ia hubble diagram is smallest for sne occurring inearly-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.moreover, sne residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 magbrighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those inlate-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in thelate-type systems.

astro-ph;0301312	analysis of the flux and polarization spectra of the type ia supernova  sn 2001el: exploring the geometry of the high-velocity ejecta	sn 2001el is the first normal type ia supernova to show a strong, intrinsicpolarization signal. in addition, during the epochs prior to maximum light, thecaii ir triplet absorption is seen distinctly and separately at both normalphotospheric velocities and at very high velocities. the high-velocity tripletabsorption is highly polarized, with a different polarization angle than therest of the spectrum. the unique observation allows us to construct arelatively detailed picture of the layered geometrical structure of thesupernova ejecta: in our interpretation, the ejecta layers near the photosphere(v \approx 10,000 km/s) obey a near axial symmetry, while a detached,high-velocity structure (v \approx 18,000-25,000 km/s) with high caii lineopacity deviates from the photospheric axisymmetry. by partially obscuring theunderlying photosphere, the high-velocity structure causes a more incompletecancellation of the polarization of the photospheric light, and so gives riseto the polarization peak and rotated polarization angle of the high-velocity irtriplet feature. in an effort to constrain the ejecta geometry, we develop atechnique for calculating 3-d synthetic polarization spectra and use it togenerate polarization profiles for several parameterized configurations. inparticular, we examine the case where the inner ejecta layers are ellipsoidaland the outer, high-velocity structure is one of four possibilities: aspherical shell, an ellipsoidal shell, a clumped shell, or a toroid. thesynthetic spectra rule out the spherical shell model, disfavor a toroid, andfind a best fit with the clumped shell. we show further that differentgeometries can be more clearly discriminated if observations are obtained fromseveral different lines of sight.

(2003). cmagic takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior oftype ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages overcurrent techniques based on maximum magnitudes. among these are a reducedsensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-widthrelation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. this allows usto provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite thefact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for cmagic.we describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed toprevent experimenter bias. the data are broadly consistent with the picture ofan accelerating universe, and agree with a flat universe within 1.7\sigma,including systematics. we also compare the cmagic results directly with thoseof a maximum magnitude fit to the same sne, finding that cmagic favors moreacceleration at the 1.6\sigma level, including systematics and the correlationbetween the two measurements. a fit for w assuming a flat universe yields avalue which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2\sigma.

astro-ph;0607363	the rise time of type ia supernovae from the supernova legacy survey	we compare the rise times of nearby and distant type ia supernovae (sne ia)as a test for evolution using 73 high-redshift spectroscopically-confirmed sneia from the first two years of the five year supernova legacy survey (snls) andpublished observations of nearby sn. because of the ``rolling'' search natureof the snls, our measurement is approximately 6 times more precise thanprevious studies, allowing for a more sensitive test of evolution betweennearby and distant supernovae. adopting a simple $t^2$ early-time model (as inprevious studies), we find that the rest-frame $b$ rise times for a fiducial snia at high and low redshift are consistent, with values$19.10^{+0.18}_{-0.17}({stat}) \pm 0.2 ({syst})$ and $19.58^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$days, respectively; the statistical significance of this difference is only 1.4\sg . the errors represent the uncertainty in the mean rather than anyvariation between individual sn. we also compare subsets of our high-redshiftdata set based on decline rate, host galaxy star formation rate, and redshift,finding no substantive evidence for any subsample dependence.

astro-ph;0703529	k-corrections and spectral templates of type ia supernovae	with the advent of large dedicated type ia supernova (sn ia) surveys,k-corrections of sne ia and their uncertainties have become especiallyimportant in the determination of cosmological parameters. while k-correctionsare largely driven by sn ia broad-band colors, it is shown here that thediversity in spectral features of sne ia can also be important. for anindividual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity inspectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filtersare aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters aremisaligned). to minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed sn iaspectral energy distribution (sed), we outline a prescription for deriving amean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneoussample of observed spectra. we then remove the effects of broad-band colors andmeasure the remaining uncertainties in the k-corrections associated with thediversity in spectral features. finally, we present a template spectroscopicsequence near maximum light for further improvement on the k-correctionestimate. a library of ~600 observed spectra of ~100 sne ia from heterogeneoussources is used for the analysis.

0809.4407	photometry assisted spectral extraction (phase) and identification of  snls supernovae	aim: we present new extraction and identification techniques for supernova(sn) spectra developed within the supernova legacy survey (snls) collaboration.  method: the new spectral extraction method takes full advantage ofphotometric information from the canada-france-hawai telescope (cfht) discoveryand reference images by tracing the exact position of the supernova and thehost signals on the spectrogram. when present, the host spatial profile ismeasured on deep multi-band reference images and is used to model the hostcontribution to the full (supernova + host) signal. the supernova is modelledas a gaussian function of width equal to the seeing. a chi-square minimisationprovides the flux of each component in each pixel of the 2d spectrogram. for ahost-supernova separation greater than &lt;~ 1 pixel, the two components arerecovered separately and we do not use a spectral template in contrast to morestandard analyses. this new procedure permits a clean extraction of thesupernova separately from the host in about 70% of the 3rd year eso/vlt spectraof the snls. a new supernova identification method is also proposed. it usesthe salt2 spectrophotometric template to combine the photometric and spectraldata. a galaxy template is allowed for spectra for which a separate extractionof the supernova and the host was not possible.  result: these new techniques have been tested against more standardextraction and identification procedures. they permit a secure type andredshift determination in about 80% of cases. the present paper illustratestheir performances on a few sample spectra.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.
