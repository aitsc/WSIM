0901.0314	the new intermediate long bursting source xte j1701-407	xte j1701-407 is a newly discovered x-ray transient source. in this work weinvestigate its flux variability and study the intermediate long and shortbursts discovered by swift on july 17, and 27, 2008, respectively. so far, onlyone intermediate long burst, with a duration of ~18 minutes and ten days latera short burst, have been recorded from xte j1701-407. we analyzed the publicavailable data from swift and rxte, and compared the observed properties of theintermediate long burst with theoretical ignition condition and light curves toinvestigate the possible nuclear burning processes. the intermediate long burstmay have exhibited a photospheric radius expansion, allowing us to derive thesource distance at 6.2 kpc assuming the empirically derived eddingtonluminosity for pure helium. the intermediate long burst decay was best fit byusing two exponential functions with e-folding times of \tau_1=40(3) s and\tau_2=221(9) s. the bursts occurred at a persistent luminosity ofl_{per}=8.3x10e36 erg/s. for the intermediate long burst the mass accretionrate per unit area onto the ns was \dot{m}=4x10e3 g/cm2/s, and the total energyreleased was e_{burst}=3.5x10e40 erg. this corresponds to an ignition columndepth of y_{ign}=1.8x10e9 g/cm2, for a pure helium burning. we find that theenergetics of this burst can be modeled in different ways, as (i) pure heliumignition, as the result of either pure helium accretion or depletion ofhydrogen by steady burning during accumulation, or (ii) as ignition of a thicklayer of hydrogen-rich material in a source with low metallicity. however,comparison of the burst duration with model light curves suggests that hydrogenburning plays a role during the burst, and therefore this source is a lowaccretion rate burster with a low metallicity in the accreted material.

0906.3633	bursting behavior of the galactic center faint x-ray transient grs  1741.9-2853	the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary grs 1741.9-2853 is a known type-iburster of the galactic center. it is transient, faint, and located in a verycrowded region, only 10 arcmin from the supermassive black hole sgr a*.therefore, its bursting behavior has been poorly studied so far. in particular,its persistent emission has rarely been detected between consecutive bursts,due to lack of sensitivity or confusion. this is what made grs 1741.9-2853 oneof the nine "burst-only sources" identified by bepposax a few years ago. thephysical properties of grs 1741.9-2853 bursts are yet of great interest sincewe know very little about the nuclear regimes at stake in low accretion ratebursters. we examine here for the first time several bursts in relation withthe persistent emission of the source, using integral, xmm-newton, and swiftobservations. we investigate the source flux variability and bursting behaviorduring its 2005 and 2007 long outbursts. the persistent luminosity of grs1741.9-2853 varied between ~1.7 and 10.5 10^36 erg s^-1, i.e. 0.9-5.3% of theeddington luminosity. the shape of the spectrum as described by an absorbedpower-law remained with a photon index gamma ~ 2 and a column density $n_{\rmh} ~ 12 10^22 cm^-2 throughout the outbursts. we discovered 11 type-i burstswith integral, and inspected 4 additional bursts: 2 recorded by xmm-newton and2 by swift. from the brigthest burst, we derive an upper limit on the sourcedistance of ~7 kpc. the observed bursts characteristics and source accretionrate suggest pure helium explosions igniting at column depths y_{ign} ~ 0.8-4.810^8 g cm^-1, for typical energy releases of ~1.2-7.4 10^39 erg.

0909.2960	does the x-ray emission of the luminous quasar rbs 1124 originate in a  mildly relativistic outflowing corona?	we have observed the luminous (l_x ~ 6x10^44 erg/s) radio-quiet quasar rbs1124 (z=0.208) with suzaku. we report the detection of a moderately broad iron(fe) line and of a weak soft x-ray excess. the x-ray data are very welldescribed by a simple model comprising a power law x-ray continuum plus itsreflection off the accretion disc. if the inner disc radius we measure (&lt;=3.8gravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit ofthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering rbs 1124 isrotating rapidly with spin a&gt;= 0.6. the soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2kev band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured seyfert1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction wemeasure (r_disc ~0.4). the low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disctruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we inferbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source(l_bol / l_edd ~1). a plausible explanation is that the x-ray corona is thebase of a failed jet (rbs 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing atmildly relativistic speeds. aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,thus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferredsource intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived eddington ratio from ~1to~0.5.

1012.0229	spectral and timing properties of the accreting x-ray millisecond pulsar  igr j17511-3057	igr j17511-3057 is the second x-ray transient accreting millisecond pulsardiscovered by integral. it was in outburst for about a month from september 13,2009. the broad-band average spectrum is well described by thermalcomptonization with an electron temperature of kt_e ~ 25 kev, soft seed photonsof kt_bb ~ 0.6 kev, and thomson optical depth \tau_t ~ 2 in a slab geometry.during the outburst the spectrum stays remarkably stable with plasma and softseed photon temperatures and scattering optical depth being constant withinerrors. we fitted the outburst profile with the exponential model, and usingthe disk instability model we inferred the outer disk radius to be (4.8 - 5.4)\times 1010 cm. the integral and rxte data reveal the x-ray pulsation at aperiod of 4.08 milliseconds up to ~ 120 kev. the pulsed fraction is shown todecrease from ~22% at 3 kev to a constant pulsed fraction of ~17-18% between7-30 kev, and then to decrease again down to ~13% at 60 kev. the nearlysinusoidal pulses show soft lags monotonically increasing with energy to about0.2 ms at 10-20 kev similar to those observed in other accreting pulsars. theshort burst profiles indicate hydrogen-poor material at ignition, whichsuggests either that the accreted material is hydrogen-deficient, or that thecno metallicity is up to a factor of 2 times solar. however, the variation ofburst recurrence time as a function of m (inferred from the x-ray flux) is muchsmaller than predicted by helium-ignition models.

1203.4096	the pulse profile and spin evolution of the accreting pulsar in terzan  5, igr j17480-2446, during its 2010 outburst	(abridged) we analyse the spectral and pulse properties of the 11 hztransient accreting pulsar, igr j17480-2446, in the globular cluster terzan 5,considering all the available rxte, swift and integral observations performedbetween october and november, 2010.  by measuring the pulse phase evolution we conclude that the ns spun up at anaverage rate of &lt;nu_dot&gt;=1.48(2)e-12 hz/s, compatible with the accretion of thekeplerian angular momentum of matter at the inner disc boundary. similar toother accreting pulsars, the stability of the pulse phases determined by usingthe second harmonic component is higher than that of the phases based on thefundamental frequency. under the assumption that the second harmonic is a goodtracer of the neutron star spin frequency, we successfully model its evolutionin terms of a luminosity dependent accretion torque. if the ns accretes thespecific keplerian angular momentum of the in-flowing matter, we estimate theinner disc radius to lie between 47 and 93 km when the luminosity attains itspeak value. smaller values are obtained if the interaction between the magneticfield lines and the plasma in the disc is considered.  the phase-averaged spectrum is described by thermal comptonization of photonswith energy of ~1 kev. a hard to soft state transition is observed during theoutburst rise. the comptonized spectrum evolves from a comptonizing cloud at anelectron temperature of ~20 kev towards an optically denser cloud at kt_e~3kev. at the same time, the pulse amplitude decreases from 27% to few per centand becomes strongly energy dependent. we discuss various possibilities toexplain such a behaviour, proposing that at large accretion luminosities asignificant fraction of the in-falling matter is not channelled towards themagnetic poles, but rather accretes more evenly onto the ns surface.

1204.2464	a complete x-ray spectral coverage of the 2010 may-june outbursts of  circinus x-1	circinus x-1 is a neutron-star-accreting x-ray binary in a wide (p$_{\rmorb}$ = 16.6 d), eccentric orbit. after two years of relatively low x-rayluminosity, in may 2010 circinus x-1 went into outburst, reaching 0.4 crabflux. this outburst lasted for about two orbital cycles and was followed byanother shorter and fainter outburst in june. we focus here on the broadbandx-ray spectral evolution of the source as it spans about three order ofmagnitudes in flux. we attempt to relate luminosity, spectral shape, localabsorption, and orbital phase. we use multiple rossi-xte/pca (3.0--25 kev) andswift/xrt (1.0--9.0 kev) observations and a 20 ks long chandra/hetgsobservation (1.0--9.0 kev), to comprehensively track the spectral evolution ofthe source during all the outbursting phases. these observations were takenevery two/three days and cover about four orbital cycles. the pca data mostlycover the major outburst, the xrt data monitor the declining phase of the majoroutburst and all the phases of the minor outburst, and chandra data provide anessential snapshot of the end of this overall outbursting phase. the x-rayspectrum can be satisfactorily described by a thermal comptonization model withvariable neutral local absorption in all phases of the outburst. no otheradditive component is statistically required. the first outburst decayslinearly, with an ankle in the light curve as the flux decreases below$\sim$\,5 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. at the same time, thesource shows a clear spectral state transition from an optically thick to anoptically thin state. while the characteristics of the first, bright, outburstcan be interpreted within the disk-instability scenario, the following, minor,outburst shows peculiarities that cannot be easily reconciled in thisframework.

1209.4856	investigating supergiant fast x-ray transients with loft	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxt) are a class of high-mass x-raybinaries whose optical counterparts are o or b supergiant stars, and whosex-ray outbursts are ~ 4 orders of magnitude brighter than the quiescent state.loft, the large observatory for x-ray timing, with its coded mask wide fieldmonitor (wfm) and its 10 m^2 class collimated x-ray large area detector (lad),will be able to dramatically deepen the knowledge of this class of sources. itwill provide simultaneous high s/n broad-band and time-resolved spectroscopy inseveral intensity states, and long term monitoring that will yield newdeterminations of orbital periods, as well as spin periods. we show the resultsof an extensive set of simulations performed using previous observationalresults of these sources obtained with swift and xmm-newton. the wfm willdetect all sfxt flares within its field of view down to a 15-20 mcrab in 5ks.our simulations describe the outbursts at several intensities(f_(2-10kev)=5.9x10^-9 to 5.5x10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1), the intermediate and mostcommon state (10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1), and the low state (1.2x10^-12 to 5x10^-13erg cm^-2 s^-1). we also considered large variations of n_h and the presence ofemission lines, as observed by swift and xmm-newton.

1212.2532	the accretion flow to the intermittent accreting ms pulsar, hete  j1900.1-2455, as observed by xmm-newton and rxte	we present a study of the accretion flow to the intermittent accretingmillisecond pulsar, hete j1900.1-2455, based on observations performedsimultaneously by xmm-newton and rxte. the 0.33-50 kev spectrum is described bythe sum of a hard comptonized component originated in an optically thin{\tau}~1 corona, a soft ktin~0.2 kev component interpreted as accretion discemission, and of disc reflection of the hard component. two emission featuresare detected at energies of 0.98(1) and 6.58(7) kev, respectively. the latteris identified as k{\alpha} transition of fe xxiii-xxv. a simultaneous detectionin epic-pn, epic-mos2, and rgs spectra favours an astrophysical origin also forthe former, which has an energy compatible with fe-l{\alpha} and helium-likene-k{\alpha} transitions. broadness of the two features suggests a commonorigin, resulting from reflection in an accretion disc with inclination of(30+4{\deg}), and extending down to rin=25(+16,-11) gravitational radii fromthe compact object. however, the strength of the feature at lower energymeasured by epic-pn cannot be entirely reconciled with the amplitude of the fek{\alpha} line, hampering the possibility of describing it in terms of abroad-band reflection model, and preventing a firm identification. pulsationsat the 377.3 hz spin frequency could not be detected, with an upper limit of0.4% at 3-{\sigma} c.l. on the fractional amplitude. we interpret the innerdisc radius estimated from spectral modelling and the lack of significantdetection of coherent x-ray pulsations as an indication of a disc accretionflow truncated by some mechanism connected to the overall evolution of theaccretion disc, rather than by the neutron star magnetic field. this iscompatible with the extremely close similarity of spectral and temporalproperties of this source with respect to other, non pulsing atoll sources inthe hard state.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1408.6536	the loft burst alert system and its burst on-board trigger	the esa m3 candidate mission loft (large observatory for x-ray timing) hasbeen designed to study strong gravitational fields by observing compactobjects, such as black-hole binaries or neutron-star systems and supermassiveblack-holes, based on the temporal analysis of photons collected by the primaryinstrument lad (large area detector), sensitive to x-rays from 2 to 50 kev,offering a very large effective area (&gt;10 m 2 ), but a small field of view({\o}&lt;1{\deg}). simultaneously the second instrument wfm (wide field monitor),composed of 5 coded-mask camera pairs (2-50 kev), monitors a large part of thesky, in order to detect and localize eruptive sources, to be observed with thelad after ground-commanded satellite repointing. with its large field of view(&gt;{\pi} sr), the wfm actually detects all types of transient sources, includinggamma-ray bursts (grbs), which are of primary interest for a world-wideobservers community. however, observing the quickly decaying grb afterglowswith ground-based telescopes needs the rapid knowledge of their preciselocalization. the task of the loft burst alert system (lbas) is therefore todetect in near- real-time grbs (about 120 detections expected per year) andother transient sources, and to deliver their localization in less than 30seconds to the observers, via a vhf antenna network. real-time full resolutiondata download to ground being impossible, the real-time data processing isperformed onboard by the lbot (loft burst on-board trigger system). in thisarticle we present the lbas and its components, the lbot and the associatedground-segment.

1408.6541	the loft ground segment	loft, the large observatory for x-ray timing, was one of the esa m3 missioncandidates that completed their assessment phase at the end of 2013. loft isequipped with two instruments, the large area detector (lad) and the wide fieldmonitor (wfm). the lad performs pointed observations of several targets perorbit (~90 minutes), providing roughly ~80 gb of proprietary data per day (theproprietary period will be 12 months). the wfm continuously monitors about 1/3of the sky at a time and provides data for about ~100 sources a day, resultingin a total of ~20 gb of additional telemetry. the loft burst alert systemadditionally identifies on-board bright impulsive events (e.g., gamma-raybursts, grbs) and broadcasts the corresponding position and trigger time to theground using a dedicated system of ~15 vhf receivers. all wfm data are plannedto be made public immediately. in this contribution we summarize the plannedorganization of the loft ground segment (gs), as established in the missionyellow book 1 . we describe the expected gs contributions from esa and the loftconsortium. a review is provided of the planned loft data products and thedetails of the data flow, archiving and distribution. despite loft was notselected for launch within the m3 call, its long assessment phase (&gt; 2 years)led to a very solid mission design and an efficient planning of its groundoperations.

1411.4470	supergiant fast x-ray transients as an under-luminous class of  supergiant x-ray binaries	the usage of cumulative luminosity distributions, constructed thanks to thelong-term observations available through wide field hard x-ray imagers, hasbeen recently exploited to study the averaged high energy emission (&gt;17 kev)from supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) and classical supergiant highmass x-ray binaries (sgxbs). here, we take advantage of the long termmonitorings now available with swift/xrt to construct for the first time thecumulative luminosity distributions of a number of sfxts and the classical sgxbigr j18027-2016 in the soft x-ray domain with a high sensitivity focusing x-raytelescope (0.3-10 kev). by complementing previous results obtained in the hardx-rays, we found that classical sgxbs are characterized by cumulativedistributions with a single knee around $\sim$10$^{36}$-10$^{37}$ erg/s, whilesfxts are found to be systematically sub-luminous and their distributions areshifted at significantly lower luminosities (a factor of $\sim$10-100). as theluminosity states in which these sources spend most of their time are typicallybelow the sensitivity limit of large field of view hard x-ray imagers, weconclude that soft x-ray monitorings carried out with high sensitivitytelescopes are particularly crucial to reconstruct the complete profile of thesfxt cumulative luminosity distributions. the difference between the cumulativeluminosity distributions of classical sgxbs and sfxts is interpreted in termsof accretion from a structured wind in the former sources and the presence ofmagnetic/centrifugal gates or a quasi-spherical settling accretion regime inthe latter.

1411.7869	probing large-scale wind structures in vela x-1 using off-states with  integral	vela x-1 is the prototype of the class of wind-fed accreting pulsars in highmass x-ray binaries hosting a supergiant donor. we have analyzed in asystematic way ten years of integral data of vela x-1 (22-50 kev) and we foundthat when outside the x-ray eclipse, the source undergoes several luminositydrops where the hard x-rays luminosity goes below 3x10^35 erg/s, becomingundetected by integral. these drops in the x-ray flux are usually referred toas "off-states" in the literature. we have investigated the distribution ofthese off-states along the vela x-1 ~8.9 d orbit, finding that their orbitaloccurrence displays an asymmetric distribution, with a higher probability toobserve an off-state near the pre-eclipse than during the post-eclipse. thisasymmetry can be explained by scattering of hard x-rays in a region of ionizedwind, able to reduce the source hard x-ray brightness preferentially neareclipse ingress. we associate this ionized large-scale wind structure with thephotoionization wake produced by the interaction of the supergiant wind withthe x-ray emission from the neutron star. we emphasize that this observationalresult could be obtained thanks to the accumulation of a decade of integraldata, with observations covering the whole orbit several times, allowing us todetect an asymmetric pattern in the orbital distribution of off-states in velax-1.

1502.04717	giant outburst from the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr j17544-2619:  accretion from a transient disc?	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are high mass x-ray binariesassociated with ob supergiant companions and characterised by an x-ray flaringbehaviour whose dynamical range reaches 5 orders of magnitude on timescales ofa few hundred to thousands of seconds. current investigations concentrate onfinding possible mechanisms to inhibit accretion in sfxts and explain theirunusually low average x-ray luminosity. we present the swift observations of anexceptionally bright outburst displayed by the sfxt igr j17544-2619 on 2014october 10 when the source achieved a peak luminosity of $3\times10^{38}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this extends the total source dynamic range to $\gtrsim$10$^6$, thelargest (by a factor of 10) recorded so far from an sfxt. tentative evidencefor pulsations at a period of 11.6 s is also reported. we show that theseobservations challenge, for the first time, the maximum theoretical luminosityachievable by an sfxt and propose that this giant outburst was due to theformation of a transient accretion disc around the compact object.

1503.02921	gro j1744-28: an intermediate b-field pulsar in a low mass x-ray binary	the bursting pulsar, gro j1744-28, went again in outburst after $\sim$18years of quiescence in mid-january 2014. we studied the broad-band, persistent,x-ray spectrum using x-ray data from a xmm-newton observation, performed almostat the peak of the outburst, and from a close integral observation, performed 3days later, thus covering the 1.3-70.0 kev band. the spectrum shows a complexcontinuum shape that cannot be modelled with standard high-mass x-ray pulsarmodels, nor by two-components models. we observe broadband and peaked residualsfrom 4 to 15 kev, and we propose a self-consistent interpretation of theseresiduals, assuming they are produced by cyclotron absorption features and by amoderately smeared, highly ionized, reflection component. we identify thecyclotron fundamental at $\sim$ 4.7 kev, with hints for two possible harmonicsat 10.4 kev and 15.8 kev. the position of the cyclotron fundamental allows anestimate for the pulsar magnetic field of (5.27 $\pm$ 0.06) $\times$ 10$^{11}$g, if the feature is produced at its surface. from the dynamical andrelativistic smearing of the disk reflected component, we obtain a lower limitestimate for the truncated accretion disk inner radius, ($\gtrsim$ 100 r$_g$),and for the inclination angle (18$^{\circ}$-48$^{\circ}$). we also detect thepresence of a softer thermal component, that we associate with the emissionfrom an accretion disk truncated at a distance from the pulsar of 50-115 r$_g$.from these estimates, we derive the magneto-spheric radius for disk accretionto be $\sim$ 0.2 times the classical alfv\'en radius for radial accretion.

0805.1849	are there magnetars in high mass x-ray binaries? the case of supergiant  fast x-ray transients	in this paper we survey the theory of wind accretion in high mass x-raybinaries hosting a magnetic neutron star and a supergiant companion.  we concentrate on the different types of interaction between the inflowingwind matter and the neutron star magnetosphere that are relevant when accretionof matter onto the neutron star surface is largely inhibited; these include theinhibition through the centrifugal and magnetic barriers. expanding on earlierwork, we calculate the expected luminosity for each regime and derive theconditions under which transition from one regime to another can take place. weshow that very large luminosity swings (~10^4 or more on time scales as shortas hours) can result from transitions across different regimes.  the activity displayed by supergiant fast x-ray transients, a recentlydiscovered class of high mass x-ray binaries in our galaxy, has often beeninterpreted in terms of direct accretion onto a neutron star immersed in anextremely clumpy stellar wind. we show here that the transitions across themagnetic and/or centrifugal barriers can explain the variability properties ofthese sources as a results of relatively modest variations in the stellar windvelocity and/or density. according to this interpretation we expect thatsupergiant fast x-ray transients which display very large luminosity swings andhost a slowly spinning neutron star are characterized by magnetar-like fields,irrespective of whether the magnetic or the centrifugal barrier applies.  supergiant fast x-ray transients might thus provide a new opportunity todetect and study magnetars in binary systems.

1511.01944	a closer view of the igr j11014-6103 outflows	the complex x-ray system igr j11014-6103 (a.k.a. the lighthouse nebula) iscomposed of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (pwn) as well as large-scalejet-like features, all launched by igr j11014-6103 which is movingsupersonically in the interstellar medium. previous observations suggested thatthe jet features stem from a ballistic jet of relativistic particles. in orderto confirm the nature of the jet and the marginally detected counter-jet, weobtained a new deep 250 ks chandra observation of the lighthouse nebula. weperformed detailed spatial and spectral analysis of all x-ray components of thesystem. the x-ray pwn is now better resolved and shows a clear bi-modalmorphology. the overall helical pattern of the main jet is confirmed. however,there are large deviations from a simple helical model at small and largescales. significant extended emission is now detected, encompassing the mainjet all along its length. the brightness dip of the main jet at ~50" distancefrom the pulsar is confirmed, the extended emission however preventsconclusions about the coherence at this position of the jet. the counter-jet isnow detected at high statistical significance. in addition, we found twosmall-scale "arcs" departing from the pulsar towards the jets. we also lookedfor possible bow-shock emission in front of the pulsar, with a short vlt/fors2h-alpha observation. no clear emission is found, most likely because ofcontamination from a diffuse surrounding nebulosity. the results of our x-rayanalysis show that current expectations from a ballistic nature of the jets canexplain satisfactorily some of the observational evidences but cannot fullyreproduce the observations. the alternative scenario (diffusion of particlesalong preexisting magnetic field lines in the surrounding medium) however alsocontinues to suffer from conflicts with the observations.
