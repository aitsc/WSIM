0903.3833	a decade of sn1993j: discovery of wavelength effects in the expansion  rate	we have studied the growth of the shell-like radio structure of supernovasn1993j in m81 from september 1993 through october 2003 with very-long-baselineinterferometry (vlbi) observations at the wavelengths of 3.6, 6, and 18cm. forthis purpose, we have developed a method to accurately determine the outerradius (r) of any circularly symmetric compact radio structure like sn1993j.  the source structure of sn1993j remains circularly symmetric (with deviationsfrom circularity under 2%) over almost 4000 days. we characterize thedecelerated expansion of sn 1993j through approximately day 1500 afterexplosion with an expansion parameter $m= 0.845\pm0.005$ ($r \propto t^{m}$).however, from that day onwards the expansion is different when observed at 6and 18cm. indeed, at 18cm, the expansion can be well characterized by the same$m$ as before day 1500, while at 6cm the expansion appears more decelerated,and is characterized by another expansion parameter, $m_{6}= 0.788\pm0.015$.therefore, since about day 1500 on, the radio source size has beenprogressively smaller at 6cm than at 18cm. these findings are in stark contrastto previous reports by other authors on the details of the expansion. in ourinterpretation the supernova expands with a single expansion parameter, $m=0.845\pm0.005$, and the 6cm results beyond day 1500 are due to physicaleffects, perhaps also coupled to instrumental limitations. two physical effectsmay be involved: (a) a changing opacity of the ejecta to the 6cm radiation, and(b) a radial decrease of the magnetic field in the emitting region.

0904.0337	23 ghz vlbi observations of sn 2008ax	we report on phase-referenced 23 ghz very-long-baseline-interferometry (vlbi)observations of the type iib supernova sn 2008ax, made with the very longbaseline array (vlba) on 2 april 2008 (33 days after explosion). theseobservations resulted in a marginal detection of the supernova. the total fluxdensity recovered from our vlbi image is 0.8$\pm$0.3 mjy (one standarddeviation). as it appears, the structure may be interpreted as either acore-jet or a double source. however, the supernova structure could be somewhatconfused with a possible close by noise peak. in such a case, the recoveredflux density would decrease to 0.48$\pm$0.12 mjy, compatible with the fluxdensities measured with the vla at epochs close in time to our vlbiobservations. the lowest average expansion velocities derived from ourobservations are $(1.90 \pm 0.30) \times 10^5$ km s$^{-1}$ (case of a doublesource) and $(5.2 \pm 1.3) \times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ (taking the weaker sourcecomponent as a spurious, close by, noise peak, which is the more likelyinterpretation). these velocities are 7.3 and 2 times higher, respectively,than the maximum ejecta velocity inferred from optical-line observations.

0907.0992	the magic highlights of the gamma ray binary ls i +61 303	the discovery of emission of tev gamma rays from x-ray binaries has triggeredan intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration, absorption,and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems. here we present thepioneering effort of the magic collaboration to understand the very high energyemission of the prototype system ls i +61 303. we report on the variable natureof the emission from ls i +61 303 and show that this emission is indeedperiodic. the system shows regular outburst at tev energies in phasephi=0.6-0.7 and detect no signal at periastron (phi~ 0.275). furthermore wefind no indication of spectral variation along the orbit of the compact objectand the spectral energy distribution is compatible with a simple power law withindex gamma=2.6+-0.2_(stat)+-0.2_(sys). to answer some of the open questionsconcerning the emission process of the tev radiation we conducted amultiwavelength campaign with the magic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift inseptember 2007. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and tev energies,with the peak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linearfit to the strictly simultaneous x-ray/tev flux pairs provides r=0.81 -0.21+0.06. here we present the observations and discuss the implications of theobtained results to the emission processes in the system.

0907.2644	radio monitoring of ngc 7469: late time radio evolution of sn 2000ft and  the circumnuclear starburst in ngc 7469	we present the results of an eight-year long monitoring of the radio emissionfrom the luminous infrared galaxy (lirg) ngc 7469, using 8.4 ghz very largearray (vla) observations at 0.3'' resolution. our monitoring shows that thelate time evolution of the radio supernova sn 2000ft follows a decline verysimilar to that displayed at earlier times of its optically thin phase. thelate time radio emission of sn 2000ft is therefore still being powered by itsinteraction with the presupernova stellar wind, and not with the interstellarmedium (ism). indeed, the ram pressure of the presupernova wind is \rho_w v_w^2\approx 7.6e-9 dyn/cm^2, at a supernova age of approximately 2127 days, whichis significantly larger than the expected pressure of the ism around sn 2000ft.at this age, the sn shock has reached a distance r_{sh \approx 0.06 pc, and ourobservations are probing the interaction of the sn with dense material that wasejected by the presupernova star about 5820 years prior to its explosion. fromour vla monitoring, we estimate that the swept-up mass by the supernova shockafter about six years of expansion is \approx 0.29 m_sun, assuming an averageexpansion speed of the supernova of 10000 km/s.  we also searched for recently exploded core-collapse supernovae in our vlaimages. apart from sn 2000ft (s_\nu \approx 1760 microjy at its peak,corresponding to 1.1e28 erg/s/hz, we found no evidence for any other radiosupernova (rsn) more luminous than \approx 6.0e26 erg/s/hz, which suggests thatno other type iin sn has exploded since 2000 in the circumnuclear starburst ofngc 7469.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1007.1459	extragalactic background light inferred from aegis galaxy sed-type  fractions	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is of fundamental importance bothfor understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for gamma-rayastronomy, but the overall spectrum of the ebl between 0.1-1000 microns hasnever been determined directly from galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed)observations over a wide redshift range. the evolving, overall spectrum of theebl is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. thisis achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame k-band galaxyluminosity function up to redshift 4 (cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with adetermination of galaxy sed-type fractions. these are based on fitting swiretemplates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshiftrange from 0.2 to 1 from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). the changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forminggalaxies, starburst galaxies and agn galaxies in that redshift range areestimated, and two alternative extrapolations of sed-types to higher redshiftsare considered. this allows calculation of the evolution of the luminositydensities from the uv to the ir, the evolving star formation rate density ofthe universe, the evolving contribution to the bolometric ebl from thedifferent galaxy populations including agn galaxies and the buildup of the ebl.our ebl calculations are compared with those from a semi-analytic model, fromanother observationally-based model and observational data. the ebluncertainties in our modeling based directly on the data are quantified, andtheir consequences for attenuation of very high energy gamma-rays due to pairproduction on the ebl are discussed. it is concluded that the ebl is wellconstrained from the uv to the mid-ir, but independent efforts from infraredand gamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in thefar-ir.

1007.2552	radio emission of sn1993j: the complete picture. i. re-analysis of all  the available vlbi data	we have performed a complete re-calibration and re-analysis of all theavailable vlbi observations of supernova sn1993j, following an homogeneous andwell-defined methodology. observations of sn1993j at 69 epochs, spanning 13years, were performed by two teams, which used different strategies andanalysis tools. the results obtained by each group are similar, but theirconclusions on the supernova expansion and the shape and evolution of theemitting region differ significantly. from our analysis of the combined set ofobservations, we have obtained an expansion curve with unprecedented timeresolution and coverage. we find that the data from both teams are compatiblewhen analyzed with the same methodology. one expansion index ($m_3 = 0.87 \pm0.02$) is enough to model the expansion observed at 1.7\,ghz, while twoexpansion indices ($m_1 = 0.933\pm0.010$ and $m_2 = 0.796\pm0.005$), separatedby a break time, $t_{br} = 390\pm30$ days, are needed to model the data, atfrequencies higher than 1.7\,ghz, up to day 4000 after explosion. we thusconfirm the wavelength dependence of the size of the emitting region reportedby one of the groups. we also find that all sizes measured at epochs later thanday 4000 after explosion are systematically smaller than our model predictions.we estimate the fractional shell width ($0.31 \pm 0.02$, average of all epochsand frequencies) and the level of opacity to the radio emission by the ejecta.we find evidence of a spectral-index radial gradient in the supernova shell,which is indicative of a frequency-dependent ejecta opacity. finally, we studythe distribution and evolution of the azimuthal anisotropies (hot spots) foundaround the radio shell during the expansion. these anisotropies haveintensities of $\sim 20$% of the mean flux density of the shell, and appear tosystematically evolve during the expansion.

1101.5380	electron cooling and the connection between expansion and flux-density  evolution in radio supernovae	radio supernovae (rsne) are weak and rare events. their typical maximum radioluminosities are of the order of only $10^{27}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$\,hz$^{-1}$.there are, however, very few cases of relatively bright (and/or close) rsne,from which the expansion of the shock and the radio light curves at severalfrequencies have been monitored covering several years. applying the standardmodel of radio emission from supernovae, it is possible to relate the definingparameters of the modelled expansion curve to those of the modelled lightcurves in a simple algebraic way, by assuming an evolution law for the magneticfield and for the energy density of the population of synchrotron-emittingelectrons.  however, cooling mechanisms of the electrons may affect considerably thisconnection between light curves and expansion curve, and lead to wrongconclusions on the details of the electron acceleration and/or on the csmradial density profile. in this paper, we study how electron cooling modifiesthe flux-density decay rate of rsne for a set of plausible/realistic values ofthe magnetic field and for different expansion regimes. we use these results toestimate the magnetic fields of different rsne observed to date and comparethem to those obtained by assuming energy equipartition between particles andmagnetic fields. for some of the best monitored rsne, for which decelerationmeasurements, optically thin spectral index, and power-law time decay have beenobserved (sn\,1979c, sn\,1986j, sn\,1993j, and sn\,2008iz), we findself-consistent solutions for the index of the power-law circumstellar densityprofile ($s=2$ for all cases), the index of the power-law relativistic electronpopulation (rather steep values, $ p = 2.3 - 3.0$) and the initial magneticfield (ranging from $\sim 20$ to $&gt; 100$\,g).

1103.0477	searches for dark matter annihilation signatures in the segue 1  satellite galaxy with the magic-i telescope	we report the results of the observation of the nearby satellite galaxy segue1 performed by the magic-i ground-based gamma-ray telescope between november2008 and march 2009 for a total of 43.2 hours. no significant gamma-rayemission was found above the background. differential upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived assuming various power-law slopes for the possibleemission spectrum. integral upper limits are also calculated for severalpower-law spectra and for different energy thresholds. the values are of theorder of 10^{-11} ph cm^{-2}$ s^{-1} above 100 gev and 10^{-12} ph cm^{-2}s^{-1} above 200 gev. segue 1 is currently considered one of the mostinteresting targets for indirect dark matter searches. in these terms, theupper limits have been also interpreted in the context of annihilating darkmatter particles. for such purpose, we performed a grid scan over a reasonableportion of the parameter space for the minimal supergravity model and computedthe flux upper limit for each point separately, taking fully into account thepeculiar spectral features of each model. we found that in order to match theexperimental upper limits with the model predictions, a minimum flux boost of10^{3} is required, and that the upper limits are quite dependent on the shapeof the gamma-ray energy spectrum predicted by each specific model. finally wecompared the upper limits with the predictions of some dark matter models ableto explain the pamela rise in the positron ratio, finding that segue 1 data arein tension with the dark matter explanation of the pamela spectrum in the caseof a dark matter candidate annihilating into tau+tau-. a complete exclusionhowever is not possible due to the uncertainties in the segue 1 astrophysicalfactor.

1103.4534	extragalactic background light inferred from aegis galaxy sed-type  fractions	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is of fundamental importance bothfor understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for gamma-rayastronomy. however, the overall spectrum of the ebl between 0.1 and 1000microns has never been determined directly neither from observed luminosityfunctions (lfs), over a wide redshift range, nor from any multiwavelengthobservation of galaxy spectral energy distributions (seds). the evolving,overall spectrum of the ebl is derived here utilizing a novel method based onobservations only. the changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forminggalaxies, starburst galaxies and active galactic nucleus (agn) galaxies fromredshift 0.2 to 1 are estimated, and two alternative extrapolations of sedtypes to higher redshifts are considered. this allows calculation of theevolving ebl. the ebl uncertainties in our modelling based directly on the dataare quantified, and their consequences for attenuation of very-high-energygamma-rays due to pair production on the ebl are discussed. it is concludedthat the ebl seems well constrained from the uv to the mid-ir at an intensitylevel roughly matching galaxy count data. independent efforts from ir andgamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in thefar-ir.

1103.5677	a search for very high energy gamma-ray emission from scorpius x-1 with  the magic telescopes	the acceleration of particles up to gev or higher energies in microquasarshas been the subject of considerable theoretical and observational efforts inthe past few years. sco x-1 is a microquasar from which evidence of highlyenergetic particles in the jet has been found when it is in the so-calledhorizontal branch (hb), a state when the radio and hard x-ray fluxes are higherand a powerful relativistic jet is present. here we present the first very highenergy gamma-ray observations of sco x-1 obtained with the magic telescopes. ananalysis of the whole dataset does not yield a significant signal, with 95% clflux upper limits above 300 gev at the level of 2.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s.simultaneous rxte observations were conducted to search for tev emission duringparticular x-ray states of the source. a selection of the gamma-ray dataobtained during the hb based on the x-ray colors did not yield a signal either,with an upper limit of 3.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s. these upper limits place aconstraint on the maximum tev luminosity to non-thermal x-ray luminosity ofl_{vhe}/l_{ntx}&lt;0.02, that can be related to a maximum tev luminosity to jetpower ratio of l_{vhe}/l_{j}&lt;10^{-3}. our upper limits indicate that theunderlying high-energy emission physics in sco x-1 must be inherently differentfrom that of the hitherto detected gamma-ray binaries.

1105.3458	a model for the thermal radio-continuum emission from radiative shocks  in colliding stellar winds	aims. the interaction of two isotropic stellar winds is studied in order tocalculate the free-free emission from the wind collision region. the effects ofthe binary separation and the wind momentum ratio on the emission from thewind-wind interaction region are investigated. methods. we developed asemi-analytical model for calculating the thermal emission from collidingstellar winds. assuming radiative shocks for the compressed layer, which areexpected in close binaries, we obtained the emission measure of the thin shell.then, we computed the total optical depth along each line of sight to obtainthe emission from the whole configuration. results. here, we presentpredictions of the free-free emission at radio frequencies from analytic,radiative shock models in colliding wind binaries. it is shown that theemission from the wind collision region mainly arises from the optically thickregion of the compressed layer and scales as ~ d^{4/5}, where d is the binaryseparation. the predicted flux density from the wind collision region becomesmore important as the frequency increases, showing higher spectral indices thanthe expected 0.6 value from the unshocked winds. we also investigate theemission from short-period wr+o systems calculated with our analyticformulation. in particular, we apply the model to the binary systems wr 98 andwr 113 and compare our results with the observations. our theoretical resultsare in good agreement with the observed thermal spectra from these sources.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1107.0704	detection of jet precession in the active nucleus of m81	(see the complete and formatted abstract in the paper). we report on vlbimonitoring of the low-luminosity agn (llagn) in m81 at 1.7, 2.3, 5, and 8.4ghz.these observations are phase-referenced to the supernova sn1993j (located inthe same galaxy) and cover from late 1993 to late 2005. the source consists atall frequencies of a slightly resolved core and a small jet extension towardsthe north-east direction (position angle of ~65 degrees) in agreement withprevious publications. we find that the position of the intensity peak in theimages at 8.4ghz is very stable in the galactic frame of m81 (proper motionupper limit about 0.010 mas per year). we confirm previous reports that thepeaks at all frequencies are systematically shifted among them, possibly due toopacity effects in the jet as predicted by the standard relativistic jet model.we use this model to estimate the magnetic field in the jet and the mass of thecentral black hole. we obtain a black-hole mass of ~2.e+7 solar masses,comparable to estimates previously reported, but the magnetic fields obtainedare thousands of times lower than previous estimates. we find that thepositions of the cores at 1.7, 2.3, and 5ghz are less stable than that at8.4ghz and evolve systematically, shifting southward at a rate of several tensof micro-arcsec per year. the evolution in the jet orientation seems to berelated to changes in the inclination of the cores at all frequencies. theseresults can be interpreted as due to a precessing jet. the jet precession alsoseems to be related to a flare in the flux densities at 5.0 and 8.4ghz, whichlasts ~4 years. a continued monitoring of the flux density and the jetstructure evolution in this llagn will be necessary to further confirm our jetprecession model.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1109.6124	phase-resolved energy spectra of the crab pulsar in the range of 50-400  gev measured with the magic telescopes	we use 73 h of stereoscopic data taken with the magic telescopes toinvestigate the very high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission of the crab pulsar.our data show a highly significant pulsed signal in the energy range from 50 to400 gev in both the main pulse (p1) and the interpulse (p2) phase regions. weprovide the widest spectra to date of the vhe components of both peaks, andthese spectra extend to the energy range of satellite-borne observatories. thegood resolution and background rejection of the stereoscopic magic systemallows us to cross-check the correctness of each spectral point of the pulsarby comparison with the corresponding (strong and well-known) crab nebula flux.the spectra of both p1 and p2 are compatible with power laws with photonindices of 4.0 \pm 0.8 (p1) and 3.42 \pm 0.26 (p2), respectively, and the ratiop1/p2 between the photon counts of the two pulses is 0.54 \pm 0.12. the vheemission can be understood as an additional component produced by the inversecompton scattering of secondary and tertiary e\pm pairs on ir-uv photons.

1111.4856	vlbi imaging of m81* at 43ghz	the nearby spiral galaxy m81 harbors in its core a low-luminosity agn(llagn), and appears closely related to the more distant and powerful agns seenin quasars and radio galaxies. the intrinsic size of this object is unknown dueto scattering, and it has shown a core-jet morphology with weak extendedemission rotating with wavelength. the proximity of m\,81 (d=3.63 mpc) allows adetailed investigation of its nucleus to be made. the nucleus is four orders ofmagnitude more luminous than the galactic centre, and is therefore considered alink between sgra* and the more powerful nuclei of radio galaxies and quasars.our main goal was to determine the size of m81* at a shorter wavelength thusdirectly testing whether the frequency-size dependent law theta proptonu^(-0.8) was still valid for wavelengths shorter than 1cm. in addition, wealso aimed to confirm the rotation of the source as a function of frequency. weobserved the continuum 7mm radio emission of m81* using the very long baselinearray on sep 13, 2002, using nearby calibrators to apply their interferometricobservables to the target source, to increase the chances of detection. thesource was detected on all baselines and hybrid mapping was possible. wepresent the first 7mm vlbi image of the core of m81*, which represents thehighest resolution image ever of this source. modeling the interferometricvisibilities with two gaussian functions sets constraints on the angular sizeof its core down to 38 microarcseconds, corresponding to a maximum (projected)linear size of 138au, and shows extended emission towards the ne with aposition angle of ~50deg. a fit of one gaussian elliptical function yields aposition angle of 28+/-8 degrees for its elongated, compact structure.combining the 7mm size with earlier measurements at other frequencies wedetermine a frequency-size dependence of theta propto nu^(-0.88+/-0.04).

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1205.2257	e-merlin and vlbi observations of the luminous infrared galaxy ic883: a  nuclear starburst and an agn candidate revealed	the high star formation rates of luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) make themideal places for core-collapse supernova (ccsn) searches. at radio frequencies,free from dust extinction, it is possible to detect compact components withinthe innermost lirg nuclear regions, such as sne and sn remnants, as well as agnburied deep in the lirg nuclei. we studied the lirg ic883 aiming at: (i)investigating its (circum-)nuclear regions using the e-evn at 5ghz, ande-merlin at 6.9ghz, complemented by archival vlbi data; (ii) detecting at radiofrequencies the two recently reported circumnuclear sne 2010cu and 2011hi,which were discovered by near-ir (nir) adaptive optics observations of ic883;and (iii) further investigating the nature of sn2011hi at nir by means ofobservations with gemini-north. the circumnuclear regions traced by e-merlin at6.9ghz have an extension of ~1kpc, and show a striking double-sided structure,which very likely corresponds to a warped rotating ring, in agreement withprevious studies. our e-evn observations at 5ghz and complementary archivalvlbi data at 5ghz and 8.4ghz, reveal the presence of various milliarcseccompact components in the nucleus of ic883. a single compact source, an agncandidate, dominates the emission at both nuclear and circumnuclear scales, asimaged with the e-evn and e-merlin, respectively. the other milliarcseccomponents are very suggestive of ongoing nuclear ccsn activity. our e-evnobservations also resulted in upper limits to the radio luminosity of the twosne in ic883 recently discovered at nir. we refine the classification ofsn2011hi as a type iip sn according to our latest gemini-north epoch from 2012,in agreement with a low-luminosity radio sn nature. we estimate a ccsn ratelower limit of 1.1_{-0.6}^{+1.3} yr^{-1} for the entire galaxy, based on threenuclear radio sne and the circumnuclear sne 2010cu and 2011hi.

1206.1314	core-collapse supernovae missed by optical surveys	we estimate the fraction of core-collapse supernovae (ccsne) that remainundetected by optical sn searches due to obscuration by large amounts of dustin their host galaxies. this effect is especially important in luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies, which are locally rare but dominate the starformation at redshifts of z~1-2. we perform a detailed investigation of the snactivity in the nearby luminous infrared galaxy arp 299 and estimate that up to83% of the sne in arp 299 and in similar galaxies in the local universe aremissed by observations at optical wavelengths. for rest-frame optical surveyswe find the fraction of sne missed due to high dust extinction to increase fromthe average local value of ~19% to ~38% at z~1.2 and then stay roughly constantup to z~2. it is therefore crucial to take into account the effects ofobscuration by dust when determining sn rates at high redshift and whenpredicting the number of ccsne detectable by future high-z surveys such aslsst, jwst, and euclid. for a sample of nearby ccsne (distances 6-15 mpc)detected during the last 12 yr, we find a lower limit for the local ccsn rateof 1.5 +0.4/-0.3 x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^-3, consistent with that expected from thestar formation rate. even closer, at distances less than ~6 mpc, we find asignificant increase in the ccsn rate, indicating a local overdensity of starformation caused by a small number of galaxies that have each hosted multiplesne.

1207.2147	magic observations of the giant radio galaxy m87 in a low-emission state  between 2005 and 2007	we present the results of a long m87 monitoring campaign in very high energy$\gamma$-rays with the magic-i cherenkov telescope. we aim to model thepersistent non-thermal jet emission by monitoring and characterizing the veryhigh energy $\gamma$-ray emission of m87 during a low state. a total of 150\,hof data were taken between 2005 and 2007 with the single magic-i telescope, outof which 128.6\,h survived the data quality selection. we also collected datain the x-ray and \textit{fermi}--lat bands from the literature (partiallycontemporaneous). no flaring activity was found during the campaign. the sourcewas found to be in a persistent low-emission state, which was at a confidencelevel of $7\sigma$. we present the spectrum between 100\,gev and 2\,tev, whichis consistent with a simple power law with a photon index $\gamma=2.21\pm0.21$and a flux normalization at 300\,gev of $(7.7\pm1.3) \times 10^{-8}$ tev$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$. the extrapolation of the magic spectrum into the gev energyrange matches the previously published \textit{fermi}--lat spectrum well,covering a combined energy range of four orders of magnitude with the samespectral index. we model the broad band energy spectrum with a spine layermodel, which can satisfactorily describe our data.

1405.4702	constraints on the progenitor system and the environs of sn 2014j from  deep radio observations	we report deep evn and emerlin observations of the type ia sn 2014j in thenearby galaxy m 82. our observations represent, together with jvla observationsof sne 2011fe and 2014j, the most sensitive radio studies of type ia sne ever.by combining data and a proper modeling of the radio emission, we constrain themass-loss rate from the progenitor system of sn 2014j to $\dot{m} \lesssim7.0\times 10^{-10}\, {\rm m_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}}$ (3-$\sigma$; for a wind speedof $100\, {\rm km s^{-1}}$). if the medium around the supernova is uniform,then $n_{\rm ism} \lesssim 1.3 {\rm cm^3}$ (3-$\sigma$), which is the moststringent limit for the (uniform) density around a type ia sn. our deep upperlimits favor a double-degenerate (dd) scenario--involving two wd stars--for theprogenitor system of sn 2014j, as such systems have less circumstellar gas thanour upper limits. by contrast, most single-degenerate (sd) scenarios, i.e., thewide family of progenitor systems where a red giant, main-sequence, orsub-giant star donates mass to a exploding wd, are ruled out by ourobservations. our estimates on the limits to the gas density surrounding sn2011fe, using the flux density limits from chomiuk et al. (2012), agree wellwith their results. although we discuss possibilities for a sd scenario to passobservational tests, as well as uncertainties in the modeling of the radioemission, the evidence from sne 2011fe and 2014j points in the direction of add scenario for both.

1509.07512	excitation mechanisms for hcn (1-0) and hco+ (1-0) in galaxies from the  great observatories all-sky lirg survey	we present new iram 30m spectroscopic observations of the $\sim88$ ghz band,including emission from the cch (n=1-0) multiplet, hcn (1-0), hco+ (1-0), andhnc (1-0), for a sample of 58 local luminous and ultraluminous infraredgalaxies from the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). by combiningour new iram data with literature data and spitzer/irs spectroscopy, we studythe correspondence between these putative tracers of dense gas and the relativecontribution of active galactic nuclei (agn) and star formation to themid-infrared luminosity of each system. we find the hcn (1-0) emission to beenhanced in agn-dominated systems ($\langle$l'$_{hcn (1-0)}$/l'$_{hco^+(1-0)}\rangle=1.84$), compared to composite and starburst-dominated systems($\langle$l'$_{hcn (1-0)}$/l'$_{hco^+ (1-0)}\rangle=1.14$, and 0.88,respectively). however, some composite and starburst systems have l'$_{hcn(1-0)}$/l'$_{hco^+ (1-0)}$ ratios comparable to those of agn, indicating thatenhanced hcn emission is not uniquely associated with energetically dominantagn. after removing agn-dominated systems from the sample, we find a linearrelationship (within the uncertainties) between $\log_{10}$(l'$_{hcn (1-0)}$)and $\log_{10}$(l$_{ir}$), consistent with most previous findings. l'$_{hcn(1-0)}$/l$_{ir}$, typically interpreted as the dense gas depletion time,appears to have no systematic trend with l$_{ir}$ for our sample of luminousand ultraluminous infrared galaxies, and has significant scatter. thegalaxy-integrated hcn (1-0) and hco+ (1-0) emission do not appear to have asimple interpretation, in terms of the agn dominance or the star formationrate, and are likely determined by multiple processes, including density andradiative effects.

astro-ph;0010611	on the way to global phase-delay astrometry	the use of the phase-delay improves substantially the accuracy obtained invlbi astrometry with respect to the group-delay observable. recently, ros etal.

astro-ph;0106177	the role of synchrotron self-absorption in the late radio emission of  sn1993j	the standard model for radio supernovae considers that the observedsynchrotron radio emission arises from the high-energy shell that results fromthe strong interaction between the expanding supernova ejecta and thecircumstellar medium. this emission is considered to be only partially absorbedby ionized thermal electrons in the circumstellar wind of the progenitor star.based on a study of the radio light curves of the type ii supernova sn1993j, wepresent evidence of synchrotron self-absorption. our modeling of the radiolight curves requires a large initial magnetic field, of about 30 gauss, andthe existence of an (initially) highly-relativistic population of electrons. wealso show that while at early epochs the dominant absorption mechanism isexternal absorption by thermal electrons, at late epochs and long wavelengthsthe dominant absorption mechanism is synchrotron self-absorption. consequently,the spectral turnover takes place at much shorter wavelengths than expected inthe standard model, and at long wavelengths (greater than about 90cm at currentepochs) the flux predictions depart substantially from those of the standardmodel.

astro-ph;0201206	strongly decelerated expansion of sn1979c	we observed sn1979c in m100 on 4 june 1999, about twenty years afterexplosion, with a very sensitive four-antenna vlbi array at the wavelength of18cm. the distance to m100 and the expansion velocities are such that thesupernova cannot be fully resolved by our earth-wide array. model-dependentsizes for the source have been determined and compared with previous results.we conclude that the supernova shock was initially in free expansion for 6 +/-2 yrs and then experienced a very strong deceleration. the onset ofdeceleration took place a few years before the abrupt trend change in theintegrated radio flux density curves. we estimate the shocked swept-up mass tobe about 1.6 solar masses, assuming a standard density profile for the csm.such a swept-up mass for sn1979c suggests a mass of the hydrogen-rich envelopeejected at explosion no larger than $m_{\rm env} \sim$ 0.9 solar masses. ifsn1979c originated in a binary star the low value of m_env suggests that thecompanion of the progenitor star stripped off most of the hydrogen-richenvelope mass of the presupernova star prior to the explosion.

astro-ph;0202514	a distorted radio shell in the young supernova sn1986j	we report here on 5 ghz global very-long-baseline interferometry (vlbi)observations of sn 1986j, 16 yr after its explosion. we obtained ahigh-resolution image of the supernova, which shows a distorted shell of radioemission, indicative of a deformation of the shock front. the angular size ofthe shell is $\sim4.7 {\rm mas}$, corresponding to a linear size of $\sim6.8\times 10^{17} {\rm cm}$ for a distance of 9.6 mpc to ngc 891. the averagespeed of the shell has decreased from $\sim$7400 \kms in 1988.74 down to about$6300 {\rm km s^{-1}}$ in 1999.14, indicative of a mild deceleration in theexpansion of sn 1986j. assuming a standard density profile for the progenitorwind ($\rho_{\rm cs} \propto r^{-s}, s=2$), the swept-up mass by the shockfront is $\sim$2.2\ms. this large swept-up mass, coupled with the milddeceleration suffered by the supernova, suggests that the mass of thehydrogen-rich envelope ejected at explosion was $\ga12$ \ms. thus, thesupernova progenitor must have kept intact most of its hydrogen-rich envelopeby the time of explosion, which favours a single, massive star progenitorscenario. we find a flux density for sn 1986j of $\sim$7.2 mjy at the observingfrequency of 5 ghz, which results in a radio luminosity of $\sim1.4 \times10^{37} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$ for the frequency range $10^7$--$10^{10}$ hz ($\alpha=-0.69; s_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha})$. we detect four bright knots thatdelineate the shell structure, and an absolute minimum of emission, which wetentatively identify with the centre of the supernova explosion. if this is thecase, sn 1986j has then suffered an asymmetric expansion. we suggest that thisasymmetry is due to the collision of the supernova ejecta with an anisotropic,clumpy (or filamentary) medium.
