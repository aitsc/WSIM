0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1001.0572	frequency of solar-like systems and of ice and gas giants beyond the  snow line from high-magnification microlensing events in 2005-2008	we present the first measurement of planet frequency beyond the "snow line"for planet/star mass-ratios[-4.5&lt;log q&lt;-2]: d^2 n/dlog q/dlogs=(0.36+-0.15)/dex^2 at mean mass ratio q=5e-4, and consistent with being flatin log projected separation, s. our result is based on a sample of 6 planetsdetected from intensive follow-up of high-mag (a&gt;200) microlensing eventsduring 2005-8. the sample host stars have typical mass m_host 0.5 msun, anddetection is sensitive to planets over a range of projected separations(r_e/s_max,r_e*s_max), where r_e 3.5 au sqrt(m_host/msun) is the einsteinradius and s_max (q/5e-5)^{2/3}, corresponding to deprojected separations ~3times the "snow line". though frenetic, the observations constitute a"controlled experiment", which permits measurement of absolute planetfrequency. high-mag events are rare, but the high-mag channel is efficient:half of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yieldedplanet detections. the planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7larger than from rv studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2&lt;p&lt;2000 days].however, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived fromrv studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it ismeasured). this suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex insemi-major axis, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass. finally, if allplanetary systems were "analogs" of the solar system, our sample would haveyielded 18.2 planets (11.4 "jupiters", 6.4 "saturns", 0.3 "uranuses", 0.2"neptunes") including 6.1 systems with 2 or more planet detections. thiscompares to 6 planets including one 2-planet system in the actual sample,implying a first estimate of 1/6 for the frequency of solar-like systems.

1004.5247	the ogle view of microlensing towards the magellanic clouds. ii. ogle-ii  smc data	the primary goal of this paper is to provide the evidence that can eitherprove or falsify the hypothesis that dark matter in the galactic halo can clumpinto stellar-mass compact objects. if such objects existed, they would act aslenses to external sources in the magellanic clouds, giving rise to anobservable effect of microlensing. we present the results of our search forsuch events, based on the data from the second phase of the ogle survey(1996-2000) towards the smc. the data set we used is comprised of 2.1 millionmonitored sources distributed over an area of 2.4 square degrees. we found onlyone microlensing event candidate, however its poor quality light curve limitedour discussion on the exact distance to the lensing object.  given a single event, taking the blending (crowding of stars) into accountfor the detection efficiency simulations, and deriving the hst-corrected numberof monitored stars, the microlensing optical depth is tau=(1.55+-1.55)10e-7.this result is consistent with the expected smc self-lensing signal, with noneed of introducing dark matter microlenses. rejecting the unconvincing eventleads to the upper limit on the fraction of dark matter in the form of machosto f&lt;20 per cent for deflectors' masses around 0.4 msun and f&lt;11 per cent formasses between 0.003 and 0.2 msun (95 per cent confidence limit). our resultindicates that the milky way's dark matter is unlikely to be clumpy and formcompact objects in the sub-solar-mass range.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1109.5699	discovery of period doubling in bl herculis stars of the ogle survey.  observations and theoretical models	we report the discovery of a period doubling behaviour in a 2.4d blherculis-type variable of the galactic bulge. another bulge bl her-type star(p=2.25d) is a strong period doubling candidate. both objects have beenidentified with the ogle-iii photometry. possibility of period doubling in thistype of pulsators has been predicted almost twenty years ago by buchler &amp;moskalik. our finding is the first observational confirmation of theirtheoretical results.  discovery of the first bl herculis star showing the period doubling effectmotivates a new theoretical investigation with the state-of-the-art convectivepulsation codes. we present the results of initial model survey, specificallyaimed at studying the observed period-doubled bl her variable. all of ournon-linear models have p=2.4d. the computations confirm that the perioddoubling effect is caused by the 3:2 resonance between the fundamental mode andthe first overtone, as indicated by earlier radiative models of buchler &amp;moskalik. comparison of the computed and the observed light curves allows toconstrain the parameters of the star, in particular its metallicity, whichappears to be high, z is approximately 0.01. the recent evolutionary tracks putalso constraint on the mass of the star, which is close to m=0.50 solar masses.

0710.2780	the optical gravitational lensing experiment. period-luminosity  relations of variable red giant stars	period-luminosity (pl) relations of variable red giants in the large (lmc)and small magellanic clouds (smc) are presented. the pl diagrams are plotted inthree planes: logp-k_s, logp-w_{jk}, and logp-w_i. fourteen pl sequences aredistinguishable, and some of them consist of three closely spaced ridges. eachof the sequences is fitted with a linear or quadratic function. thesimilarities and differences between the pl relations in both galaxies arediscussed for four types of red giant variability: ogle small amplitude redgiants (osargs), miras and semiregular variables (srvs), long secondary periods(lsps) and ellipsoidal variables. we propose a new method of separating osargsfrom non-variable stars and srvs. the method employs the position in thereddening-free pl diagrams and the characteristic period ratios of thesemultiperiodic variables. the pl relations for the lmc osarg are compared withthe calculated relations for rgb models along isochrones of relevant ages andmetallicities. we also compare measured periods and amplitudes of the osargswith predictions based on the relations valid for less luminous solar-likepulsators. miras and srvs seem to follow pl relation of the same slopes in thelmc and smc, while for lsp and ellipsoidal variables slopes in both galaxiesare different. the pl sequences defined by lsp variables and binary systemsoverlap in the whole range of analyzed wavebands. we put forward new argumentsfor the binary star scenario as an explanation of the lsp variability andelaborate on it further. the measured pulsation to orbital period ratio impliesnearly constant ratio of the star radius to orbital distance, r/a=0.4, as wefind. combined effect of tidal friction and mass loss enhanced by the low-masscompanion may explain why such a value is preferred.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1412.4121	deciphering the 3d structure of the old galactic bulge from the ogle rr  lyrae stars	we have analyzed a sample of 27,258 fundamental-mode rr lyrae variable stars(type rrab) detected recently toward the galactic bulge by the opticalgravitational lensing experiment (ogle) survey. the data support our earlierclaim that these metal-poor stars trace closely the barred structure formed ofintermediate-age red clump giants. the distance to the galactic center (gc)inferred from the bulge rr lyrae stars is r_0=8.27+/-0.01(stat)+/-0.40(sys)kpc. we show that their spatial distribution has the shape of a triaxialellipsoid with an major axis located in the galactic plane and inclined at anangle of i=20+/-3 deg to the sun-gc line of sight. the obtained scale-lengthratio of the major axis to the minor axis in the galactic plane and to the axisvertical to the plane is 1:0.49(2):0.39(2). we do not see the evidence for thebulge rr lyrae stars forming an x-shaped structure. based on the light curveparameters, we derive metallicities of the rrab variables and show that thereis a very mild but statistically significant radial metallicity gradient. about60% of the bulge rrab stars form two very close sequences on theperiod-amplitude (or bailey) diagram, which we interpret as two major old bulgepopulations: a and b. their metallicities likely differ. population a is aboutfour times less abundant than the slightly more metal-poor population b. mostof the remaining stars seem to represent other, even more metal-poorpopulations of the bulge. the presence of multiple old populations indicatesthat the milky way bulge was initially formed through mergers.

1504.08224	ogle atlas of classical novae i. galactic bulge objects	eruptions of classical novae are possible sources of lithium formation andgamma-ray emission. nova remnants can also become type ia supernovae (sne ia).the contribution of novae to these phenomena depends on nova rates, which arenot well established for the galaxy. here, we directly measure a galactic bulgenova rate of $13.8 \pm 2.6$ per year. this measurement is much more accuratethan any previous measurement of this kind thanks to many years' monitoring ofthe bulge by the optical gravitational lensing experiment (ogle) survey. oursample consists of 39 novae eruptions, $\sim$1/3 of which are ogle-baseddiscoveries. this long-term monitoring allows us to not only measure the novarate but also to study in detail the light curves of 39 eruptions and more than80 post-nova candidates. we measured orbital periods for 9 post-novae and 9novae, and in 14 cases we procured the first estimates. the ogle survey is verysensitive to the frequently erupting recurrent novae. we did not find anyobject similar to m31 2008-12a, which erupts once a year. the lack of detectionindicates that there is only a small number of them in the galactic bulge.

0806.0025	a low-mass planet with a possible sub-stellar-mass host in microlensing  event moa-2007-blg-192	we report the detection of an extrasolar planet of mass ratio q ~ 2 x 10^(-4)in microlensing event moa-2007-blg-192. the best fit microlensing model showsboth the microlensing parallax and finite source effects, and these can becombined to obtain the lens masses of m = 0.060 (+0.028 -0.021) m_sun for theprimary and m = 3.3 (+4.9 -1.6) m_earth for the planet. however, theobservational coverage of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, andthe radius of the source was estimated without the benefit of a source starcolor measurement. as a result, the 2-sigma limits on the mass ratio and finitesource measurements are weak. nevertheless, the microlensing parallax signalclearly favors a sub-stellar mass planetary host, and the measurement of finitesource effects in the light curve supports this conclusion. adaptive opticsimages taken with the very large telescope (vlt) naco instrument are consistentwith a lens star that is either a brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of themain sequence. follow-up vlt and/or hubble space telescope (hst) observationswill either confirm that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-masslens star and enable a precise determination of its mass. in either case, thelens star, moa-2007-blg-192l, is the lowest mass primary known to have acompanion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet, moa-2007-blg-192lb, isprobably the lowest mass exoplanet found to date, aside from the lowest masspulsar planet.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

(2004b), which combines light-curve analysis with priorsfrom a galactic model of the source and lens populations, to take account offinite-source effects. this is the first event so analyzed for whichfinite-source effects are important, and hence we develop two new techniquesfor evaluating these effects. somewhat surprisingly, we find thatogle-2004-blg-343 is no more sensitive to planets than two previously analyzedevents with a_{max}~100, despite the fact that it was observed at ~12 timeshigher magnification. however, we show that had the event been observed overits peak, it would have been sensitive to almost all neptune-mass planets overa factor of 5 of projected separation and even would have had some sensitivityto earth-mass planets. this shows that some microlensing events being detectedin current experiments are sensitive to very low-mass planets. we also givesuggestions on how extremely high-magnification events can be more promptlymonitored in the future.
