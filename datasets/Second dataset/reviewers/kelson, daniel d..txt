0706.3894	the initial-final mass relation: direct constraints at the low mass end	the initial-final mass relation represents a mapping between the mass of awhite dwarf remnant and the mass that the hydrogen burning main-sequence starthat created it once had. the relation thus far has been constrained using asample of ~40 stars in young open clusters, ranging in initial mass from ~2.75-- 7 msun, and shows a general trend that connects higher mass main-sequencestars with higher mass white dwarfs. in this paper, we present cfht/cfh12kphotometric and keck/lris multiobject spectroscopic observations of a sample of22 white dwarfs in two older open clusters, ngc 7789 (t = 1.4 gyr) and ngc 6819(t = 2.5 gyr). we measure masses for the highest s/n spectra by fitting thebalmer lines to atmosphere models and place the first direct constraints on thelow mass end of the initial-final mass relation. our results indicate that theobserved general trend at higher masses continues down to low masses, withm_initial = 1.16 msun main-sequence stars forming m_final = 0.53 msun whitedwarfs (including our data from the very old open cluster, ngc 6791). thisextention of the relation represents a four fold increase in the total numberof hydrogen burning stars for which the integrated mass loss can now becalculated, assuming a salpeter initial mass function. the new leverage at thelow mass end is used to derive a purely empirical initial-final mass relationwithout the need for any indirectly derived anchor points. the sample of whitedwarfs in these clusters also shows several very interesting systems that wediscuss further: a db (helium atmosphere) white dwarf, a magnetic white dwarf,a dab (mixed hydrogen/helium atmosphere or a double degenerate da+db) whitedwarf(s), and two possible equal mass da double degenerate binary systems.

0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0910.0837	the dependence of star formation rates on stellar mass and environment  at z~0.8	we examine the star formation rates (sfrs) of galaxies in a redshift sliceencompassing the z=0.834 cluster rx j0152.7-1357. we used a low-dispersionprism in the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph (imacs) to identifygalaxies with z&lt;23.3 ab mag in diverse environments around the cluster out toprojected distances of ~8 mpc from the cluster center. we utilize amass-limited sample (m&gt;2x10^{10} m_sun) of 330 galaxies that were imaged byspitzer mips at 24 micron to derive sfrs and study the dependence of specificsfr (ssfr) on stellar mass and environment. we find that the sfr and ssfr showa strong decrease with increasing local density, similar to the relation atz~0. our result contrasts with other work at z~1 that find the sfr-densitytrend to reverse for luminosity-limited samples. these other results appear tobe driven by star-formation in lower mass systems (m~10^{10} m_sun). ourresults imply that the processes that shut down star-formation are present ingroups and other dense regions in the field. our data also suggest that thelower sfrs of galaxies in higher density environments may reflect a change inthe ratio of star-forming to non-star-forming galaxies, rather than a change insfrs. as a consequence, the sfrs of star-forming galaxies, in environmentsranging from small groups to clusters, appear to be similar and largelyunaffected by the local processes that truncate star-formation at z~0.8.

1003.1420	the mid-infrared luminosities of normal galaxies over cosmic time	modern population synthesis models estimate that 50% of the restframe k-bandlight is produced by tp-agb stars during the first gyr of a stellar population,with a substantial fraction continuing to be produced by the tp-agb over ahubble time. between 0.2 and 1.5 gyr, intermediate mass stars evolve intotp-agb c stars which, due to significant amounts of circumstellar dust, emithalf their energy in the mid-ir. we combine these results using publishedmid-ir colors of galactic tp-agb m and c stars to construct simple models forexploring the contribution of the tp-agb to 24micron data as a function ofstellar population age. we compare these empirical models with an ensemble ofgalaxies in the cdfs from z=0 to z=2, and with high quality imaging in m81.within the uncertainties, the tp-agb appears responsible for a substantialfraction of the mid-ir luminosities of galaxies from z=0 to z=2, the maximumredshift to which we can test our hypothesis, while, at the same time, ourmodels reproduce much of the detailed structure observed in mid-ir imaging ofm81. the mid-ir is a good diagnostic of star formation over timescales of ~1.5gyr, but this implies that on-going star formation rates at z=1 may beoverestimated by factors of ~1.5-6, depending on the nature of star formationevents. our results, if confirmed through subsequent work, have strongimplications for the star formation rate density of the universe and the growthof stellar mass over time.

1101.0812	a multi-wavelength study of low redshift clusters of galaxies i.  comparison of x-ray and mid-infrared selected agns	clusters of galaxies have long been used as laboratories for the study ofgalaxy evolution, but despite intense, recent interest in feedback between agnsand their hosts, the impact of environment on these relationships remainspoorly constrained. we present results from a study of agns and their hostgalaxies found in low-redshift galaxy clusters. we fit model spectral energydistributions (seds) to the combined visible and mid-infrared (mir) photometryof cluster members and use these model seds to determine stellar masses andstar-formation rates (sfrs). we identify two populations of agns, the firstbased on their x-ray luminosities (x-ray agns) and the second based on thepresence of a significant agn component in their model seds (ir agns). we findthat the two agn populations are nearly disjoint; only 8 out of 44 agns areidentified with both techniques. we further find that ir agns are hosted bygalaxies with similar masses and sfrs but higher specific sfrs (ssfrs) thanx-ray agn hosts. the relationship between agn accretion and host star-formationin cluster agn hosts shows no significant difference compared to therelationship between field agns and their hosts. the projected radialdistributions of both agn populations are consistent with the distribution ofother cluster members. we argue that the apparent dichotomy between x-ray andir agns can be understood as a combination of differing extinction due to coldgas in the host galaxies of the two classes of agns and the presence of weakstar-formation in x-ray agn hosts.

1104.3597	kinematics of gas in lyman alpha nebulae	exploring the origin of ly-alpha nebulae (blobs) requires measurements oftheir gas kinematics that are impossible with only the resonant,optically-thick lya line. to define gas motions relative to the systemicvelocity of the blob, the lya line must be compared with an optically-thin linelike halpha, which is not much altered by radiative transfer effects. we obtainoptical and nir spectra of the two brightest lya blobs from yang et al. sampleusing the magellan/mage and vlt/sinfoni. both the lya and halpha lines confirmthat these blobs lie at the survey redshift, z~2.3. within each blob, we detectseveral halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in hstimages. the halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internalvelocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (lab01), theirvelocity difference is ~440 km/s. the presence of multiple galaxies within theblobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relativemotion, is consistent with our previous finding that lya blobs inhabit massivedark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.to determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantlyinfalling or outflowing, we compare the lya and halpha line centers, findingthat lya is not offset (delta lya = +0km/s) in lab01 and redshifted by only+230 km/s in lab02. these offsets are small compared to those of lyman breakgalaxies, which average +450 km/s and extend to about +700 km/s. we test andrule out the simplest infall models and those outflow models withsuper/hyper-winds, which require large outflow velocities. because of theunknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiplesources of lya emission embedded in the blobs, a larger sample and moresophisticated models are required to test more complex or a wider range ofinfall and outflow scenarios.

1107.3147	the uvj selection of quiescent and star forming galaxies: separating  early and late-type galaxies and isolating edge-on spirals	we utilize for the first time hst acs imaging to examine the structuralproperties of galaxies in the rest-frame u-v versus v-j diagram (i.e., the uvjdiagram) using a sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.9 that reaches a low stellar mass limit (logm/msun&gt;10.25). the use of the uvj diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescentgalaxies from star forming galaxies (sfgs) is becoming more common due to itsability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened sfgs. quiescentgalaxies occupy a small and distinct region of uvj color space and we find mostof them to have concentrated profiles with high sersic indices (n&gt;2.5) andsmooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. sfgs populate a broad,but well-defined sequence of uvj colors and are comprised of objects with a mixof sersic indices. interestingly, most uvj-selected sfgs with high sersicindices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of then&lt;2.5 sfgs and late-type systems. finally, we find that the position of a sfgon the sequence of uvj colors is determined to a large degree by the mass ofthe galaxy and its inclination. systems that are closer to edge-on generallydisplay redder colors and lower [oii]3727 luminosity per unit mass as aconsequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. we conclude that thetwo main features seen in uvj color space correspond closely to the traditionalmorphological classes of early and late-type galaxies.

1112.2691	first results from z-fourge: discovery of a candidate cluster at z = 2.2  in cosmos	we report the first results from the z-fourge survey: the discovery of acandidate galaxy cluster at z = 2.2 consisting of two compact overdensitieswith red galaxies detected at &gt;20{\sigma} above the mean surface density. thediscovery was made possible by a new deep (ks &lt; 24.8 ab 5{\sigma})magellan/fourstar near-ir imaging survey with 5 custom medium-bandwidthfilters. the filters pinpoint the location of the balmer/4000\aa\ break inevolved stellar populations at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, yielding significantly moreaccurate photometric redshifts than possible with broadband imaging alone. theoverdensities are within 1' of each other in the cosmos field and appear to beembedded in a larger structure that contains at least one additionaloverdensity (\sim10{\sigma}). considering the global properties of theoverdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of agalaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. a comparison to a large{\lambda}cdm simulation suggests that the system may consist of mergingsubclusters, with properties in between those of z &gt; 2 protoclusters with morediffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusterswith prominent red sequences. the structure is completely absent in publicoptical catalogs in cosmos and only weakly visible in a shallower near-irsurvey. the discovery showcases the potential of deep near-ir surveys withmedium-band filters to advance the understanding of environment and galaxyevolution at z &gt; 1.5.

1201.0783	the carnegie-spitzer-imacs redshift survey of galaxy evolution since  z=1.5: i. description and methodology	we describe the carnegie-spitzer-imacs (csi) survey, a wide-field, near-irselected spectrophotometric redshift survey with the inamori magellan arealcamera and spectrograph (imacs) on magellan-baade. by defining a flux-limitedsample of galaxies in spitzer 3.6micron imaging of swire fields, the csi surveyefficiently traces the stellar mass of average galaxies to z~1.5. this firstpaper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations, processing ofthe photometry and spectrophotometry. we also describe the processing of thedata: new methods of fitting synthetic templates of spectral energydistributions are used to derive redshifts, stellar masses, emission lineluminosities, and coarse information on recent star-formation. our uniquemethodology for analyzing low-dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prismsin imacs, combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the ir,has yielded 37,000 high quality redshifts in our first 5.3 sq.degs of the swirexmm-lss field. we use three different approaches to estimate our redshifterrors and find robust agreement. over the full range of 3.6micron fluxes ofour selection, we find typical uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) &lt; 0.015. incomparisons with previously published vvds redshifts, for example, we find ascatter of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.012 for galaxies at 0.8&lt; z&lt; 1.2. for galaxiesbrighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.009 andsigma_z/(1+z) = 0.025, respectively. notably, our low-dispersion spectroscopyand analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates forboth red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based systematics thatcan seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment.

1201.1009	a direct measurement of hierarchical growth in galaxy groups since z~1	we present the first measurement of the evolution of the galaxy group stellarmass function (grsmf) to redshift z&gt;~1 and low masses (m*&gt;10^12 msun). ourresults are based on early data from the carnegie-spitzer-imacs (csi) survey,utilizing low-resolution spectra and broadband optical/near-ir photometry tomeasure redshifts for a 3.6um selected sample of 37,000 galaxies over a 5.3deg^2 area to z~1.2. employing a standard friends-of-friends algorithm for allgalaxies more massive than log(m*/msun)=10.5, we find a total of ~4000 groups.correcting for spectroscopic incompleteness (including slit collisions), webuild cumulative stellar mass functions for these groups in redshift bins atz&gt;0.35, comparing to the z=0 and z&gt;0 mass functions from various group andcluster samples. our derived mass functions match up well with z&gt;0.35 x-rayselected clusters, and strong evolution is evident at all masses over the past8 gyr. given the already low level of star formation activity in galaxies atthese masses, we therefore attribute most of the observed growth in the grsmfto group-group and group-galaxy mergers, in accordance with qualitative notionsof hierarchical structure formation. given the factor 3-10 increase in thenumber density of groups and clusters with m*&gt;10^12 msun since z=1 and thestrong anticorrelation between star formation activity and environmentaldensity, this late-time growth in group-sized halos may therefore be animportant contributor to the structural and star-formation evolution of massivegalaxies over the past 8 gyr.

1202.5269	sgas 143845.1+145407: a big, cool starburst at redshift 0.816	we present the discovery and a detailed multi-wavelength study of astrongly-lensed luminous infrared galaxy at z=0.816. unlike most known lensedgalaxies discovered at optical or near-infrared wavelengths this lensed sourceis red, r-ks = 3.9 [ab], which the data presented here demonstrate is due toongoing dusty star formation. the overall lensing magnification (a factor of17) facilitates observations from the blue optical through to 500micron, fullycapturing both the stellar photospheric emission as well as the re-processedthermal dust emission. we also present optical and near-ir spectroscopy. theseextensive data show that this lensed galaxy is in many ways typical ofir-detected sources at z~1, with both a total luminosity and size in accordancewith other (albeit much less detailed) measurements in samples of galaxiesobserved in deep fields with the spitzer telescope. its far-infrared spectralenergy distribution is well-fit by local templates that are an order ofmagnitude less luminous than the lensed galaxy; local templates of comparableluminosity are too hot to fit. its size (d~7kpc) is much larger than localluminous infrared galaxies, but in line with sizes observed for such galaxiesat z~1. the star formation appears uniform across this spatial scale. in thissource, the luminosity of which is typical of sources that dominate the cosmicinfrared background, we find that star formation is spatially extended and wellorganised, quite unlike the compact merger-driven starbursts which are typicalfor sources of this luminosity at z~0.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

0704.3455	the distribution of agn in clusters of galaxies	we present a study of the distribution of agn in clusters of galaxies with auniformly selected, spectroscopically complete sample of 35 agn in eightclusters at z = 0.06 to 0.31. we find that the 12 agn with l_x &gt; 10^42 erg/s ingalaxies more luminous than a rest-frame m_r &lt; -20 mag are more centrallyconcentrated than typical cluster galaxies of this luminosity, although theseagn have comparable velocity and substructure distributions to other clustermembers. in contrast, a larger sample of 30 cluster agn with l_x &gt; 10^41 erg/sdo not show evidence for greater concentration than inactive members, norevidence for a different kinematic or substructure distribution. as we do seeclear differences in the spatial and kinematic distributions of the bluebutcher-oemler and red galaxy populations, any difference in the agn andinactive galaxy population must be less distinct than that between these twopairs of populations. comparison of the agn fraction selected via x-rayemission in this study to similarly-selected agn in the field indicates thatthe agn fraction is not significantly lower in clusters, contrary to agnidentified via visible-wavelength emission lines, but similar to theapproximately constant radio-selected agn fraction in clusters and the field.we also find significant evidence for variation between clusters and explorethe dependence of cluster agn fraction on redshift, velocity dispersion,cluster substructure, and butcher-oemler fraction. while we see weak evidencefor several trends, correlations between these four parameters in our smallsample precludes identification of which one(s) most strongly influence thecluster agn fraction.

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

1302.3221	demographics of the galaxies hosting short-duration gamma-ray bursts	we present observations of the afterglows and host galaxies of threeshort-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs): 100625a, 101219a and 110112a. we findthat grb 100625a occurred in a z=0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of4.6e9 m_sun and a stellar population age of 0.7 gyr, and grb 101219a originatedin a star-forming galaxy at z=0.718 with a stellar mass of 1.4e9 m_sun, a starformation rate of 16 m_sun yr^-1, and a stellar population age of 50 myr. wealso report the discovery of the optical afterglow of grb 110112a, which lacksa coincident host galaxy to i&gt;26 mag and we cannot conclusively identify anyfield galaxy as a possible host. the bursts have inferred circumburst densitiesof ~1e-4-1 cm^-3, and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of1e50-1e51 erg. these events highlight the diversity of galaxies that host shortgrbs. to quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 swift short grbs withrobust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected byswift to may 2012) and classify them as follows: late-type (50%), early-type(15%), inconclusive (20%), and host-less (lacking a coincident host galaxy tolimits of &gt;26 mag; 15%). to find likely ranges for the true late- andearly-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to the late- orearly-type category using probabilistic arguments, and consider the scenariothat all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set anupper bound on the early-type fraction. the most likely ranges for the late-and early-type fractions are ~60-80% and ~20-40%, respectively. we find noclear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type, and no change to thefractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants fromthe long grb/collapsar population. our reported demographics are consistentwith a short grb rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.

0705.0977	stellar evolution in ngc 6791: mass loss on the red giant branch and the  formation of low mass white dwarfs	we present the first detailed study of the properties (temperatures,gravities, and masses) of the ngc 6791 white dwarf population. this uniquestellar system is both one of the oldest (8 gyr) and most metal-rich ([fe/h] ~0.4) open clusters in our galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) thatexhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch.fitting the balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using keck/lrisspectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, &lt;m&gt; = 0.43 +/-0.06 msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolutioninvolving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. we show that atleast 40% of ngc 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the redgiant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium intocarbon-oxygen in their core. such increased mass loss in the evolution of theprogenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extremehorizontal branch in the cmd. this unique stellar evolutionary channel alsonaturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 gyr) for ngc6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this clusterwill cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore thecorrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 gyr, consistent with the wellmeasured main-sequence turnoff age. these results provide direct empiricalevidence that mass loss is much more efficient in high metallicity environmentsand therefore may be critical in interpreting the ultraviolet upturn inelliptical galaxies.

1402.7076	the mass-independence of specific star formation rates in galactic disks	the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the sfr "mainsequence"; ${\rm sfr}-m_*$) is not quite unity: specific star formation rates$({\rm sfr}/m_*)$ are weakly-but-significantly anti-correlated with $m_*$. herewe demonstrate that this trend may simply reflect the well-known increase inbulge mass-fractions -- portions of a galaxy not forming stars -- with $m_*$.using a large set of bulge/disk decompositions and sfr estimates derived fromthe sloan digital sky survey, we show that re-normalizing sfr by disk stellarmass $({\rm ssfr_{\rm disk}\equiv sfr}/m_{*,{\rm disk}})$ reduces the$m_*$-dependence of sf efficiency by $\sim0.25$ dex per dex, erasing itentirely in some subsamples. quantitatively, we find $\log {\rmssfr_{disk}}-\log m_*$ to have a slope $\beta_{\rm disk}\in[-0.20,0.00]\pm0.02$(depending on sfr estimator and main sequence definition) for star-forminggalaxies with $m_*\geq10^{10}m_{\odot}$ and bulge mass-fractions$b/t\lesssim0.6$, generally consistent with a pure-disk control sample($\beta_{\rm control}=-0.05\pm0.04$). that $\langle{\rm sfr}/m_{*,{\rmdisk}}\rangle$ is (largely) independent of host mass for star-forming disks hasstrong implications for aspects of galaxy evolution inferred from any ${\rmsfr}-m_*$ relation, including: manifestations of "mass quenching" (bulgegrowth), factors shaping the star-forming stellar mass function (uniform $d\logm_*/dt$ for low-mass, disk-dominated galaxies), and diversity in star formationhistories (dispersion in ${\rm sfr}(m_*,t)$). our results emphasize the need totreat galaxies as composite systems -- not integrated masses -- inobservational and theoretical work.

1405.1048	exploring the z=3-4 massive galaxy population with zfourge: the  prevalence of dusty and quiescent galaxies	our understanding of the redshift $z&gt;3$ galaxy population relies largely onsamples selected using the popular "dropout" technique, typically consisting ofuv-bright galaxies with blue colors and prominent lyman breaks. as it iscurrently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxypopulation, we here use the fourstar galaxy evolution (zfourge) survey tocreate a stellar mass-limited sample at $z=3-4$. uniquely, zfourge uses deepnear-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshiftsand stellar population properties. the mass-complete sample consists of 57galaxies with log m $&gt;10.6$, reaching below $m^{\star}$ at $z=3-4$.  on average, the massive $z=3-4$ galaxies are extremely faint in the observedoptical with median $r_{tot}^{ab}=27.48\pm0.41$ (restframe$m_{1700}=-18.05\pm0.37$). they lie far below the uv luminosity-stellar massrelation for lyman break galaxies and are about $\sim100\times$ fainter at thesame mass. the massive galaxies are red ($r-ks_{ab}=3.9\pm0.2$; restframeuv-slope $\beta=-0.2\pm0.3$) likely from dust or old stellar ages. we classifythe galaxy seds by their restframe $u-v$ and $v-j$ colors and find a diversepopulation: $46^{+6+10}_{-6-17}$% of the massive galaxies are quiescent,$54^{+8+17}_{-8-10}$% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only$14^{+3+10}_{-3-4}$% resemble luminous blue star forming lyman break galaxies.this study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies athigher redshift than previously known. furthermore,we uncover a reservoir ofdusty star-forming galaxies with $4\times$ lower specific star-formation ratescompared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at $z&gt;3$. with $5\times$ highernumbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formationcompared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.

1406.5191	decoding the star-forming main sequence or: how i learned to stop  worrying and love the central limit theorem	star-formation rates (sfr) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellarmass, with a small dispersion in ssfr at fixed mass, sigma~0.3 dex. with suchsmall scatter this star-formation main sequence (sfms) has been interpreted asdeterministic and fundamental. here we demonstrate that it is a simpleconsequence of the central limit theorem. our derivation begins byapproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like arandom walk (where the expectation of sfr at any time is equal to the sfr atthe previous time). we then derive expectation values for median ssfr ofstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. we generalize the results forstochastic changes in sfr that are not independent of each other but arecorrelated over time. for unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive anexpectation that &lt;ssfr&gt; should be independent of mass, decline as 1/t, and havea relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. the derived sfms andits evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy toconstrain cosmological parameters. the framework reproduces several importantobservables, including: the scatter in ssfr at fixed mass; the sfhs of nearbydwarf galaxies and the milky way; and the scatter in the tully-fisher relation.the evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss waysto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such asmergers. the predicted dispersion in ssfr has consequences for theclassification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneousformation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in theirstar-formation activity. the implied dispersion in sfhs, and the sfms'sinsensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits theability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmicbaselines.

astro-ph;0303507	optimal techniques in two-dimensional spectroscopy: background  subtraction for the 21st century	in two-dimensional spectrographs, the optical distortions in the spatial anddispersion directions produce variations in the sub-pixel sampling of thebackground spectrum. using knowledge of the camera distortions and thecurvature of the spectral features, one can recover information regarding thebackground spectrum on wavelength scales much smaller than a pixel. as aresult, one can propagate this better-sampled background spectrum throughinverses of the distortion and rectification transformations, and accuratelymodel the background spectrum in two-dimensional spectra for which thedistortions have not been removed (i.e. the data have not beenrebinned/rectified). the procedure, as outlined in this paper, is extremelyinsensitive to cosmic rays, hot pixels, etc. because of this insensitivity todiscrepant pixels, sky modeling and subtraction need not be performed as one ofthe later steps in a reduction pipeline. sky-subtraction can now be performedas one of the earliest tasks, perhaps just after dividing by a flat-field.because subtraction of the background can be performed without having to``clean'' cosmic rays, such bad pixel values can be trivially identified afterremoval of the two-dimensional sky background.

astro-ph;9704090	a pair of lensed galaxies at z=4.92 in the field of cl1358+62	the cluster cl1358+62 displays a prominent red arc in wfpc2 images obtainedwith the hubble space telescope. keck spectra of the arc show ly alpha emissionat 7204 angstrom, a continuum drop blueward of the line, and several absorptionlines to the red. we identify the arc as a gravitationally lensed galaxy at aredshift of z=4.92. it is the highest redshift object currently known. agravitational lens model was used to reconstruct images of the high-redshiftgalaxy. the reconstructed image is asymmetric, containing a bright knot and apatch of extended emission 0.4 arcsec from the knot. the effective radius ofthe bright knot is 0.022 arcsec or 130 h^-1 pc. the extended patch is partiallyresolved into compact regions of star formation. the reconstructed galaxy hasi_ab= 24, giving a bolometric luminosity of about 3e11 lsun. this can beproduced by a star formation rate of 36 h^-2 msun /yr (q0=0.5), or by aninstantaneous star burst of 3e8 msun. the spectral lines show velocityvariations on the order of 300 km/s along the arc. the si ii line is blueshifted with respect to the ly alpha emission, and the ly alpha emission lineis asymmetric with a red tail. these spectral features are naturally explainedby an outflow model, in which the blue side of the ly alpha line has beenabsorbed by outflowing neutral h i. evidence from other sources indicates thatoutflows are common in starburst galaxies at high and low redshift. we havediscovered a companion galaxy with a radial velocity only 450 km/s differentthan the arc's. the serendipitous discovery of these two galaxies suggests thatsystematic searches may uncover galaxies at even higher redshifts.

astro-ph;9801190	the color-magnitude relation in cl 1358+62 at z=0.33: evidence for  significant evolution in the s0 population	we use a large mosaic of hst wfpc2 images to measure the colors andmorphologies of 194 spectroscopically confirmed members of the rich galaxycluster cl1358+62 at z=0.33. we study the color-magnitude (cm) relation as afunction of radius in the cluster. the intrinsic scatter in the restframe b-vcm relation of the elliptical galaxies is very small: ~0.022 magnitudes. the cmrelation of the ellipticals does not depend significantly on the distance fromthe cluster center. in contrast, the cm relation for the s0 galaxies doesdepend on radius: the s0s in the core follow a cm relation similar to theellipticals, but at large radii (r&gt;0.7mpc) the s0s are systematically bluer andthe scatter in the cm relation approximately doubles to ~0.043 magnitudes. theblueing of the s0s is significant at the 95% confidence level. these resultsimply that the s0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster have formed starsmore recently than the s0s in the inner parts. a likely explanation is thatclusters at z=0.33 continue to accrete galaxies and groups from the field andthat infall extinguishes star formation. the apparent homogeneity of theelliptical galaxy population implies that star formation in recently accretedellipticals was terminated well before accretion occurred. we have constructedmodels to explore the constraints that these observations place on the starformation history of cluster galaxies. we conclude that the population of s0sin clusters is likely to evolve as star forming galaxies are converted intopassively evolving galaxies. assuming a constant accretion rate after z=0.33,we estimate ~15% of the present day early-type galaxy population in richclusters was accreted between z=0.33 and z=0. the ellipticals (and thebrightest s0s) are probably a more stable population, at least since z=0.6.

(1998) using thehst/wfpc2. combined with cluster velocities corrected for a cosmological flowmodel, these distances imply a value of the hubble constant of h0 = 69 +/- 4(random) +/- 6 (systematic) km/s/mpc. this result assumes that the cepheid plrelation is independent of the metallicity of the variable stars; adopting ametallicity correction as in kennicutt et al.

astro-ph;9909222	the extragalactic distance scale key project xxvii. a derivation of the  hubble constant using the fundamental plane and dn-sigma relations in leo i,  virgo, and fornax	using published photometry and spectroscopy, we construct the fundamentalplane and d_n-sigma relations in leo i, virgo and fornax. the published cepheidp-l relations to spirals in these clusters fixes the relation between angularsize and metric distance for both the fundamental plane and d_n-sigmarelations. using the locally calibrated fundamental plane, we infer distancesto a sample of clusters with a mean redshift of cz \approx 6000 \kms, andderive a value of h_0=78+- 5+- 9 km/s/mpc (random, systematic) for the localexpansion rate. this value includes a correction for depth effects in thecepheid distances to the nearby clusters, which decreased the deduced value ofthe expansion rate by 5% +- 5%. if one further adopts the metallicitycorrection to the cepheid pl relation, as derived by the key project, the valueof the hubble constant would decrease by a further 6%+- 4%. these two sourcesof systematic error, when combined with a +- 6% error due to the uncertainty inthe distance to the large magellanic cloud, a +- 4% error due to uncertaintiesin the wfpc2 calibration, and several small sources of uncertainty in thefundamental plane analysis, combine to yield a total systematic uncertainty of+- 11%. we find that the values obtained using either the cmb, or a flow-fieldmodel, for the reference frame of the distant clusters, agree to within 1%. thedn-sigma relation also produces similar results, as expected from thecorrelated nature of the two scaling relations. a complete discussion of thesources of random and systematic error in this determination of the hubbleconstant is also given, in order to facilitate comparison with the othersecondary indicators being used by the key project.

astro-ph;9909269	the hubble space telescope key project on the extragalactic distance  scale xxiv: the calibration of tully-fisher relations and the value of the  hubble constant	this paper presents the calibration of bvrih$ tully-fisher relations based oncepheid distances to 21 galaxies within 25 mpc, and 23 clusters within 10,000km/s. these relations have been applied to several distant cluster surveys inorder to derive a value for the hubble constant, h0, mainly concentrating on ani-band all-sky survey by giovanelli and collaborators which consisted of totali magnitudes and 50% linewidth data for ~550 galaxies in 16 clusters. forcomparison, we also derive the values of h0 using surveys in b-band and v-bandby bothun and collaborators, and in h-band by aaronson and collaborators.careful comparisons with various other databases from literature suggest thatthe h-band data, whose magnitudes are isophotal magnitudes extrapolated fromaperture magnitudes rather than total magnitudes, are subject to systematicuncertainties. taking a weighted average of the estimates of hubble constantsfrom four surveys, we obtain h0 = 71 +- 4 (random) +- 7 (systematic) km/s/mpc.we have also investigated how various systematic uncertainties affect the valueof h0 such as the internal extinction correction method used, tully-fisherslopes and shapes, a possible metallicity dependence of the cepheidperiod-luminosity relation and cluster population incompleteness bias.

astro-ph;9910501	a database of cepheid distance moduli and trgb, gclf, pnlf and sbf data  useful for distance determinations	we present a compilation of cepheid distance moduli and data for foursecondary distance indicators that employ stars in the old stellar populations:the planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf), the globular clusterluminosity function (gclf), the tip of the red giant branch (trgb), and thesurface brightness fluctuation (sbf) method. the database includes all datapublished as of july 15, 1999. the main strength of this compilation resides inall data being on a consistent and homogeneous system: all cepheid distancesare derived using the same calibration of the period-luminosity relation, thetreatment of errors is consistent for all indicators, measurements which arenot considered reliable are excluded. as such, the database is ideal forinter-comparing any of the distance indicators considered, or for deriving acepheid calibration to any secondary distance indicator. specifically, thedatabase includes: 1) cepheid distances, extinctions and metallicities; 2)apparent magnitudes of the pnlf cutoff; 3) apparent magnitudes and colors ofthe turnover of the gclf (both in the v- and b-bands); 4) apparent magnitudesof the trgb (in the i-band) and v-i colors at and 0.5 magnitudes fainter thanthe trgb; 5) apparent surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes i, k', k_short,and using the f814w filter with the hst/wfpc2. in addition, for every galaxy inthe database we give reddening estimates from dirbe/iras as well as hi maps,j2000 coordinates, hubble and t-type morphological classification, apparenttotal magnitude in b, and systemic velocity.

astro-ph;9911065	the evolution of early-type galaxies in distant clusters i.: surface  photometry and structural parameters for 53 galaxies in the z=0.33 cluster  cl1358+62	using hst imaging of cl1358+62 (z=0.33) structural parameters are derived for53 cluster members. we fit integrated r^{1/4}-laws to the integrated s.b.profiles, and fit two-dimensional r^{1/4}-law model galaxies to the imagesdirectly. the results from the two methods agree very well, with an rms scatterof 13% in r_e. the half-light radii range from 1 to 20 kpc, with a median of 3kpc. we compared r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fits to r_{1/2} derived using otherprofiles. in particular, we fit sersic r^{1/n}-laws and superpositions ofr^{1/4}-law bulges with exponential disks. the r_{1/2} derived from thebest-fit sersic profiles varied with respect to r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fitsby 1% in the median, but with a standard deviation of more than 40%. for thebulge-plus-disk fits, the derived r_{1/2} were offset from r_e of ther^{1/4}-law fits by 10% in the mean, also with a standard deviation of morethan 40%. by comparing the sersic r_{1/2} with those derived from thebulge-plus-disk fitting, that scatter is also large, at 30%. we conclude thatr_{1/2} is generally measured with a typical accuracy of 30-40%. the largeuncertainties in r_{1/2} do not impact the fundamental plane analysis becausethe combination r&lt;i&gt;^{0.76}, which enters the fundamental plane, is extremelystable. the rms scatter in r&lt;i&gt;^{0.76} is less than 3%, regardless of the formof the profile fit to the galaxies. we find that the median bulge fraction ofthe sample is 84% and that the few e+a galaxies in this sample have disks whichmake up about 10-35% of their total light. these results are consistent withresiduals from fitting 2d r^{1/4}-law models directly to the galaxies, in whichdisk-like structures are revealed in about half of the sample. two of the threee+a galaxies show spiral arm structure.

0706.0209	first measurement of a rapid increase in the agn fraction in  high-redshift clusters of galaxies	we present the first measurement of the agn fraction in high-redshiftclusters of galaxies (z~0.6) with spectroscopy of one cluster and archival datafor three additional clusters. we identify 8 agn in all four of these clustersfrom the chandra data, which are sensitive to agn with hard x-ray (2-10kev)luminosity l_{x,h} &gt; 10^43 erg/s in host galaxies more luminous than a restframe m_r &lt; -20 mag. this stands in sharp contrast to the one agn with l_{x,h}&gt; 10^43 erg/s we discovered in our earlier study of eight low-redshift clusterswith z=0.06-0.31 (average z~0.2). three of the four high-redshift clusterdatasets are sensitive to nearly l_{x,h} &gt; 10^42 erg/s and we identify sevenagn above this luminosity limit, compared to two in eight, low-redshiftclusters. based on membership estimates for each cluster, we determine that theagn fraction at z~0.6 is f_a(l_x&gt;10^42;m_r&lt;-20) = 0.028 (+0.019/-0.012) andf_a(l_x&gt;10^43;m_r&lt;-20) = 0.020 (+0.012/-0.008). these values are approximatelya factor of 20 greater than the agn fractions in lower-redshift (average z~0.2)clusters of galaxies and represent a substantial increase over the factors of1.5 and 3.3 increase, respectively, in the measured space density evolution ofthe hard x-ray luminosity function over this redshift range. potentialsystematic errors would only increase the significance of our result. thecluster agn fraction increases more rapidly with redshift than the field andthe increase in cluster agn indicates the presence of an agn butcher-oemlereffect.

0812.2021	a wide-field study of the z~0.8 cluster rx j0152.7-1357: the role of  environment in the formation of the red-sequence	[abridged] we present the first results from the largest spectroscopic surveyto date of an intermediate redshift galaxy cluster, the z=0.834 cluster rxj0152.7-1357. we use the colors of galaxies, assembled from a d~12 mpc regioncentered on the cluster, to investigate the properties of the red-sequence as afunction of density and clustercentric radius. our wide-field multi-slit surveywith a low-dispersion prism in the imacs spectrograph at magellan allowed us toidentify 475 new members of the cluster and its surrounding large scalestructure with a redshift accuracy of dz/(1+z)~1% and a contamination rate of~2% for galaxies with i&lt;23.75 mag. we combine these new members with the 279previously known spectroscopic members to give a total of 754 galaxies fromwhich we obtain a mass-limited sample of 300 galaxies with stellar massesm&gt;4x10^{10} m_sun. we find that the red galaxy fraction is 93+/-3% in the twomerging cores of the cluster and declines to a level of 64+/-3% at projectedclustercentric radii r&gt;~3 mpc. at these large projected distances, thecorrelation between clustercentric radius and local density is nonexistent.this allows an assessment of the influence of the local environment on galaxyevolution, as opposed to mechanisms that operate on cluster scales. even beyondr&gt;3 mpc we find an increasing fraction of red galaxies with increasing localdensity. the red fraction at the highest local densities in two groups at r&gt;3mpc matches the red fraction found in the two cores. strikingly, galaxies atintermediate densities at r&gt;3 mpc, that are not group members, also show signsof an enhanced red fraction. our results point to such intermediate densityregions and the groups in the outskirts of the cluster, as sites where thelocal environment influences the transition of galaxies onto the red-sequence.
