0902.2477	galaxy-induced transformation of dark matter halos	we use n-body/gasdynamical lambdacdm cosmological simulations to examine theeffect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of itsdark halo. two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only theevolution of the dark matter component and a second one where a baryoniccomponent is added. these simulations include radiative cooling but neglectstar formation and feedback, leading most baryons to collect at the halo centerin a disk which is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral.this unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effectthat galaxies may have in transforming their dark halos. we find that the shapeof the halo becomes more axisymmetric: halos are transformed from triaxial intoessentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughlyconstant flattening (c/a ~ 0.85). halos always contract as a result of galaxyassembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the"adiabatic contraction" hypothesis. the reduced contraction helps to reconcilelambdacdm halos with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solarcircle and should alleviate the long-standing difficulty of matchingsimultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy disks and the luminosityfunction. the halo contraction is also less pronounced than found in earliersimulations, a disagreement that suggests that halo contraction is not solely afunction of the initial and final distribution of baryons. not only how muchbaryonic mass has been deposited at the center of a halo matters, but also themode of its deposition. it might prove impossible to predict the halo responsewithout a detailed understanding of a galaxy's assembly history.

0706.2768	towards a holistic view of the heating and cooling of the intracluster  medium	(abridged) x-ray clusters are conventionally divided into two classes: "coolcore" (cc) clusters and "non-cool core" (ncc) clusters. yet relatively littleattention has been given to the origins of this dichotomy and, in particular,to the energetics and thermal histories of the two classes. we develop a modelfor the entropy profiles of clusters starting from the configurationestablished by gravitational shock heating and radiative cooling. at largeradii, gravitational heating accounts for the observed profiles and theirscalings well. however, at small and intermediate radii, radiative cooling andgravitational heating cannot be combined to explain the observed profiles ofeither type of cluster. the inferred entropy profiles of ncc clusters requirethat material is preheated prior to cluster collapse in order to explain theabsence of low entropy (cool) material in these systems. we show that a similarmodification is also required in cc clusters in order to match their propertiesat intermediate radii. in cc clusters, this modification is unstable, and anadditional process is required to prevent cooling below a temperature of a fewkev. we show that this can be achieved by adding a self-consistent agn feedbackloop in which the lowest-entropy, most rapidly cooling material is heated sothat it rises buoyantly to mix with material at larger radii. the resultingmodel does not require fine tuning and is in excellent agreement with a widevariety of observational data. some of the other implications of this model arebriefly discussed.

0905.2378	maximum spin of black holes driving jets	unbounded outflows in the form of highly collimated jets and broad windsappear to be a ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems. the mostpowerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not themajority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black hole. whateverthe precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert abraking torque on the black hole. we calculate the spin-up function for anaccreting black hole, accounting for this braking torque. we find that thepredicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin anddimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. using recentrelativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibratethe efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an adafflow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96%of the maximal spin value in the absence of jets. combining our adaf systemwith a simple model for jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium isreached at approximately 93% of the maximal spin value, as found in thenumerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at whichpoint the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by the brakingtorque arising from jet production. our model also yields a relationshipbetween jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in surprisingly goodagreement with that seen in the simulation studies, indicating that our simplemodel is a useful and convenient description of adaf inflow - jet outflow abouta spinning black hole for incorporation in models of the formation andevolution of galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.

0908.3201	the relationship between substructure in 2d x-ray surface brightness  images and weak lensing mass maps of galaxy clusters: a simulation study	in this paper, we undertake a study to determine what insight can be reliablygleaned from the comparison of the x-ray and the weak lensing mass maps ofgalaxy clusters. we do this by investigating the 2d substructure within threehigh-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters. our main resultsfocus on non-radiative gas dynamics, but we also consider the effects ofradiative cooling at high redshift. for our analysis, we use a novel approach,based on unsharp-masking, to identify substructures in 2d surface mass densityand x-ray surface brightness maps. at full resolution (~ 15 h^-1 kpc), thistechnique is capable of identifying almost all self-bound dark matter subhaloeswith m&gt;10^12 h^-1 m_sun. we also report a correlation between the mass of asubhalo and the area of its corresponding 2d detection; such a correlation,once calibrated, could provide a useful estimator for substructure mass.comparing our 2d mass and x-ray substructures, we find a surprising number ofcases where the matching fails: around one third of galaxy-sized substructureshave no x-ray counterpart. some interesting cases are also found at largermasses, in particular the cores of merging clusters where the situation can becomplex. finally, we degrade our mass maps to what is currently achievable withweak-lensing observations (~100 h^-1 kpc at z=0.2). while the completeness masslimit increases by around an order of magnitude, a mass-area correlationremains. our paper clearly demonstrates that the next generation of lensingsurveys should start to reveal a wealth of information on cluster substructure.(abridged)

1001.0780	locuss: a comparison of cluster mass measurements from xmm-newton and  subaru - testing deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium and non-thermal  pressure support	we compare x-ray hydrostatic and weak-lensing mass estimates for a sample of12 clusters that have been observed with both xmm-newton and subaru. at anover-density of \delta=500, we obtain 1-m^{x}/m^{wl}=0.01+/-0.07 for the wholesample. we also divided the sample into undisturbed and disturbed sub-samplesbased on quantitative x-ray morphologies using asymmetry and fluctuationparameters, obtaining 1-m^{x}/m^{wl}=0.09+/-0.06 and -0.06+/-0.12 for theundisturbed and disturbed clusters, respectively. in addition to non-thermalpressure support, there may be a competing effect associated with adiabaticcompression and/or shock heating which leads to overestimate of x-rayhydrostatic masses for disturbed clusters, for example, in the famous mergingcluster a1914. despite the modest statistical significance of the massdiscrepancy, on average, in the undisturbed clusters, we detect a clear trendof improving agreement between m^{x} and m^{wl} as a function of increasingover-density, m^{x}/m^{wl}=(0.908+/-0.004)+(0.187+/-0.010) \log_{10}(\delta/500). we also examine the gas mass fractions, f_{gas}=m^{gas}/m^{wl}, findingthat they are an increasing function of cluster radius, with no dependence ondynamical state, in agreement with predictions from numerical simulations.overall, our results demonstrate that xmm-newton and subaru are a powerfulcombination for calibrating systematic uncertainties in cluster massmeasurements.

1004.2050	mass transport by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters	we investigate the effect of three important processes by which agn-blownbubbles transport material: drift, wake transport and entrainment. the first ofthese, drift, occurs because a buoyant bubble pushes aside the adjacentmaterial, giving rise to a net upward displacement of the fluid behind thebubble. for a spherical bubble, the mass of upwardly displaced material isroughly equal to half the mass displaced by the bubble, and should be ~10^{7-9} solar masses depending on the local icm and bubble parameters. we showthat in classical cool core clusters, the upward displacement by drift may be akey process in explaining the presence of filaments behind bubbles. a bubblealso carries a parcel of material in a region at its rear, known as the wake.the mass of the wake is comparable to the drift mass and increases the averagedensity of the bubble, trapping it closer to the cluster centre and reducingthe amount of heating it can do during its ascent. moreover, material droppingout of the wake will also contribute to the trailing filaments. mass transportby the bubble wake can effectively prevent the build-up of cool material in thecentral galaxy, even if agn heating does not balance icm cooling. finally, weconsider entrainment, the process by which ambient material is incorporatedinto the bubble. abridged

1009.0878	neuron dynamics in the presence of 1/f noise	interest in understanding the interplay between noise and the response of anon-linear device cuts across disciplinary boundaries. it is as relevant forunmasking the dynamics of neurons in noisy environments as it is for designingreliable nanoscale logic circuit elements and sensors. most studies of noise innon-linear devices are limited to either time-correlated noise with alorentzian spectrum (of which the white noise is a limiting case) or just whitenoise. we use analytical theory and numerical simulations to study the impactof the more ubiquitous "natural" noise with a 1/f frequency spectrum.specifically, we study the impact of the 1/f noise on a leaky integrate andfire model of a neuron. the impact of noise is considered on two quantities ofinterest to neuron function: the spike count fano factor and the speed ofneuron response to a small step-like stimulus. for the perfect (non-leaky)integrate and fire model, we show that the fano factor can be expressed as anintegral over noise spectrum weighted by a (low pass) filter function. thisresult elucidates the connection between low frequency noise and disorder inneuron dynamics. we compare our results to experimental data of single neuronsin vivo, and show how the 1/f noise model provides much better agreement thanthe usual approximations based on lorentzian noise. the low frequency noise,however, complicates the case for information coding scheme based on interspikeintervals by introducing variability in the neuron response time. on a positivenote, the neuron response time to a step stimulus is, remarkably, nearlyoptimal in the presence of 1/f noise. an explanation of this effect elucidateshow the brain can take advantage of noise to prime a subset of the neurons torespond almost instantly to sudden stimuli.

1206.1525	a giant metrewave radio telescope/chandra view of iras 09104+4109: a  type 2 qso in a cooling flow	iras 09104+4109 is a rare example of a dust enshrouded type 2 qso in thecentre of a cool-core galaxy cluster. previous observations of this z=0.44system showed that as well as powering the hyper-luminous infrared emission ofthe cluster-central galaxy, the qso is associated with a double-lobed radiosource. however, the steep radio spectral index and misalignment between thejets and ionised optical emission suggested that the orientation of the qso hadrecently changed. we use a combination of new, multi-band giant metrewave radiotelescope observations and archival radio data to confirm that the jets are nolonger powered by the qso, and estimate their age to be 120-160 myr. this is inagreement with the ~70-200 myr age previously estimated for star-formation inthe galaxy. previously unpublished very long baseline array data reveal a 200pc scale double radio source in the galaxy core which is more closely alignedwith the current qso axis and may represent a more recent period of jetactivity. these results suggest that the realignment of the qso, the cessationof jet activity, and the onset of rapid star-formation may have been caused bya gas-rich galaxy merger. a chandra x-ray observation confirms the presence ofcavities associated with the radio jets, and we estimate the energy required toinflate them to be ~7.7x10^60 erg. the mechanical power of the jets issufficient to balance radiative cooling in the cluster, provided they areefficiently coupled to the intra-cluster medium (icm). we find no evidence ofdirect radiative heating and conclude that the qso either lacks the radiativeluminosity to heat the icm, or that it requires longer than 100-200 myr tosignificantly impact its environment.

1209.5748	isotropic heating of galaxy cluster cores via rapidly reorienting agn  jets	agn jets carry more than sufficient energy to stave off catastrophic coolingof the intracluster medium (icm) in the cores of cool-core clusters. however,in order to prevent catastrophic cooling, the icm must be heated in anear-isotropic fashion and narrow bipolar jets with $p_{\rm jet}=10^{44-45}$ergs/s, typical of radio agns at cluster centres, are inefficient at heatingthe gas in the transverse direction to the jets. we argue that due to existentconditions in cluster cores, the smbhs will, in addition to accreting gas viaradiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes of enhancedaccretion via thin discs. in general, the orientation of these accretion discswill be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes and the ensuingtorques will cause the black hole's spin axis (and therefore, the jet axis) toslew and rapidly change direction. this model not only explains recentobservations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individualcool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular directionwith respect to the cluster center, but also shows that agn jets {\it can} heatthe cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas cooling timescale. our model{\it does} require that the smbhs at the centers of cool-core clusters bespinning relatively slowly. torques from individual misaligned discs areineffective at tilting rapidly spinning black holes by more than a few degrees.additionally, since smbhs that host thin accretion discs will manifest asquasars, we predict that roughly 1--2 rich clusters within $z&lt;0.5$ should havequasars at their centers.

1307.3219	inferring the andromeda galaxy's mass from its giant southern stream  with bayesian simulation sampling	m31 has a giant stream of stars extending far to the south and a great dealof other tidal debris in its halo, much of which is thought to be directlyassociated with the southern stream. we model this structure by means ofbayesian sampling of parameter space, where each sample uses an n-bodysimulation of a satellite disrupting in m31's potential. we combine constraintson stellar surface densities from the isaac newton telescope survey of m31 withkinematic data and photometric distances. this combination of data tightlyconstrains the model, indicating a stellar mass at last pericentric passage oflog(m_s / msun) = 9.5+-0.1, comparable to the lmc. any existing remnant of thesatellite is expected to lie in the ne shelf region beside m31's disk, atvelocities more negative than m31's disk in this region. this rules out theprominent satellites m32 or ngc 205 as the progenitor, but an overdensityrecently discovered in m31's ne disk sits at the edge of the progenitorlocations found in the model. m31's virial mass is constrained in this model tobe log(m200) = 12.3+-0.1, alleviating the previous tension betweenobservational virial mass estimates and expectations from the general galacticpopulation and the timing argument. the techniques used in this paper, whichshould be more generally applicable, are a powerful method of extractingphysical inferences from observational data on tidal debris structures.

1408.4803	the x-ray spectrum of the cooling-flow quasar h1821+643 : a massive  black hole feeding off the intracluster medium	we present a deep suzaku observation of h1821+643, an extremely rare exampleof a powerful quasar hosted by the central massive galaxy of a richcooling-core cluster of galaxies. informed by previous chandra studies of thecluster, we achieve a spectral separation of emission from the active galacticnucleus (agn) and the intracluster medium (icm). with a high degree ofconfidence, we identify the signatures of x-ray reflection/reprocessing by coldand slowly moving material in the agn's immediate environment. the ironabundance of this matter is found to be significantly sub-solar (z~0.4zsun), anunusual finding for powerful agn but in line with the idea that this quasar isfeeding from the icm via a compton-induced cooling flow. we also find a subtlesoft excess that can be described phenomenologically (with an additional blackbody component) or as ionized x-ray reflection from the inner regions of a highinclination (i=57 degrees) accretion disk around a spinning (a&gt;0.4) black hole.we describe how the ionization state of the accretion disk can be used toconstrain the eddington fraction of the source. applying these arguments to ourspectrum implies an eddington fraction of 0.25-0.5, with an associated blackhole mass of 3-6x10^9msun.

0803.3476	was the andromeda stream produced by a disk galaxy?	the halo region of m31 exhibits a startling level of stellar inhomogeneities,the most prominent of which is the "giant southern stream". our previousanalysis indicates that this stream, as well as several other observedfeatures, are products of the tidal disruption of a single satellite galaxywith stellar mass ~10^9 solar masses less than 1 gyr ago. here we show that thespecific observed morphology of the stream and halo debris favors a cold,rotating, disk-like progenitor over a dynamically hot, non-rotating one. theseobserved characteristics include the asymmetric distribution of stars along thestream cross-section and its metal-rich core/metal-poor sheath structure. wefind that a disk-like progenitor can also give rise to arc-like features on theminor axis at certain orbital phases that resemble the recently discoveredminor-axis "streams", even reproducing the lower observed metallicity of thesestreams. though interpreted by the discoverers as new, independent tidalstreams, our analysis suggests that these minor-axis streams may alternativelyarise from the progenitor of the giant southern stream. overall, our studypoints the way to a more complete reconstruction of the stream progenitor andits merger with m31, based on the emerging picture that most of the majorinhomogeneities observed in the m31 halo share a common origin with the giantstream.

0804.1552	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - iii. effects on  compact cool cores	(abridged) we use the simulations presented in poole et al. 2006 to examinethe effects of mergers on compact cool cores in x-ray clusters. we propose ascheme for classifying the morphology of clusters based on their surfacebrightness and entropy profiles. three dominant morphologies emerge: twohosting compact cores and central temperatures which are cool (ccc systems) orwarm (cwc systems) and one hosting extended cores which are warm (ewc systems).we find that ccc states are disrupted only after direct collisions betweencluster cores in head-on collisions or during second pericentric passage inoff-axis mergers. by the time they relax, our remnant cores have generally beenheated to warm core (cwc or ewc) states but subsequently recover ccc states.the only case resulting in a long-lived ewc state is a slightly off-axis 3:1merger for which the majority of shock heating occurs during the accretion of alow-entropy stream formed from the disruption of the secondary's core.compression prevents core temperatures from falling until after relaxation thusexplaining the observed population of relaxed cwc systems with no need toinvoke agn feedback. the morphological segregation observed in the l_x-t_x andbeta-r_c scaling relations is reflected in our simulations as well. however,none of the cases we have studied produce sufficiently high remnant centralentropies to account for the most under-luminous ewc systems observed. lastly,systems which initially host central metallicity gradients do not yield mergerremnants with flat metallicity profiles. taken together, these results suggestthat once formed, compact core systems are remarkably stable against disruptionfrom mergers. it remains to be demonstrated exactly how the sizable observedpopulation of extended core systems was formed.

1504.02215	cool core cycles: cold gas and agn jet feedback in cluster cores	using high-resolution 3-d and 2-d (axisymmetric) hydrodynamic simulations inspherical geometry, we study the evolution of cool cluster cores heated byfeedback-driven bipolar active galactic nuclei (agn) jets. condensation of coldgas, and the consequent enhanced accretion, is required for agn feedback tobalance radiative cooling with reasonable efficiencies, and to match theobserved cool core properties. a feedback efficiency (mechanical luminosity$\approx \epsilon \dot{m}_{\rm acc} c^2$; where $\dot{m}_{\rm acc}$ is the massaccretion rate at 1 kpc) as small as $5 \times 10^{-5}$ is sufficient to reducethe cooling/accretion rate by $\sim 10$ compared to a pure cooling flow. thisvalue is smaller compared to the ones considered earlier, and is consistentwith the jet efficiency and the fact that only a small fraction of gas at 1 kpcis accreted on to the supermassive black hole (smbh). we find hysteresis cyclesin all our simulations with cold mode feedback: {\em condensation} of cold gaswhen the ratio of the cooling-time to the free-fall time ($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rmff}$) is $\lesssim 10$ leads to a sudden enhancement in the accretion rate; alarge accretion rate causes strong jets and {\em overheating} of the hot icmsuch that $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} &gt; 10$; further condensation of cold gas issuppressed and the accretion rate falls, leading to slow cooling of the coreand condensation of cold gas, restarting the cycle. therefore, there is aspread in core properties, such as the jet power, accretion rate, for the samevalue of core entropy or $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$. a fewer number of cyclesare observed for higher efficiencies and for lower mass halos because the coreis overheated to a longer cooling time. the 3-d simulations show the formationof a few-kpc scale, rotationally-supported, massive ($\sim 10^{11} m_\odot$)cold gas torus.

1512.01251	the growth and enrichment of the intragroup gas	the thermal and chemical properties of the hot diffuse intragroup medium(igrm) provide important constraints on the feedback processes associated withmassive galaxy formation and evolution. here we explore these constraints via adetailed analysis of the global properties of simulated z&lt;3 galaxy groups froma cosmological simulation that includes a well-constrained prescription forstellar/supernovae-powered galactic outflows but no agn feedback. our aims areto (a) establish a baseline against which we will compare future models; (b)identify model successes due to stellar/supernovae-powered outflows; and (c)pinpoint features that signal the need for, and constrain the nature of, agnfeedback.  our simulation successfully reproduces key observed z=0 group igrmproperties, including the various x-ray lx - tx - entropy scaling relations,for all but the most massive groups. the z&lt;1 redshift evolution of these alsoagree with observations. contrary to expectations, the simulated groups' igrmdoes not suffer catastrophic cooling. yet, the z=0 group stellar mass is ~ 2xtoo large. this is due to the build-up of cold gas in the massive galaxiesbefore they are incorporated inside groups. this in turn indicates that otherfeedback mechanisms must activate in real galaxies once their stellar massesgrow to a few x 10^{10} m_sun. we show that these must be powerful enough toexpel a significant fraction of the gas from the galactic halos. gentlemaintenance-mode (quenching) agn feedback, as seen in galaxy clusters, will notdo. just as importantly, we find that the stellar/supernovae-powered winds areessential for understanding the igrm metal abundances. our simulation is ableto reproduce the observed relationship between the global igrm iron and siliconabundance and the group x-ray temperature, and these results ought to berelatively insensitive to the addition of agn feedback.

0806.3434	the role of the radial orbit instability in dark matter halo formation  and structure	for a decade, n-body simulations have revealed a nearly universal dark matterdensity profile, which appears to be robust to changes in the overall densityof the universe and the underlying power spectrum. despite its universality,the physical origin of this profile has not yet been well understood.semi--analytic models by barnes et al. (2005) have suggested that the densitystructure of dark matter halos is determined by the onset of the radial orbitinstability (roi). we have tested this hypothesis using n-body simulations ofcollapsing dark matter halos with a variety of initial conditions. fordynamically cold initial conditions, the resulting halo structures are triaxialin shape, due to the mild aspect of the instability. we examine how variationsin initial velocity dispersion affect the onset of the instability, and findthat an isotropic velocity dispersion can suppress the roi entirely, while apurely radial dispersion does not. the quantity sigma^2/vc^2 is a criterion forinstability, where regions with sigma^2/vc^2 &lt;~1 become triaxial due to the roior other perturbations. we also find that the radial orbit instability sets ascale length at which the velocity dispersion changes rapidly from isotropic toradially anisotropic. this scale length is proportional to the radius at whichthe density profile changes shape, as is the case in the semi--analytic models;however, the coefficient of proportionality is different by a factor of ~2.5.we conclude that the radial orbit instability is likely to be a key physicalmechanism responsible for the nearly universal profiles of simulated darkmatter halos.

astro-ph;0012305	the dynamics of sinking satellites around disk galaxies: a poor man's  alternative to high-resolution numerical simulations	we have developed a simple yet surprisingly accurate analytic scheme fortracking the dynamical evolution of substructure within larger dark halos. thescheme incorporates the effects of dynamical friction, tidal mass loss andtidal heating via physically motivated approximations. using our scheme, we canpredict the orbital evolution and mass-loss history of individual subhalos indetail. we are also able to determine the impact and importance of thedifferent physical processes on the dynamical evolution of the subhalos. totest and calibrate this model, we compare it with a set of recenthigh-resolution numerical simulations of mergers between galaxies and smallcompanions. we find that we can reproduce the orbits and mass-loss rates seenin all of these simulations with considerable accuracy, using a single set ofvalues for the three free parameters in our model. computationally, our schemeis more than 1000 times faster than the simplest of the high-resolutionnumerical simulations. this means that we can carry out detailed andstatistically meaningful investigations into the characteristics of the subhalopopulation in different cosmologies, the stripping and disruption of thesubhalos, and the interactions of the subhalos with other dynamical structuressuch as a thin disk. this last point is of particular interest given theubiquity of minor mergers in hierarchical models. in this regard, our method'ssimplicity and speed makes it particularly attractive for incorporation intosemi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0109329	physical implications of the x-ray properties of galaxy groups and  clusters	within the standard framework of structure formation, where clusters andgroups of galaxies are built up from the merging of smaller systems, thephysical properties of the intracluster medium, such as the gas temperature andthe total x-ray luminosity, are predicted to possess well defined self-similarscaling relations. observed clusters and groups, however, show strongdeviations from these predicted relations. we argue that these deviations areunlikely to be entirely due to observational biasses; we assume they arephysically based, due to the presence of excess entropy in the intraclustermedium in addition to that generated by accretion shocks during the formationof the cluster. several mechanisms have been suggested as a means of generatingthis entropy. focussing on those mechanisms that preheat the gas before itbecomes a constituent of the virialized cluster environment, we present asimple, intuitive, physically motivated, analytic model that successfullycaptures the important physics associated with the accretion of high entropygas onto group and cluster-scale systems. we use the model to derive the newrelationships between the observable properties of clusters and groups ofgalaxies, as well as the evolution of these relations. these include theluminosity-temperature and luminosity-$\sigma$ relations, as well as thetemperature distribution function and x-ray luminosity function. theseproperties are found to be a more accurate description of the observations thanthose predicted from the standard framework. future observations will thatfurther test the efficacy of the preheated gas scenario are also discussed.

astro-ph;0203189	the cluster gas mass - temperature relation: evidence for a high level  of preheating	recent x-ray observations have been used to demonstrate that the cluster gasmass-temperature relation is steeper than theoretical self-similar predictionsdrawn from numerical simulations that consider the evolution of the cluster gasthrough the effects of gravity and shock heating alone. one possibleexplanation for this is that the gas mass fraction is not constant acrossclusters of different temperature, as is usually assumed. observationally,however, there is no compelling evidence for gas mass fraction variation,especially in the case of hot clusters. seeking an alternative physicalexplanation for the observed trends, we investigate the role in the cluster gasmass - temperature relation of the preheating of the intracluster medium bysome arbitrary source for clusters with emission-weighted mean temperatures ofgreater than about 3 kev. making use of the physically-motivated, analyticmodels developed in 2002 by babul and coworkers, we find that preheating does,indeed, lead to a steeper relation. this is in agreement with previoustheoretical studies on the relation. however, in apparent conflict with thesestudies, we argue that a ``high'' level of entropy injection is required tomatch observations. in particular, an entropy floor of greater than about 300kev cm^2 is required. we also present a new test, namely, the study of therelation within different fixed radii. this allows one to indirectly probe thedensity profiles of clusters, since it samples different fractions of thevirial radius for clusters of different temperature. this test also confirmsthat a high level of preheating is required to match observations.

astro-ph;0301612	the evolution of substructure in galaxy, group and cluster haloes i:  basic dynamics	the hierarchical mergers that form the haloes of dark matter surroundinggalaxies, groups and clusters are not entirely efficient, leaving substantialamounts of dense substructure, in the form of stripped halo cores or`subhaloes', orbiting within these systems. using a semi-analytic model ofsatellite dynamics, we study the evolution of haloes as they mergehierarchically, to determine how much substructure survives merging and how theproperties of individual subhaloes change over time. we find that subhaloesevolve, due to mass loss, orbital decay, and tidal disruption, on acharacteristic time-scale equal to the period of radial oscillations at thevirial radius of the system. subhaloes with realistic densities and densityprofiles lose 25-45 per cent of their mass per pericentric passage, dependingon their concentration and on the circularity of their orbit. as the halogrows, the subhalo orbits also grow in size and become less bound. based onthese general patterns, we suggest a method for including realistic amounts ofsubstructure in semi-analytic models based on merger trees. we show that theparameters in the resulting model can be fixed by requiring self-consistencybetween different levels of the merger hierarchy. in a companion paper, we willcompare the results of our model with numerical simulations of halo formation.

astro-ph;0302087	cluster sunyaev-zeldovich effect scaling relations	x-ray observations of an "entropy floor" in nearby groups and clusters ofgalaxies offer evidence that important non-gravitational processes, such asradiative cooling and/or "preheating", have strongly influenced the evolutionof the intracluster medium (icm). we examine how the presence of an entropyfloor modifies the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect. a detailed analysisof scaling relations between x-ray and sz effect observables and also betweenthe two primary sz effect observables is presented. we find that relationshipsbetween the central compton parameter and the temperature or mass of a clusterare extremely sensitive to the presence of an entropy floor. the same is truefor correlations between the integrated compton parameter and the x-rayluminosity or the central compton parameter. in fact, if the entropy floor isas high as inferred in recent analyses of x-ray data, a comparison of thesecorrelations with both current and future sz effect observations should show aclear signature of this excess entropy. moreover, because the sz effect isredshift-independent, the relations can potentially be used to track theevolution of the cluster gas and possibly discriminate between the possiblesources of the excess entropy. to facilitate comparisons with observations, weprovide analytic fits to these scaling relations.

astro-ph;0303270	on the relationship between cooling flows and bubbles	a common feature of the x-ray bubbles observed in chandra images of some"cooling flow" clusters is that they appear to be surrounded by bright, coolshells. temperature maps of a few nearby luminous clusters reveal that theshells consist of the coolest gas in the clusters -- much cooler than thesurrounding medium. using simple models, we study the effects of this coolemission on the inferred cooling flow properties of clusters. we find that theintroduction of bubbles into model clusters that do not have cooling flowsresults in temperature and surface brightness profiles that resemble those seenin nearby "cooling flow" clusters. they also approximately reproduce the recentxmm-newton and chandra observations of a high minimum temperature of 1-3 kev.hence, bubbles, if present, must be taken into account when inferring thephysical properties of the icm. in the case of some clusters, bubbles mayaccount entirely for these observed features, calling into question theirdesignation as clusters with cooling flows. however, since not all nearby"cooling flow" clusters show bubble-like features, we suggest that there may bea diverse range of physical phenomena that give rise to the same observedfeatures.

astro-ph;0303451	the sz effect signature of excess entropy in distant, massive clusters	studies of cluster x-ray scaling relations have led to suggestions thatnon-gravitational processes, e.g., radiative cooling and/or "preheating", havesignificantly modified the entropy of the intracluster medium (icm). for thefirst time, we test this hypothesis through a comparison of predicted thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect scaling relations with available data from theliterature. one of the relations that we explore, in principle, depends solelyon sz effect observations, thus offering an x-ray independent probe of the icm.a detailed comparison of the theoretical relations with the largest compilationof high redshift sz effect data to date indicates that the presence of anentropy floor is favored by the data. furthermore, the inferred level of thatfloor, 300 kev cm^2 or higher, is comparable to that found in studies of x-rayscaling relations of nearby massive clusters. thus, we find no evidence forsignificant evolution of the entropy floor out to z = 0.7. we furtherdemonstrate that the high quality data to be obtained from the upcomingsunyaev-zeldovich array (sza) and the (soon-to-be) upgraded owens valley radioobservatory (ovro) array will open powerful new windows into the properties ofthe icm. specifically, the new measurements will allow for accuratemeasurements of the icm entropy for even the most distant galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0312002	investigating the origins of dark matter halo density profiles	although high-resolution n-body simulations make robust empirical predictionsfor the density distribution within cold dark matter halos, these studies haveyielded little physical insight into the origins of the distribution. weinvestigate the problem using analytic and semi-analytic approaches. simpleanalytic considerations suggest that the inner slope of dark matter haloscannot be steeper than alpha=2 (rho ~ r^-alpha), with alpha=1.5-1.7 being amore realistic upper limit. our analysis suggests that any number of effects,both real (angular momentum from tidal torques, secondary perturbations) andartificial (two-body interactions, the accuracy of the numerical integrator,round-off errors), will result in shallower slopes. we also find that the halosshould exhibit a well-defined relation between r_peri/r_apo and j_theta/j_r. wederive this relation analytically and speculate that it may be "universal".using a semi-analytic scheme based on ryden &amp; gunn (1987), we further explorethe relationship between the specific angular momentum distribution in a haloand its density profile. for now we restrict ourselves to halos that formprimarily via nearly-smooth accretion of matter, and only consider the specificangular momentum generated by secondary perturbations associated with the colddark matter spectrum of density fluctuations. compared to those formed inn-body simulations, our ``semi-analytic'' halos are more extended, have flatterrotation curves and have higher specific angular momentum, even though we havenot yet taken into account the effects of tidal torques. whether the densityprofiles of numerical halos is indeed the result of loss in angular momentumoutside the central region, and whether this loss is a feature of hierarchicalmerging and major mergers in particular, is under investigation.

astro-ph;0406329	models of the icm with heating and cooling: explaining the global and  structural x-ray properties of clusters	(abridged) theoretical models that include only gravitationally-drivenprocesses fail to match the observed mean x-ray properties of clusters. as aresult, there has recently been increased interest in models in which eitherradiative cooling or entropy injection play a central role in mediating theproperties of the intracluster medium. both sets of models give reasonable fitsto the mean properties of clusters, but cooling only models result in fractionsof cold baryons in excess of observationally established limits and thesimplest entropy injection models do not treat the "cooling core" structurepresent in many clusters and cannot account for entropy profiles revealed byrecent x-ray observations. we consider models that marry radiative cooling withentropy injection, and confront model predictions for the global and structuralproperties of massive clusters with the latest x-ray data. the modelssuccessfully and simultaneously reproduce the observed l-t and l-m relations,yield detailed entropy, surface brightness, and temperature profiles inexcellent agreement with observations, and predict a cooled gas fraction thatis consistent with observational constraints. the model also provides apossible explanation for the significant intrinsic scatter present in the l-tand l-m relations and provides a natural way of distinguishing between clustersclassically identified as "cooling flow" clusters and dynamically relaxed"non-cooling flow" clusters. the former correspond to systems that had onlymild levels (&lt; 300 kev cm^2) of entropy injection, while the latter areidentified as systems that had much higher entropy injection. this is borne outby the entropy profiles derived from chandra and xmm-newton.

astro-ph;0410049	the evolution of substructure in galaxy, group and cluster haloes iii:  comparison with simulations	in a previous paper, we described a new method for including detailedinformation about substructure in semi-analytic models of halo formation basedon merger trees. in this paper, we compare the predictions of our model withresults from self-consistent numerical simulations. we find that in general thetwo methods agree extremely well, particularly once numerical effects andselection effects in the choice of haloes are taken into account. as expectedfrom the original analyses of the simulations, we see some evidence forartificial overmerging in the innermost regions of the simulated haloes, eitherbecause substructure is being disrupted artificially or because thegroup-finding algorithms used to identify substructure are not detecting allthe bound clumps in the highest-density regions. our analytic results suggestthat greater mass and force resolution may be required before numericalovermerging becomes negligible in all current applications. we discuss theimplications of this result for observational and experimental tests of halosubstructure, such as the analysis of discrepant magnification ratios instrongly lensed systems, terrestrial experiments to detect dark matterparticles directly, or indirect detection experiments searching for positrons,gamma-rays, neutrinos or other dark matter decay products.

astro-ph;0412442	the phase-space density distribution of dark matter halos	high resolution n-body simulations have all but converged on a commonempirical form for the shape of the density profiles of halos, but the fullunderstanding of the underlying physics of halo formation has eluded them sofar. we investigate the formation and structure of dark matter halos usinganalytical and semi-analytical techniques. our halos are formed via an extendedsecondary infall model (esim); they contain secondary perturbations and hencerandom tangential and radial motions which affect the halo's evolution at itundergoes shell-crossing and virialization. even though the density profiles ofnfw and esim halos are different their phase-space density distributions arethe same: \rho/\sigma^3 ~ r^{-\alpha}, with \alpha=1.875 over ~3 decades inradius. we use two approaches to try to explain this ``universal'' slope: (1)the jeans equation analysis yields many insights, however, does not answer why\alpha=1.875. (2) the secondary infall model of the 1960's and 1970's,augmented by ``thermal motions'' of particles does predict that halos shouldhave \alpha=1.875. however, this relies on assumptions of spherical symmetryand slow accretion. while for esim halos these assumptions are justified, theymost certainly break down for simulated halos which forms hierarchically. wespeculate that our argument may apply to an ``on-average'' formation scenarioof halos within merger-driven numerical simulations, and thereby explain why\alpha=1.875 for nfw halos. thus, \rho/\sigma^3 ~ r^{-1.875} may be a genericfeature of violent relaxation.

astro-ph;0501137	the effects of radiative cooling on the entropy distribution of  intracluster gas	high resolution x-ray observations indicate that the entropy profiles in thecentral regions of some massive cooling flow clusters are well approximated bypowerlaws. mccarthy and coworkers recently accounted for this trend with ananalytic model that includes the detailed effects of radiative cooling.interestingly, these authors found that cooling (and subsequent inflow of thegas) naturally establishes approximate steady-state powerlaw entropy profilesin the cores of clusters. however, the origin of this behavior and itsdependence on initial conditions have yet to be elucidated. in the presentstudy, we explain this trend in the context of the self-similar cooling wavemodel developed previously by bertschinger (1989). it is shown that thelogarithmic slope of the entropy profile in the cores of relaxed cooling flowclusters is given by a simple analytic function that depends only on thelogarithmic slopes of the local gravitational potential and the coolingfunction. we discuss a number of potentially interesting uses of the aboveresult, including: (1) a way of measuring the shapes of gravitationalpotentials of cooling flow clusters (which may, for example, be compared withthe results of the standard hydrostatic equilibrium method); (2) a simplemethod for constructing realistic analytic cluster models that include theeffects of radiative cooling; and (3) a test of the reliability of coolingroutines implemented in analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations.

astro-ph;0506571	semi-analytical dark matter halos and the jeans equation	although n-body studies of dark matter halos show that the density profiles,rho(r), are not simple power-laws, the quantity rho/sigma^3, where sigma(r) isthe velocity dispersion, is in fact a featureless power-law over ~3 decades inradius. in the first part of the paper we demonstrate, using the semi-analyticextended secondary infall model (esim), that the nearly scale-free nature ofrho/sigma^3 is a robust feature of virialized halos in equilibrium. byexamining the processes in common between numerical n-body and semi-analyticapproaches, we argue that the scale-free nature of rho/sigma^3 cannot be theresult of hierarchical merging, rather it must be an outcome of violentrelaxation. the empirical results of the first part of the paper motivate theanalytical work of the second part of the paper, where we use rho/sigma^3proportional to r^{-alpha} as an additional constraint in the isotropic jeansequation of hydrostatic equilibrium. our analysis shows that the constrainedjeans equation has different types of solutions, and in particular, it admits aunique ``periodic'' solution with alpha=1.9444. we derive the analyticexpression for this density profile, which asymptotes to inner and outerprofiles of rho ~ r^{-0.78}, and rho ~ r^{-3.44}, respectively.

astro-ph;0511768	an analytic investigation of the scatter in the integrated x-ray  properties of galaxy groups and clusters	(abridged) we revisit the scaling relationships between the dark matter massand observed x-ray luminosity and temperature of galaxy clusters and groups inthe local universe. specifically, we compare recent observations with analyticmodels of the intracluster medium in which the gas entropy distribution hasbeen shifted by a variable amount, k0, to investigate the origin of the scatterin these scaling relations, and its influence on the luminosity and temperaturefunctions. we find that variations in halo concentration or formation epoch(which might determine the time available for low entropy gas to cool out) areinsufficient to explain the amount of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation.instead, a range of entropy floors at a fixed halo mass, spanning approximately50 kev sq.cm to 700 kev sq.cm, is required to match the data. this range islikely related to the variance in heating and/or cooling efficiency from haloto halo. we demonstrate that these models are consistent with the observedtemperature and luminosity functions of clusters, if scatter in themass-luminosity relation is accounted for. finally, we present predictions forthe redshift evolution of these scaling relations and luminosity/temperaturefunctions. comparison with recent data at z&lt;0.7 shows reasonable agreement witha model that assumes a median entropy floor of k0=200 kev sq.cm. whenobservations are extended to group scales (kt &lt; 1 kev), this evolution willhave the potential to discriminate between an entropy floor that is independentof redshift (for example, in a preheating scenario) and one that depends on thecooling time of the halo.

astro-ph;0602566	suppressing cluster cooling flows by self-regulated heating from  spatially distributed population of agns	(abridged) existing models invoking agn activty to resolve the cooling flowconundrum in galaxy clusters focus exclusively on the role of the centralgalaxy. such models require fine-tuning of highly uncertain microscopictransport properties to distribute the thermal thermal over the entire clustercooling core. we propose that the icm is instead heated by multiple, spatiallydistributed agns. there is mounting observational evidence for multiple agns incluster environments. active agns drive bubbles into the icm. we identify threedistinct interactions between the bubble and the icm: (1) upon injection, thebubbles expand rapidly in situ to reach pressure equilibrium with theirsurroundings, generating shocks and waves whose dissipation is the principalsource of icm heating. (2) once inflated, the bubbles rise buoyantly at ratedetermined by a balance with the viscous drag force, which itself results insome additional heating. (3) rising bubbles expand and compress theirsurroundings. this process is adiabatic and does not contribute to anyadditional heating; rather, the increased icm density due to compressionenhances cooling. our model sidesteps the ``transport'' issue by relying on thespatially distributed galaxies to heat the cluster core. we include selfregulation in our model by linking agn activity in a galaxy to coolingcharacteristics of the surrounding icm. we use a spherically symmetricone-dimensional hydrodynamical code to carry out a preliminary studyillustrating the efficacy of the model. our self-regulating scenario predictsthat there should be enhanced agn activity of galaxies inside the coolingregions compared to galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster. this predictionremains to be confirmed or refuted by observations.

astro-ph;0606101	on the formation of extended galactic disks by tidally disrupted dwarf  galaxies	we explore the possibility that extended disks, such as that recentlydiscovered in m31, are the result of a single dwarf (10^9--10^10 msun)satellite merger. we carry out n-body simulations of dwarf nfw halos withembedded spheriodal stellar components on co-planar, prograde orbits in am31-like host galaxy. as the orbit decays due to dynamical friction and thesystem is disrupted, the stellar particles form an extended, exponentialdisk-like structure that spans the radial range 30--200 kpc once they haverelaxed. the disk scale-length correlates with the initial extent of thestellar component within the satellite halo: the more embedded the stars, thesmaller the resulting disk scale-length. if the progenitors start on circularorbits, the kinematics of the stars that make up the extended disk have anaverage rotational motion that is 30--50 km/s lower than the host's circularvelocity. for dwarf galaxies moving on highly eccentric orbits (e=0.7), thestellar debris exhibits a much lower rotational velocity. our results implythat extended galactic disks might be a generic feature of the hierarchicalformation of spiral galaxies such as m31 and the milky way.

astro-ph;0608560	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - i. dynamical evolution  and emergent transient structures	we report on the analysis of a suite of sph simulations (incorporatingcooling and star formation) of mergers involving idealised x-ray clusters whoseinitial conditions resemble relaxed clusters with cool compact cores observedby chandra and xmm. the simulations sample the most interesting, theoreticallyplausible, range of impact parameters and progenitor mass ratios. we find thatall mergers evolve via a common progression. we illustrate this progression inthe projected gas density, x-ray surface brightness, sz, temperature, and gasentropy maps. several different classes of transient ``cold front''-likefeatures can arise over the course of a merger. we find that all of theseclasses are present in chandra and xmm observations of merging systems andpropose a naming scheme for these features: ``comet-like'' tails, bridges,plumes, streams and edges. in none of the cases considered do the initial coolcompact cores of the primary and the secondary get destroyed during the courseof the mergers. we quantify the evolving morphology of our mergers usingcentroid variance, power ratios and offset between the x-ray and the projectedmass maps. we find that the centroid variance best captures the dynamical stateof the cluster. placing the system at z=0.1, we find that all easily identifiedobservable traces of the secondary disappear from a simulated 50 ks chandraimage following the second pericentric passage. the system, however, takesapproximately 2 additional gyrs to relax and virialize. temperaturefluctuations at the level of 20% can persist in the final systems well past thepoint of virialization, suggesting that that the existence of temperaturefluctuations, in and of themselves, do not necessarily indicate a disturbed orunrelaxed system.

astro-ph;0609784	density profiles of collisionless equilibria. ii. anisotropic spherical  systems	it has long been realized that dark matter halos formed in cosmologicaln-body simulations are characterized by density profiles rho(r) that, whensuitably scaled, have similar shapes. additionally, combining the density andvelocity dispersion profiles sigma(r), each of which have decidedlynonpower-law shapes, leads to quantity rho/(sigma^3) that is a power-law inradius over 3 orders of magnitude in radius. halos' velocity anisotropyprofiles beta(r) vary from isotropic near the centers of halos to quiteradially anisotropic near the virial radius. finally, there appears to be anearly linear correlation between beta and the logarithmic density slope gammafor a wide variety of halos. this work is part of a continuing investigation ofthe above interrelationships and their origins using analytical andsemi-analytical techniques. our finding suggest that the nearly linearbeta--gamma relationship is not just another expression of scale-freerho/(sigma^3) behavior. we also note that simultaneously reproducing densityand anisotropy profiles like those found in simulations requires beta(r) andgamma(r) to have similar shapes, leading to nearly linear beta--gammacorrelations. this work suggests that the beta--gamma and power-lawrho/(sigma^3) relations have distinct physical origins.

astro-ph;0612354	models for jet power in elliptical galaxies: a case for rapidly spinning  black holes	the power of jets from black holes are expected to depend on both the spin ofthe black hole and the structure of the accretion disk in the region of thelast stable orbit. we investigate these dependencies using two differentphysical models for the jet power: the classical blandford-znajek (bz) modeland a hybrid model developed by meier. in the bz case, the jets are powered bymagnetic fields directly threading the spinning black hole while in the hybridmodel, the jet energy is extracted from both the accretion disk as well as theblack hole via magnetic fields anchored to the accretion flow inside andoutside the hole's ergosphere. the hybrid model takes advantage of thestrengths of both the blandford-payne and bz mechanisms, while avoiding themore controversial features of the latter. we develop these models more fullyto account for general relativistic effects and to focus on advection-dominatedaccretion flows (adaf) for which the jet power is expected to be a significantfraction of the accreted rest mass energy.  we apply the models to elliptical galaxies, in order to see if these modelscan explain the observed correlation between the bondi accretion rates and thetotal jet powers. for typical values of the disk viscosity parameteralpha~0.04-0.3 and mass accretion rates consistent with adaf modelexpectations, we find that the observed correlation requires j&gt;0.9; i.e., itimplies that the black holes are rapidly spinning. our results suggest that thecentral black holes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidlyrotating in order to drive jets powerful enough to heat the intracluster mediumand quench cooling flows.

astro-ph;0612392	modelling the jet power in elliptical galaxies: support for rapidly  spinning black holes	recently, allen et al. measured a tight correlation between the bondiaccretion rates and jet powers of the nuclei of nearby x-ray luminouselliptical galaxies. we employ two models of jet powering to understand theabove correlation and derive constraints on the spin and accretion rate of thecentral black holes. the first is the blandford-znajek model, in which the spinenergy of the hole is extracted as jet power; the second model is an hybridversion of the blandford-payne and blandford-znajek processes, in which theoutflow is generated in the inner parts of the accretion disk. we assumeadvection-dominated accretion flows (adaf) and account for general relativisticeffects. our modelling implies that for typical values of the disk viscosityparameter alpha~0.01-1 the tight correlation implies the narrow range of spinsj~0.7-1 and accretion rates mdot(r_ms)~(0.01-1) mdot_bondi. our results providesupport for the "spin paradigm" scenario and suggest that the central blackholes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidly rotating in order todrive radio jets powerful enough to quench the cooling flows.

astro-ph;0701335	modelling shock heating in cluster mergers: i. moving beyond the  spherical accretion model	(abridged) the thermal history of the intracluster medium (icm) is complex.heat input from cluster mergers, agn, and galaxy winds offsets and may evenhalt the cooling of the icm. consequently, the processes that set theproperties of the icm play a key role in determining how galaxies form. in thispaper we focus on the shock heating of the icm during cluster mergers, with theeventual aim of incorporating this mechanism into semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation.  we use a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to track the evolution of the icmin idealised two-body mergers. we find the heating of the icm can be understoodrelatively simply by considering the evolution of the gas entropy during themergers. we examine the processes that generate the entropy in order tounderstand why previous analytic shock heating models failed. we find that: (1)the energy that is thermalised in the collision greatly exceeds the kineticenergy available when the systems first touch. the smaller system penetratesdeep into the potential well before it is disrupted. (2) for unequal massmergers, most of the energy is thermalised in the more massive component. theheating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of thefinal system. (3) the bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinctepisodes. the first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock waveis generated that propagates outwards from the centre. this causes the combinedsystem to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. the secondepisode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. thisrevised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physicalunderstanding of cosmological gas simulations.

astro-ph;0701586	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - ii. effects on global  x-ray and sz properties and their scaling relations	we use the suite of simulations presented in poole et al (2006) to examineglobal x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) observables for systems of mergingrelaxed x-ray clusters. in all of the scaling relations generated from theproperties we have studied, we observe a generic evolution (in good qualitativeagreement with previous authors): a rapid transient roughly along the massscaling relations, a subsequent slow drift across the scatter untilvirialization, followed by a slow evolution along and up the mass scalingrelations as cooling recovers in the cluster cores. however, this drift is notsufficient to account for the observed scatter in the scaling relations. wealso study the effects of mergers on several theoretical temperature measuresof the intracluster medium: emission weighted measures (t_ew), thespectroscopic-like measure proposed by mazzotta et al (2004; t_sl) and plasmamodel fits to the integrated spectrum of the system (t_spec). we find that t_sltracks t_spec for the entire duration of our mergers, illustrating that itremains a good tool for observational comparison even for highly disturbedsystems. furthermore, the transient temperature increases produced during firstand second pericentric passage are 15-40% larger for t_ew than for t_sl ort_spec. this suggests that the effects of transient temperature increases onsigma_8 and omega_m derived by randall et al (2002) are over estimated. lastly,we examine the x-ray sz proxy proposed by kravtsov et al (2006) and find thatthe tight mass scaling relation they predict remains secure through the entireduration of a merger event, independent of projection effects.

astro-ph;9402003	shear fields and the evolution of galactic-scale density peaks	we present preliminary results of our investigation into the influence ofshear fields on the evolution of galactic scale fluctuations in a primordialgaussian random density field. specifically, we study how the matter associatedwith a galaxy-scale peak evolves, to determine whether the shear can affect thepeak's ability to form a virialized structure. we find that the evolution ofthe mass distribution in the immediate surroundings of $\geq 1\sigma$ initialdensity peaks is sensitive to the nature and magnitude of the shear. its finalfate and configuration spans a plethora of possibilities, ranging fromaccretion onto the peak to complete disruption. on the other hand, the massdefining the peak itself always tends to form a virialized object, though agiven galaxy-scale peak need not necessarily form only one halo. furthermore,galaxy-size halos need not necessarily be associated with initial galaxy-scaledensity peaks. under certain conditions, the shear field is capable of breakingup a single primordial peak into two (and perhaps, more) distinct halos, or ofpromoting the growth of smaller-scale peaks into galaxy-size halos.

astro-ph;9405063	gravitational lensing in clusters of galaxies: new clues regarding the  dynamics of intracluster gas	long arcs in clusters of galaxies, produced by gravitational lensing, can beused to estimate the mass interior to the arcs and therefore, constrain thecluster mass distribution. the radial density distribution of the intraclustergas (icm) can be extracted from the x-ray surface brightness observations. ifthe gas temperature is also known, it is then possible to probe the dynamicalstate of the gas and test whether the icm is in hydro- static equilibriumwithin the gravitational potential of the cluster as a result of thermalpressure support. we analyze three clusters that exhibit large arcs, whosex-ray surface brightness profiles have been observed, and whose gastemperatures have been determined. in two of the clusters, a2218 and a1689, thecentral mass implied by lensing is a factor of $2$--$2.5$ too large for the gasat the observed temperature to be in hydrostatic equilibrium solely due tothermal pressure support. in other words, if we accept the mass estimatederived from the lensing analysis and demand that the x-ray surface brightnessprofile be consistent with the observations, the required gas temperature is afactor of $2$--$2.5$ higher than observed. the results for the third cluster,a2163 (the most luminous and the hottest cluster known), are more ambiguous.the discrepancy between the x-ray and the lensing mass estimates arise becausethe presence of arcs imply a highly concentrated cluster mass distributionwhereas the observed x-ray profiles imply a more extended mass distribution.the large x-ray core radii are not the result of the limited resolution of thex-ray detectors. we consider various possibilities that could account for thediscrepancy.

astro-ph;9508156	faint blue galaxies and the epoch of dwarf-galaxy formation	both theoretical and observational lines of reasoning suggest that the veryfaint (b &gt; 24) galaxies seen in deep images of the sky are small low-massgalaxies that experienced starburst at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 and have since faded into lowluminosity, low surface brightness objects. we scrutinize this hypothesis inorder to determine whether such a model can account for the observedwavelength- dependent number counts as well as redshift, color and sizedistributions. low-mass galaxies generically arise in large numbers inhierarchical clustering scenarios. although expected to form at high redshifts,the metagalactic uv radiation at high redshifts will delay significant starformation (sf) activity in these galaxies until z &lt; 1. we combine these twoelements, along with simple assumptions about sf histories and efficiency, toconstruct our bursting dwarf model. we further augment the model with aphenomenological prescription for the formation and evolution of the locallyobserved galaxies, and use spectral synthesis/monte-carlo methods to generaterealistic galaxy catalogs for comparison with observations. for reasonablechoices of sf histories for the low-mass galaxies, the model results are invery good agreement with the results of the deep galaxy surveys. moreover, theresults of deep hst imaging studies, of gravitational lensing and galaxyclustering studies, and of regular galaxies at intermediate/high redshiftsfavor the dwarf-dominated model. we also discuss some generic predictions ofthe model. for example, the model predicts that the k-band number counts shouldbegin to rise more steeply at magnitudes fainter than k_{ab} = 24-25 and thelocal field luminosity function should steepen at magnitudes fainter than m_b\approx -16. we also consider the possibility of detecting the low surface

astro-ph;9608138	statistics of gravitational microlensing magnification. i.  two-dimensional lens distribution	(abridged) in this paper we refine the theory of microlensing for a planardistribution of point masses. we derive the macroimage magnificationdistribution p(a) at high magnification (a-1 &gt;&gt; tau^2) for a low optical depth(tau &lt;&lt; 1) lens distribution by modeling the illumination pattern as asuperposition of the patterns due to individual ``point mass plus weak shear''lenses. we show that a point mass plus weak shear lens produces an astroid-shaped caustic and that the magnification cross-section obeys a simple scalingproperty. by convolving this cross-section with the shear distribution, weobtain a caustic-induced feature in p(a) which also exhibits a simple scalingproperty. this feature results in a 20% enhancement in p(a) at a approx 2/tau.in the low magnification (a-1 &lt;&lt; 1) limit, the macroimage consists of a brightprimary image and a large number of faint secondary images formed close to eachof the point masses. taking into account the correlations between the primaryand secondary images, we derive p(a) for low a. the low-a distribution has apeak of amplitude ~ 1/tau^2 at a-1 ~ tau^2 and matches smoothly to the high-adistribution. we combine the high- and low-a results and obtain a practicalsemi-analytic expression for p(a). this semi-analytic distribution is inqualitative agreement with previous numerical results, but the latter showstronger caustic-induced features at moderate a for tau as small as 0.1. weresolve this discrepancy by re-examining the criterion for low optical depth. asimple argument shows that the fraction of caustics of individual lenses thatmerge with those of their neighbors is approx 1-exp(-8 tau). for tau=0.1, thefraction is surprisingly high: approx 55%. for the purpose of computing p(a) inthe manner we did, low optical depth corresponds to tau &lt;&lt; 1/8.

astro-ph;9608139	statistics of gravitational microlensing magnification. ii.  three-dimensional lens distribution	in paper i we studied the theory of gravitational microlensing for a planardistribution of point masses. in this second paper, we extend the analysis to athree-dimensional lens distribution. first we study the lensing properties ofthree-dimensional lens distributions by considering in detail the criticalcurves, the caustics, the illumination patterns, and the magnificationcross-sections sigma(a) of multiplane configurations with two, three, and fourpoint masses. for n_\ast point masses that are widely separated in lagrangianspace, we find that there are ~ 2^{n_\ast} - 1 critical curves in total, butthat only ~ n_\ast of these produce prominent caustic-induced features at thehigh magnification end of sigma(a).  in the case of a low optical depth random distribution of point masses, weshow that the multiplane lens equation near a point mass can be reduced to thesingle plane equation of a point mass perturbed by weak shear. this allows usto calculate the caustic-induced feature in the macroimage magnificationdistribution p(a) as a weighted sum of the semi-analytic feature derived inpaper i for a planar lens distribution. the resulting semi-analyticcaustic-induced feature is similar to the feature in the planar case, but itdoes not have any simple scaling properties, and it is shifted to highermagnification. the semi-analytic distribution is compared to the results ofprevious numerical simulations for optical depth tau ~ 0.1, and they are inbetter agreement than a similar comparison in the planar case. we explain thisby estimating the fraction of caustics of individual lenses that merge withthose of their neighbors. for tau=0.1, the fraction is approx 20%, much lessthan the approx 55% for the planar case.

astro-ph;9704076	the delayed formation of dwarf galaxies	one of the largest uncertainties in understanding the effect of a backgrounduv field on galaxy formation is the intensity and evolution of the radiationfield with redshift. this work attempts to shed light on this issue bycomputing the quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium states of gas in sphericallysymmetric dark matter halos (roughly corresponding to dwarf galaxies) as afunction of the amplitude of the background uv field. we integrate the fullequations of radiative transfer, heating, cooling and non-equilibrium chemistryfor nine species: h, h^+, h^-,h_2, h_2^+, he, he^+, he^{++}, and e^-. as theamplitude of the uv background is decreased the gas in the core of the dwarfgoes through three stages characterized by the predominance of ionized (h^+),neutral (h) and molecular (h_2) hydrogen. characterizing the gas state of adwarf galaxy with the radiation field allows us to estimate its behavior for avariety of models of the background uv flux. our results indicate that atypical radiation field can easily delay the collapse of gas in haloscorresponding to 1-$\sigma$ cdm perturbations with circular velocities lessthan 30 km/s.

astro-ph;9801057	the hubble deep field and the disappearing dwarf galaxies	several independent lines of reasoning suggest that many of the very faint (b&gt; 24) blue galaxies are low-mass objects that experienced a short epoch of starformation at redshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1 and have since faded into low luminosity,low surface brightness objects. such a scenario, which arises naturally if starformation in dwarf galaxies is delayed by photoionisation due to themetagalactic uv radiation field, provides an attractive way to reconcile theeinstein-de sitter cosmological model to the steeply rising galaxy countsobserved at blue wavelengths. the hubble deep field (hdf) images provide astringent test of this model. we compare the babul &amp; ferguson (1996) model tothe data by constructing using simulated images and carrying out sourcedetection and photometry for the simulations in the same way they were carriedout for the real data. we compare the model predictions for the counts, sizes,and colours of galaxies observed in the hdf, and to the predictions from a lowq_0 pure-luminosity-evolution (ple) model. both models fail to reproduce theobservations. the low q_0 model predicts far more lyman-break ``dropouts'' thanare seen in the data. the fading dwarf model predicts too many remnants: fadeddwarf galaxies in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 that should be detectable inthe hdf as low-surface brightness red objects but are not seen. if fading dwarfgalaxies are to reconcile the einstein-de sitter geometry to the counts, thenthe dwarf population must (a) form earlier than z ~ 1, with a higher initialluminosity; (b) have an initial-mass function more heavily weighted towardmassive stars than the salpeter imf; or (c) expand much more than assumedduring the supernova wind phase.

astro-ph;9809159	pre-heated isentropic gas in groups of galaxies	we confirm that the standard assumption of isothermal, shock-heated gas incluster potentials is unable to reproduce the observed x-ray luminosity-temperature relation of groups of galaxies. as an alternative, we construct aphysically motivated model for the adiabatic collapse of pre-heated gas into anisothermal potential that improves upon the original work of kaiser (1991). theluminosity and temperature of the gas is calculated, assuming an appropriatedistribution of halo formation times and radiation due to both bremsstrahlungand recombination processes. this model successfully reproduces the slope anddispersion of the luminosity-temperature relation of galaxy groups. we alsopresent calculations of the temperature and luminosity functions for galaxygroups under the prescription of this model. this model makes two strongpredictions for haloes with total masses m&lt;10^13 m_sun, which are not yettestable with current data: (1) the gas mass fraction will increase in directproportion to the halo mass; (2) the gas temperature will be larger than thevirial temperature of the mass. the second effect is strong enough that groupmasses determined from gas temperatures will be overestimated by about an orderof magnitude if it is assumed that the gas temperature is the virialtemperature. the entropy required to match observations can be obtained byheating the gas at the turnaround time, for example, to about 3 x 10^6 k atz=1, which is too high to be generated by a normal rate of supernovaexplosions. this model breaks down on the scale of low mass clusters, but thisis an acceptable limitation, as we expect accretion shocks to contributesignificantly to the entropy of the gas in such objects.
