0907.3471	mass measurement of a single unseen star and planetary detection  efficiency for ogle 2007-blg-050	we analyze ogle-2007-blg-050, a high magnification microlensing event (a ~432) whose peak occurred on 2 may, 2007, with pronounced finite-source andparallax effects. we compute planet detection efficiencies for this event inorder to determine its sensitivity to the presence of planets around the lensstar. both finite-source and parallax effects permit a measurement of theangular einstein radius \theta_e = 0.48 +/- 0.01 mas and the parallax \pi_e =0.12 +/- 0.03, leading to an estimate of the lens mass m = 0.50 +/- 0.14 m_sunand its distance to the observer d_l = 5.5 +/- 0.4 kpc. this is only the seconddetermination of a reasonably precise (&lt;30%) mass estimate for an isolatedunseen object, using any method. this allows us to calculate the planetarydetection efficiency in physical units (r_\perp, m_p), where r_\perp is theprojected planet-star separation and m_p is the planet mass. when computingplanet detection efficiency, we did not find any planetary signature and ourdetection efficiency results reveal significant sensitivity to neptune-massplanets, and to a lesser extent earth-mass planets in some configurations.indeed, jupiter and neptune-mass planets are excluded with a high confidencefor a large projected separation range between the planet and the lens star,respectively [0.6 - 10] and [1.4 - 4] au, and earth-mass planets are excludedwith a 10% confidence in the lensing zone, i.e. [1.8 - 3.1] au.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1104.5094	ogle-2005-blg-018: characterization of full physical and orbital  parameters of a gravitational binary lens	we present the analysis result of a gravitational binary-lensing eventogle-2005-blg-018. the light curve of the event is characterized by 2 adjacentstrong features and a single weak feature separated from the strong features.the light curve exhibits noticeable deviations from the best-fit model based onstandard binary parameters. to explain the deviation, we test models includingvarious higher-order effects of the motions of the observer, source, and lens.from this, we find that it is necessary to account for the orbital motion ofthe lens in describing the light curve. from modeling of the light curveconsidering the parallax effect and keplerian orbital motion, we are able tomeasure not only the physical parameters but also a complete orbital solutionof the lens system. it is found that the event was produced by a binary lenslocated in the galactic bulge with a distance $6.7\pm 0.3$ kpc from the earth.the individual lens components with masses $0.9\pm 0.3\ m_\odot$ and $0.5\pm0.1\ m_\odot$ are separated with a semi-major axis of $a=2.5 \pm 1.0$ au andorbiting each other with a period $p=3.1 \pm 1.3$ yr. the event demonstratesthat it is possible to extract detailed information about binary lens systemsfrom well-resolved lensing light curves.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1111.4032	characterizing lenses and lensed stars of high-magnification single-lens  gravitational microlensing events with lenses passing over source stars	we present the analysis of the light curves of 9 high-magnificationsingle-lens gravitational microlensing events with lenses passing over sourcestars, including ogle-2004-blg-254, moa-2007-blg-176,moa-2007-blg-233/ogle-2007-blg-302, moa-2009-blg-174, moa-2010-blg-436,moa-2011-blg-093, moa-2011-blg-274, ogle-2011-blg-0990/moa-2011-blg-300, andogle-2011-blg-1101/moa-2011-blg-325. for all events, we measure the linearlimb-darkening coefficients of the surface brightness profile of source starsby measuring the deviation of the light curves near the peak affected by thefinite-source effect. for 7 events, we measure the einstein radii and thelens-source relative proper motions. among them, 5 events are found to haveeinstein radii less than 0.2 mas, making the lenses candidates of very low-massstars or brown dwarfs. for moa-2011-blg-274, especially, the small einsteinradius of $\theta_{\rm e}\sim 0.08$ mas combined with the short time scale of$t_{\rm e}\sim 2.7$ days suggests the possibility that the lens is afree-floating planet. for moa-2009-blg-174, we measure the lens parallax andthus uniquely determine the physical parameters of the lens. we also find thatthe measured lens mass of $\sim 0.84\ m_\odot$ is consistent with that of astar blended with the source, suggesting that the blend is likely to be thelens. although we find planetary signals for none of events, we provideexclusion diagrams showing the confidence levels excluding the existence of aplanet as a function of the separation and mass ratio.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1402.4219	detection of bridge emission above 50 gev from the crab pulsar with the  magic telescopes	the crab pulsar is the only astronomical pulsed source detected at very highenergy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma-rays. the emission mechanism of vhe pulsation isnot yet fully understood, although several theoretical models have beenproposed. in order to test the new models, we measured the light curve and thespectra of the crab pulsar with high precision by means of deep observations.we analyzed 135 hours of selected magic data taken between 2009 and 2013 instereoscopic mode. in order to discuss the spectral shape in connection withlower energies, 4.6 years of {\it fermi}-lat data were also analyzed. the knowntwo pulses per period were detected with a significance of $8.0 \sigma$ and$12.6 \sigma$. in addition, significant emission was found between the twopulses with $6.2 \sigma$. we discovered the bridge emission above 50 gevbetween the two main pulses. this emission can not be explained with theexisting theories. these data can be used for testing new theoretical models.

1405.6074	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula 3c 58 by  magic	the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) 3c 58 is one of the historical very-high-energy(vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray source candidates. it is energized by one of thehighest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of crab pulsar) and it has beencompared to the crab nebula due to their morphological similarities. thisobject was previously observed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(whipple, veritas and magic), although not detected, with an upper limit of2.4% crab unit (c.u.) at vhe. it was detected by fermi-lat with a spectrumextending beyond 100 gev. we analyzed 81 hours of 3c 58 data taken with themagic telescopes and we detected vhe gamma-ray emission with a significance of5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% c.u. above 1 tev. the differentialenergy spectrum between 400 gev and 10 tev is well described by a power-lawfunction d\phi/de=f_0(e/1tev)^{-gamma} withf_0=(2.0\pm0.4_{stat}\pm0.6_{sys})\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}tev^{-1} andgamma=2.4\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{sys}. the skymap is compatible with an unresolvedsource. we report the first significant detection of pwn 3c 58 at tev energies.according to our results 3c 58 is the least luminous vhe gamma-ray pwn everdetected at vhe and the one with the lowest flux at vhe to date. we compare ourresults with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electronsup-scatter photon fields. the best representation favors a distance to the pwnof 2 kpc and far infrared (fir) comparable to cmb photon fields. if we consideran unexpectedly high fir density, the data can also be reproduced by modelsassuming a 3.2 kpc distance. a low magnetic field, far from equipartition, isrequired to explain the vhe data. hadronic contribution from the hostingsupernova remnant (snr) requires unrealistic energy budget given the density ofthe medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the snr as origin of the vhegamma-ray emission.

1406.6892	measurement of the crab nebula spectrum over three decades in energy  with the magic telescopes	the magic stereoscopic system collected 69 hours of crab nebula data betweenoctober 2009 and april 2011. analysis of this data sample using the latestimprovements in the magic stereoscopic software provided an unprecedentedprecision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gammarays. we derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 gevup to almost 30 tev with 5 bins per energy decade. at low energies, magicresults, combined with fermi-lat data, show a flat and broad inverse comptonpeak. the overall fit to the data between 1 gev and 30 tev is not welldescribed by a log-parabola function. we find that a modified log-parabolafunction with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description ofthe data ($\chi^2=35/26$). using systematic uncertainties of red the magic andfermi-lat measurements we determine the position of the inverse compton peak tobe at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) gev, which is the most preciseestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. there is nohint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 gevwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. we considerthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectralenergy distribution of the crab nebula. the constant b-field model cannotsatisfactorily reproduce the vhe spectral measurements presented in this work,having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed ic peak.most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of themagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. on the other hand, thetime-dependent 1d spectral model provides a good fit of the new vhe resultswhen considering a 80 {\mu}g magnetic field. however, it fails to match thedata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1409.3389	first broadband characterization and redshift determination of the vhe  blazar magic j2001+439	we aim to characterize the broadband emission from 2fgl j2001.1+4352, whichhas been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar mg4 j200112+4352. based onits gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very highenergy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-ray emitter. the source was observed with magicfirst in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.the magic observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.the object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during theyears 2010 and 2011. the source, named magic j2001+439, is detected for thefirst time at vhe with magic at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (e &gt;70 gev) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 july 16. themulti-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with thehighest amplitude of variability in the x-ray and vhe bands. we also organizeddeep imaging optical observations with the nordic optical telescope in 2013 todetermine the source redshift. we determine for the first time the redshift ofthis bl lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazaractivity. using the observational evidence that the luminosities of bl lac hostgalaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-0.04. additionally, we use the fermi-lat and magic gamma-ray spectra to providean independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. using the former (moreaccurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with aone-zone ssc model for different activity states and interpret the few-daytimescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component ofthe electron energy distribution.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1510.07048	teraelectronvolt pulsed emission from the crab pulsar detected by magic	aims: to investigate the extension of the very-high-energy spectral tail ofthe crab pulsar at energies above 400 gev. methods: we analyzed $\sim$320 hoursof good quality data of crab with the magic telescope, obtained from february2007 until april 2014. results: we report the most energetic pulsed emissionever detected from the crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 tev. the pulse profileshows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the gev energyrange. the spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functionsfrom 70 gev up to 1.5 tev and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above10 gev by the large area telescope (lat) on board of the fermi satellite. whenmaking a joint fit of the lat and magic data, above 10 gev, the photon indicesof the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. conclusions: we measured with the magictelescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. such tevpulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a lorentz factorof at least $5\times 10^6$. these results strongly suggest ic scattering offlow energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production regionin the vicinity of the light cylinder.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.
