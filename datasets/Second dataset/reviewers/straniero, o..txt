0902.0243	evolution, nucleosynthesis and yields of low mass agb stars	the envelope of thermally pulsing agb stars undergoing periodic thirddredge-up episodes is enriched in both light and heavy elements, the ashes of acomplex internal nucleosynthesis involving p, alpha and n captures overhundreds of stable and unstable isotopes. in this paper, new models of low-massagb stars (2 msun), with metallicity ranging between z=0.0138 (the solar one)and z=0.0001, are presented. main features are: i) a full nuclear network (fromh to bi) coupled to the stellar evolution code, ii) a massloss-period-luminosity relation, based on available data for long periodvariables, and ii) molecular and atomic opacities for c- and/or n-enhancedmixtures, appropriate for the chemical modifications of the envelope caused bythe third dredge up. for each model a detailed description of the physical andchemical evolution is presented; moreover, we present a uniform set of yields,comprehensive of all chemical species (from hydrogen to bismuth). the mainnucleosynthesis site is the thin 13c pocket, which forms in the core-envelopetransition region after each third dredge up episode. the formation of this 13cpockets is the principal by-product of the introduction of a new algorithm,which shapes the velocity profile of convective elements at the inner border ofthe convective envelope: both the physical grounds and the calibration of thealgorithm are discussed in detail. the final surface compositions of thevarious models reflect the differences in the initial iron-seed content and inthe physical structure of agb stars belonging to different stellar populations.the agreement with the observed [hs/ls] index observed in intrinsic c stars atdifferent [fe/h] is generally good.

0706.2100	molecular opacities for low-mass metal-poor agb stars undergoing the  third dredge up	the concomitant overabundances of c, n and s-process elements are commonlyascribed to the complex interplay of nucleosynthesis, mixing and mass losstaking place in asymptotic giant branch stars. at low metallicity, theenhancement of c and/or n may be up to 1000 times larger than the original ironcontent and significantly affects the stellar structure and its evolution. forthis reason, the interpretation of the already available and still growingamount of data concerning c-rich metal-poor stars belonging to our galaxy aswell as to dwarf spheroidal galaxies would require reliable agb stellar modelsfor low and very low metallicities. in this paper we address the question ofcalculation and use of appropriate opacity coefficients, which take intoaccount the c enhancement caused by the third dredge up. a possible nenhancement, caused by the cool bottom process or by the engulfment of protonsinto the convective zone generated by a thermal pulse and the subsequent hugethird dredge up, is also considered. basing on up-to-date stellar models, weillustrate the changes induced by the use of these opacity on the physical andchemical properties expected for these stars.

0909.2742	very low mass white dwarfs with a c-o core	the lower limit for the mass of white dwarfs (wds) with c-o core is commonlyassumed to be roughly 0.5 msun. as a consequence, wds of lower masses areusually identified as he-core remnants. however, when the initial mass of theprogenitor star is in between 1.8 and 3 msun, which corresponds to the socalled red giant (rgb) phase transition, the mass of the h-exhausted core atthe tip of the rgb is 0.3 &lt; m_h/msun &lt; 0.5. prompted by this well known resultof stellar evolution theory, we investigate the possibility to form c-o wdswith mass m &lt; 0.5 msun. the pre-wd evolution of stars with initial mass ofabout 2.3 msun, undergoing anomalous mass-loss episodes during the rgb phaseand leading to the formation of wds with he-rich or co-rich cores have beencomputed. the cooling sequences of the resulting wds are also described. weshow that the minimum mass for a c-o wd is about 0.33 msun, so that both he andc-o core wds can exist in the mass range 0.33-0.5 msun. the models computed forthe present paper provide the theoretical tools to indentify the observationalcounterpart of very low mass remnants with a c-o core among those commonlyascribed to the he-core wd population in the progressively growing sample ofobserved wds of low mass. moreover, we show that the central he-burning phaseof the stripped progeny of the 2.3 msun star lasts longer and longer as thetotal mass decreases. in particular, the m= 0.33 msun model takes about 800 myrto exhausts its central helium, which is more than three time longer than thevalue of the standard 2.3 msun star: it is, by far, the longest core-he burninglifetime. finally, we find the occurrence of gravonuclear instabilities duringthe he-burning shell phase.

0909.3454	interpretation of cemp(s) and cemp(s + r) stars with agb models	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars play a fundamental role in the s-processnucleosynthesis during their thermal pulsing phase. the theoretical predictionsobtained by agb models at different masses, s-process efficiencies, dilutionfactors and initial r-enrichment, are compared with spectroscopic observationsof carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars enriched in s-process elements, cemp(s),collected from the literature. we discuss here five stars as example, cs22880-074, cs 22942-019, cs 29526-110, he 0202-2204, and lp 625-44. all theseobjects lie on the main-sequence or on the giant phase, clearly before thetp-agb stage: the hypothesis of mass transfer from an agb companion, wouldexplain the observed s-process enhancement. cs 29526-110 and lp 625-44 arecemp(s+r) objects, and are interpreted assuming that the molecular cloud, fromwhich the binary system formed, was already enriched in r-process elements bysnii pollution. in several cases, the observed s-process distribution may beaccounted for agb models of different initial masses with proper 13c-pocketefficiency and dilution factor. na (and mg), produced via the neutron capturechain starting from 22ne, may provide an indicator of the initial agb mass.

0909.5560	barium stars: theoretical interpretation	barium stars are extrinsic asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. they presentthe s-enhancement characteristic for agb and post-agb stars, but are in anearlier evolutionary stage (main sequence dwarfs, subgiants, red giants). theyare believed to form in binary systems, where a more massive companion evolvedfaster, produced the s-elements during its agb phase, polluted the presentbarium star through stellar winds and became a white dwarf. the samples ofbarium stars of allen &amp; barbuy (2006) and of smiljanic et al. (2007) areanalysed here. spectra of both samples were obtained at high-resolution andhigh s/n. we compare these observations with agb nucleosynthesis models usingdifferent initial masses and a spread of 13c-pocket efficiencies. once aconsistent solution is found for the whole elemental distribution ofabundances, a proper dilution factor is applied. this dilution is explained bythe fact that the s-rich material transferred from the agb to the nowadaysobserved stars is mixed with the envelope of the accretor. we also analyse themass transfer process, and obtain the wind velocity for giants and subgiantswith known orbital period. we find evidence that thermohaline mixing is actinginside main sequence dwarfs and we present a method for estimating its depth.

1001.5376	s-process in low metallicity stars. i. theoretical predictions	a large sample of carbon enhanced metal-poor stars enriched in s-processelements (cemp-s) have been observed in the galactic halo. these stars of lowmass (m ~ 0.9 msun) are located on the main-sequence or the red giant phase,and do not undergo third dredge-up (tdu) episodes. the s-process enhancement ismost plausibly due to accretion in a binary system from a more massivecompanion when on the asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase (now a white dwarf).in order to interpret the spectroscopic observations, updated agb models areneeded to follow in detail the s-process nucleosynthesis. we presentnucleosynthesis calculations based on agb stellar models obtained with franec(frascati raphson-newton evolutionary code) for low initial stellar masses andlow metallicities. for a given metallicity, a wide spread in the abundances ofthe s-process elements is obtained by varying the amount of 13c and its profilein the pocket, where the 13c(a, n)16o reaction is the major neutron source,releasing neutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase. weaccount also for the second neutron source 22ne(a, n)25mg, partially activatedduring convective thermal pulses. we discuss the surface abundance of elementsfrom carbon to bismuth, for agb models of initial masses m = 1.3 -- 2 msun, lowmetallicities ([fe/h] from -1 down to -3.6) and for different 13c-pocketsefficiencies. in particular we analyse the relative behaviour of the threes-process peaks: light-s (ls at magic neutron number n = 50), heavy-s (hs at n= 82) and lead (n = 126). two s-process indicators, [hs/ls] and [pb/hs], areneeded in order to characterise the s-process distribution. in the onlinematerial, we provide a set of data tables with surface predictions. ...

1002.0681	metallicity as a source of dispersion in the snia bolometric light curve  luminosity-width relationship	the recognition that the metallicity of type ia supernova (snia) progenitorsmight bias their use for cosmological applications has led to an increasinginterest in its role on the shaping of snia light curves. we explore thesensitivity of the synthesized mass of 56ni, m(56ni), to the progenitormetallicity starting from pre-main sequence models with masses m0 = 2 - 7 m_sunand metallicities z = 1e-5 - 0.10. the interplay between convective mixing andcarbon burning during the simmering phase eventually rises the neutron excessand leads to a smaller 56ni yield, but does not change substantially thedependence of m(56ni) on z. uncertain attributes of the wd, like the centraldensity, have a minor effect on m(56ni). our main results are: 1) a sizableamount of 56 ni is synthesized during incomplete si-burning, which leads to astronger dependence of m(56ni) on z than obtained by assuming that 56ni isproduced in material that burns fully to nuclear statistical equilibrium; 2) inone-dimensional delayed detonation simulations a composition dependence of thedeflagration-to-detonation transition density gives a non-linear relationshipbetween m(56ni) and z, and predicts a luminosity larger than previously thoughtat low metallicities (however, the progenitor metallicity alone cannot explainthe whole observational scatter of snia luminosities), and 3) an accuratemeasurement of the slope of the hubble residuals vs metallicity for a largeenough data set of snia might give clues to the physics ofdeflagration-to-detonation transition in thermonuclear explosions.

1005.3549	on the need for deep mixing in agb stars of low mass	the photospheres of low-mass red giants show cno isotopic abundances that arenot satisfactorily accounted for by canonical stellar models. the same is truefor the measurements of these isotopes and of the $^{26}$al/$^{27}$al ratio inpresolar grains of circumstellar origin. non-convective mixing, occurringduring both red giant branch (rgb) and asymptotic giant branch (agb) stages isthe explanation commonly invoked to account for the above evidence. recently,the need for such mixing phenomena on the agb was questioned, and chemicalanomalies usually attributed to them were suggested to be formed in earlierphases. we have therefore re-calculated extra-mixing effects in low mass starsfor both the rgb and agb stages, in order to verify the above claims. ourresults contradict them; we actually confirm that slow transport below theconvective envelope occurs also on the agb. this is required primarily by theoxygen isotopic mix and the $^{26}$al content of presolar oxide grains. otherpieces of evidence exist, in particular from the isotopic ratios of carbonstars of type n, or c(n), in the galaxy and in the lmc, as well as of sicgrains of agb origin. we further show that, when extra-mixing occurs in the rgbphases of population i stars above about 1.2 $m_{\odot}$, this consumes $^3$hein the envelope, probably preventing the occurrence of thermohaline diffusionon the agb. therefore, we argue that other extra-mixing mechanisms should beactive in those final evolutionary phases.

1006.5281	new experimental study of low-energy (p,gamma) resonances in magnesium  isotopes	proton captures on mg isotopes play an important role in the mg-al cycleactive in stellar h shell burning. in particular, the strengths of low-energyresonances with e &lt; 200 kev in 25mg(p,gamma)26al determine the production of26al and a precise knowledge of these nuclear data is highly desirable.absolute measurements at such low-energies are often very difficult andhampered by gamma-ray background as well as changing target stoichiometryduring the measurements. the latter problem can be partly avoided using higherenergy resonances of the same reaction as a normalization reference. hence theparameters of suitable resonances have to be studied with adequate precision.in the present work we report on new measurements of the resonance strengthsomega_gamma of the e = 214, 304, and 326 kev resonances in the reactions24mg(p,gamma)25al, 25mg(p,gamma)26al, and 26mg(p,gamma)27al, respectively.these studies were performed at the luna facility in the gran sasso undergroundlaboratory using multiple experimental techniques and provided results with ahigher accuracy than previously achieved.

1107.4514	revision of the 15n(p,{\gamma})16o reaction rate and oxygen abundance in  h-burning zones	the no cycle takes place in the deepest layer of a h-burning core or shell,when the temperature exceeds t {\simeq} 30 {\cdot} 106 k. the o depletionobserved in some globular cluster giant stars, always associated with a naenhancement, may be due to either a deep mixing during the rgb (red giantbranch) phase of the star or to the pollution of the primordial gas by an earlypopulation of massive agb (asymptotic giant branch) stars, whose chemicalcomposition was modified by the hot bottom burning. in both cases, the no cycleis responsible for the o depletion. the activation of this cycle depends on therate of the 15n(p,{\gamma})16o reaction. a precise evaluation of this reactionrate at temperatures as low as experienced in h-burning zones in stellarinteriors is mandatory to understand the observed o abundances. we present anew measurement of the 15n(p,{\gamma})16o reaction performed at luna coveringfor the first time the center of mass energy range 70-370 kev, whichcorresponds to stellar temperatures between 65 {\cdot} 106 k and 780 {\cdot}106k. this range includes the 15n(p,{\gamma})16o gamow-peak energy of explosiveh-burning taking place in the external layer of a nova and the one of the hotbottom burning (hbb) nucleosynthesis occurring in massive agb stars. with thepresent data, we are also able to confirm the result of the previous r-matrixextrapolation. in particular, in the temperature range of astrophysicalinterest, the new rate is about a factor of 2 smaller than reported in thewidely adopted compilation of reaction rates (nacre or cf88) and theuncertainty is now reduced down to the 10% level.

1110.1949	type ia supernovae and the ^{12}c+^{12}c reaction rate	the experimental determination of the cross-section of the ^{12}c+^{12}creaction has never been made at astrophysically relevant energies (e&lt;2 mev).the profusion of resonances throughout the measured energy range has led tospeculation that there is an unknown resonance at e\sim1.5 mev possibly asstrong as the one measured for the resonance at 2.14 mev. we study theimplications that such a resonance would have for the physics of snia, payingspecial attention to the phases that go from the crossing of the ignition curveto the dynamical event. we use one-dimensional hydrostatic and hydrodynamiccodes to follow the evolution of accreting white dwarfs until they grow closeto the chandrasekhar mass and explode as snia. in our simulations, we accountfor a low-energy resonance by exploring the parameter space allowed byexperimental data. a change in the ^{12}c+^{12}c rate similar to the oneexplored here would have profound consequences for the physical conditions inthe snia explosion, namely the central density, neutronization, thermalprofile, mass of the convective core, location of the runaway hot spot, or timeelapsed since crossing the ignition curve. for instance, with the largestresonance strength we use, the time elapsed since crossing the ignition curveto the supernova event is shorter by a factor ten than for models using thestandard rate of ^{12}c+^{12}c, and the runaway temperature is reduced from\sim8.14\times10^{8} k to \sim4.26\times10^{8} k. on the other hand, aresonance at 1.5 mev, with a strength ten thousand times smaller than the onemeasured at 2.14 mev, but with an {\alpha}/p yield ratio substantiallydifferent from 1 would have a sizeable impact on the degree of neutronizationof matter during carbon simmering. we conclude that a robust understanding ofthe links between snia properties and their progenitors will not be attaineduntil the ^{12}c+^{12}c reaction rate is measured at energies \sim1.5 mev.

1211.6661	impact of a revised $^{25}$mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$al reaction rate on the  operation of the mg-al cycle	proton captures on mg isotopes play an important role in the mg-al cycleactive in stellar h-burning regions. in particular, low-energy nuclearresonances in the $^{25}$mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$al reaction affect the productionof radioactive $^{26}$al$^{gs}$ as well as the resulting mg/al abundance ratio.reliable estimations of these quantities require precise measurements of thestrengths of low-energy resonances. based on a new experimental study performedat luna, we provide revised rates of the $^{25}$mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$al$^{gs}$and the $^{25}$mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$al$^{m}$ reactions with correspondinguncertainties. in the temperature range 50 to 150 mk, the new recommended rateof the $^{26}$al$^{m}$ production is up to 5 times higher than previouslyassumed. in addition, at t$=100$ mk, the revised total reaction rate is afactor of 2 higher. note that this is the range of temperature at which themg-al cycle operates in an h-burning zone. the effects of this revision arediscussed. due to the significantly larger $^{25}$mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$al$^{m}$rate, the estimated production of $^{26}$al$^{gs}$ in h-burning regions is lessefficient than previously obtained. as a result, the new rates should imply asmaller contribution from wolf-rayet stars to the galactic $^{26}$al budget.similarly, we show that the agb extra-mixing scenario does not appear able toexplain the most extreme values of $^{26}$al/$^{27}$al, i.e. $&gt;10^{-2}$, foundin some o-rich presolar grains. finally, the substantial increase of the totalreaction rate makes the hypothesis of a self-pollution by massive agbs a morerobust explanation for the mg-al anticorrelation observed in globular-clusterstars.

1307.2017	the effects of rotation on the s-process nucleosynthesys in asymptotic  giant branch stars	in this paper we analyze the effects induced by rotation on low massasymptotic giant branch stars. we compute two sets of models, m=2.0 msun at[fe/h]=0 and m=1.5 msun at [fe/h]=-1.7, respectively, by adopting main sequencerotation velocities in the range 0 - 120 km/s. at high metallicity, we findthat the goldreich-schubert-fricke instability, active at the interface betweenthe convective envelope and the rapid rotating core, contaminates the13c-pocket (the major neutron source) with 14n (the major neutron poison), thusreducing the neutron flux available for the synthesis of heavy elements. as aconsequence, the yields of heavy-s elements (ba, la, nd, sm) and, to a lessextent, those of light-s elements (sr, y, zr) decrease with increasing rotationvelocities up to 60 km/s. however, for larger initial rotation velocities, theproduction of light-s and, to a less extent, that of heavy-s begins again toincrease, due to mixing induced by meridional circulations. at low metallicity,the effects of meridional circulations are important even at rather lowrotation velocity. the combined effect of goldreich-schubert-fricke instabilityand meridional circulations determines an increase of light-s and, to a lessextent, heavy-s elements, while lead is strongly reduced. for bothmetallicities, the rotation-induced instabilities active during the interpulsephase reduce the neutrons-to-seeds ratio, so that the spectroscopic indexes[hs/ls] and [pb/hs] decrease by increasing the initial rotation velocity. ouranalysis suggests that rotation could explain the spread in the s-processindexes, as observed in s-process enriched stars at different metallicities.

1408.2986	effects of nuclear cross sections on $^{19}$f nucleosynthesis at low  metallicities	the origin of fluorine is a longstanding problem in nuclear astrophysics. itis widely recognized that asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars are among themost important contributors to the galactic fluorine production. in general,extant nucleosynthesis models overestimate the fluorine production by agb starswith respect to observations. in this paper we review the relevant nuclearreaction rates involved in the fluorine production/destruction. we perform thisanalysis on a model with initial mass m=2 m$_\odot$ and z=0.001. we found thatthe major uncertainties are due to the $^{13}$c($\alpha$,n)$^{16}$o, the$^{19}$f($\alpha$,p)$^{22}$ne and the $^{14}$n(p,$\gamma$)$^{15}$o reactions. achange of the corresponding reaction rates within the present experimentaluncertainties implies surface $^{19}$f variations at the agb tip lower than10\%. for some $\alpha$ capture reactions, however, larger variations in therates of those processes cannot be excluded. thus, we explore the effects ofthe variation of some $\alpha$ capture rates well beyond the current publisheduncertainties. the largest $^{19}$f variations are obtained by varying the$^{15}$n($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$f and the $^{19}$f($\alpha$,p)$^{22}$nereactions. the analysis of some $\alpha$ capture processes assuming a wideruncertainty range determines $^{19}$f abundances in better agreement withrecent spectroscopic fluorine measurements at low metallicity. in the frameworkof the latter scenario the $^{15}$n($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$f and the$^{19}$f($\alpha$,p)$^{22}$ne reactions show the largest effects on fluorinenucleosynthesis. the presence of poorly known low energy resonances make such ascenario, even if unlikely, possible. we plan to directly measure theseresonances.

1411.2888	a new study of the $^{22}$ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$na reaction deep  underground: feasibility, setup, and first observation of the 186 kev  resonance	the $^{22}$ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$na reaction takes part in the neon-sodiumcycle of hydrogen burning. this cycle is active in asymptotic giant branchstars as well as in novae and contributes to the nucleosythesis of neon andsodium isotopes. in order to reduce the uncertainties in the predictednucleosynthesis yields, new experimental efforts to measure the$^{22}$ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$na cross section directly at the astrophysicallyrelevant energies are needed. in the present work, a feasibility study for a$^{22}$ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$na experiment at the laboratory for undergroundnuclear astrophysics (luna) 400\,kv accelerator deep underground in the gransasso laboratory, italy, is reported. the ion beam induced $\gamma$-raybackground has been studied. the feasibility study led to the first observationof the $e_{\rm p}$ = 186\,kev resonance in a direct experiment. an experimentallower limit of 0.12\,$\times$\,10$^{-6}$\,ev has been obtained for theresonance strength. informed by the feasibility study, a dedicated experimentalsetup for the $^{22}$ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$na experiment has been developed. thenew setup has been characterized by a study of the temperature and pressureprofiles. the beam heating effect that reduces the effective neon gas densitydue to the heating by the incident proton beam has been studied using theresonance scan technique, and the size of this effect has been determined for aneon gas target.

0705.2151	astrophysical s-factor of the 3he(alpha,gamma)7be reaction measured at  low energy via prompt and delayed gamma detection	solar neutrino fluxes depend both on astrophysical and on nuclear physicsinputs, namely on the cross sections of the reactions responsible for neutrinoproduction inside the solar core. while the flux of solar 8b neutrinos has beenrecently measured at superkamiokande with a 3.5% uncertainty and a precisemeasurement of 7be neutrino flux is foreseen in the next future, the predictedfluxes are still affected by larger errors. the largest nuclear physicsuncertainty to determine the fluxes of 8b and 7be neutrinos comes from the3he(alpha,gamma)7be reaction. the uncertainty on its s-factor is due to anaverage discrepancy in results obtained using two different experimentalapproaches: the detection of the delayed gamma rays from 7be decay and themeasurement of the prompt gamma emission. here we report on a new highprecision experiment performed with both techniques at the same time. thanks tothe low background conditions of the gran sasso luna accelerator facility, thecross section has been measured at ecm = 170, 106 and 93 kev, the latter beingthe lowest interaction energy ever reached.  the s-factors from the two methods do not show any discrepancy within theexperimental errors. an extrapolated s(0)= 0.560+/-0.017 kev barn is obtained.moreover, branching ratios between the two prompt gamma-transitions have beenmeasured with 5-8% accuracy.

0805.1121	fluorine in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars: a binary scenario	a super-solar fluorine abundance was observed in the carbon-enhancedmetal-poor (cemp) star he 1305+0132 ([f/fe] = +2.90, [fe/h] = -2.5). we proposethat this observation can be explained using a binary model that involve masstransfer from an asymptotic giant branch (agb) star companion and, based onthis model, we predict f abundances in cemp stars in general. we discuss wetherf can be used to discriminate between the formation histories of most cempstars: via binary mass transfer or from the ejecta of fast-rotating massivestars. we compute agb yields using different stellar evolution andnucleosynthesis codes to evaluate stellar model uncertainties. we use a simpledilution model to determine the factor by which the agb yields should bediluted to match the abundances observed in he 1305+0132. we further employ abinary population synthesis tool to estimate the probability of f-rich cempstars. the abundances observed in he 1305+0132 can be explained if this staraccreted 3-11% of the mass lost by its former agb companion. the primary agbstar should have dredged-up at least 0.2 msun of material from its he-richregion into the convective envelope via third dredge-up, which corresponds toagb models of z ~ 0.0001 and mass ~ 2 msun. many agb model uncertainties, suchas the treatment of convective borders and mass loss, require furtherinvestigation. we find that in the binary scenario most cemp stars should alsobe femp stars, that is, have [f/fe] &gt; +1, while fast-rotating massive stars donot appear to produce fluorine. we conclude that fluorine is a signature oflow-mass agb pollution in cemp stars, together with elements associated withthe slow neutron-capture process.

1507.07338	evolution, nucleosynthesis and yields of agb stars at different  metallicities (iii): intermediate mass models, revised low mass models and  the ph-fruity interface	we present a new set of models for intermediate mass agb stars (4.0, 5.0 and,6.0 msun) at different metallicities (-2.15&lt;=fe/h]&lt;=+0.15). this integrates theexisting set of models for low mass agb stars (1.3&lt;=m/m&lt;=3.0) already includedin the fruity database. we describe the physical and chemical evolution of thecomputed models from the main sequence up to the end of the agb phase. due toless efficient third dredge up episodes, models with large core masses showmodest surface enhancements. the latter is due to the fact that the interpulsephases are short and, then, thermal pulses are weak. moreover, the hightemperature at the base of the convective envelope prevents it to deeplypenetrate the radiative underlying layers. depending on the initial stellarmass, the heavy elements nucleosynthesis is dominated by different neutronsources. in particular, the s-process distributions of the more massive modelsare dominated by the \nean~reaction, which is efficiently activated duringthermal pulses. at low metallicities, our models undergo hot bottom burning andhot third dredge up. we compare our theoretical final core masses to availablewhite dwarf observations. moreover, we quantify the weight that intermediatemass models have on the carbon stars luminosity function. finally, we presentthe upgrade of the fruity web interface, now also including the physicalquantities of the tp-agb phase of all the models included in the database(ph-fruity).

astro-ph;0105486	the kr85 s-process branching and the mass of carbon stars	we present new spectroscopic observations for a sample of c(n)-type redgiants. these objects belong to the class of asymptotic giant branch stars,experiencing thermal instabilities in the he-burning shell (thermal pulses).mixing episodes called third dredge-up enrich the photosphere with newlysynthesized c12 in the he-rich zone, and this is the source of the highobserved ratio between carbon and oxygen (c/o &gt; 1 by number). our spectroscopicabundance estimates confirm that, in agreement with the general understandingof the late evolutionary stages of low and intermediate mass stars, carbonenrichment is accompanied by the appearance of s-process elements in thephotosphere. we discuss the details of the observations and of the derivedabundances, focusing in particular on rubidium, a neutron-density sensitiveelement, and on the s-elements sr, y and zr belonging to the first s-peak. thecritical reaction branching at kr85, which determines the relative enrichmentof the studied species, is discussed. subsequently, we compare our data withrecent models for s-processing in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branchstars, at metallicities relevant for our sample. a remarkable agreement betweenmodel predictions and observations is found. thanks to the different neutrondensity prevailing in low and intermediate mass stars, comparison with themodels allows us to conclude that most c(n) stars are of low mass (m &lt; 3mo). wealso analyze the c12/c13 ratios measured, showing that most of them cannot beexplained by canonical stellar models. we discuss how this fact would requirethe operation of an ad hoc additional mixing, currently called cool bottomprocess, operating only in low mass stars during the first ascent of the redgiant branch and, perhaps, also during the asymptotic giant branch.

astro-ph;0204332	the lithium content of the globular cluster ngc 6397	we make use of high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of 12turn-off stars in the metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397 to measure itslithium content. we conclude that they all have the same lithium abundancea(li) = 2.34 with a standard deviation of 0.056 dex. we use this result,together with monte carlo simulations, to estimate that the maximum allowedintrinsic scatter is of the order of 0.035 dex. this is a new stringentconstraint to be fulfilled by stellar models which predict li depletion. weargue that although a mild depletion of 0.1 -- 0.2 dex, as predicted by recentmodels, cannot be ruled out, there is no compelling reason for it. this fact,together with the good agreement with the li abundance observed in field stars,supports the primordial origin of lithium in metal-poor stars. taking the abovevalue as the primordial lithium abundance implies a cosmic baryonic densitywhich is either omega_b h^2 = 0.016 +/- 0.004 or omega_b h^2 = 0.005^{+0.0026}_{-0.0006}, from the predictions of standard big bangnucleosynthesis. the high baryonic density solution is in agreement with recentresults on the primordial abundance of deuterium and 3he and on the estimatesderived from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background.

astro-ph;0510131	chemical analysis of carbon stars in the local group: i. the small  magellanic cloud and the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present the first results of our ongoing chemical study of carbon stars inthe local group of galaxies. we used spectra obtained with uves at the 8.2 mkueyen-vlt telescope and a new grid of spherical model atmospheres for coolcarbon-rich stars which include polyatomic opacities, to perform a fullchemical analysis of one carbon star, bmb-b~30, in the small magellanic cloud(smc) and two, igi95-c1 and igi95-c3, in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (sgrdsph) galaxy. our main goal is to test the dependence on the stellarmetallicity of the s-process nucleosynthesis and mixing mechanism occurring inagb stars. for these three stars, we find important s-element enhancements withrespect to the mean metallicity ([m/h]), namely [s/m]$\approx$+1.0, similar tothe figure found in galactic agb stars of similar metallicity. the abundanceratios derived between elements belonging to the first and second s-processabundance peaks, corresponding to nuclei with a magic number of neutrons n=50(88sr, 89y, 90zr) and n=82 (138ba, 139la, 140ce, 141pr), agree remarkably wellwith the theoretical predictions of low mass (m $&lt;3$~m$\_\odot$) metal-poor agbnucleosynthesis models where the main source of neutrons is the$^{13}$c$(\alpha,n)^{16}$o reaction activated duringthe long interpulse phase,in a small pocket located within the he-rich intershell. the derived c/o and$^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratios are, however, more difficult to reconcile withtheoretical expectations. possible explanations, like the extrinsic origin ofthe composition of these carbon stars or the operation of a non-standard mixingprocess during the agb phase (such as the {\it cool bottom process}), arediscussed on the basis of the collected observational constraints.

astro-ph;0601159	an empirical calibration of the mixing-length parameter alpha	we present an empirical calibration of the mixing-length free parameter${\alpha}$ based on a homogeneous infrared database of 28 galactic globularclusters spanning a wide metallicity range (-2.15$&lt;$[fe/h]$&lt;$-0.2). empiricalestimates of the red giant effective temperatures have been obtained frominfrared colors. suitable relations linking these temperatures to the clustermetallicity have been obtained and compared to theoretical predictions. anappropriate set of models for the sun and population ii giants have beencomputed by using both the standard solar metallicity $[z/x]_{\odot}=0.0275$and the most recently proposed value $[z/x]_{\odot}=$0.0177. we find that whenthe standard solar metallicity is adopted, a unique value of $\alpha$=2.17 canbe used to reproduce both the solar radius and the population ii red gianttemperature. conversely, when the new solar metallicity is adopted, twodifferent values of $\alpha$ are required: $\alpha=1.86$ to fit the solarradius and $\alpha \approx2.0$ to fit the red giant temperatures. however, itmust be noted that, regardless the adopted solar reference, the $\alpha$parameter does not show any significant dependence on metallicity.

astro-ph;0606374	short-lived isotopes and 23na production in low mass agb stars	we discuss the synthesis of some short-lived isotopes and of 23na inthermally pulsing agb stars with initial mass of 2 msun and two differentmetallicities (z=1.5e-2, corresponding to the metal amount in the sun, andz=1e-4), representative of disk and halo stars, respectively. the differentnucleosynthesis channels are illustrated in some details. as previously found,the 13c formed after each third dredge up episode is usually completelyconsumed by alpha captures before the onset of the subsequent thermal pulse,releasing neutrons. this is the most efficient neutron source in low mass agbstars and the resulting s-process nucleosynthesis is at the origin of the solarmain component. however, in the solar metallicity model, we find that thetemperature of the first formed 13c pocket remains too low during theinterpulse and the 13c is not completely burnt, being partially engulfed in theconvective zone generated by the following thermal pulse. due to the rapidconvective mixing in this zone, the 13c is exposed to a larger temperature anda nucleosynthesis characterized by a relatively high neutron density develops.the main effect is the strong enhancement of isotopes located beyond somecritical branching in the neutron-capture path, like 60fe, otherwise onlymarginally produced during a standard s-process nucleosynthesis.

astro-ph;0611229	a method to derive the absolute composition of the sun, the solar system  and the stars	the knowledge of isotopic and elemental abundances of the pristine solarsystem material provides a fundamental test of galactic chemical evolutionmodels, while the composition of the solar photosphere is a reference patternto understand stellar abundances. however, spectroscopic or meteoriticabundance determinations are only possible for an incomplete sample of the 83elements detected in the solar system. therefore, only relative abundances areexperimentally determined, with respect to h or to si for spectroscopic ormeteoritic measurements, respectively. for this reason, the availablecompilations of solar abundances are obtained by combining spectroscopic andmeteoritic determinations, a procedure requiring the knowledge of the chemicalmodification occurred in the solar photosphere. we provide a method to derivethe mass fractions of all the 83 elements (and their most abundant isotopes) inthe early solar system material and in the present-day solar surface.calculations are repeated by adopting the most widely adopted compilations ofsolar abundances. since for a given [fe/h], the total metallicity depends onsolar (z/x), a 30% reduction of z is found when passing from the classicalanders&amp;grevesse to the most recent lodders compilation. some implications arediscussed, as, in particular, an increase of about 700 myr of the estimated ageof globular clusters. within the experimental errors, the complete set ofrelative solar abundances, as obtained by combining meteoritic and photosphericmeasurements, are consistent with the variations implied by the quoted physicalprocesses. few deviations can be easily attributed to the decay of long-livedradioactive isotopes. the huge lithium depletion is only partially explained byintroducing a rotational-induced mixing in the tachocline.

astro-ph;0702405	white dwarf cooling sequences, ii: luminosity functions	given the importance of white dwarfs (wds) in many fields of modernastrophysics, the precise knowledge of the actual degree of accuracy of theassociated theoretical predictions is a primary task. in the first paper of aseries dedicated to the modeling of wd structure and evolution we discussed thelimits of the available theoretical studies of cooling sequences. in thepresent work we extend this analysis to isochrones and luminosity functions ofwds belonging to old stellar systems, like globular or old disk clusters. thediscussion is focused on the most common da, those with a co core and an h-richenvelope. we discuss, in particular, the variation of the age derived from theobserved wd sequence caused by different assumptions about the conductiveopacity as well as that induced by changing the carbon abundance in the core.the former causes a global uncertainty of the order of 10% and the latter ofabout 5%. we discuss different choices of the initial-to-final mass relation,which induces an uncertainty of 8% on the gc age estimate.

astro-ph;9505104	the fate of li and be in stars and in the laboratory	we connect the observed under-abundances of li and be in dwarfs, with recentresults on nuclear cross sections at low energies: for collisions of protonswith atomic or molecular targets, the measured cross sections seem too highwith respect to extrapolations for bare nuclei. phenomenologically, theseanomalous nuclear interactions can be described in terms of an effectivescreening potential $u_{lab}$ in the range of few hundred ev: in the presenceof the electron cloud, nuclei become more transparent to each other as if theeffective collision energy is aumented by $u_{lab}$. this implies that fusioncross sections are enlarged and at the same time elastic cross sections arelowered. if something similar occurs in stellar plasma, the nuclear burningtemperatures are lowered, whereas diffusion processes are enhanced. we findthat the observed li and be abundances in the hyades and in the sun can bereproduced for effective screening potentials of the plasma in the range of600-700 ev, close to that found by experiments in the lab.

astro-ph;9903451	galactic chemical evolution of heavy elements: from barium to europium	we follow the chemical evolution of the galaxy for elements from ba to eu,using an evolutionary model suitable to reproduce a large set of galactic(local and non local) and extragalactic constraints. input stellar yields forneutron-rich nuclei have been separated into their s-process and r-processcomponents. the production of s-process elements in thermally pulsingasymptotic giant branch stars of low mass proceeds from the combined operationof two neutron sources: the dominant reaction 13c(alpha,n)16o, which releasesneutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase, and the reaction22ne(alpha,n)25mg, marginally activated during thermal instabilities. theresulting s-process distribution is strongly dependent on the stellarmetallicity. for the standard model discussed in this paper, it shows a sharpproduction of the ba-peak elements around z = z_sun/4. concerning the r-processyields, we assume that the production of r-nuclei is a primary processoccurring in stars near the lowest mass limit for type ii supernovaprogenitors. the r-contribution to each nucleus is computed as the differencebetween its solar abundance and its s-contribution given by the galacticchemical evolution model at the epoch of the solar system formation. we compareour results with spectroscopic abundances of elements from ba to eu at variousmetallicities (mainly from f and g stars) showing that the observed trends canbe understood in the light of the present knowledge of neutron capturenucleosynthesis. finally, we discuss a number of emerging features that deservefurther scrutiny.

astro-ph;9906248	the giant, horizontal and asymptotic branches of galactic globular  clusters. i. the catalog, photometric observables and features	a catalog including a set of the most recent color magnitude diagrams (cmds)is presented for a sample of 61 galactic globular clusters (ggcs). we used thisdata-base to perform an homogeneous systematic analysis of the evolvedsequences (namely, red giant branch (rgb), horizontal branch (hb) andasymptotic giant branch (agb)). based on this analysis, we present: (1) a newprocedure to measure the level of the zahb (v_zahb) and an homogeneous set ofdistance moduli obtained adopting the hb as standard candle; (2) an independentestimate for rgb metallicity indicators and new calibrations of theseparameters in terms of both spectroscopic ([fe/h]_cg97) and global metallicity([m/h], including also the alpha-elements enhancement). the set of equationspresented can be used to simultaneously derive a photometric estimate of themetal abundance and the reddening from the morphology and the location of thergb in the (v,b-v)-cmd. (3) the location of the rgb-bump (in 47 ggcs) and theagb-bump (in 9 ggcs). the dependence of these features on the metallicity isdiscussed. we find that by using the latest theoretical models and the newmetallicity scales the earlier discrepancy between theory and observations(~0.4 mag) completely disappears.

astro-ph;9912425	do zero metal intermediate mass stars experience thermal pulses?	we have studied the evolution of intermediate mass (m.ge.5mo) zero metal(z=0) stars with particular attention to the agb phase. at variance withprevious claims we find that these stars experience thermal instability (the socalled thermal pulses). the critical quantity which controls the onset of athermally pulsing phase is the amount of cno in the envelope during the agb.for these stars the central he burning starts in the blue side of the hrdiagram and the 1^{st} dredge up does not take place. then the envelopemaintains its initial composition up to the beginning of the agb phase.however, during the early agb the 2^{nd} dredge-up occurs and fresh he and cnoelements are engulfed in the convective envelope. we find that in stars withm.ge.6mo the resulting amount of ^{12}c is large enough to sustain a normal cnoburning within the h shell and consequently the star enters the usual thermalpulse phase. in the 5mo model, owing to the lower ^{12}c enhancement in theenvelope after the 2^{nd} dredge-up, the he burning shell suffers weak thermalinstabilities. 9 of these thermal oscillation are needed before the he burningluminosity reaches 3x10^5 lo and a first convective shell develops in betweenthe two burning shells. later on a second convective shell forms at the base ofthe h rich envelope. this convective zone cross the h/he discontinuity andpartially overlaps the previous one, dredging up fresh ^{12}c. after a huge hflash, a quiescent cno burning settle on.  from this moment a thermal pulse phase starts, which is very similar to theone experienced by the more massive models.

0812.3103	fluorine in agb carbon stars revisited	a reanalysis of the fluorine abundance in three galactic agb carbon stars (txpsc, aq sgr and r scl) has been performed from the molecular hf (1-0) r9 lineat 2.3358 $\mu$m. high-resolution (r$\sim 50000$) and high signal to noisespectra obtained with the crires spectrograph and the vlt telescope or from thenoao archive (for tx psc) have been used. our abundance analysis uses thelatest generation of marcs model atmospheres for cool carbon rich stars. usingspectral synthesis in lte we derive for these stars fluorine abundances thatare systematically lower by $\sim 0.8$ dex in average with respect to the soleprevious estimates by jorissen, smith &amp; lambert (1992). the possible reasons ofthis discrepancy are explored. we conclude that the difference may rely on theblending with c-bearing molecules (cn and c$_2$) that were not properly takeninto account in the former study. the new f abundances are in better agreementwith the prediction of full network stellar models of low mass agb stars. thesemodels also reproduce the $s$-process elements distribution in the sampledstars. this result, if confirmed in a larger sample of agb stars, mightalleviate the current difficulty to explain the largest [f/o] ratios found byjorissen et al. in particular, it may not be necessary to search foralternative nuclear chains affecting the production of f in agb stars.
