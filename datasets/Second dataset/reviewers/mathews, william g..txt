0903.1135	stopping cooling flows with cosmic ray feedback	multi-gyr two-dimensional calculations describe the gasdynamical evolution ofhot gas in the virgo cluster resulting from intermittent cavities formed withcosmic rays. without cosmic rays, the gas evolves into a cooling flow,depositing about 85 solar masses per year of cold gas in the cluster core --such uninhibited cooling conflicts with x-ray spectra and many otherobservations. when cosmic rays are produced or deposited 10 kpc from thecluster center in bursts of about 10^{59} ergs lasting 20 myrs and spaced atintervals of 200 myrs, the central cooling rate is greatly reduced to 0.1 - 1solar masses per year, consistent with observations. after cosmic rays diffusethrough the cavity walls, the ambient gas density is reduced and is buoyantlytransported 30-70 kpc out into the cluster. cosmic rays do not directly heatthe gas and the modest shock heating around young cavities is offset by globalcooling as the cluster gas expands. after several gyrs the hot gas density andtemperature profiles remain similar to those observed, provided thetime-averaged cosmic ray luminosity is about 10^{43} erg/s, approximately equalto the bolometric x-ray luminosity within only 56 kpc. if an appreciablefraction of the relativistic cosmic rays are protons, gamma rays produced bypion decay following inelastic p-p collisions may be detected with the fermigamma ray telescope.

0906.0576	hydrostatic gas constraints on supermassive black hole masses:  implications for hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical modelling in a sample  of early-type galaxies	we present new mass measurements for the supermassive black holes (smbhs) inthe centres of three early-type galaxies. the gas pressure in the surrounding,hot interstellar medium (ism) is measured through spatially resolvedspectroscopy with the chandra x-ray observatory, allowing the smbh mass (mbh)to be inferred directly under the hydrostatic approximation. this techniquedoes not require calibration against other smbh measurement methods and itsaccuracy depends only on the ism being close to hydrostatic, which is supportedby the smooth x-ray isophotes of the galaxies. combined with results from ourrecent study of the elliptical galaxy ngc4649, this brings to four the numberof galaxies with smbhs measured in this way. of these, three already have massdeterminations from the kinematics of either the stars or a central gas disc,and hence join only a handful of galaxies with mbh measured by more than onetechnique. we find good agreement between the different methods, providingsupport for the assumptions implicit in both the hydrostatic and the dynamicalmodels. the stellar mass-to-light ratios for each galaxy inferred by ourtechnique are in agreement with the predictions of stellar population synthesismodels assuming a kroupa initial mass function (imf). this concurrence impliesthat no more than ~10-20% of the ism pressure is nonthermal, unless there is aconspiracy between the shape of the imf and nonthermal pressure. finally, wecompute bondi accretion rates, finding that the two galaxies with the highestrates exhibit little evidence of x-ray cavities, suggesting that thecorrelation with the agn jet power takes time to be established.

0911.0720	spitzer observations of passive and star forming early-type galaxies: an  infrared color-color sequence	we describe the infrared properties of a large sample of early type galaxies,comparing data from the spitzer archive with ks-band emission from 2mass. whilemost representations of this data result in correlations with large scatter, wefind a remarkably tight relation among colors formed by ratios of luminositiesin spitzer-mips (24, 70 and 160 um) bands and the ks-band. remarkably, thiscorrelation among e and s0 galaxies follows that of nearby normal galaxies ofall morphological types. in particular, the tight infrared color-colorcorrelation for s0 galaxies alone follows that of the entire hubble sequence ofnormal galaxies, roughly in order of galaxy type from ellipticals to spirals toirregulars. the specific star formation rate of s0 galaxies estimated from the24um luminosity increases with decreasing ks-band luminosity (or stellar mass)from essentially zero, as with most massive ellipticals, to rates typical ofirregular galaxies. moreover, the luminosities of the many infrared-luminous s0galaxies can significantly exceed those of the most luminous (presumablypost-merger) e galaxies. star formation rates in the most infrared-luminous s0galaxies approach 1-10 solar masses per year. consistently with this picture wefind that while most early-type galaxies populate an infrared red sequence,about 24% of the objects (mostly s0s) are in an infrared blue cloud togetherwith late type galaxies. for those early-type galaxies also observed at radiofrequencies we find that the far-infrared luminosities correlate with the massof neutral and molecular hydrogen, but the scatter is large. this scattersuggests that the star formation may be intermittent or that similar s0galaxies with cold gaseous disks of nearly equal mass can have varying radialcolumn density distributions that alter the local and global sf rates.

1004.2258	removing cool cores and central metallicity peaks in galaxy clusters  with powerful agn outbursts	recent x-ray observations of galaxy clusters suggest that cluster populationsare bimodally distributed according to central gas entropy and are separatedinto two distinct classes: cool core (cc) and non-cool core (ncc) clusters.while it is widely accepted that agn feedback plays a key role in offsettingradiative losses and maintaining many clusters in the cc state, the origin ofncc clusters is much less clear. at the same time, a handful of extremelypowerful agn outbursts have recently been detected in clusters, with a totalenergy ~10^{61}-10^{62} erg. using two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, weshow that if a large fraction of this energy is deposited near the centers ofcc clusters, which is likely common due to dense cores, these agn outbursts cancompletely remove ccs, transforming them to ncc clusters. our model also hasinteresting implications for cluster abundance profiles, which usually show acentral peak in cc systems. our calculations indicate that during the cc to ncctransformation, agn outbursts efficiently mix metals in cluster centralregions, and may even remove central abundance peaks if they are not broadenough. for cc clusters with broad central abundance peaks, agn outburstsdecrease peak abundances, but can not effectively destroy the peaks. our modelmay simultaneously explain the contradictory (possibly bimodal) results ofabundance profiles in ncc clusters, some of which are nearly flat, while othershave strong central peaks similar to those in cc clusters. a statisticalanalysis of the sizes of central abundance peaks and their redshift evolutionmay shed interesting insights on the origin of both types of ncc clusters andthe evolution history of thermodynamics and agn activity in clusters.

1009.1388	cosmic ray-dominated agn jets and the formation of x-ray cavities in  galaxy clusters	it is widely accepted that feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) plays akey role in the evolution of gas in groups and clusters of galaxies.unequivocal evidence comes from quasi-spherical x-ray cavities observed nearcluster centers having sizes ranging from a few to tens of kpc, some containingradio emission. cavities apparently evolve from the interaction of agn jetswith the intracluster medium (icm). however, in numerical simulations it hasbeen difficult to create such fat cavities from narrow jets. ultra-hot thermaljets dominated by kinetic energy typically penetrate deep into the icm, formingradially elongated cavities at large radii unlike those observed. here, westudy very light jets dominated energetically by relativistic cosmic rays (crs)with axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations, investigating the jet evolutionboth when they are active and when they are later turned off. we find that,when the thermal gas density in a cr-dominated jet is sufficiently low, the jethas a correspondingly low inertia, and thus decelerates quickly in the icm.furthermore, cr pressure causes the jet to expand laterally, encounter anddisplace more decelerating icm gas, naturally producing fat cavities nearcluster centers similar to those observed. our calculations of cavity formationimply that agn jets responsible for creating fat x-ray cavities (radio bubbles)are very light, and dominated by crs. this scenario is consistent with radioobservations of fanaroff-riley i jets that appear to decelerate rapidly,produce strong synchrotron emission and expand typically at distances of a fewkpc from the central agn.

1010.4899	self-consistent evolution of gas and cosmic rays in cygnus a and similar  fr ii classic double radio sources	in cygnus a and other classical fr ii double radio sources, powerful opposingjets from the cores of halo-centered galaxies drive out into the surroundingcluster gas, forming hotspots of shocked and compressed cluster gas at the jetextremities. the moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. aninner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and createsadditional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. anouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or clustergas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. we describecomputations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shockedcluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.relativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interactingwith small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities. theevolution of cygnus a is governed almost entirely by cosmic ray energy flowingfrom the hotspots. mass flowing into hotspots from the jets is assumed to besmall, greatly reducing the mass of gas flowing back along the jet, common inprevious calculations, that would disrupt the spatial segregation ofsynchrotron-loss ages observed inside fr ii radio lobes. we compute theevolution of the cocoon when the velocity and cosmic ray luminosity of thehotspots are constant and when they vary with time. if cosmic rays mix withcluster gas in hotspots before flowing into the radio lobe, the thermal gas isheated to mildly relativistic temperatures, producing an unobserved pressureinside the lobe.

0709.2427	the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, surface brightness and  color profiles in elliptical galaxies	we describe photometry at mid-infrared passbands (1.2 - 24 microns) for asample of 18 elliptical galaxies. all surface brightness distributions resemblede vaucouleurs profiles, indicating that most of the emission arises from thephotospheres or circumstellar regions of red giant stars. the spectral energydistribution peaks near 1.6 microns, but the half-light or effective radius hasa pronounced minimum near the k band (2.15 microns). apart from the 24 micronpassband, all sample-averaged radial color profiles have measurable slopeswithin about twice the (k band) effective radius. evidently this variationarises because of an increase in stellar metallicity toward the galactic cores.for example, the sampled-averaged color profile (k - 5.8 microns) has apositive slope although no obvious absorption feature is observed in spectra ofelliptical galaxies near 5.8 microns. this, and the minimum in the effectiveradius, suggests that the k band may be anomalously luminous in metal-richstars in galaxy cores. unusual radial color profiles involving the 24 micronpassband may suggest that some 24 micron emission comes from interstellar notcircumstellar dust grains.

1103.0055	the fermi bubbles. i. possible evidence for recent agn jet activity in  the galaxy	the fermi gamma-ray space telescope reveals two large gamma-ray bubbles inthe galaxy, which extend about 50 degrees (~ 10 kpc) above and below thegalactic center (gc) and are symmetric about the galactic plane. usingaxisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of thedynamical cosmic ray (cr) - gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can becreated with a recent active galactic nucleus (agn) jet activity about 1 - 3myr ago, which was active for a duration of ~ 0.1 - 0.5 myr. the bipolar jetswere ejected into the galactic halo along the rotation axis of the galaxy. nearthe gc, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001&lt;~ \eta &lt;~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. the jets are energeticallydominated by kinetic energy, and over-pressured with either cr or thermalpressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat cr bubbles asobserved. the sharp edges of the bubbles imply that cr diffusion across thebubble surface is strongly suppressed. the jet activity induces a strong shock,which heats and compresses the ambient gas in the galactic halo, potentiallyexplaining the rosat x-ray shell features surrounding the bubbles. the fermibubbles provide plausible evidence for a recent powerful agn jet activity inour galaxy, shedding new insights into the origin of the halo cr population andthe channel through which massive black holes in disk galaxies release feedbackenergy during their growth.

1105.5866	cosmic ray diffusion fronts in the virgo cluster	the pair of large radio lobes in the virgo cluster, each about 23 kpc inradius, have curiously sharp outer edges where the radio-synchrotron continuumflux declines abruptly. however, just adjacent to this sharp transition, theradio flux increases. this radio limb-brightening is observed over at leasthalf of the perimeter of both lobes. we describe slowly propagating steadystate diffusion fronts that explain these counterintuitive features. because ofthe natural buoyancy of radio lobes, the magnetic field is largely tangent tothe lobe boundary, an alignment that polarizes the radio emission anddramatically reduces the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. ascosmic ray electrons diffuse slowly into the cluster gas, the local magneticfield and gas density are reduced as gas flows back toward the radio lobe.radio emission peaks can occur because the synchrotron emissivity increaseswith magnetic field and then decreases with the density of non-thermalelectrons. a detailed comparison of steady diffusion fronts with quantitativeradio observations may reveal information about the spatial variation ofmagnetic fields and the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. onlarger scales, some reduction of the gas density inside the virgo lobes due tocosmic ray pressure must occur and may be measurable. such x-ray observationscould reveal important information about the presence of otherwise unobservablenon-thermal components such as relativistic electrons of low energy or protoncosmic rays.

1105.5870	estimate of the total mechanical feedback energy from galaxy  cluster-centered black holes: implications for black hole evolution, cluster  gas fraction and entropy	the total feedback energy injected into hot gas in galaxy clusters by centralblack holes can be estimated by comparing the potential energy of observedcluster gas profiles with the potential energy of non-radiating, feedback-freehot gas atmospheres resulting from gravitational collapse in clusters of thesame total mass. feedback energy from cluster-centered black holes expands thecluster gas, lowering the gas-to-dark matter mass ratio below the cosmic value.feedback energy is unnecessarily delivered by radio-emitting jets to distantgas far beyond the cooling radius where the cooling time equals the clusterlifetime. for clusters of mass 4-11 x 10^14 msun estimates of the totalfeedback energy, 1-3 x 10^63 ergs, far exceed feedback energies estimated fromobservations of x-ray cavities and shocks in the cluster gas, energies gainedfrom supernovae, and energies lost from cluster gas by radiation. thetime-averaged mean feedback luminosity is comparable to those of powerfulquasars, implying that some significant fraction of this energy may arise fromthe spin of the black hole. the universal entropy profile in feedback-freegaseous atmospheres in nfw cluster halos can be recovered by multiplying theobserved gas entropy profile of any relaxed cluster by a factor involving thegas fraction profile. while the feedback energy and associated mass outflow inthe clusters we consider far exceed that necessary to stop cooling inflow, thetime-averaged mass outflow at the cooling radius almost exactly balances themass that cools within this radius, an essential condition to shut down clustercooling flows.

1110.0834	the fermi bubbles. ii. the potential roles of viscosity and cosmic ray  diffusion in jet models	the origin of the fermi bubbles recently detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope in the inner galaxy is mysterious. in the companion paper guo &amp;mathews (paper i), we use hydrodynamic simulations to show that they could beproduced by a recent powerful agn jet event. here we further explore thisscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (cr)diffusion on the morphology and cr distribution of the bubbles. we show thateven a relatively low level of viscosity (\mu_{visc} &gt;~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or~0.1% - 1% of braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppressthe development of kelvin-helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,resulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. furthermore, viscosity reducescirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix thecr-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. thusviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored cr distribution, an importantingredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightnessdistribution. generically, such a cr distribution often produces alimb-brightened gamma-ray intensity distribution. however, we show that byincorporating cr diffusion which is strongly suppressed across the bubblesurface (as inferred from sharp bubble edges) but is close to canonical valuesin the bubble interior, we obtain a reasonably flat gamma-ray intensityprofile. the similarity of the resulting cr bubble with the observed fermibubbles strengthens our previous result in paper i that the fermi bubbles wereproduced by a recent agn jet event. studies of the nearby fermi bubbles mayprovide a unique opportunity to study the potential roles of plasma viscosityand cr diffusion on the evolution of agn jets and bubbles.

1206.4585	radiating bondi and cooling site flows	steady accretion of a radiating gas onto a central mass point is describedand compared to classic bondi accretion. radiation losses are essential foraccretion flows to be observed. unlike bondi flows, radiating bondi flows passthrough a sonic point at a finite radius and become supersonic near the center.the morphology of all radiating bondi flows is described by a singledimensionless parameter. in radiating bondi flows the mass accretion ratevaries approximately as the first power of the central mass -- this differssignificantly from the quadratic dependence on the central mass in classicalbondi flows. mass accretion rates onto galaxy or cluster-centered black holesestimated from traditional and radiating bondi flows are significantlydifferent. in radiating bondi flows the gas temperature increases at largeradii, as in the cores of many galaxy groups and clusters, allowing radiatingbondi flows to merge naturally with gas arriving from their clusterenvironments. some radiating flows cool completely before reaching the centerof the flow, and this also occurs in cooling site flows in which there is nocentral gravitating mass.

0711.4384	creation of the x-ray cavity jet and its radio lobe in m87/virgo with  cosmic rays; relevance to relic radio sources	young cavities in the x-ray emitting hot gas in galaxy clusters are oftenfilled with radio synchrotron emission and it is widely thought that thecavities are inflated by these cosmic rays. at a later stage of its evolution,when the cavity becomes buoyant, the converging flow of gas beneath the cavityresults in a filament of thermal gas, a cavity jet, that moves radially outwardat large subsonic velocities. as the cavity jet forms, the cosmic ray electronsmay diffuse through the cavity walls, filling a large volume surrounding thecavity jet, as observed in m87/virgo and elsewhere, sometimes referred to asrelic radio sources. we compute the combined evolution of cosmic rays, cavitiesand cavity jets. the observed pattern in m87/virgo can be reached in 100 myrs,matching the synchrotron age of the extended radio source. a 20-30 kpc longcavity jet is surrounded by a quasi-spherical radio lobe 40 kpc in diameter,but the initial cavity has disappeared. at later times the cavity jet will fallback to the origin, leaving only the extended radio source. the combinedjet-lobe evolution in m87/virgo requires a total cosmic ray energy that is morethan 10 times larger than that usually assumed, 4pv.

1305.2958	hot versus cold: the dichotomy in spherical accretion of cooling flows  onto supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies, galaxy groups and  clusters	feedback heating from active galactic nuclei (agns) has been commonly invokedto suppress cooling flows predicted in hot gas in elliptical galaxies, galaxygroups and clusters. previous studies have focused on if and how agn feedbackheats the gas, but little paid attention to its triggering mechanism. usingspherically symmetric simulations, we investigate how large-scale cooling flowsare accreted by central supermassive black holes (smbhs) in eight well-observedsystems and find an interesting dichotomy. in massive clusters, the gasdevelops a central cooling catastrophe within about the cooling time (typically~ 100 - 300 myr), resulting in a cold-mode accretion onto smbhs. however, inour four simulated systems on group and galaxy scales at a low metallicityz=0.3z_{sun}, the gas quickly settles into a long-term state which has a cuspycentral temperature profile extending to several tens to about 100 pc. at themore realistic solar metallicity, two groups (with r_{e} ~ 4 kpc) still hostthe long-term hot-mode accretion. both accretion modes naturally appear in ouridealized calculations where only cooling, gas inflow, and compressionalheating are considered. the long-term hot-mode accretion is maintained by thequickly-established closeness between the timescales of these processes,preferably in systems with low gas densities, low gas metallicities, andimportantly, compact central galaxies, which result in strong gravitationalacceleration and compressional heating at the intermediate radii. ourcalculations predict that central cuspy temperature profiles appear more oftenin smaller systems than galaxy clusters, which instead often host significantcold gas and star formation.

0801.3461	weighing the quiescent central black hole in an elliptical galaxy with  x-ray emitting gas	we present a chandra study of the hot ism in the giant elliptical galaxyngc4649. in common with other group-centred ellipticals, its temperatureprofile rises with radius in the outer parts of the galaxy, from ~0.7kev at2kpc to ~0.9kev by 20kpc. however, within the central ~2kpc the trend reversesand the temperature peaks at ~1.1kev within the innermost 200pc. under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we demonstrate that the centraltemperature spike arises due to the gravitational influence of a quiescentcentral super-massive black hole. we constrain the black hole mass (mbh) to$(3.35^{+0.67}_{-0.95})\times 10^9$msun (90% confidence), in good agreementwith stellar kinematics measurements. this is the first direct measurement ofmbh based on studies of hydrostatic x-ray emitting gas, which are sensitive tothe most massive black holes, and is a crucial validation of bothmass-determination techniques. this agreement clearly demonstrates the gas mustbe close to hydrostatic, even in the very centre of the galaxy, which isconsistent with the lack of morphological disturbances in the x-ray image.ngc4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which mbh has beenmeasured by more than one method. at larger radii, we were able to decomposethe gravitating mass profile into stellar and dark matter (dm) components.unless one accounts for the dm, a standard virial analysis of the starsdramatically over-estimates the stellar mass of the galaxy. we find themeasured j-band stellar mass-to-light ratio, 1.37+/-0.10 msun/lsun, is in goodagreement with simple stellar population model calculations for this object.

1402.0853	first dynamic computation of synchrotron emission from the cygnus a  radio cavity; evidence for electron pair plasma in cavity	cosmic rays, thermal gas and magnetic fields in frii radio cavities areassumed to come entirely from winds flowing from just behind the jet shocks.combining analytic and computational methods, it is shown that the computedradio-electron energy distribution and synchrotron emissivity spectraeverywhere in the cygnus a radio cavity agrees with radio observations of thecygnus a lobes. the magnetic field energy density is small everywhere andevolves passively in the post-shock wind. most synchrotron emission arises inrecent post-shock material as it flows back along the radio cavity wall.because it experienced less adiabatic expansion, the magnetic field in thisyoung backflow is larger than elsewhere in the radio lobe, explaining theobserved radio synchrotron limb-brightening. the boundary backflow deceleratesdue to small cavity pressure gradients, causing large-scale fieldsperpendicular to the backflow (and synchrotron emission) to grow exponentiallyunlike observations. however, if the field is random on subgrid (sub-kpc)scales, the computed field reproduces both the magnitude and slowly decreasingradio synchrotron emissivity observed along the backflow. the radio synchrotronspectrum and image computed with a small-scale random field agree with vlaobservations. the total relativistic energy density in the post-jet shockregion required in computations to inflate the radio cavity matches the energydensity of relativistic electrons observed in the post-shock region of cygnusa. this indicates that the component in the jet and cavity that dominates thedynamical evolution is a relativistic pair plasma.

1501.07647	hot gaseous atmospheres in galaxy groups and clusters are both heated  and cooled by x-ray cavities	expanding x-ray cavities observed in hot gas atmospheres of many galaxygroups and clusters generate shock waves and turbulence that are primaryheating mechanisms required to avoid uninhibited radiatively cooling flowswhich are not observed. however, we show here that the evolution of buoyantcavities also stimulates radiative cooling of observable masses oflow-temperature gas. during their early evolution, radiative cooling occurs inthe wakes of buoyant cavities in two locations: in thin radial filamentsparallel to the buoyant velocity and more broadly in gas compressed beneathrising cavities. radiation from these sustained compressions removes entropyfrom the hot gas. gas experiencing the largest entropy loss cools first,followed by gas with progressively less entropy loss. most cooling occurs atlate times, $\sim 10^8-10^9$ yrs, long after the x-ray cavities have disruptedand are impossible to detect. during these late times, slightly denser lowentropy gas sinks slowly toward the centers of the hot atmospheres where itcools intermittently, forming clouds near the cluster center. single cavitiesof energy $10^{57}-10^{58}$ ergs in the atmosphere of the ngc 5044 group create$10^8 - 10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ of cooled gas, exceeding the mass of extendedmolecular gas currently observed in that group. the cooled gas clouds wecompute share many attributes with molecular clouds recently observed in ngc5044 with alma: self-gravitationally unbound, dust-free, quasi-randomlydistributed within a few kpc around the group center.

astro-ph;0002385	where do cooling flows cool?	although only about 5 percent of the total baryonic mass in luminouselliptical galaxies is in the form of cooled interstellar gas, it isconcentrated within the optical effective radius r_e where it influences thelocal dynamical mass. the mass of cooled gas must be spatially distributedsince it greatly exceeds the masses of central black holes. we explore here theproposition that a population of low mass, optically dark stars is created fromthe cooled gas. we consider a wide variety of radial distributions for theinterstellar cooling, but only a few are consistent with observed x-ray surfacebrightness profiles. in a region of concentrated interstellar cooling, thex-ray emission can exceed that observed, suggesting the presence of additionalsupport by magnetic stresses or non-thermal pressure. in general we find thatthe mass of cooled gas contributes significantly to stellar dynamical mass tolight ratios which vary with galactic radius. if the stars formed from cooledinterstellar gas are optically luminous, their influence on the the mass tolight ratio would be reduced. the mass of cooled gas inside r_e is sensitive tothe rate that old stars lose mass, which is nearly independent of the initialmass function of the old stellar population.

astro-ph;0003470	why are rotating elliptical galaxies less elliptical at x-ray  frequencies?	if mass and angular momentum were conserved in cooling flows associated withluminous, slowly rotating elliptical galaxies, the inflowing hot gas would spinup, resulting in disks of cold gas and x-ray images that are highly flattenedalong the equatorial plane out to several effective radii. such x-rayflattening is not observed at the spatial resolution currently available tox-ray observations. evidently mass and angular momentum are not in factconserved. if cooling flows are depleted by localized radiative cooling atnumerous sites distributed throughout the flows, then disks of cooled gas donot form and the x-ray images appear nearly circular. however, the distributionof young stars formed from the cooled gas is still somewhat flattened relativeto the stellar light. x-ray images of galactic cooling flows can also becircularized by the turbulent diffusion of angular momentum away from the axisof rotation, but the effective viscosity of known processes -- stellar massloss, supernovae, cooling site evolution, etc. -- is insufficient toappreciably circularize the x-ray images. radial gradients in the interstellariron abundance are unaffected by the expected level of interstellar turbulencesince these gradients are continuously re-established by type ia supernovae.

0705.3710	spitzer observations of transient, extended dust in two elliptical  galaxies: new evidence of recent feedback energy release in galactic cores	spitzer observations of extended dust in two optically normal ellipticalgalaxies provide a new confirmation of buoyant feedback outflow in the hot gasatmospheres around these galaxies. agn feedback energy is required to preventwholesale cooling and star formation in these group-centered galaxies. in ngc5044 we observe interstellar (presumably pah) emission at 8 microns out toabout 5 kpc. both ngc 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from colddust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. the sputtering lifetime ofthis extended dust in the ~1kev interstellar gas, ~10^7 yrs, establishes thetime when the dust first entered the hot gas. evidently the extended dustoriginated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxycores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. thesurviving central dust in ngc 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many smallfilaments. it is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emissionin ngc 5044 is spatially coincident with halpha+[nii] emission from warm gas. acalculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out fromthe galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about ~10^7 yrs, explaining theoptical line emission observed. the x-ray images of both galaxies aredisturbed. all timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibriumand buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, anddust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy inboth galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.

astro-ph;0008190	influence of cooled interstellar gas on the fundamental plane for  elliptical galaxies	we explore the possibly important influence of cooled interstellar gas on thefundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. interstellar cooling is described bya parameterized sink term in the equation of continuity. parameters that givethe best fits to the x-ray observations of ngc 4472 are used as a template forthe radial distribution of interstellar cooling in structurally homologouselliptical galaxies of lower mass. gas that cools within an effective radiuscan contribute an additional 10 - 30 percent to the mass of the old stellarpopulation. if the cooled gas forms into stars of very low mass, $\llm_{\odot}$, as is commonly assumed, the cooled mass is optically dark. as aresult, the mass to light ratios determined from stellar velocitiessystematically overestimate that of the old stellar population. moreover, thetotal mass and spatial distribution of the optically dark young stellarpopulation does not scale homologously with galactic luminosity or radius andthe total stellar mass to light ratio varies with galactic radius. weinvestigate the non-homologous perturbations of cooled gas on the mass to lightratio for several idealized homologous elliptical galaxies and show that theyappear to be incompatible with the observed thinness of the fundamental plane.if optically luminous young stars formed from the cooled gas, the disturbanceof the fundamental plane would be lessened.

astro-ph;0101517	entropy evolution in galaxy groups and clusters; a comparison of  external and internal heating	x-ray observations of hot gas in galaxy groups indicate higher entropies thancan be achieved in the accretion shocks as it fell into the dark halos. it hasbeen proposed that this entropy excess results from some universal externalheating process in the early universe - agn, population iii stars, etc. - thatoccurred before most of the gas entered the dark halos. alternatively, the hotgas in groups may be heated internally by type ii supernovae when the galacticstars formed. we investigate here the gas-dynamical consequences of variousamounts of external, high redshift heating and compare with internal supernovaheating. radiative losses and distributed mass dropout are included. we findthat externally heated flows are unsatisfactory; when the heating is highenough to bring the x-ray luminosities into agreement with observations, thegas entropy is too high. flows internally heated by type ii supernovae arepreferred. our results are insensitive to the epoch and spatial distribution ofthe supernova heating process. however, with a salpeter imf a large fraction ofthe energy produced by supernovae must heat the hot gas. alternatively, onlyabout 20 percent of the type ii supernova energy would be required to heat thegas if the initial mass function is flatter than salpeter, as suggested bystellar mass to light ratios.

astro-ph;0101545	spatial diffusion of x-ray emission lines in the m87 cooling flow;  evidence for absorption	recent xmm-newton observations of the cooling flow gas in m87 indicatesharply decreasing oxygen, iron and silicon abundances within $\sim 5$ kpc ofthe galactic center. this result is unexpected since stellar mass loss and typeia supernovae are expected to produce pronounced central abundance maxima forall three elements. however, it has been suggested that many of the strongx-ray lines are optically thick and diffuse to larger radii in the cooling flowbefore escaping, falsifying the central abundances. we verify with radiationtransfer calculations that this effect does indeed occur in the m87 coolingflow, but that it is insufficient to account for the m87 observations. wesuggest that some source of continuous opacity is required to reduce thecentral x-ray line emission, perhaps by warm gas at $t \sim 10^5 - 10^6$ k. theradial surface brightness profiles of x-ray resonance lines are also sensitiveto turbulence in cooling flows which reduces the line center optical depthsconsiderably. turbulence may provide sufficient energy to continuously heat thewarm absorbing gas.

astro-ph;0111104	confrontation of intracluster and interstellar gas in cluster-centered  elliptical galaxies: m87 in virgo and ngc 4874 in coma	x-ray observations of m87 in the virgo cluster and ngc 4874 in coma revealthat the gas temperature beyond about 50 kpc from these cd galaxies iscomparable to the virial temperature of the cluster, 3 or 9 kev respectively,but within the optical galaxy the temperature drops to the galactic virialtemperature, about 1 kev. we show that these steep thermal (and density)gradients follow naturally from the usual cooling inflow assumptions withoutrecourse to thermal conductivity. to avoid unobserved central massconcentrations, most of the gas must radiatively cool (``dropout'') before itflows to the galactic core, i.e. the gas must be multiphase. recent xmm spectraof m87 indicate single phase flow at every radius with no apparent radiativecooling to low temperatures. however, the x-ray spectral evidence formultiphase cooling beginning at lower temperatures near 1 kev (within about 10kpc) may be less apparent and may have escaped detection. finally, we show thatthe standard decomposition method used by x-ray observers to determine the massflow dm/dt(r) may fail rather badly due to small deviations from perfectlysteady state flow. when applied to our slightly non-steady computed flows, thisdecomposition (incorrectly) gives the usual result, dm/dt proportional to r,and overestimates the mass dropout dm/dt(r) at large radii.

astro-ph;0203409	heated cooling flows	in conventional models of galactic and cluster cooling flows widespreadcooling (mass dropout) is assumed to avoid accumulation of unacceptably largecentral masses. however, recent xmm observations have failed to find spectralevidence for locally cooling gas. this has revived the notion that coolingflows are heated by some process such as an intermittent, low-level agninvolving supermassive black holes in the central galaxy. to explore thishypothesis, we consider the gasdynamical consequences of galactic cooling flowsheated by many different scenarios without specifying the detailed physics ofthe heating process. we are unable to find a single acceptable heated flow inreasonable agreement with well observed hot gas temperature and densityprofiles, even using finely tuned parameters. idealized flows in whichradiative cooling is perfectly balanced by global heating are grosslyincompatible with observations. flows heated by episodic central feedbackgenerate quasi-cyclic changes in the hot gas density profile which are notsupported by current observations. paradoxically, centrally heated (orpressurized) cooling flows experience spontaneous non-linear compressions thatresult in spatially widespread cooling instabilities. therefore, spectralevidence for cooling gas is difficult to avoid by central heating.

astro-ph;0205362	xmm-newton and chandra observations of the galaxy group ngc 5044. i.  evidence for limited multi-phase hot gas	using new xmm and chandra observations we present an analysis of thetemperature structure of the hot gas within a radius of 100 kpc of the brightnearby galaxy group ngc 5044. a spectral deprojection analysis of dataextracted from circular annuli reveals that a two-temperature model (2t) of thehot gas is favored over single-phase or cooling flow (m_dot = 4.5 +/- 0.2m_{sun}/yr) models within the central ~30 kpc. alternatively, the data can befit equally well if the temperature within each spherical shell variescontinuously from ~t_h to t_c ~ t_h/2, but no lower. the high spatialresolution of the chandra data allows us to determine that the temperatureexcursion t_h --&gt; t_c required in each shell exceeds the temperature rangebetween the boundaries of the same shell in the best-fitting single-phasemodel. this is strong evidence for a multi-phase gas having a limitedtemperature range. the cooler component of the 2t model has a temperature (t_c\~ 0.7 kev) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars. the hot phase hasa temperature (t_h ~ 1.4 kev) characteristic of the virial temperature of the\~10^{13} m_{sun} halo expected in the ngc 5044 group. however, in view of themorphological disturbances and x-ray holes visible in the chandra image withinr ~10 kpc, bubbles of gas heated to ~t_h in this region may be formed byintermittent agn feedback. some additional heating at larger radii may beassociated with the evolution of the cold front near r ~50 kpc, as suggested bythe sharp edge in the epic images.

astro-ph;0301283	feedback heating in cluster and galactic cooling flows	cluster cooling flow models that include both thermal conduction and agnheating have lower overall mass cooling rates and simultaneously sustaindensity and temperature profiles similar to those observed with no ad hoc massdropout. to achieve this agreement, the thermal conductivity must be about 0.35+/- 0.10 of the spitzer value, similar to that advocated by narayan &amp; medvedev.however, when applied to galaxy/group scales the synergistic combination of agnheating and conduction is less satisfactory. when the computed density profileand the global cooling rate are lowered by agn heating to match observations ofthese smaller scale flows, the gas temperatures within about 10 kpc are toolarge. in addition, best-fitting flows in galaxy/groups with agn heating andthermal conduction require larger conductivities, about 0.5 - 1.0 of thespitzer value. when the gas density in galaxy/group flows is lowered byheating, the iron enrichment by type ia supernovae is more effective and thehot gas iron abundance greatly exceeds observed values. consequently,galactic/group flows with central heating and conduction require an additionalprocess that removes the iron: failure of type ia ejecta to go into the hotphase, selective cooling, etc.

astro-ph;0306535	circulation flows: cooling flows with bubble return	the failure of the xmm-newton and chandra x-ray telescopes to detect coolinggas in elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies has led many to adopt theposition that the gas is not cooling at all and that heating by an activenucleus in the central e or cd galaxy is sufficient to offset radiativecooling. in this paper we explore an idealized limiting example of this pointof view in which hot, buoyant bubbles formed near the center return theinflowing, radiatively cooling gas to distant regions in the flow. we show thatidealized steady state, centrally heated non-cooling flows can indeed beconstructed. in addition, the emission-weighted temperature profiles in thesecirculating flows resemble those of normal cooling flows. however, thesesolutions are valid only (1) for a range of bubble parameters for which thereis no independent justification, (2) for a limited spatial region in thecooling flow and (3) for a limited period of time after which cooling seemsinevitable. our exploration of non-cooling flows is set in the context ofgalaxy/group flows.

astro-ph;0309367	stellar orbits and the interstellar gas temperature in elliptical  galaxies	we draw attention to the close relationship between the anisotropy parameterbeta(r) for stellar orbits in elliptical galaxies and the temperature profilet(r) of the hot interstellar gas. for nearly spherical galaxies the gas densitycan be accurately determined from x-ray observations and the stellar luminositydensity can be accurately found from the optical surface brightness. the jeansequation and hydrostatic equilibrium establish a connection between beta(r) andt(r) that must be consistent with the observed stellar velocity dispersion.purely optical observations of the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 indicatebeta(r) &lt; 0.35 within the effective radius. however, the x-ray gas temperatureprofile t(r) for ngc 4472 requires significantly larger anisotropy, beta = 0.6- 0.7, about twice the optical value. this strong preference for radial stellarorbits must be understood in terms of the formation history of massiveelliptical galaxies. conversely, if the smaller, optically determinedanisotropy is indeed correct, we are led to the important conclusion that thetemperature profile t(r) of the hot interstellar gas in ngc 4472 must differfrom that indicated by x-ray observations, or that the hot gas is not inhydrostatic equilibrium.

astro-ph;0412102	the ages of elliptical galaxies from mid-infrared emission	the mid-infrared (10-20 um) luminosity of elliptical galaxies is dominated bythe integrated emission from circumstellar dust in red giant stars. as a singlestellar population evolves, the rate of dusty mass loss from red giant starsdecreases with time, so the mid-infrared luminosity should also decline withstellar age. to seek such a correlation, we have used archival iso observationsto determine surface brightness profiles and central fluxes at 15 um in 17early-type galaxies for which stellar ages have been determined from opticalspectral indices. the radial surface brightness distributions at 15 umgenerally follow the stellar de vaucouleurs profile as expected. we find thatthe surface brightness ratio mu_{15um}/mu_{i-band} is systematically higher inelliptical galaxies with ages &lt; 5 gyrs and in galaxies that exhibit evidence ofrecent mergers. within the accuracy of our observations, mu_{15um}/mu_{i-band}shows no age dependence for ages &gt; 5 gyrs. the corresponding flux ratiosf_{15um}/f_{i-band} within apertures scaled to the effective radius (r_e/8) areproportional to the mu_{15um}/mu_{i-band} ratios at larger galactic radii,indicating that no 15 um emission is detected from central dust clouds visiblein optical images in some of our sample galaxies. emission at 15 um is observedin non-central massive clouds of dust and cold gas in ngc1316, an ellipticalgalaxy that is thought to have had a recent merger. recent {\it spitzer spacetelescope} data also indicate the presence of pah emission at 8 um. severalellipticals have extended regions of 15 um emission that have no obviouscounterparts at other frequencies.

astro-ph;0505527	thermal evolution of supernova iron in elliptical galaxies	in explaining the relative metal abundances observed in galaxy groups andclusters, it is generally assumed that all metals created by supernovae arepresent either in visible stars or the hot gas. we discuss here the possibilitythat some of the iron expelled into the hot gas by type ia supernovae may haveradiatively cooled, avoiding detection by x-ray and optical observers.hydrodynamic models of type ia explosions in the hot gas inside ellipticalgalaxies result in a gas of nearly pure iron that is several times hotter thanthe local interstellar gas. we describe the subsequent thermal evolution of theiron-rich gas as it radiates and thermally mixes with the surrounding gas.there is a critical time by which the iron ions must mix into the ambient gasto avoid rapid radiative cooling. we find that successful mixing is possible ifthe iron ions diffuse with large mean free paths, as in an unmagnetized plasma.however, in microgauss fields the larmor radii of the iron ions areexceptionally small, so the field geometry must be highly tangled or radial toallow the iron to mix by diffusion faster than it cools by radiative losses.the possibility that some of the supernova iron cools cannot be easilydiscounted.

astro-ph;0511328	mid-infrared emission from elliptical galaxies: sensitivity to stellar  age	mid-infrared observations (3.6 - 24 microns) of normal giant ellipticalgalaxies with the spitzer space telescope are consistent with pure populationsof very old stars with no evidence of younger stars. most of the stars in giantelliptical galaxies are old but the mean stellar age determined from balmerabsorption in optical spectra can appear much younger due to a small admixtureof younger stars. the mean stellar age can also be determined from the spectralenergy distribution in the mid-infrared which decreases with time relative tothe optical emission and shifts to shorter wavelengths. the observed fluxratios f_8um/f_3.6um and f_24um/f_3.6um for elliptical galaxies with the oldestbalmer line ages are lower than predicted by recent models of single stellarpopulations. for ellipticals with the youngest balmer line ages in our sample,3-5 gyrs, the flux ratios f_24um/f_3.6um are identical to those of the oldeststars. when theoretical mid-ir spectra of old (12 gyr) and young stellarpopulations are combined, errors in the f_24um/f_3.6um observations areformally inconsistent with a mass fraction of young stars that exceeds ~1%.this is less than the fraction of young stars expected in discussions of recentsurveys of elliptical galaxies at higher redshifts. however, this inconsistancybetween balmer line ages and those inferred from mid-ir observations must beregarded as provisional until more accurate observations and theoreticalspectra become available. finally, there is no evidence to date that centraldisks or patches of dust commonly visible in optical images of ellipticalgalaxies contribute sensibly to the mid-ir spectrum.

astro-ph;0601555	stopping cooling flows with jets	we describe 2d gasdynamical models of jets that carry mass as well as energyto the hot gas in galaxy clusters. these flows have many attractive attributesfor solving the galaxy cluster cooling flow problem: why the hot gastemperature and density profiles resemble cooling flows but show no spectralevidence of cooling to low temperatures. using an approximate model for thecluster a1795, we show that mass-carrying jets can reduce the overall coolingrate to or below the low values implied by x-ray spectra. biconicalsubrelativistic jets, described with several ad hoc parameters, are assumed tobe activated when gas flows toward or cools near a central supermassive blackhole. as the jets proceed out from the center they entrain more and moreambient gas. the jets lose internal pressure by expansion and are compressed bythe ambient cluster gas, becoming rather difficult to observe. for a widevariety of initial jet parameters and several feedback scenarios the globalcooling can be suppressed for many gyrs while maintaining cluster temperatureprofiles similar to those observed. the intermittancy of the feedback generatesmultiple generations of x-ray cavities similar to those observed in the perseuscluster and elsewhere.

astro-ph;0608610	the concentration-velocity dispersion relation in galaxy groups	based on results from cold dark matter n-body simulations we develop adynamical model for the evolution of subhaloes within host haloes of galaxygroups. only subhaloes more massive than 5 times 10^8 m_{sol} at the time ofaccretion are examined because they are massive enough to possibly hostluminous galaxies. as they orbit within a growing host potential the subhaloesare subject to tidal stripping and dynamical friction. we consider groups ofequal mass (m_{vir} = 3.9 times 10^{13} m_{sol}) at redshift z=0 but withdifferent concentrations associated with different formation times. weinvestigate the variation of subhaloe (or satellite galaxy) velocity dispersionwith host concentration and/or formation time. in agreement with the jeansequation the velocity dispersion of subhaloes increases with the hostconcentration. between concentrations ~5 and ~20 the subhaloe velocitydispersions increase by ~25 per cent. by applying a simplified tidal disruptioncriterion, i.e. rejection of all subhaloes with a tidal truncation radius below3 kpc at z=0, the central velocity dispersion of 'surviving' subhaloesincreases substantially for all concentrations. the enhanced central velocitydispersion among surviving subhaloes is caused by a lack of slow tangentialmotions. additionally, we present a fitting formula for the velocity anisotropyparameter \beta(r) which does not depend on concentration if the group-centricdistances are scaled by r_s, the characteristic radius of the nfw-profile.

astro-ph;0610134	probing the dark matter and gas fraction in relaxed galaxy groups with  x-ray observations from chandra and xmm	we present radial mass profiles within 0.3 r_vir for 16 relaxed galaxygroups-poor clusters (kt range 1-3 kev) selected for optimal mass constraintsfrom the chandra and xmm data archives. after accounting for the mass of hotgas, the resulting mass profiles are described well by a two-component modelconsisting of dark matter (dm), represented by an nfw model, and stars from thecentral galaxy. the stellar component is required only for 8 systems, for whichreasonable stellar mass-to-light ratios (m/l_k) are obtained, assuming a kroupaimf. modifying the nfw dark matter halo by adiabatic contraction does notimprove the fit and yields systematically lower m/l_k. in contrast to previousresults for massive clusters, we find that the nfw concentration parameter(c_vir) for groups decreases with increasing m_vir and is inconsistent with novariation at the 3 sigma level. the normalization and slope of the c_vir-m_virrelation are consistent with the standard lambdacdm cosmological model withsigma_8 = 0.9. the small intrinsic scatter measured about the c_vir-m_virrelation implies the groups represent preferentially relaxed, early formingsystems. the mean gas fraction (f =0.05 +/- 0.01) of the groups measured withinan overdensity delta=2500 is lower than for hot, massive clusters, but thefractional scatter (sigma_f/f=0.2) for groups is larger, implying a greaterimpact of feedback processes on groups, as expected.

astro-ph;0701431	far infrared spitzer observations of elliptical galaxies: evidence for  extended diffuse dust	far-infrared spitzer observations of elliptical galaxies are inconsistentwith simple steady state models of dust creation in red giant stars anddestruction by grain sputtering in the hot interstellar gas at t ~ 10^7 k. theflux at 24 microns correlates with optical fluxes, suggesting that thisrelatively hot dust is largely circumstellar. but fluxes at 70 and 160 micronsdo not correlate with optical fluxes. elliptical galaxies with similar l_b haveluminosities at 70 and 160 microns (l_70 and l_160) that vary over a factor ~100, implying an additional source of dust unrelated to that produced byongoing local stellar mass loss. neither l_70/l_b nor l_160/l_b correlate withthe stellar age or metallicity. optical line fluxes from warm gas at t ~ 10^4 kcorrelate weakly with l_70 and l_160, suggesting that the dust may beresponsible for cooling this gas. many normal elliptical galaxies have emissionat 70 microns that is extended to 5-10 kpc. extended far-infrared emission withsputtering lifetimes of ~10^8 yrs is difficult to maintain by mergers withgas-rich galaxies. instead, we propose that this cold dust is buoyantlytransported from reservoirs of dust in the galactic cores which is supplied bymass loss from stars in the core. intermittent energy outbursts from agns candrive the buoyant outflow.

astro-ph;9502053	interstellar grains in elliptical galaxies: grain evolution	we consider the lifecycle of dust introduced into the hot interstellar mediumin isolated elliptical galaxies. dust grains are ejected into galactic-scalecooling flows in large ellipticals by normal mass loss from evolving redgiants. newly introduced dust rapidly enters the hot gas environment and issputtered away by thermal collisions with ions. before the grains arecompletely sputtered away, they emit prodigious amounts of infrared radiationwhich may contribute to the large far infrared luminosities observed inellipticals. in order to study the global properties of grains in ellipticalswe construct a new series of king-type galactic models which are consistentwith the fundamental plane, galactic mass to light ratios and other relevantobservational correlations. we describe a new ``continuity'' procedure toconstruct simple time-dependent gas dynamic models for cooling flows. in allgalaxy models, although grains can flow a considerable distance from theirradius of origin before being sputtered away, the grain size distribution isaccurately determined by assuming {\it in situ} sputtering, completely ignoringadvection. the dominant source of grain heating is absorption of starlight;grain heating by collisions with energetic thermal electrons or x-rayabsorption are negligible. however, we also show that when self-consistentgrain sputtering is included the dust-to-gas ratio is reduced and radiativecooling, not electron-grain interactions dominates plasma cooling, even for themost massive ellipticals.

astro-ph;9611096	galactic drips and how to stop them!	the temperature of hot interstellar gas at large radii in elliptical galaxiescan be lower than the mean galactic virial temperature. if so, a nonlinearcooling wave can form in the hot interstellar gas and propagate slowly towardthe galactic core. if the cooling wave survives hydrodynamic instabilities, itcan intermittently deposit cold gas within about 15 effective radii. for abright elliptical the total mass deposited in this manner can approach 10^10solar masses. the cold gas that drips out at large galactic radii may accountfor the young stellar populations and extended gas at $\sim 10^4$ k observed inmany ellipticals, features that are often attributed to galactic mergers.galactic drips are expected in relatively isolated (field) ellipticals provided(i) the galactic stellar velocity ellipsoids are radially oriented at largegalactic radii and (ii) the current type ia supernova rate is sufficientlysmall to be consistent with interstellar iron abundances found in recent x-raystudies. galactic drips are surpressed in ellipticals located within clustersof galaxies; when the pressure in the ambient cluster gas exceeds that in theouter parts of the galactic interstellar medium, some cluster gas flows intothe galaxy which surpresses the drips.

astro-ph;9706089	self-generated magnetic fields in galactic cooling flows	interstellar magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies are assumed to have theirorigin in stellar fields that accompany normal mass loss from an evolvingpopulation of old stars. the seed fields are amplified by interstellarturbulence driven by stellar mass loss and supernova events. these disorderedfields are further amplified by time-dependent compression in the inward movinggalactic cooling flow and are expected to dominate near the galactic core.under favorable circumstances, fields similar in strength to those observed $b\sim 1-10~(r/10~kpc)^{-1.2}\mu$g can be generated solely from these naturalgalactic processes. in general the interstellar field throughout ellipticalgalaxies is determined by the outermost regions in the interstellar gas wherethe turbulent dynamo process can occur. because of the long hydrodynamic flowtimes in galactic cooling flows, currently observed magnetic fields may resultfrom periods of intense turbulent field amplification that occurred in theouter galaxy in the distant past. particularly strong fields in ellipticals mayresult from ancient galactic mergers or shear turbulence introduced at theboundary between the interstellar gas and ambient cluster gas.

astro-ph;9706276	evolution of interstellar gas in rapidly rotating elliptical galaxies:  formation of disks	we describe the evolution of hot interstellar gas in a family of lowluminosity elliptical galaxies all having $m_b = -20$ but with differentdegrees of flattening (e0, e2, and e6) caused by rotation. the interstellar gasis furnished by stellar mass loss. the soft x-ray luminosity lx of the hotinterstellar gas after 15 gyrs decreases dramatically with galactic rotation.the hot gas cools onto a large disk having a size that depends inversely on theassumed supernova rate. although lx of the hot, rotating interstellar gas maybe difficult to observe, the photoionized part of the cooled gaseous disk gascan be observed in optical line emission. the mass of hii gas ($\sim 10^8$$m_{\odot}$) may be much greater than previously realized since large regionsof rotationally supported, low density hii are optically faint. we interpretthe stellar disks that are common in low luminosity ellipticals as stars thathave formed in the non-ionized part of the cold disk gas. the total mass anddistribution of cold disk gas available for star formation are similar to thoseof stellar disks observed. the high stellar h$\beta$ photometric index observedin disky ellipticals can be understood by combining the light of young diskstellar populations with that of the old bulge population.

astro-ph;9710199	recent x-ray observations and the evolution of hot gas in elliptical  galaxies: evidence for circumgalactic gas	x-ray emitting gaseous halos, such as that in elliptical galaxies like ngc4472, cannot have been produced solely from gas expelled from galactic stars.in traditional models for the evolution of hot interstellar gas (cooling flows)in ellipticals, the galaxies are assumed to have been cleared of gas bysnii-driven winds at some early time then gas is subsequently replenished bymass loss from an evolving population of old stars. to test this, we accuratelydetermine the stellar and dark halo mass of ngc 4472 using hydrostaticequilibrium, then solve the standard time-dependent cooling flow equations torecover the observed hot gas temperature and density distributions when evolvedto the present time. this procedure fails: the computed gas density gradient istoo steep, the total gas mass is too low, and the gas temperatures are much toolow. all variants on this basic procedure also fail: increasing the snia rate,using the mass dropout assumption, arbitrarily adjusting uncertaincoefficients, etc. however, agreement is achieved if the galaxy is suppliedwith additional, spatially-extended hot gas early in its evolution. this old``circumgalactic'' gas can be retained to the present time and may be relatedto cosmological ``secondary infall''.

astro-ph;9806350	cosmological and environmental influences on hot gas observed in  elliptical galaxies	the variation of temperature and density in the hot, x-ray emitting gasaround massive, group dominant elliptical galaxies can be understood as acombination of gas ejected from evolving galactic stars and gas thataccumulates in the outer halo by secondary cosmic infall. beginning with anoverdensity perturbation in a simple flat cosmology, we can duplicate observedproperties of the hot gas. at some early time we form the stellar galaxy andrelease supernova energy, conserving dark and baryonic matter. using apotential appropriate to the large elliptical ngc 4472, we follow the evolutionof intergalactic and interstellar gas to the present time when the computed gasdensity and temperature agree with x-ray observations of ngc 4472. if the hotgas and dark matter halos are subject to differential tidal truncations or massexchanges between group members, then the correlation between $l_x/l_b$ and therelative sizes of galactic x-ray images can be generated. the physicalproperties of hot interstellar gas observed in bright ellipticals today aresensitive to the cosmic baryon fraction, the time of maximum star formation andthe amount of ``feedback'' energy delivered to the gas by type ii supernovae atthe epoch of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9808175	evolution of hot gas and dark halos in group-dominant elliptical  galaxies: influence of cosmic inflow	we study the complete dynamical evolution of hot interstellar gas in massiveelliptical galaxies born into a simple flat universe beginning with anoverdense perturbation. within the turn-around radius dark matter flows in aself-similar fashion into a stationary navarro-frenk-white halo and thebaryonic gas shocks. after a few gigayears, when enough gas accumulates withinthe accretion shock, the de vaucouleurs stellar system is constructed and theenergy from type ii supernovae is released. the stars and dark halo are matchedto ngc 4472. gas continues to enter the galaxy by secondary infall and bystellar mass loss based on a salpeter imf. after about 13 gyrs the temperatureand density distribution in the hot gas agree quite well with the hotinterstellar gas observed in ngc 4472. as a result of supernova-driven outflow,the present day baryonic fraction has a deep minimum in the outer galactichalo. when relatively gas-rich, x-ray luminous models are spatially truncatedat early times, simulating tidal events that may have occurred during galaxygroup dynamics, the current locus of truncated models lies just along the$l_x$, x-ray size correlation among well-observed ellipticals, providinganother striking confirmation of our simple model of elliptical evolution.

astro-ph;9811258	a comparison of metal enrichment histories in rich clusters and  individual luminous elliptical galaxies	hot, x-ray emitting gaseous halos around massive elliptical galaxies are aresult of both stellar mass loss and inflow toward the overdensity from whichgiant ellipticals and their associated galaxy groups formed. the metalabundance in this gas contains important information about early star formationand past supernova activity. we find that type ii supernovae based on asalpeter imf, plus a small number of additional type ia supernovae, can explainthe the density, temperature and abundance profiles currently observed ingaseous halos around massive ellipticals. within the central, optically brightregions of luminous ellipticals, approximately half of the interstellar iron isproduced by type ia supernovae and half by mass lost from evolving stars whichwere originally enriched by type ii supernovae. however, iron and siliconabundances in the intracluster gas within rich clusters suggest enrichment by alarger number of supernovae per unit optical light than we require for massiveellipticals, either more type ia or more type ii from a flatter imf. since theenrichment histories of massive ellipticals and rich clusters are fundamentallydifferent, e and so galaxies may not be the only sources of metal enrichment inrich cluster gas.

0812.2594	evidence of star formation in local s0 galaxies: spitzer observations of  the sauron sample	we discuss infrared spitzer observations of early type galaxies in the sauronsample at 24, 60 and 170 microns. when compared with 2mass ks bandluminosities, lenticular (s0) galaxies exhibit a much wider range of mid tofar-infrared luminosities then elliptical (e) galaxies. mid and far-infraredemission from e galaxies is a combination of circumstellar or interstellaremission from local mass-losing red giant stars, dust buoyantly transportedfrom the galactic cores into distant hot interstellar gas and dust accretedfrom the environment. the source of mid and far-ir emission in s0 galaxies isquite different and is consistent with low levels of star formation, 0.02 - 0.2msol/yr, in cold, dusty gaseous disks. the infrared 24micron-70micron color issystematically lower for (mostly s0) galaxies with known molecular disks. ourobservations support the conjecture that cold dusty gas in some s0 galaxies iscreated by stellar mass loss at approximately the same rate that it is consumedby star formation, so the mass depletion of these disks by star formation willbe slow. unlike e galaxies, the infrared luminosities of s0 galaxies correlatewith both the mass of molecular gas and the stellar hbeta spectral index, andall are related to the recent star formation rate. however, star formationrates estimated from the hbeta emission line luminosities l_{hbeta} in saurons0 galaxies are generally much smaller. since l_{hbeta} does not correlate with24 microns emission from dust heated by young stars, optical emission linesappear to be a poor indicator of star formation rates in sauron s0 galaxies.the absence of hbeta emission may be due to a relative absence of ob stars inthe initial mass function or to dust absorption of hbeta emission lines.
