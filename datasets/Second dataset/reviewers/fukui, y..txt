0902.1578	molecular and atomic gas in the large magellanic cloud - i. conditions  for co detection	we analyze the conditions for detection of co(1-0) emission in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), using the recently completed second nanten co survey.in particular, we investigate correlations between co integrated intensity andhi integrated intensity, peak brightness temperature, and line width at aresolution of 2.6' (~40 pc). we find that significant hi column density andpeak brightness temperature are necessary but not sufficient conditions for codetection, with many regions of strong hi emission not associated withmolecular clouds. the large scatter in co intensities for a given hi intensitypersists even when averaging on scales of &gt;200 pc, indicating that the scatteris not solely due to local conversion of hi into h_2 near gmcs. we focus on twopossibilities to account for this scatter: either there exist spatialvariations in the i(co) to n(h_2) conversion factor, or a significant fractionof the atomic gas is not involved in molecular cloud formation. a weak tendencyfor co emission to be suppressed for large hi linewidths supports the secondhypothesis, insofar as large linewidths may be indicative of warm hi, and callsinto question the likelihood of forming molecular clouds from colliding hiflows. we also find that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas shows nosignificant correlation (or anti-correlation) with the stellar surface density,though a correlation with midplane hydrostatic pressure p_h is found when thedata are binned in p_h. the latter correlation largely reflects the increasinglikelihood of co detection at high hi column density.

0908.1168	the second survey of the molecular clouds in the large magellanic cloud  by nanten. ii. star formation	we studied star formation activities in the molecular clouds in the largemagellanic cloud. we have utilized the second catalog of 272 molecular cloudsobtained by nanten to compare the cloud distribution with signatures of massivestar formation including stellar clusters, and optical and radio hii regions.we find that the molecular clouds are classified into three types according tothe activities of massive star formation; type i shows no signature of massivestar formation, type ii is associated with relatively small hii region(s) andtype iii with both hii region(s) and young stellar cluster(s). the radiocontinuum sources were used to confirm that type i gmcs do not host opticallyhidden hii regions. these signatures of massive star formation show a goodspatial correlation with the molecular clouds in a sense they are locatedwithin ~100 pc of the molecular clouds. among possible ideas to explain the gmctypes, we favor that the types indicate an evolutionary sequence; i.e., theyoungest phase is type i, followed by type ii and the last phase is type iii,where the most active star formation takes place leading to cloud dispersal.the number of the three types of gmcs should be proportional to the time scaleof each evolutionary stage if a steady state of massive star and clusterformation is a good approximation. by adopting the time scale of the youngeststellar clusters, 10 myrs, we roughly estimate the timescales of types i, iiand iii to be 6 myrs, 13 myrs and 7 myrs, respectively, corresponding to alifetime of 20-30 myrs for the gmcs with a mass above the completeness limit, 5x 10^4 msun.

0909.0382	molecular and atomic gas in the large magellanic cloud ii.  three-dimensional correlation between co and hi	we compare the co j =(1-0) and hi emission in the large magellanic cloud(lmc) in three dimensions, i.e. including a velocity axis in addition to thetwo spatial axes, with the aim of elucidating the physical connection betweengiant molecular clouds (gmcs) and their surrounding hi gas. the co j =1-0dataset is from the second nanten co survey and the hi dataset is from themerged australia telescope compact array (atca) and parkes telescope surveys.the major findings of our analysis are: 1) gmcs are associated with an envelopeof hi emission, 2) in gmcs [average co intensity] is proportional to [averagehi intensity]^[1.1+-0.1] and 3) the hi intensity tends to increase with thestar formation activity within gmcs, from type i to type iii. an analysis ofthe hi envelopes associated with gmcs shows that their average linewidth is 14km s-1 and the mean density in the envelope is 10 cm-3. we argue that the hienvelopes are gravitationally bound by gmcs. these findings are consistent witha continual increase in the mass of gmcs via hi accretion at an accretion rateof 0.05 msun/yr over a time scale of 10 myr. the growth of gmcs is terminatedvia dissipative ionization and/or stellar-wind disruption in the final stage ofgmc evolution.

1004.2094	physical properties of giant molecular clouds in the large magellanic  cloud	the magellanic mopra assessment (magma) is a high angular resolution comapping survey of giant molecular clouds (gmcs) in the large and smallmagellanic clouds using the mopra telescope. here we report on the basicphysical properties of 125 gmcs in the lmc that have been surveyed to date. theobserved clouds exhibit scaling relations that are similar to those determinedfor galactic gmcs, although lmc clouds have narrower linewidths and lower columinosities than galactic clouds of a similar size. the average mass surfacedensity of the lmc clouds is 50 msol/pc2, approximately half that of gmcs inthe inner milky way. we compare the properties of gmcs with and without signsof massive star formation, finding that non-star-forming gmcs have lower peakco brightness than star-forming gmcs. we compare the properties of gmcs withestimates for local interstellar conditions: specifically, we investigate thehi column density, radiation field, stellar mass surface density and theexternal pressure. very few cloud properties demonstrate a clear dependence onthe environment; the exceptions are significant positive correlations betweeni) the hi column density and the gmc velocity dispersion, ii) the stellar masssurface density and the average peak co brightness, and iii) the stellar masssurface density and the co surface brightness. the molecular mass surfacedensity of gmcs without signs of massive star formation shows no dependence onthe local radiation field, which is inconsistent with thephotoionization-regulated star formation theory proposed by mckee (1989). wefind some evidence that the mass surface density of the magma clouds increaseswith the interstellar pressure, as proposed by elmegreen (1989), but thedetailed predictions of this model are not fulfilled once estimates for thelocal radiation field, metallicity and gmc envelope mass are taken intoaccount.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1010.3134	statistical study of dust properties in lmc molecular clouds	the objective of this paper is to construct a catalog providing the dustproperties and the star formation efficiency (sfe) of the molecular clouds inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc). we use the infrared (ir) data obtained withthe spitzer telescope as part of the ``surveying the agents of a galaxy'sevolution'' (sage) legacy survey as well as the iras data. we also work withextinction (av) maps of the lmc. a total of 272 molecular clouds have beendetected in the lmc in a previous molecular survey, accounting for 230 giantmolecular clouds and 42 smaller clouds. we perform correlations between the iremission/extinction, and atomic and molecular gas tracers. we compare theatomic gas that surrounds the molecular cloud with the molecular gas in thecloud. using a dust emission model, we derive the physical properties of dustin and outside the clouds: equilibrium temperature, emissivity and extinction.we also determine the luminosity of the interstellar radiation fieldintercepted by the cloud, and the total ir luminosity. statistically, we do notfind any significant difference in the dust properties between the atomic andthe molecular phases. in particular we do not find evidence for a systematicdecrease of the dust temperature in the molecular phase, with respect to thesurrounding, presumably atomic gas. this is probably because giant molecularclouds are the sites of star formation, which heat the dust, while the smallestclouds are unresolved. the ratio between the ir luminosity and the cloud mass(ldust/mgas) does not seem to correlate with mgas. the highest value of theratio we derived is 18.1 lsol/msol in the 30 doradus region, which is known tobe the most prominent star formation region of the lmc, while the most likelyvalue is 0.5 and is representative of quiescent clouds. we provide aprescription to associate the various stages of star formation with itsldust/mgas.

[ci] and mid-j co lines in  two 4'x4' fields	the carina region is an excellent astrophysical laboratory for studying thefeedback mechanisms of newly born, very massive stars within their natal giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) at only 2.35 kpc distance. we use a clumpy pdr model toanalyse the observed intensities of atomic carbon and co and to derive theexcitation conditions of the gas. the nanten2-4m submillimeter telescope wasused to map the [ci] 3p1-3p0, 3p2-3p1 and co 4-3, 7-6 lines in two 4'x4'regions of carina where molecular material interfaces with radiation from themassive star clusters. one region is the northern molecular cloud near thecompact ob cluster tr14, and the second region is in the molecular cloud southof etacar and tr16. these data were combined with 13co sest spectra, hires/iras60um and 100um maps of the fir continuum, and maps of 8um irac/spitzer and msxemission. we used the hires far-infrared dust data to create a map of the fuvfield heating the gas. the northern region shows an fuv field of a few 1000 indraine units while the field of the southern region is about a factor 10weaker. we constructed models consisting of an ensemble of small sphericallysymmetric pdr clumps within the 38" beam (0.43pc), which follow canonicalpower-law mass and mass-size distributions. we find that an average local clumpdensity of 2x10**5 cm-3 is needed to reproduce the observed line emission attwo selected interface positions. stationary, clumpy pdr models reproduce theobserved cooling lines of atomic carbon and co at two positions in the carinanebula.

1205.3384	dark gas in the solar neighnorhood from extinction data	when modeling infrared or gamma-ray data as a linear combination of observedgas tracers, excess emission has been detected compared to expectations fromknown neutral and atomic gas as traced by hi and co measurements, respectively.this excess might correspond to an additional gas component. this so-called"dark gas" (dg) has been observed in our galaxy, as well as the magellanicclouds. for the first time, we investigate the correlation between visibleextinction (av) data and gas tracers on large scales in the solar neighborhood.our work focuses on both the solar neighborhood ($|b|&gt;10\degr$), and the innerand outer galaxy, as well as on four individual regions: taurus, orion,cepheus-polaris and aquila-ophiuchus. thanks to the recent production of anall-sky av map, we first perform the correlation between av and both hi and coemission over the most diffuse regions, to derive the optimal (av/nh)^(ref)ratio. we then iterate the analysis over the entire regions to estimate theco-to-h2 conversion factor as well as the dg mass fraction. the averageextinction to gas column-density ratio in the solar neighborhood is found to be(av/nh)^(ref)=6.53 10^(-22) mag. cm^2, with significant differences between theinner and outer galaxy. we derive an average xco value of 1.67 10^(20) h2cm^(-2)/(k km s^(-1)). in the solar neighborhood, the gas mass in the darkcomponent is found to be 19% relative to that in the atomic component and164$%$ relative to the one traced by co. these results are compatible with therecent analysis using planck data within the uncertainties of our measurements.we estimate the ratio of dark gas to total molecular gas to be 0.62 in thesolar neighborhood. the hi-to-h2 and h2-to-co transitions appear for av$\simeq$0.2 mag and av$\simeq1.5$ mag, respectively, in agreement withtheoretical models of dark-h2 gas.

1211.7119	supergiant shells and molecular cloud formation in the lmc	we investigate the influence of large-scale stellar feedback on the formationof molecular clouds in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). examining therelationship between hi and 12co(j=1-0) in supergiant shells (sgss), we findthat the molecular fraction in the total volume occupied by sgss is notenhanced with respect to the rest of the lmc disk. however, the majority ofobjects (~70% by mass) are more molecular than their local surroundings,implying that the presence of a supergiant shell does on average have apositive effect on the molecular gas fraction. averaged over the full sgssample, our results suggest that ~12-25% of the molecular mass in supergiantshell systems was formed as a direct result of the stellar feedback thatcreated the shells. this corresponds to ~4-11% of the total molecular mass ofthe galaxy. these figures are an approximate lower limit to the totalcontribution of stellar feedback to molecular cloud formation in the lmc, andconstitute one of the first quantitative measurements of feedback-triggeredmolecular cloud formation in a galactic system.

(2011) modellingtechnique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of thestar formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of pahs or thedust mass surface density of the region. we observe that the pah fractionstrongly decreases in the hii regions. this decrease coincides with peaks inthe mean radiation field intensity map. the dust surface densities follow thefir distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 msolar (2.8 times lessthan when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. we find anon-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud n159 south (showing nomassive sf). we also investigate the drivers of the herschel/pacs and spiresubmm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) andthe xco conversion factor in the region n159. we finally model individualregions to analyse variations in the sed shape across the complex and the 870umemission in more details. no measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems tobe detected in these regions.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1401.7418	a detailed study of non-thermal x-ray properties and interstellar gas  toward the \gamma-ray supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946	we have carried out a spectral analysis of the suzaku x-ray data in the0.4-12 kev range toward the shell-type very-high-energy {\gamma}-ray supernovaremnant rx j1713.7-3946. the aims of this analysis are to estimate detailedx-rays spectral properties at a high angular resolution up to 2 arcmin, and tocompare them with the interstellar gas. the x-ray spectrum is non-thermal andused to calculate absorbing column density, photon index, andabsorption-corrected x-ray flux. the photon index varies significantly from 2.1to 2.9. it is shown that the x-ray intensity is well correlated with the photonindex, especially in the west region, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81.the x-ray intensity tends to increase with the averaged interstellar gasdensity while the dispersion is relatively large. the hardest spectra havingthe photon index less than 2.4 are found outside of the central 10 arcmin ofthe snr, from the north to the southeast (~430 arcmin^2) and from the southwestto the northwest (~150 arcmin^2). the former region shows low interstellar gasdensity, while the latter high interstellar gas density. we present discussionfor possible scenarios which explain the distribution of the photon index andits relationship with the interstellar gas.

1403.0999	optically thick hi dominant in the local interstellar medium; an  alternative interpretation to "dark gas"	dark gas in the interstellar medium (ism) is believed to not be detectableeither in co or hi radio emission, but it is detected by other means includinggamma-rays, dust emission and extinction traced outside the galactic plane at|b|&gt;5 degree. in these analyses, the 21-cm hi emission is usually assumed to becompletely optically thin. we have reanalyzed the hi emission from the wholesky at |b|&gt;15 degree by considering temperature stratification in the isminferred from the planck/iras analysis of the dust properties. the resultsindicate that the hi emission is saturated with an optical depth ranging from0.5 to 3 for 85% of the local hi gas. this optically thick hi is characterizedby spin temperature in the range 10k-60k, significantly lower than previouslypostulated in the literature, whereas such low temperature is consistent withemission/absorption measurements of the cool hi toward radio continuum sources.the distribution and the column density of the hi are consistent with those ofthe dark gas sug- gested by gamma-rays, and it is possible that the dark gas inthe galaxy is dominated by optically thick cold hi gas. this result impliesthat the average density of hi is 2-2.5 times higher than that derived on theoptically-thin assumption in the local ism.

1403.1250	the supernova remnant w44: confirmations and challenges for cosmic-ray  acceleration	the middle-aged supernova remnant (snr) w44 has recently attracted attentionbecause of its relevance regarding the origin of galactic cosmic-rays. thegamma-ray missions agile and fermi have established, for the first time for asnr, the spectral continuum below 200 mev which can be attributed to neutralpion emission. confirming the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission near100 mev is then of the greatest importance. our paper is focused on a globalre-assessment of all available data and models of particle acceleration in w44,with the goal of determining on a firm ground the hadronic and leptoniccontributions to the overall spectrum. we also present new gamma-ray and conanten2 data on w44, and compare them with recently published agile and fermidata. our analysis strengthens previous studies and observations of the w44complex environment and provides new information for a more detailed modeling.in particular, we determine that the average gas density of the regionsemitting 100 mev - 10 gev gamma-rays is relatively high (n= 250 - 300 cm^-3).the hadronic interpretation of the gamma-ray spectrum of w44 is viable, andsupported by strong evidence. it implies a relatively large value for theaverage magnetic field (b &gt; 10^2 microg) in the snr surroundings, sign of fieldamplification by shock-driven turbulence. our new analysis establishes that thespectral index of the proton energy distribution function is p1 = 2.2 +/- 0.1at low energies and p2 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 at high energies. we critically discusshadronic versus leptonic-only models of emission taking into accountsimultaneously radio and gamma-ray data. we find that the leptonic models aredisfavored by the combination of radio and gamma-ray data. having determinedthe hadronic nature of the gamma-ray emission on firm ground, a number oftheoretical challenges remains to be addressed.

1404.2285	characterizing the structure of diffuse emission in hi-gal maps	we present a study of the structure of the galactic interstellar mediumthrough the delta-variance technique, related to the power spectrum and thefractal properties of infrared/sub-mm maps. through this method, it is possibleto provide quantitative parameters which are useful to characterize differentmorphological and physical conditions, and to better constrain the theoreticalmodels. in this respect, the herschel infrared galactic plane survey carriedout at five photometric bands from 70 to 500 \mu m constitutes an uniquedatabase for applying statistical tools to a variety of regions across themilky way. in this paper, we derive a robust estimate of the power-law portionof the power spectrum of four contiguous 2{\deg}x2{\deg} hi-gal tiles locatedin the third galactic quadrant (217{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 225{\deg}, -2{\deg} &lt; b &lt;0{\deg}). the low level of confusion along the line of sight testified by coobservations makes this region an ideal case. we find very different values ofthe power spectrum slope from tile to tile but also from wavelength towavelength (2 &lt; \beta &lt; 3), with similarities between fields attributable tocomponents located at the same distance. thanks to the comparison with modelsof turbulence, an explanation of the determined slopes in terms of the fractalgeometry is also provided, and possible relations with the underlying physicsare investigated. in particular, an anti-correlation between ism fractaldimension and star formation efficiency is found for the two main distancecomponents observed in these fields. a possible link between the fractalproperties of the diff?use emission and the resulting clump mass function isdiscussed.

(2014) revealed two candidate molecular counterparts ofthe dhn at radial velocities of -35 km/s and 0 km/s and discussed the model inwhich the dhn has its origin at the circumnuclear disk in the gc. in thispaper, new co observations toward the dhn using the cso and mopra telescopesare presented. the higher-resolution observations of ~1 pc scale reveal thedetailed distributions and kinematics of the two co counterparts (the 0 km/sand -35 km/s features) and provide new information on their physicalconditions. as a result, we find that the 0 km/s feature with a mass of3.3x10^4 msun coincides with the infrared emission of the dhn, indicating clearassociation with the dhn. the association of the -35 km/s feature, with a massof 0.8x10^4 msun, is less clear compared with the 0 km/s feature, but thecomplementary distribution between the molecular gas and the dhn and velocityvariation along the dhn support its association with the dhn. the two molecularfeatures are highly excited, as shown by the relatively high co j=2-1/j=1-0intensity ratios of ~1.0, and have kinetic temperatures of ~30 k, consistentwith the typical molecular clouds in the gc.

1405.0331	comparison of prestellar core elongations and large-scale molecular  cloud structures in the lupus i region	turbulence and magnetic fields are expected to be important for regulatingmolecular cloud formation and evolution. however, their effects on subparsec to100 parsec scales, leading to the formation of starless cores, is not wellunderstood. we investigate the prestellar core structure morphologies obtainedfrom analysis of the herschel-spire 350 $\mu$m maps of the lupus i cloud. thisdistribution is first compared on a statistical basis to the large scale shapeof the main filament. we find the distribution of the elongation position angleof the cores to be consistent with a random distribution, which means nospecific orientation of the morphology of the cores is observed with respect toa large-scale filament shape model for lupus i, or relative to a large-scalebent filament model. this distribution is also compared to the mean orientationof the large-scale magnetic fields probed at 350 $\mu$m with the balloon-bornelarge aperture telescope for polarimetry (blastpol) during its 2010 campaign.here again we do not find any correlation between the core morphologydistribution and the average orientation of the magnetic fields on parsecscales. our main conclusion is that the local filament dynamics - includingsecondary filaments that often run orthogonally to the primary filament - andpossibly small-scale variations in the local magnetic field direction, could bethe dominant factors for explaining the final orientation of each core.

1407.2381	magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a jet drilling an hi cloud: shock  induced formation of molecular clouds and jet breakup	the formation mechanism of the jet-aligned co clouds found by nanten coobservations is studied by magnetohydrodynamical (mhd) simulations taking intoaccount the cooling of the interstellar medium. motivated by the association ofthe co clouds with the enhancement of hi gas density, we carried out mhdsimulations of the propagation of a supersonic jet injected into the dense higas. we found that the hi gas compressed by the bow shock ahead of the jet iscooled down by growth of the cooling instability triggered by the densityenhancement. as a result, cold dense sheath is formed around the interfacebetween the jet and the hi gas. the radial speed of the cold, dense gas in thesheath is a few km/s almost independent of the jet speed. molecular clouds canbe formed in this region. since the dense sheath wrapping the jet reflectswaves generated in the cocoon, the jet is strongly perturbed by the vortices ofthe warm gas in the cocoon, which breaks up the jet and forms a secondary shockin the hi-cavity drilled by the jet. the particle acceleration at the shock canbe the origin of radio and x-ray filaments observed near the eastern edge ofw50 nebula surrounding the galactic jet source ss433.

1503.06795	isolating signatures of major cloud-cloud collisions using  position-velocity diagrams	collisions between giant molecular clouds are a potential mechanism fortriggering the formation of massive stars, or even super star clusters. thetrouble is identifying this process observationally and distinguishing it fromother mechanisms. we produce synthetic position-velocity diagrams from modelsof: cloud-cloud collisions, non-interacting clouds along the line of sight,clouds with internal radiative feedback and a more complex cloud evolving in agalactic disc, to try and identify unique signatures of collision. we find thata broad bridge feature connecting two intensity peaks, spatially correlated butseparated in velocity, is a signature of a high velocity cloud-cloud collision.we show that the broad bridge feature is resilient to the effects of radiativefeedback, at least to around 2.5myr after the formation of the first massive(ionising) star. however for a head on 10km/s collision we find that this willonly be observable from 20-30 per cent of viewing angles. such broad-bridgefeatures have been identified towards m20, a very young region of massive starformation that was concluded to be a site of cloud-cloud collision by torii etal (2011), and also towards star formation in the outer milky way by izumi etal (2014).

1506.00759	enhancement of the 6.4 kev line in the inner galactic ridge:  proton-induced fluorescence?	a common idea for the origin of the galactic diffuse x-ray emission,particularly that of the iron lines from neutral and highly ionized atoms, is asuperposition of many cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries. inthis scenario, the flux should symmetrically distribute between the east andwest on the plane with respect to sagittarius a$^*$ because the stellar massdistribution determined by infrared observations is nearly symmetric. thissymmetry is confirmed for the highly ionized iron line as well as the continuumemission. however, a clear excess of the neutral iron line in the near east ofthe galactic center compared to the near-west side is found. the fluxdistribution of the excess emission well correlates with molecular columndensity. the x-ray spectrum of the excess emission is described by a power-lawcontinuum plus a 6.4 kev line with the large equivalent width of $\sim1.3$ kev,which is hardly explained by the low-energy electron bombardment scenario. thelongitudinal and latitudinal distribution of the excess emission disfavors thex-ray irradiation, neither by sagittarius a$^*$ nor by nearby x-ray binaries.then the low-energy proton bombardment is the most probable origin although thehigh energy density $\sim 80$ ev cm$^{-3}$ in 0.1-1000 mev is required andthere is no conventional proton source in the vicinity.

1509.00859	isolating signatures of major cloud-cloud collisions ii: the lifetimes  of broad bridge features	we investigate the longevity of broad bridge features in position-velocitydiagrams that appear as a result of cloud-cloud collisions. broad bridges willhave a finite lifetime due to the action of feedback, conversion of gas intostars and the timescale of the collision. we make a series of analyticarguments with which to estimate these lifetimes. our simple analytic argumentssuggest that for collisions between clouds larger than r~10 pc the lifetime ofthe broad bridge is more likely to be determined by the lifetime of thecollision rather than the radiative or wind feedback disruption timescale.however for smaller clouds feedback becomes much more effective. this isbecause the radiative feedback timescale scales with the ionising flux nly asr^{7/4}nly^{-1/4} so a reduction in cloud size requires a relatively largedecrease in ionising photons to maintain a given timescale. we find that ouranalytic arguments are consistent with new synthetic observations of numericalsimulations of cloud-cloud collisions (including star formation and radiativefeedback). we also argue that if the number of observable broad bridges remains~ constant, then the disruption timescale must be roughly equivalent to thecollision rate. if this is the case our analytic arguments also providecollision rate estimates, which we find are readily consistent with previoustheoretical models at the scales they consider (clouds larger than about 10 pc)but are much higher for smaller clouds.

1511.07457	the dust properties and physical conditions of the interstellar medium  in the lmc massive star forming complex n11	we combine spitzer and herschel data of the star-forming region n11 in thelarge magellanic cloud to produce detailed maps of the dust properties in thecomplex and study their variations with the ism conditions. we also compareapex/laboca 870um observations with our model predictions in order to decomposethe 870um emission into dust and non-dust (free-free emission and co(3-2) line)contributions. we find that in n11, the 870um can be fully accounted for bythese 3 components. the dust surface density map of n11 is combined with hi andco observations to study local variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratios. ouranalysis leads to values lower than those expected from the lmc low-metallicityas well as to a decrease of the gas-to-dust mass ratio with the dust surfacedensity. we explore potential hypotheses that could explain the low observedgas-to-dust mass ratios (variations in the xco factor, presence of co-dark gasor of optically thick hi or variations in the dust abundance in the denseregions). we finally decompose the local seds using a principal componentanalysis (i.e. with no a priori assumption on the dust composition in thecomplex). our results lead to a promising decomposition of the local seds invarious dust components (hot, warm, cold) coherent with that expected for theregion. further analysis on a larger sample of galaxies will follow in order tounderstand how unique this decomposition is or how it evolves from oneenvironment to another.

astro-ph;0503199	nonthermal x-radiation of snr rx j1713.7-3946: the relations to a nearby  molecular cloud	the recent x-ray and co observations of rx j1713.7-3946 show that asignificant fraction of the nonthermal x-ray emission of this unique supernovaremnant associates, in one way or another, with a molecular cloud interactingwith the west part of the shell. this adds a new puzzle in the origin of x-rayemission which cannot be easily explained within the standard model inaccordance of which x-rays are result of synchrotron radiation of multi-tevelectrons accelerated by supernova shock waves. we explore an alternativeorigin of the x-ray emission assuming that it is produced by secondaryelectrons resulting from high energy hadronic interactions in the moleculargas. such a scenario could explain in a quite natural way the apparentcorrelation between the x-ray and co morphologies. however, the tev gamma-rayemission recently reported by h.e.s.s. significantly constrains the parameterspace of this model. namely, this mechanism cannot reproduce the bulk of theobserved x-ray flux unless one postulates existence of a pev cosmic-raycomponent penetrating with an unusually hard spectrum into the dense cloud.

astro-ph;0506489	a detailed study of molecular clouds toward the tev gamma-ray snr  g347.3-0.5	we present a detailed study of molecular gas toward the supernovae remnantg347.3-0.5 (j1713.7-3946) obtained with the 4m mm/sub-mm telescope nanten .this study has revealed that several intensity peaks and the overalldistribution of the molecular gas with radial velocities from -12 km s-1 to -3km s-1 show a remarkably good correlation with the x-ray features, stronglysupporting the kinematic distance ~ 1 kpc derived by fukui et al. (2003), asopposed to 6 kpc previously claimed. in addition, we show that absorption ofx-rays is caused by local molecular gas at softer x-ray bands. subsequentmeasurements of the co(j=3-2) made with the aste 10 m and cso 10.4 m telescopestoward the molecular intensity peaks have revealed higher excitationconditions, most likely higher temperatures above ~ 30 k as compared to that ofthe typical gas in low mass dark clouds. this is most likely caused by enhancedheating by the high energy events in the snr, where possible mechanisms includeheating by x-rays, gamma-rays, and/or cosmic ray protons, although we admitadditional radiative heating by young protostars embedded may be working aswell. in one of the co peaks, we have confirmed the presence of broad molecularwings of ~ 20 km s-1 velocity extent in the co(j=3-2) transition. the snrevolution is well explained as the free expansion phase based on the distanceof 1 kpc.

astro-ph;0508121	high-mass cloud cores in the eta carinae giant molecular cloud	we carried out an unbiased survey for massive dense cores in the giantmolecular cloud associated with eta carinae with the nanten telescope in 12co,13co, and c18o 1-0 emission lines. we identified 15 c18o cores. two of the 15cores are associated with iras point sources whose luminosities are larger than10^4 lo, which indicates that massive star formation is occuring within thesecores. five cores including the two with iras sources are associated with msxpoint sources. we detected h13co+ (1-0) emission toward 4 c18o cores, one ofwhich is associated with neither iras nor msx point sources. this core showsthe presence of a bipolar molecular outflow in 12co (2-1), which indicates thatstar formation is also occuring in the core. in total, six c18o cores out of 15are experienced star formation, and at least 2 of 15 are massive-star formingcores in the eta car gmc. we found that massive star formation occurspreferentially in cores with larger column density, mass, number density, andsmaller ratio of virial mass to lte mass mvir/m. we also found that the coresin the eta car gmc are characterized by large line width and mvir/m on averagecompared to the cores in other gmcs. we investigated the origin of a largeamount of turbulence in the eta car gmc. we propose the possibility that thelarge turbulence was pre-existing when the gmc was formed, and is nowdissipating. mechanisms such as multiple supernova explosions in the carinaflare supershell may have contributed to form a gmc with a large amount ofturbulence.

astro-ph;0510473	an unbiased survey for molecular clouds in the southern galactic warp	we have made an unbiased survey for molecular clouds in the galactic warp.this survey, covering an area of 56 square degrees at l = 252 deg to 266 degand b = -5 deg to -1 deg, has revealed 70 molecular clouds, while only 6 cloudswere previously known in the region. the number of molecular clouds is, then,an order of magnitude greater than previously known in this sector at r &gt; 14.5kpc. the mass of the clouds is in a range from 7.8x10(2) mo to 8.4x10(4) mo,significantly less than the most massive giant molecular clouds in the innerdisk, ~10(6) mo, while the cloud mass spectrum characterized by a power law isbasically similar to other parts of the galaxy. the x factor, n(h2)/wco(12co),derived from the molecular clouds in the warp is estimated to be 3.5(+/-1.8)times larger than that in the inner disk. the total molecular mass in the warpis estimated as 7.3x10(5) mo, and total mass in the far-outer galaxy (r &gt; 14.5kpc) can be estimated as 2x10(7) mo. the spatial correlation between the co andhi distribution appears fairly good, and the mass of the molecular gas is about1% of that of the atomic gas in the far-outer galaxy. this ratio is similar tothat in the interarm but is ten times smaller than those of the spiral arms.only 6 of the 70 warp clouds show signs of star formation at the irassensitivity and star formation efficiency for high-mass stars in the warp isfound to be smaller than those in other molecular clouds in the galaxy.

astro-ph;0602380	a multi-resolution analysis of the radio-fir correlation in the large  magellanic cloud	we investigate the local correlation betwen the 1.4 ghz radio continuum and60 micron far-infrared (fir) emission within the large magellanic cloud (lmc)on spatial scales between 0.05 and 1.5 kpc. on scales below ~1 kpc, theradio-fir correlation is clearly better than the correlation of the cold gastracers with either the radio or the fir emission. for the lmc as a whole,there is a tight correlation between the radio and fir emission on spatialscales above ~50 pc. by decomposing the radio emission into thermal andnon-thermal components, however, we show that the scale on which the radio-fircorrelation breaks down is inversely proportional to the thermal fraction ofthe radio emission: regions that show a strong correlation to very small scalesare the same regions where the thermal fraction of the radio emission is high.contrary to previous studies of the local radio-fir correlation in the lmc, weshow that the slope of the relation between the radio and fir emission isnon-linear. in bright star-forming regions, the radio emission increases fasterthan linearly with respect to the fir emission (power-law slope of ~1.2),whereas a flatter slope of ~0.6-0.9 applies more generally across the lmc. ourresults are consistent with a scenario in which the uv photons and cosmic raysin the lmc have a common origin in massive star formation, but the cosmic raysare able to diffuse away from their production sites. our results do notprovide direct evidence for coupling between the magnetic field and the localgas density, but we note that synchrotron emission may not be a good tracer ofthe magnetic field if cosmic rays can readily escape the lmc.

astro-ph;0703727	multi-frequency study of the lmc supernova remnant (snr) b0513-692 and  new snr candidate j051327-6911	we present a new multi-wavelength study of supernova remnant (snr) b0513-692in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the remnant also has a strong, superposed,essentially unresolved, but unrelated radio source at its north-western edge,j051324-691049. this is identified as a likely compact hii region based onrelated optical imaging and spectroscopy. we use the australia telescopecompact array (atca) at 4790 and 8640 mhz to determine the large scalemorphology, spectral index and polarization characteristics of b0513-692 forthe first time. we detect a strongly polarized region (49%) in the remnant'ssouthern edge. interestingly we also detect a small (~40 arcsec) moderatelybright, but distinct optical, circular shell in our halpha imagery which isadjacent to the compact hii region and just within the borders of the ne edgeof b0513-692. we suggest this is a separate new snr candidate based on itsapparently distinct character in terms of optical morphology in 3 imagedemission lines and indicative snr optical spectroscopy (including enhancedoptical [sii] emission relative to halpha).

astro-ph;0703761	star-forming regions in the small magellanic cloud multi-wavelength  properties of stellar complexes	we trace the star formation regions in the smc and study their properties.the size and spatial distribution of these regions is found to support thehierarchical scenario of star formation, whereas, the evaluation of theirintensity, contributes to the understanding of the various stages of starformation. their connection to the lmc-smc close encounter, about $(0.9-2)\times 10^{8}$ years ago, is investigated as well. the smc, being almostedge-on, does not easily reveal these areas, as is the case with the lmc.however, a study through multi-wavelength images such as optical, ir and radiohas been proved very useful. a selection of areas, with enhanced 60 and100-$\mu$m infrared flux and emission in all iras bands, identifies the starforming regions. all of the identified regions are dominated by early-typestars and considering their overall size (increasing order) a total of 24aggregates, 23 complexes, and 3 super-complexes were found. we present theircoordinates, dimensions, and ir fluxes. moreover, we correlate their positionswith known associations, snrs, and \hii regions and discuss their activity.
