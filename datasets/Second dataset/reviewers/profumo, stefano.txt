0812.4457	dissecting cosmic-ray electron-positron data with occam's razor: the  role of known pulsars	we argue that both the positron fraction measured by pamela and the peculiarspectral features reported in the total electron-positron (e+e-) flux measuredby atic have a very natural explanation in electron-positron pairs produced bynearby pulsars. while this possibility was pointed out a long time ago, thegreatly improved quality of current data potentially allow to reverse-engineerthe problem: given the regions of pulsar parameter space favored by pamela andby atic, are there known pulsars that explain the data with reasonableassumptions on the injected e+e- pairs? in the context of simple benchmarkmodels for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listedin the most complete available catalogue. we find that it is unlikely that asingle pulsar be responsible for both the pamela e+ fraction anomaly and forthe atic excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explainboth experimental results. the pamela excess e+ likely come from a set ofmature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single,younger and closer source like geminga. the atic data require a larger (andless plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, moredistant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars. we list severalcandidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute to explain thepamela and atic data. although generally suppressed, we find that thecontribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could contribute for the aticexcess. finally, we stress the multi-faceted and decisive role that fermi-latwill play in the very near future by (1) providing an exquisite measurement ofthe e+e- flux, (2) unveiling the existence of as yet undetected pulsars, and(3) searching for anisotropies in the arrival direction of high-energy e+e-.

0902.3219	strong gravitational lensing probes of the particle nature of dark  matter	there is a vast menagerie of plausible candidates for the constituents ofdark matter, both within and beyond extensions of the standard model ofparticle physics. each of these candidates may have scattering (and other)cross section properties that are consistent with the dark matter abundance,bbn, and the most scales in the matter power spectrum; but which may havevastly different behavior at sub-galactic "cutoff" scales, below which darkmatter density fluctuations are smoothed out. the only way to quantitativelymeasure the power spectrum behavior at sub-galactic scales at distances beyondthe local universe, and indeed over cosmic time, is through probes available inmultiply imaged strong gravitational lenses. gravitational potentialperturbations by dark matter substructure encode information in the observedrelative magnifications, positions, and time delays in a strong lens. each ofthese is sensitive to a different moment of the substructure mass function andto different effective mass ranges of the substructure. the time delayperturbations, in particular, are proving to be largely immune to thedegeneracies and systematic uncertainties that have impacted exploitation ofstrong lenses for such studies. there is great potential for a coordinatedtheoretical and observational effort to enable a sophisticated exploitation ofstrong gravitational lenses as direct probes of dark matter properties. thisopportunity motivates this white paper, and drives the need for: a) strongsupport of the theoretical work necessary to understand all astrophysicalconsequences for different dark matter candidates; and b) tailoredobservational campaigns, and even a fully dedicated mission, to obtain therequisite data.

0907.4374	can we discover dual-component thermal wimp dark matter?	we address the question of whether the upcoming generation of dark mattersearch experiments and colliders will be able to discover if the dark matter inthe universe has two components of weakly interacting massive particles(wimps). we outline a model-independent approach, and we study the specificcases of (1) direct detection with low-background 1 ton noble-gas detectors and(2) a 0.5 tev center of mass energy electron-positron linear collider. we alsoanalyze the case of indirect detection via two gamma-ray lines, which wouldprovide a verification of such a discovery, although multiple gamma-ray linescan in principle originate from the annihilation of a single dark matterparticle. for each search "channel", we outline a few assumptions to relate thevery small set of parameters we consider (defining the masses of the two wimpsand their relative abundance in the overall dark matter density) with therelevant detection rates. we then draw general conclusions on which corners ofa generic dual-component dark matter scenario can be explored with current andnext generation experiments. we find that in all channels the ideal setup isone where the relative mass splitting between the two wimp species is of order1, and where the two dark matter components contribute in a ratio close to 1:1to the overall dark matter content of the universe. interestingly, in the caseof direct detection, future experiments might detect multiple states even ifonly ~ 10% of the energy-density of dark matter in the universe is in thesubdominant species.

0909.1317	the impact of a strongly first-order phase transition on the abundance  of thermal relics	we study the impact of a strongly first-order electro-weak phase transitionon the thermal relic abundance of particle species that could constitute thedark matter and that decoupled before the phase transition occurred. we definea dilution factor induced by generic first-order phase transitions, and weexplore the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric extension to thestandard model to determine which phase transition temperatures and dilutionfactors are relevant for the lightest neutralino as a dark matter candidate. wethen focus on a specific toy-model setup that could give rise to a stronglyfirst-order electro-weak phase transition, and proceed to a detailedcalculation of dilution factors and transition temperatures, comparing ourfindings to actual neutralino dark matter models. typical models that wouldproduce an excessive thermal relic density and that can be salvaged postulatinga strongly first-order electro-weak phase transition include massive(multi-tev) wino or higgsino-like neutralinos, as well as bino-like neutralinosin a wider mass range, with masses as low as 400 gev. if lhc data indicate aninferred thermal neutralino relic abundance larger than the cold dark matterdensity, the mismatch could thus potentially be explained by electro-weak scalephysics that will also be thoroughly explored with collider experiments in thenear future.

1001.4086	multi-wavelength searches for particle dark matter	if dark matter particles pair annihilate into stable standard modelparticles, a population of energetic, non-thermal electrons and positrons isnecessarily produced. the secondary radiation resulting from the energy lossesof this non-standard population (including synchrotron and inverse comptonup-scattering of background radiation photons) in turn produces a peculiarmulti-wavelength spectrum, extending from radio to gamma-ray frequencies. wegive here an overview of multi-wavelength searches for dark matter, includingthe expected injection spectrum and production rate of electrons and positronsfrom dark matter annihilation, the computation of the effects of propagationand energy losses and the actual multi-wavelength emission. we then outline theapplication of this general framework to the case of galaxy clusters(specifically coma, 1e 0657-56 - the so-called bullet cluster - and ophiuchus)and of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (including draco, fornax, ursa minor andcarina). we also review the application of multi-wavelength search strategiesto our own milky way, and more specifically to the galactic center environment,to dark galactic mini-halos and to the so-called wmap haze and other radiodata. we argue that multi-wavelength observations will complement gamma-rayobservations as probes of particle dark matter, since the expected luminositiesat different frequencies are generically comparable. the indirect search fordark matter with astronomical observations at various frequencies is thereforea crucial and indispensable element in the quest for the fundamental nature ofdark matter.

1001.4540	the contribution of fermi gamma-ray pulsars to the local flux of  cosmic-ray electrons and positrons	we analyze the contribution of gamma-ray pulsars from the first fermi-largearea telescope (lat) catalogue to the local flux of cosmic-ray electrons andpositrons (e+e-). we present new distance estimates for all fermi gamma-raypulsars, based on the measured gamma-ray flux and pulse shape. we then estimatethe contribution of gamma-ray pulsars to the local e+e- flux, in the context ofa simple model for the pulsar e+e- emission. we find that 10 of the fermipulsars potentially contribute significantly to the measured e+e- flux in theenergy range between 100 gev and 1 tev. of the 10 pulsars, 2 are old egretgamma-ray pulsars, 2 pulsars were discovered with radio ephemerides, and 6 werediscovered with the fermi pulsar blind-search campaign. we argue that knownradio pulsars fall in regions of parameter space where the e+e- contribution ispredicted to be typically much smaller than from those regions where fermi-latpulsars exist. however, comparing the fermi gamma-ray flux sensitivity to theregions of pulsar parameter space where a significant e+e- contribution ispredicted, we find that a few known radio pulsars that have not yet beendetected by fermi can also significantly contribute to the local e+e- flux if(i) they are closer than 2 kpc, and if (ii) they have a characteristic age onthe order of one mega-year.

1003.0002	systematic effects in extracting a "gamma-ray haze" from spatial  templates	recent claims of a gamma-ray excess in the diffuse galactic emission detectedby the fermi large area telescope with a morphology similar to the wmap hazewere based on the assumption that spatial templates of the interstellar medium(ism) column density and the 408 mhz sky are good proxies for neutral pion andinverse compton (ic) gamma-ray emission, respectively. we identify significantsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additionaldiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-rayhaze. to quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of theratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ism column density,and of ic to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray modelsand simulations. in the region above and below the galactic center, the ismtemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay byapproximately 20%. additionally, the synchrotron template tends tounder-estimate the ic emission at low energies (few gev) and to over-estimateit at higher energies (tens of gev) by potentially large factors that dependcrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the galaxy. the size ofthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed "fermihaze" signal. we thus conclude that a detailed model for the galactic diffuseemission is necessary in order to conclusively assess the presence of agamma-ray excess possibly associated to the wmap haze morphology.

1004.3998	the morphology of the galactic dark matter synchrotron emission with  self-consistent cosmic ray diffusion models	a generic prediction in the paradigm of weakly interacting dark matter is theproduction of relativistic particles from dark matter pair-annihilation inregions of high dark matter density. ultra-relativistic electrons and positronsproduced in the center of the galaxy by dark matter annihilation should producea diffuse synchrotron emission. while the spectral shape of the synchrotrondark matter haze depends on the particle model (and secondarily on the galacticmagnetic fields), the morphology of the haze depends primarily on (1) the darkmatter density distribution, (2) the galactic magnetic field morphology, and(3) the diffusion model for high-energy cosmic-ray leptons. interestingly, anunidentified excess of microwave radiation with characteristics similar tothose predicted by dark matter models has been claimed to exist near thegalactic center region in the data reported by the wmap satellite, and dubbedthe "wmap haze". in this study, we carry out a self-consistent treatment of thevariables enumerated above, enforcing constraints from the available data oncosmic rays, radio surveys and diffuse gamma rays. we outline and makepredictions for the general morphology and spectral features of a "dark matterhaze" and we compare them to the wmap haze data. we also characterize and studythe spectrum and spatial distribution of the inverse compton emission resultingfrom the same population of energetic electrons and positrons. we point outthat the spectrum and morphology of the radio emission at different frequenciesis a powerful diagnostics to test whether a galactic synchrotron haze indeedoriginates from dark matter annihilation.

1006.1648	implications of fermi observations for hadronic models of radio halos in  clusters of galaxies	we analyze the impact of the fermi non-detection of gamma-ray emission fromclusters of galaxies on hadronic models for the origin of cluster radio halos.in hadronic models, the inelastic proton-proton collisions responsible for theproduction of the electron-positron population fueling the observed synchrotronradio emission yield a gamma-ray flux, from the decay of neutral pions, whosespectrum and normalization depend on the observed radio emissivity and on thecluster magnetic field. we thus infer lower limits on the average clustermagnetic field in hadronic models from the fermi gamma-ray limits. we alsocalculate the corresponding maximal energy density in cosmic rays and theminimal-guaranteed gamma-ray flux from hadronic radio-halo models. we find thatthe observationally most interesting cases correspond to clusters with largeradio emissivities featuring soft spectra. estimates of the central magneticfield values for those clusters are larger than, or close, to the largestmagnetic field values inferred from faraday rotation measures of clusters,placing tension on the hadronic origin of radio halos. in most cases, however,we find that the fermi data do not per se rule out hadronic models for clusterradio halos as the expected gamma-ray flux can be pushed below the fermisensitivity for asymptotically large magnetic fields. we also find that cosmicrays do not contribute significantly to the cluster energy budget for nearbyradio halo clusters.

1008.2230	probing dark matter with agn jets	we study the possibility of detecting a signature of particle dark matter inthe spectrum of gamma-ray photons from active galactic nuclei (agns) resultingfrom the scattering of high-energy particles in the agn jet off of dark matterparticles. we consider particle dark matter models in the context of bothsupersymmetry and universal extra-dimensions (ued), and we present the completelowest-order calculation for processes where a photon is emitted in darkmatter-electron and/or dark matter-proton scattering, where electrons andprotons belong to the agn jet. we find that the process is dominated by aresonance whose energy is dictated by the particle spectrum in the dark mattersector (neutralino and selectron for the case of supersymmetry, kaluza-kleinphoton and electron for ued). the resulting gamma-ray spectrum exhibits a verycharacteristic spectral feature, consisting of a sharp break to a hardpower-law behavior. although the normalization of the gamma-ray flux dependsstrongly on assumptions on both the agn jet geometry, composition and particlespectrum as well as on the particle dark matter model and density distribution,we show that for realistic parameters choices, and for two prominent nearbyagns (centaurus a and m87), the detection of this effect is in principlepossible. finally, we compare our predictions and results with recent gamma-rayobservations from the fermi, h.e.s.s. and veritas telescopes.

1104.5487	gravity waves from a cosmological phase transition: gauge artifacts and  daisy resummations	the finite-temperature effective potential customarily employed to describethe physics of cosmological phase transitions often relies on specific gaugechoices, and is manifestly not gauge-invariant at finite order in itsperturbative expansion. as a result, quantities relevant for the calculation ofthe spectrum of stochastic gravity waves resulting from bubble collisions infirst-order phase transitions are also not gauge-invariant. we assess thequantitative impact of this gauge-dependence on key quantities enteringpredictions for gravity waves from first order cosmological phase transitions.we resort to a simple abelian higgs model, and discuss the case of r_xi gauges.by comparing with results obtained using a gauge-invariant hamiltonianformalism, we show that the choice of gauge can have a dramatic effect ontheoretical predictions for the normalization and shape of the expected gravitywave spectrum. we also analyze the impact of resumming higher-ordercontributions as needed to maintain the validity of the perturbative expansion,and show that doing so can suppress the amplitude of the spectrum by an orderof magnitude or more. we comment on open issues and possible strategies forcarrying out "daisy resummed" gauge invariant computations in non-abelianmodels for which a gauge-invariant hamiltonian formalism is not presentlyavailable.

1106.4568	cosmic ray-dark matter scattering: a new signature of (asymmetric) dark  matter in the gamma ray sky	we consider the process of scattering of galactic cosmic-ray electrons andprotons off of dark matter with the radiation of a final-state photon. thisprocess provides a novel way to search for galactic dark matter with gammarays. we argue that for a generic weakly interacting massive particle, barringeffects such as co-annihilation or a velocity-dependent cross section, thegamma-ray emission from cosmic-ray scattering off of dark matter is typicallysmaller than that from dark matter pair-annihilation. however, if dark matterparticles cannot pair-annihilate, as is the case for example in asymmetric darkmatter scenarios, cosmic-ray scattering with final state photon emissionprovides a unique window to detect a signal from dark matter with gamma rays.we estimate the expected flux level and its spectral features for a genericsupersymmetric setup, and we also discuss dipolar and luminous dark matter. weshow that in some cases the gamma-ray emission might be large enough to bedetectable with the fermi large area telescope.

1108.1407	dark matter detection with hard x-ray telescopes	we analyze the impact of future hard x-ray observations on the search forindirect signatures of particle dark matter in large extragalactic systems suchas nearby clusters or groups of galaxies. we argue that the hard x-ray energyband falls squarely at the peak of the inverse compton emission from electronsand positrons produced by dark matter annihilation or decay for a large classof dark matter models. specifically, the most promising are low-mass modelswith a hard electron-positron annihilation final state spectrum andintermediate-mass models with a soft electron-positron spectrum. we find thatconstraints on dark matter models similar to the current constraints from thefermi gamma-ray space telescope will be close to the sensitivity limit of thenear-term hard x-ray telescopes nustar and astro-h for relatively longobservations. an instrument like the wide field imager (wfi) proposed forathena would instead give a significant gain in sensitivity to dark matter ifplaced in a low background orbit similar to nustar's; however, given the higherexpected background level for athena's proposed orbit at l2, its sensitivitywill be similar to that of nustar.

1203.1100	earthly probes of the smallest dark matter halos	dark matter kinetic decoupling involves elastic scattering of dark matter offof leptons and quarks in the early universe, the same process relevant fordirect detection and for the capture rate of dark matter in celestial bodies;the resulting size of the smallest dark matter collapsed structures should thuscorrelate with quantities connected with direct detection rates and with theflux of high-energy neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in the sun or inthe earth. in this paper we address this general question in the context of twowidely studied and paradigmatic weakly-interacting particle dark matter models:the lightest neutralino of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standardmodel, and the lightest kaluza-klein particle of universal extra dimensions(ued). we argue and show that while the scalar neutralino-nucleon cross sectioncorrelates poorly with the kinetic decoupling temperature, the spin-dependentcross section exhibits a strong correlation in a wide range of models. in uedmodels the correlation is present for both cross sections, and isextraordinarily tight for the spin-dependent case. a strong correlation is alsofound, for both models, for the flux of neutrinos from the sun, especially forfluxes large enough to be at potentially detectable levels. we provide analyticguidance and formulae that illustrate our findings.

1203.3539	the morphology of hadronic emission models for the gamma-ray source at  the galactic center	recently, detections of a high-energy gamma-ray source at the position of thegalactic center have been reported by multiple gamma-ray telescopes, spanningthe energy range between 100 mev and 100 tev. analysis of these signalsstrongly suggests the tev emission to have a morphology consistent with a pointsource up to the angular resolution of the hess telescope (approximately 3 pc),while the point-source nature of the gev emission is currently unsettled, withindications that it may be spatially extended. in the case that the emission ishadronic and in a steady state, we show that the expected gamma-ray morphologyis dominated by the distribution of target gas, rather than by details ofcosmic-ray injection and propagation. specifically, we expect a significantportion of hadronic emission to coincide with the position of thecircum-nuclear ring, which resides between 1-3 pc from the galactic center. wenote that the upcoming cherenkov telescope array (cta) will be able to observeconclusive correlations between the morphology of the tev gamma-ray source andthe observed gas density, convincingly confirming or ruling out a hadronicorigin for the gamma-ray emission.

1203.3547	the isotropic radio background and annihilating dark matter	observations by arcade-2 and other telescopes sensitive to low frequencyradiation have revealed the presence of an isotropic radio background with ahard spectral index. the intensity of this observed background is found toexceed the flux predicted from astrophysical sources by a factor ofapproximately 5-6. in this article, we consider the possibility thatannihilating dark matter particles provide the primary contribution to theobserved isotropic radio background through the emission of synchrotronradiation from electron and positron annihilation products. for reasonableestimates of the magnetic fields present in clusters and galaxies, we find thatdark matter could potentially account for the observed radio excess, but onlyif it annihilates mostly to electrons and/or muons, and only if it possesses amass in the range of approximately 5-50 gev. for such models, the annihilationcross section required to normalize the synchrotron signal to the observedexcess is sigma v ~ (0.4-30) x 10^-26 cm^3/s, similar to the value predictedfor a simple thermal relic (sigma v ~ 3 x 10^-26 cm^3/s). we find that in anyscenario in which dark matter annihilations are responsible for the observedexcess radio emission, a significant fraction of the isotropic gamma raybackground observed by fermi must result from dark matter as well.

1204.6047	gamma-ray lines in the fermi data: is it a bubble?	recently, tentative evidence for an excess of gamma rays at energies around130 gev has been reported from analyses of data from the fermi large areatelescope (lat). the excess is potentially of great interest, as it could beassociated with the pair-annihilation of galactic dark matter and thesubsequent production of monochromatic or internal bremsstrahlung gamma rays.the 130 gev excess appears when an optimized selection of the target region ofinterest is employed, a procedure that depends upon the assumed dark matterdensity profile. for the profiles producing an appreciable signal, these targetregions vastly overlap with the region corresponding to the so-called "fermibubbles". we argue that the tentative evidence for a line feature is likely dueto hard photons in the fermi bubbles regions, where the gamma-ray spectrumcontains a spectral break in the energy range of interest (100-150 gev).although the origin of this broken power-law is unclear, it is probably relatedto standard astrophysical processes and not to dark matter annihilation. abroken power-law provides as good a fit as a line "excess", even within smallenergy windows, and a significantly better fit for large energy windows.

1206.1676	gamma rays from star formation in clusters of galaxies	star formation in galaxies is observed to be associated with gamma-rayemission. the detection of gamma rays from star-forming galaxies by the fermilarge area telescope (lat) has allowed the determination of a functionalrelationship between star formation rate and gamma-ray luminosity (ackermannet. al. 2012). since star formation is known to scale with total infrared(8-1000 micrometers) and radio (1.4 ghz) luminosity, the observed infrared andradio emission from a star-forming galaxy can be used to quantitatively inferthe galaxy's gamma-ray luminosity. similarly, star forming galaxies withingalaxy clusters allow us to derive lower limits on the gamma-ray emission fromclusters, which have not yet been conclusively detected in gamma rays. in thisstudy we apply the relationships between gamma-ray luminosity and radio and irluminosities derived in ackermann et. al. 2012 to a sample of galaxy clustersfrom ackermann et. al. 2010 in order to place lower limits on the gamma-rayemission associated with star formation in galaxy clusters. we find thatseveral clusters have predicted lower limits on gamma-ray emission that arewithin an order of magnitude of the upper limits derived in ackermann et. al.2010 based on non-detection by fermi-lat. given the current gamma-ray limits,star formation likely plays a significant role in the gamma-ray emission insome clusters, especially those with cool cores. we predict that both fermi-latover the course of its lifetime and the future cherenkov telescope array willbe able to detect gamma-ray emission from star-forming galaxies in clusters.

1206.4308	exploring the nature of the galactic center gamma-ray source with the  cherenkov telescope array	observations from multiple gamma-ray telescopes have uncovered a high energygamma-ray source spatially coincident with the galactic center. recently, acompelling model for the broad-band gamma-ray emission has been formulatedwhich posits that high energy protons emanating from sgr a* could producegamma-rays through pion decays resulting from inelastic collisions with thetraversed interstellar gas in the region. models of the gas distribution in thegalactic center region imply that the resulting gamma-ray morphology would beobserved as a point source with all current telescopes, but that the upcomingcherenkov telescope array (cta) may be able to detect an extended emissionprofile with an unmistakable morphology. here, we critically evaluate thisclaim, employing a three dimensional gas distribution model and a detailedmonte carlo simulation, and using the anticipated effective area and angularresolution of cta. we find that the impressive angular resolution of cta willbe key to test hadronic emission models conclusively against, for example,point source or dark matter annihilation scenarios. we comment on the relevanceof this result for searches for dark matter annihilation in the galactic centerregion.

1210.0872	constraints on dark matter annihilation in clusters of galaxies from  diffuse radio emission	annihilation of dark matter can result in the production of stable standardmodel particles including electrons and positrons that, in the presence ofmagnetic fields, lose energy via synchrotron radiation, observable as radioemission. galaxy clusters are excellent targets to search for or to constrainthe rate of dark matter annihilation, as they are both massive and dark matterdominated. in this study, we place limits on dark matter annihilation in asample of nearby clusters using upper limits on the diffuse radio emission, lowlevels of observed diffuse emission, or detections of radio mini-haloes. wefind that the strongest limits on the annihilation cross section are betterthan limits derived from the non-detection of clusters in the gamma-ray band bya factor of approximately 3 or more when the same annihilation channel andsubtructure model, but different best-case clusters, are compared. the limitson the cross section depend on the assumed amount of substructure, varying byas much as 2 orders of magnitude for increasingly optimistic substructuremodels as compared to a smooth nfw profile. in our most optimistic case, usingthe results of the phoenix project (gao et al. 2012b) we find that the derivedlimits reach below the thermal relic cross section of 3x10^-26 cm^3 s^-1 fordark matter masses as large as 400 gev, for the bbar annihilation channel. wediscuss uncertainties due to the limited available data on the magnetic fieldstructure of individual clusters. we also report the discovery of diffuse radioemission from the central 30-40 kpc regions of the groups m49 and ngc4636.

1212.5747	testing the dark matter origin of the wmap-planck haze with radio  observations of spiral galaxies	if the galactic wmap radio haze, as recently confirmed by planck, is producedby dark matter annihilation or decay, similar diffuse radio halos should existaround other galaxies with physical properties comparable to the milky way. ifinstead the haze is due to an astrophysical mechanism peculiar to the milky wayor to a transient event, a similar halo need not exist around all milky way"twins". we use radio observations of 66 spiral galaxies to test the darkmatter origin of the haze. we select galaxies based on morphological type andmaximal rotational velocity, and obtain their luminosities from a 1.49 ghzcatalog and additional radio observations at other frequencies. we find manyinstances of galaxies with radio emission that is less than 5% as bright asnaively expected from dark matter models that could produce the milky way haze,and at least 3 galaxies that are less than 1% as bright as expected, assumingdark matter distributions, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray propagationparameters equal to those of the milky way. for reasonable ranges for thevariation of these parameters, we estimate the fraction of galaxies that shouldbe expected to be significantly less bright in radio, and argue that this ismarginally compatible with the observed distribution. while our findingstherefore cannot rule out a dark matter origin for the radio haze at this time,we find numerous examples (including the andromeda galaxy) where, if darkmatter is indeed the origin of the milky way haze, some mechanism must be inplace to suppress the corresponding haze of the external galaxy. we point outthat planck data will offer opportunities to improve this type of constraint ina highly relevant frequency range and for a potentially larger set of candidategalaxies.

1302.1915	gamma rays from cosmic-ray proton scattering in agn jets: the  intra-cluster gas vastly outshines dark matter	active galactic nuclei (agn) host powerful jets containing high-energyelectrons and protons. the astrophysical environment where agns and their jetsare found is characterized by large concentrations of both dark matter (dm) andintra-cluster medium (icm) gas. as the high-energy jet particles transverse thedm and the icm, elastic and inelastic scattering processes generically lead tothe production of final-state photons. as first envisioned by bloom and wells(1998), and as more recently pointed out by us and others, the scattering ofelectrons off of dm could lead to a potentially detectable gamma-ray signal,with the parton-level contribution from protons offering dimmer perspectives.recently, chang et al. argued that taking into account photons fromhadronization and showering, the actual photon flux is substantially increased.here, we point out that the proton-jets have to be highly collimated, contraryto what predicted by simple blob-geometry jet-models sometimes employed inthese studies, otherwise they would produce a very large flux of photons frominelastic collisions with icm nucleons, which would outshine by many orders ofmagnitude the signal from dm, for almost any reasonable icm and dm densityprofiles.

1302.4781	electroweak baryogenesis and the fermi gamma-ray line	many particle physics models attempt to explain the 130 gev gamma-ray featurethat the fermi-lat observes in the galactic center. neutralino dark matter innon-minimal supersymmetric models, such as the nmssm, is an especiallywell-motivated theoretical setup which can explain the line. we explore thepossibility that regions of the nmssm consistent with the 130 gev line can alsoproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via electroweakbaryogenesis. we find that such regions can in fact accommodate a stronglyfirst-order electroweak phase transition (due to the singlet contribution tothe effective potential), while also avoiding a light stop and producing astandard model-like higgs in the observed mass range. simultaneously,cp-violation from a complex phase in the wino-higgsino sector can account forthe observed baryon asymmetry through resonant sources at the electroweak phasetransition, while satisfying current constraints from dark matter, collider,and electric dipole moment (edm) experiments. this result is possible by virtueof a relatively light pseudoscalar higgs sector with a small degree of mixing,which yields efficient s-channel resonant neutralino annihilation consistentwith indirect detection constraints, and of the moderate values of $\mu$required to obtain a bino-like lsp consistent with the line. the wino mass isessentially a free parameter which one can tune to satisfy electroweakbaryogenesis. thus, the nmssm framework can potentially explain the origins ofboth baryonic and dark matter components in the universe. the tightness of theconstraints we impose on this scenario makes it extraordinarily predictive, andconclusively testable in the near future by modest improvements in edm and darkmatter search experiments.

1304.1791	probing the pulsar origin of the anomalous positron fraction with ams-02  and atmospheric cherenkov telescopes	recent observations by pamela, fermi-lat, and ams-02 have conclusivelyindicated a rise in the cosmic-ray positron fraction above 10 gev, a featurewhich is impossible to mimic under the paradigm of secondary positronproduction with self-consistent galactic cosmic-ray propagation models. aleading explanation for the rising positron fraction is an additional source ofelectron-positron pairs, for example one or more mature, energetic, andrelatively nearby pulsars. we point out that any one of two well-known nearbypulsars, geminga and monogem, can satisfactorily provide enough positrons toreproduce ams-02 observations. a smoking-gun signature of this scenario is ananisotropy in the arrival direction of the cosmic-ray electrons and positrons,which may be detectable by existing, or future, telescopes. the predictedanisotropy level is, at present, consistent with limits from fermi-lat andams-02. we argue that the large collecting area of atmospheric cherenkovtelescopes (acts) makes them optimal tools for detecting such an anisotropy.specifically, we show that much of the proton and gamma-ray background, whichaffects measurements of the cosmic-ray electron-positron spectrum with acts,may be controlled in the search for anisotropies. we conclude that observationsusing archival act data could already constrain or substantiate the pulsarorigin of the positron anomaly, while upcoming instruments (such as thecherenkov telescope array) will provide strong constraints on the source of therising positron fraction.

1304.5524	a clustering analysis of the morphology of the 130 gev gamma-ray feature	recent observations indicating the existence of a monochromatic gamma-rayline with energy ~130 gev in the fermi-lat data have attracted great interestdue to the possibility that the line feature stems from the annihilation ofdark matter particles. many studies examining the robustness of the putativeline-signal have concentrated on its spectral attributes. here, we study themorphological features of the gamma-ray line photons, which can be used todifferentiate a putative dark matter signal from astrophysical backgrounds orinstrumental artifacts. photons stemming from dark matter annihilation willproduce events tracing a specific morphology, with a statistical clusteringthat can be calculated based on models of the dark matter density profile inthe inner galaxy. we apply the dbscan clustering algorithm to fermi gamma-raydata, and show that we can rule out the possibility that 1 (2, 4) or fewerpoint-like sources produce the observed morphology for the line photons at a99% (95%, 90%) confidence level. our study strongly disfavors the mainastrophysical background envisioned to produce a line feature at energies above100 gev: cold pulsar winds. it is highly unlikely that 4 or more such objectshave exactly the same monochromatic cosmic-ray energy needed to produce agamma-ray line, to within instrumental energy resolution. furthermore, we showthat the larger photon statistics expected with air cherenkov telescopes suchas h.e.s.s.-ii will allow for extraordinarily stringent morphological tests ofthe origin of the "line photons".

1307.6277	the pitfalls of dark crossings	we explore the connection between pair production of dark matter particles atcollider experiments and annihilation of dark matter in the early and lateuniverse, with a focus on the correlation between the two time-reversedprocesses. we consider both a model-independent effective theory framework,where the initial and final states are assumed to not change undertime-reversal, and concrete uv-complete models within the framework ofsupersymmetric extensions to the standard model. even within the effectivetheory framework (where crossing symmetry is in some sense assumed), we findthat the predictions of that symmetry can vary by orders of magnitude dependingon the details of the selected effective interaction. within the supersymmetricmodels we consider, we find that there is an even wilder variation in theexpectations one can derive for collider observables based on cross-symmetricprocesses such as having a thermal relic or given indirect dark matterdetection rates. we also explore additional "pitfalls" where na\"ive crossingsymmetry badly fails, including models with very light mediators leading tosommerfeld enhancements and/or dark matter bound states.

1401.7050	dark matter in minimal universal extra dimensions with a stable vacuum  and the "right" higgs	the recent discovery of a higgs boson with mass of about 125 gev, along withits striking similarity to the prediction from the standard model, informs andconstrains many models of new physics. the higgs mass exhausts one out of threeinput parameters of the minimal, five-dimensional version of universal extradimension models, the other two parameters being the kaluza-klein (kk) scaleand the cut-off scale of the theory. the presence of kk fermions with largecoupling to the higgs implies a short-lived electro-weak vacuum, unless thecut-off scale is at most a few times higher than the kk mass scale, providingan additional tight constraint to the theory parameter space. here, we focus onthe lightest kk particle as a dark matter candidate, and investigate theregions of parameter space where such particle has a thermal relic density inaccord with the cosmological dark matter density. we find the paradoxicalresult that, for low enough cutoff scales consistent with vacuum stability,larger than previously thought kk mass scales become preferred to explain thedark matter abundance in the universe. we explain this phenomenon bypinpointing the additional particles which, at such low cutoffs, become closeenough in mass to the dark matter candidate to coannihilate with it. we makepredictions for both collider and direct dark matter searches that might soonclose in on all viable theory parameter space.

1406.2424	effect of black holes in local dwarf spheroidal galaxies on gamma-ray  constraints on dark matter annihilation	recent discoveries of optical signatures of black holes in dwarf galaxiesindicates that low-mass galaxies can indeed host intermediate massive blackholes. this motivates the assessment of the resulting effect on the host darkmatter density profile, and the consequences for the constraints on the planeof the dark matter annihilation cross section versus mass, stemming from thenon-observation of gamma rays from local dwarf spheroidals with the fermi largearea telescope. we compute the density profile using three differentprescriptions for the black hole mass associated with a given spheroidalgalaxy, and taking into account the cutoff to the density from dark matterpair-annihilation. we find that the limits on the dark matter annihilation ratefrom observations of individual dwarfs are enhanced by factors of a few up to$10^6$, depending on the specific galaxy, on the black hole mass prescription,and on the dark matter particle mass. we estimate limits from combinedobservations of a sample of 15 dwarfs, for a variety of assumptions on thedwarf black hole mass and on the dark matter density profile prior to adiabaticcontraction. we find that if black holes are indeed present in local dwarfspheroidals, then, independent of assumptions, (i) the dark matterinterpretation of the galactic center gamma-ray excess would be conclusivelyruled out, (ii) wino dark matter would be excluded up to masses of about 3 tev,and (iii) vanilla thermal relic wimps must be heavier than 100 gev.

astro-ph;0611129	the shadow of dark matter	we carry out a model independent study of resonant photon scattering off darkmatter (dm) particles. the dm particle chi_1 can feature an electric ormagnetic transition dipole moment which couples it with photons and a heavierneutral particle chi_2. resonant photon scattering then takes place at aspecial energy set by the masses of chi_1 and chi_2, with the width of theresonance set by the size of the transition dipole moment. we compute theconstraints on the parameter space of the model from stellar energy losses,data from sn 1987a, the lyman-alpha forest, big bang nucleosynthesis,electro-weak precision measurements and accelerator searches. we show that thevelocity broadening of the resonance plays an essential role for thepossibility of the detection of a spectral feature originating from resonantphoton-dm scattering. depending upon the particle setup and the dm surface massdensity, the favored range of dm particle masses lies between tens of kev and afew mev, while the resonant photon absorption energy is predicted to be betweentens of kev and few gev.

0810.3233	early annihilation and diffuse backgrounds in 1/v wimp models	several recent studies have considered modifications to the standardweakly-interacting massive particle (wimp) scenario in which the cross section(times relative velocity v) for pair annihilation is enhanced by a factor 1/v.since v~10^{-3} in the galactic halo, this may boost the annihilation rate intophotons and/or electron-positron pairs enough to explain several puzzlinggalactic radiation signals. here we show that if the annihilation cross sectionscales as 1/v, then there is a burst of wimp annihilation in the firstdark-matter halos that form at redshifts z ~ 100-200. if the annihilation is togamma rays in the energy range 100 kev - 300 gev, or to electron-positron pairsin the energy range gev - 2 tev, then there remains a contribution to thediffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background today. upper limits to thisbackground provide constraints to the annihilation cross section. if the photonor electron-positron energies fall outside these energy ranges, then theradiation is absorbed by the intergalactic medium (igm) and thus ionizes andheats the igm. in this case, cosmic microwave background constraints to theionization history also put limits on the annihilation cross section.

0812.0597	gamma rays from clusters and groups of galaxies: cosmic rays versus dark  matter	clusters of galaxies have not yet been detected at gamma-ray frequencies;however, the recently launched fermi gamma-ray space telescope, formerly knownas glast, could provide the first detections in the near future. clusters areexpected to emit gamma rays as a result of (1) a population of high-energyprimary and re-accelerated secondary cosmic rays (cr) fueled by structureformation and merger shocks, active galactic nuclei and supernovae, and (2)particle dark matter (dm) annihilation. in this paper, we ask the question ofwhether the fermi telescope will be able to discriminate between the twoemission processes. we present data-driven predictions for a large x-ray fluxlimited sample of galaxy clusters and groups. we point out that the gamma raysignals from cr and dm can be comparable. in particular, we find that poorclusters and groups are the systems predicted to have the highest dm to cremission at gamma-ray energies. based on detailed fermi simulations, we studyobservational handles that might enable us to distinguish the two emissionmechanisms, including the gamma-ray spectra, the spatial distribution of thesignal and the associated multi-wavelength emissions. we also propose optimalhardness ratios, which will help to understand the nature of the gamma-rayemission. our study indicates that gamma rays from dm annihilation with a highparticle mass can be distinguished from a cr spectrum even for fairly faintsources. discriminating a cr spectrum from a light dm particle will be insteadmuch more difficult, and will require long observations and/or a bright source.while the gamma-ray emission from our simulated clusters is extended,determining the spatial distribution with fermi will be a challenging taskrequiring an optimal control of the backgrounds.

hep-ph;0407036	a statistical analysis of supersymmetric dark matter in the mssm after  wmap	we study supersymmetric dark matter in the general flavor diagonal mssm bymeans of an extensive random scan of its parameter space. we find that, incontrast with the standard msugra lore, the large majority of viable modelsfeatures either a higgsino or a wino-like lightest neutralino, and yields arelic abundance well below the wmap bound. among the models with neutralinorelic density within the wmap range, higgsino-like neutralinos are stilldominant, though a sizeable fraction of binos is also present. in this lattercase, relic density suppression mechanisms are shown to be essential in orderto obtain the correct neutralino abundance. we then carry out a statisticalanalysis and a general discussion of neutralino dark matter direct detectionand of indirect neutralino detection at neutrino telescopes and at antimattersearch experiments. we point out that current data exclude only a marginalportion of the viable parameter space, and that models whose thermal relicabundance lies in the wmap range will be significantly probed only at futuredirect detection experiments. finally, we emphasize the importance of relicdensity enhancement mechanisms for indirect detection perspectives, inparticular at future antimatter search experiments.

hep-ph;0412058	neutralino dark matter detection in split supersymmetry scenarios	we study the phenomenology of neutralino dark matter within genericsupersymmetric scenarios where the gaugino and higgsino masses are much lighterthan the scalar soft breaking masses (split supersymmetry). we consider alow-energy model-independent approach and show that the guidelines in thedefinition of this general framework come from cosmology, which forces thelightest neutralino to have a mass smaller than 2.2 tev. the testability of theframework is addressed by discussing all viable dark matter detectiontechniques. current data on cosmic rays antimatter, gamma-rays and on theabundance of primordial 6li already set significant constraints on theparameter space. complementarity among future direct detection experiments,indirect searches for antimatter and with neutrino telescopes, and tests of thetheory at future accelerators, such as the lhc and a nlc, is highlighted. inparticular, we study in detail the regimes of wino-higgsino mixing andbino-wino transition, which have been most often neglected in the past. weemphasize that our analysis may apply to more general supersymmetric modelswhere scalar exchanges do not provide the dominant contribution to annihilationrates.

hep-ph;0505227	mixed wino dark matter: consequences for direct, indirect and collider  detection	in supersymmetric models with gravity-mediated susy breaking and gaugino massunification, the predicted relic abundance of neutralinos usually exceeds thestrict limits imposed by the wmap collaboration. one way to obtain the correctrelic abundance is to abandon gaugino mass universality and allow a mixedwino-bino lightest susy particle (lsp). the enhanced annihilation andscattering cross sections of mixed wino dark matter (mwdm) compared to binodark matter lead to enhanced rates for direct dark matter detection, as well asfor indirect detection at neutrino telescopes and for detection of dark matterannihilation products in the galactic halo. for collider experiments, mwdmleads to a reduced but significant mass gap between the lightest neutralinos sothat chi_2^0 two-body decay modes are usually closed. this means that dileptonmass edges-- the starting point for cascade decay reconstruction at the cernlhc-- should be accessible over almost all of parameter space. measurement ofthe m_{\tz_2}-m_{\tz_1} mass gap at lhc plus various sparticle masses and crosssections as a function of beam polarization at the international linearcollider (ilc) would pinpoint mwdm as the dominant component of dark matter inthe universe.

hep-ph;0511034	exploring the bwca (bino-wino co-annihilation) scenario for neutralino  dark matter	in supersymmetric models with non-universal gaugino masses, it is possible tohave opposite-sign su(2) and u(1) gaugino mass terms. in these models, thegaugino eigenstates experience little mixing so that the lightest susy particleremains either pure bino or pure wino. the neutralino relic density can only bebrought into accord with the wmap measured value when bino-wino co-annihilation(bwca) acts to enhance the dark matter annihilation rate. we map out parameterspace regions and mass spectra which are characteristic of the bwca scenario.direct and indirect dark matter detection rates are shown to be typically verylow. at collider experiments, the bwca scenario is typified by a small mass gapm_{\tilde z_2}-m_{\tilde z_1} ~ 20-80 gev, so that tree level two body decaysof \tilde z_2 are not allowed. however, in this case the second lightestneutralino has an enhanced loop decay branching fraction to photons. while thephotonic neutralino decay signature looks difficult to extract at the fermilabtevatron, it should lead to distinctive events at the cern lhc and at a lineare^+e^- collider.
