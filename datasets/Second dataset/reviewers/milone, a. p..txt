0905.4058	a double stellar generation in the globular cluster ngc6656 (m 22). two  stellar groups with different iron and s-process element abundance	aims. in this paper we present the chemical abundance analysis from highresolution uves spectra of seventeen bright giant stars of the globular clusterm~22. results. we obtained an average iron abundance of [fe/h]=-1.76\pm0.02(internal errors only) and an \alpha enhancement of 0.36\pm0.04 (internalerrors only). na and o, and al and o follow the well known anti-correlationfound in many other gcs. we identified two groups of stars with significantlydifferent abundances of the s-process elements y, zr and ba. the relativenumbers of the two group members are very similar to the ratio of the stars inthe two sgbs of m22 recently found by piotto (2009). y and ba abundances do notcorrelate with na, o and al. the s-element rich stars are also richer in ironand have higher ca abundances. the results from high resolution spectra havebeen further confirmed by lower resolution giraffe spectra of fourteenadditional m22 stars. giraffe spectra show also that the eu -- a pure r-processelement -- abundance is not related to the iron content. we discuss thechemical abundance pattern of m22 stars in the context of the multiple stellarpopulations in gc scenario.

0909.4785	radial distribution of the multiple stellar populations in omega  centauri	we present a detailed study of the radial distribution of the multiplepopulations identified in the galactic globular cluster omega cen. we used bothspace-based images (acs/wfc and wfpc2) and ground-based images (fors1@vlt andwfi@2.2m eso telescopes) to map the cluster from the inner core to theoutskirts (~20 arcmin). these data sets have been used to extract high-accuracyphotometry for the construction of color-magnitude diagrams and astrometricpositions of ~900 000 stars. we find that in the inner ~2 core radii the bluemain sequence (bms) stars slightly dominate the red main sequence (rms) innumber. at greater distances from the cluster center, the relative numbers ofbms stars with respect to rms drop steeply, out to ~8 arcmin, and then remainconstant out to the limit of our observations. we also find that the dispersionof the gaussian that best fits the color distribution within the bms issignificantly greater than the dispersion of the gaussian that best fits thecolor distribution within the rms. in addition, the relative number ofintermediate-metallicity red-giant-branch stars which includes the progeny ofthe bms) with respect to the metal-poor component (the progeny of the rms)follows a trend similar to that of the main-sequence star-count ration_bms/n_rms. the most metal-rich component of the red-giant branch follows thesame distribution as the intermediate-metallicity component. we briefly discussthe possible implications of the observed radial distribution of the differentstellar components in omega cen.

1012.4931	sodium-oxygen anticorrelation among horizontal branch stars in the  globular cluster m4	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gc) is mainlygoverned by metallicity. the second parameter problem, well known since the60's, states that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the observed hbmorphology of many gcs. despite many efforts to resolve this issue, the secondparameter phenomenon still remains without a satisfactory explanation. we haveanalyzed blue, red-hb, and rr-lyrae stars in the gc m4 and studied their fe,na, and o abundances. our goal is to investigate possible connections betweenthe bimodal hb of m4 and the chemical signatures of the two stellar populationsrecently discovered among red giants of this cluster. we obtainedflames-uves/giraffe spectra of a sample of 22 stars covering the hb from thered to the blue region. while iron has the same abundance in both the red andblue-hb segment, the red-hb is composed of stars with scaled-solar sodiumabundances, while the blue-hb stars are all sodium enhanced and oxygendepleted. the rr-lyrae are na-poor, as the red-hb stars, and o-rich. this iswhat we expect if the blue-hb consists of a second generation of stars formedfrom the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar population throughhigh-temperature hydrogen-burning processes that include the cno, nena, andmgal cycles and are therefore expected to be he-rich. according to thisscenario, the sodium and oxygen pattern detected in the blue and red-hbsegments suggests helium as the second parameter that rules the hb morphologyin m4.

1103.0867	ngc 2419: a large and extreme second generation in a currently  undisturbed cluster	we analyse complementary hst and subaru data for the globular cluster ngc2419. we make a detailed analysis of the horizontal branch (hb), that appearscomposed by two main groups of stars: the luminous blue hb stars ---that extendby evolution into the rr lyrae and red hb region--- and a fainter, extremelyblue population. we examine the possible models for this latter group andconclude that a plausible explanation is that they correspond to a significant(~30 %) extreme second generation with a strong helium enhancement (y~0.4). wealso show that the color dispersion of the red giant branch is consistent withthis hypothesis, while the main sequence data are compatible with it, althoughthe large observational error blurs the possible underlying splitting. while itis common to find an even larger (50 -- 80) percentage of second generation ina globular cluster, the presence of a substantial and extreme fraction of thesestars in ngc 2419 might be surprising, as the cluster is at present well insidethe radius beyond which the galactic tidal field would be dominant. if asimilar situation had been present in the first stages of the cluster life, thecluster would have retained its initial mass, and the percentage of secondgeneration stars should have been quite small (up to ~10 %). such a largefraction of extreme second generation stars implies that the system must havebeen initially much more massive and in different dynamical conditions thantoday. we discuss this issue in the light of existing models of the formationof multiple populations in globular clusters.

1105.0366	the oxygen vs. sodium (anti)correlation(s) in omega cen	recent exam of large samples of omega cen giants shows that it shares withmono-metallic globular clusters the presence of the sodium versus oxygenanticorrelation, within each subset of stars with iron content in the range-1.9&lt;~[fe/h]&lt;~-1.3. these findings suggest that, while the second generationformation history in omega cen is more complex than that of mono-metallicclusters, it shares some key steps with those simpler cluster. in addition, thegiants in the range -1.3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;~-0.7 show a direct o--na correlation, atmoderately low o, but na up to 20 times solar. these peculiar na abundances arenot shared by stars in other environments often assumed to undergo a similarchemical evolution, such as in the field of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. theseo and na abundances match well the yields of the massive asymptotic giantbranch stars (agb) in the same range of metallicity, suggesting that the starsat [fe/h]&gt;-1.3 in omega cen are likely to have formed directly from the pureejecta of massive agbs of the same metallicities. this is possible if themassive agbs of [fe/h]&gt;-1.3 in the progenitor system evolve when all thepristine gas surrounding the cluster has been exhausted by the previous starformation events, or the proto--cluster interaction with the galaxy caused theloss of a significant fraction of its mass, or of its dark matter halo, and thesupernova ejecta have been able to clear the gas out of the system. the absenceof dilution in the metal richer populations lends further support to a scenarioof the formation of second generation stars in cooling flows from massive agbprogenitors. we suggest that the entire formation of omega cen took place in afew 10^8yr, and discuss the problem of a prompt formation of s--processelements.

1107.2056	multiple stellar populations in the globular clusters ngc1851 and  ngc6656 (m22)	in the last years, photometric and spectroscopic evidence has demonstratedthat many, maybe all the globular clusters (gc) host multiple stellarpopulations. high-resolution spectroscopy has established that, while most gcsare mono-metallic with no significant abundance spread in $s$-elements, in allthe globulars studied to date the presence of different stellar generation isinferred by the na-o and the c-n anticorrelations. in this context, ngc 1851and ngc 6656 are among the most intriguing clusters. contrary to the majorityof gcs, they host two groups of stars with different s-elements abundance thatare clearly associated to the two distinct sub-giant and red-giant branchesdetected in their color-magnitude diagrams (cmd). in the case of ngc 6656s-rich stars are also enriched in iron and calcium. each $s$-element groupexhibits its own na-o and c-n anticorrelations thus indicating the presence ofsub-populations and suggesting that the parent clusters have experienced a verycomplex star-formation history. in this paper we summarize the properties ofmultiple populations in ngc 1851 and ngc 6656.

1108.2391	luminosity and mass functions of the three main sequences of the  globular cluster ngc 2808	high-precision hst photometry has recently revealed that the globular cluster(gc) ngc 2808 hosts a triple main sequence (ms) corresponding to three stellarpopulations with different helium abundances. we carried out photometry onacs/wfc hst images of ngc 2808 with the main purpose of measuring theluminosity function (lf) of stars in the three different mss, and the binaryfraction in the cluster. we used isochrones to transform the observed lfs intomass functions (mfs). we estimated that the fraction of binary systems in ngc2808 is f_bin ~0.05, and find that the three mss have very similar lfs. theslopes of the corresponding mfs are alpha=-1.2+/-0.3 for the red ms, alpha=-0.9+/-0.3 for the middle ms, and alpha = -0.9+/-0.4 for the blue one, thesame, to within the errors. there is marginal evidence of a mf flattening formasses m&lt;~0.6 m_sun for the the reddest (primordial) ms. these resultsrepresent the first direct measurement of the present day mf and lf in distinctstellar populations of a gc, and provide constraints on models of the formationand evolution of multiple generations of stars in these objects.

1109.0900	multiple stellar populations in 47 tucanae	we use hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based imaging to study themultiple populations of 47 tuc, combining high-precision photometry withcalculations of synthetic spectra. using filters covering a wide range ofwavelengths, our hst photometry splits the main sequence (ms) into twobranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant andred-giant regions (sgb, rgb), and on the horizontal branch (hb). we calculatetheoretical stellar atmospheres for ms stars, assuming different chemicalcomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the hstfilters with our observed colors. we find that we can match the complex ofobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance andanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but withdepleted c and o. we confirm that models of rgb and red hb stars with that pairof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. we suggest that thedifferent strengths of molecular bands of oh, cn, ch and nh, falling indifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the twopopulations. near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitudediagram (cmd) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of thestars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirtsof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. thus thesecond, he/n-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes themajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. we present evidencethat the cmd of 47 tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the twopopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the msup to the rgb, and thence to the hb. a third population is visible only in thesgb, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

1110.2458	the visir@vlt mid-ir view of 47tuc: a further step in solving the puzzle  of rgb mass loss	there is an ongoing debate regarding the onset luminosity of dusty mass lossin population-ii red giant stars. in this paper we present visir@vlt mir 8.6micron imaging of 47tuc, centre of attention of a number of space-based spitzerobservations and studies. the visir high resolution (diffraction limited)observations allow excellent matching to existing optical hubble spacetelescope catalogues. the optical-mir coverage of the inner 1.15 arcmin of thecluster provide the cleanest possible, blending-free, sampling of the upper 3magnitudes of the giant branch. our diagrams show no evidence of faint giantswith mir-excess. a combined nir-mir diagram further confirms the near absenceof dusty red giants. dusty red giants and asymptotic giant stars are confinedto the 47tuc long period variables population. in particular, dusty red giantsare limited to the upper one 8.6 micron magnitude below the giant branch tip.this particular luminosity level corresponds to ~1000 solar luminosity,suggested in previous determinations to mark the onset of dusty mass-loss.interestingly, at this luminosity level, we detect a small deviation betweenthe colours of red giants and the theoretical isochrones.

1111.0552	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. xii. photometric binaries  along the main-sequence	the fraction of binary stars is an important ingredient to interpret globularcluster dynamical evolution and their stellar population. we investigate theproperties of main-sequence binaries measured in a uniform photometric sampleof 59 galactic globular clusters that were observed by hst wfc/acs as a part ofthe globular cluster treasury project. we measured the fraction of binaries andthe distribution of mass-ratio as a function of radial location within thecluster, from the central core to beyond the half-mass radius. we studied theradial distribution of binary stars, and the distribution of stellar massratios. we investigated monovariate relations between the fraction of binariesand the main parameters of their host clusters. we found that in nearly all theclusters, the total fraction of binaries is significantly smaller than thefraction of binaries in the field, with a few exceptions only. binary stars aresignificantly more centrally concentrated than single ms stars in most of theclusters studied in this paper. the distribution of the mass ratio is generallyflat (for mass-ratio parameter q&gt;0.5). we found a significant anti-correlationbetween the binary fraction in a cluster and its absolute luminosity (mass).some, less significant correlation with the collisional parameter, the centralstellar density, and the central velocity dispersion are present. there is nostatistically significant relation between the binary fraction and othercluster parameters. we confirm the correlation between the binary fraction andthe fraction of blue stragglers in the cluster.

1202.2825	the double sub-giant branch of ngc 6656 (m22): a chemical  characterization	we present an abundance analysis of 101 subgiant branch (sgb) stars in theglobular cluster m22. using low resolution flames/giraffe spectra we havedetermined abundances of the neutron-capture strontium and barium and the lightelement carbon. with these data we explore relationships between the observedsgb photometric split in this cluster and two stellar groups characterized bydifferent contents of iron, slow neutron-capture process (s-process) elements,and the alpha element calcium, that we previously discovered in m22's red-giantstars. we show that the sgb stars correlate in chemical composition andcolor-magnitude diagram position: the stars with higher metallicity andrelative s-process abundances define a fainter sgb, while stars with lowermetallicity and s-process content reside on a relatively brighter sgb. thisresult has implications for the relative ages of the two stellar groups of m22.in particular, it is inconsistent with a large spread in ages of the two sgbs.by accounting for the chemical content of the two stellar groups, isochronefitting of the double sgb suggests that their ages are not different by morethan 300 myr.

1202.6176	c and n abundances of ms and sgb stars in ngc 1851	we present the first chemical analysis of stars on the double subgiant branch(sgb) of the globular cluster ngc 1851. we obtained 48 magellan imacs spectraof subgiants and fainter stars covering the spectral region between3650-6750\aa, to derive c and n abundances from the spectral features at4300\aa (g-band) and at ~ 3883\aa (cn). we added to our sample ~ 45 unvevolvedstars previously observed with fors2 at the vlt. these two datasets werehomogeneously reduced and analyzed. we derived abundances of c and n for atotal of 64 stars and found considerable star-to-star variations in both [c/h]and [n/h] at all luminosities extending to the red giant branch (rgb) base(v~18.9). these abundances appear to be strongly anticorrelated, as would beexpected from the cn-cycle enrichment, but we did not detect any bimodality inthe c or n content. we used hst and ground-based photometry to select twogroups of faint- and bright-sgb stars from the visual and str\"omgrencolor-magnitude diagrams. significant variations in the carbon and nitrogenabundances are present among stars of each group, which indicates that each sgbhosts multiple subgenerations of stars. bright- and faint-sgb stars differ inthe total c+n content, where the fainter sgb have about 2.5 times the c+ncontent of the brighter ones. coupling our results with literature photometricdata and abundance determinations from high-resolution studies, we identify thefainter sgb with the red-rgb population, which also should be richer on averagein ba and other s-process elements, as well as in na and n, when compared tobrighter sgb and the blue-rgb population.

1205.3760	hubble space telescope observations of an outer field in omega centauri:  a definitive helium abundance	we revisit the problem of the split main sequence (ms) of the globularcluster omega centauri, and report the results of two-epoch hubble spacetelescope observations of an outer field, for which proper motions give us apure sample of cluster members, and an improved separation of the two branchesof the main sequence. using a new set of stellar models covering a grid ofvalues of helium and metallicity, we find that the best possible estimate ofthe helium abundance of the bluer branch of the ms is y = 0.39 +/- 0.02. forthe cluster center we apply new techniques to old observations: we use indicesof photometric quality to select a high-quality sample of stars, which we alsocorrect for differential reddening. we then superpose the color-magnitudediagram of the outer field on that of the cluster center, and suggest aconnection of the bluer branch of the ms with one of the more prominent amongthe many sequences in the subgiant region. we also report a group of undoubtedcluster members that are well to the red of the lower ms.

1205.4071	age and helium content of the open cluster ngc 6791 from multiple  eclipsing binary members. ii. age dependencies and new insights	models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by measuringaccurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. multiplebinary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these oldstellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. in the firstpaper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsingbinaries in the old open cluster ngc6791 sets tighter constraints on theproperties of stellar models than has previously been possible, therebypotentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. herewe add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison todetermine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employingas many observational constraints as possible. we improve our photometry andcorrect empirically for differential reddening effects. we then perform anextensive comparison of the cmds and eclipsing binary measurements to victoriaand dsep isochrones to estimate cluster parameters. we also reanalyse aspectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [fe/h] constraints. we find a bestestimate of the age of ~8.3 gyr while demonstrating that remaining ageuncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the cno abundances. the heliummass fraction is well constrained at y = 0.30 \pm 0.01 resulting in dy/dz ~ 1.4assuming that such a relation exists. during the analysis we firmly identifyblue straggler stars, including the star 2-17, and find indications for thepresence of their evolved counterparts. our analysis supports the rgb mass-lossfound from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass ofstars on the lower rgb, 1.15\pm0.02msun. this will be an important consistencycheck for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars.

1206.5529	the infrared eye of the wide-field camera 3 on the hubble space  telescope reveals multiple main sequences of very low-mass stars in ngc 2808	we use images taken with the infrared channel of the wide field camera 3 onthe hubble space telescope (hst) to study the multiple main sequences (mss) ofngc 2808. below the turn off, the red, the middle, and the blue ms, previouslydetected from visual-band photometry, are visible over an interval of about 3.5f160w magnitudes. the three mss merge together at the level of the ms bend. atfainter magnitudes, the ms again splits into two components containing ~65% and~35% of stars, with the most-populated ms being the bluest one. theoreticalisochrones suggest that the latter is connected to the red ms discovered in theoptical color-magnitude diagram (cmd), and hence corresponds to the firststellar generation, having primordial helium and enhanced carbon and oxygenabundances. the less-populated ms in the faint part of the near-ir cmd ishelium-rich and poor in carbon and oxygen, and it can be associated with themiddle and the blue ms of the optical cmd. the finding that the photometricsignature of abundance anticorrelation are also present in fully convective msstars reinforces the inference that they have a primordial origin.

1208.1873	hubble space telescope reveals multiple sub-giant branch in eight  globular clusters	in the last few years many globular clusters (gcs) have revealed complexcolor-magnitude diagrams, with the presence of multiple main sequences (mss),broaden or multiple sub-giant branches (sgbs) and ms turn offs, and broad orsplit red giant branches (rgbs). after a careful correction for differentialreddening, high accuracy photometry with the hubble space telescope presentedin this paper reveals a broadened or even split sgb in five additional milkyway gcs: ngc 362, ngc 5286, ngc 6656, ngc 6715, and ngc 7089. in addition, weconfirm (with new and archival hst data) the presence of a split sgb in 47tuc,ngc 1851, and ngc 6388. the fraction of faint sgb stars with respect to theentire sgb population varies from one cluster to another and ranges from$\sim$0.03 for ngc 362 to ~0.50 for ngc 6715. the average magnitude differencebetween the bright sgb and the faint sgb is almost the same at differentwavelengths. this peculiarity is consistent with the presence of two groups ofstars with either an age difference of about 1-2 gyrs, or a significantdifference in their overall c+n+o content.

1301.2822	the intriguing stellar populations in the globular clusters ngc 6388 and  ngc 6441	ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 are two massive galactic bulge globular clusters whichshare many properties, including the presence of an extended horizontal branch(hb), quite unexpected because of their high metal content. in this paper weuse hst's wfpc2, acs, and wfc3 images and present a broad multicolor study oftheir stellar content, covering all main evolutionary branches. thecolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) give compelling evidence that both clustershost at least two stellar populations, which manifest themselves in differentways. ngc 6388 has a broadened main sequence (ms), a split sub-giant branch(sgb), and a split red giant branch (rgb) that becomes evident above the hb inour data set; its red hb is also split into two branches. ngc 6441 has a splitms, but only an indication of two sgb populations, while the rgb clearly splitsin two from the sgb level upward, and no red hb structure. the multicoloranalysis of the cmds confirms that the he difference between the two mainstellar populations in the two clusters must be similar. this isobservationally supported by the hb morphology, but also confirmed by the colordistribution of the stars in the ms optical band cmds. however, a ms splitbecomes evident in ngc 6441 using uv colors, but not in ngc 6388, indicatingthat the chemical patterns of the different populations are different in thetwo clusters, with c, n, o abundance differences likely playing a major role.we also analyze the radial distribution of the two populations.

1302.5870	horizontal-branch morphology and multiple stellar populations in the  anomalous globular cluster m22	m22 is an anomalous globular cluster that hosts two groups of stars withdifferent metallicity and s-element abundance. the star-to-star light-elementvariations in both groups, with the presence of individual na-o and c-nanticorrelations, demonstrates that this milky-way satellite has experienced acomplex star-formation history. we have analysed flames/uves spectra for sevenstars covering a small color interval, on the reddest horizontal-branch (hb)portion of this cluster and investigated possible relations between thechemical composition of a star and its location along the hb. our chemicalabundance analysis takes into account effects introduced by deviations from thelocal-thermodynamic equilibrium (nlte effects), that are significant for themeasured spectral lines in the atmospheric parameters range spanned by ourstars. we find that all the analysed stars are barium-poor and sodium-poor,thus supporting the idea that the position of a star along the hb is strictlyrelated to the chemical composition, and that the hb-morphology is influencedby the presence of different stellar populations.

(1) the observed abundance dispersions are a factor of ~2 larger thanthe average measurement uncertainty. (2) there are positive correlations, ofhigh statistical significance, between all elements and na. (3) for any pair ofelements, there are positive correlations of high statistical significance,although the amplitudes of the abundance variations are small. removingabundance trends with effective temperature and/or using a different pair ofreference stars does not alter these results. these abundance variations andcorrelations may reflect a combination of (a) he abundance variations and (b)inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the pre- or proto-cluster environment.regarding the former, the current constraints on delta y from photometry likelypreclude he as being the sole explanation. regarding the latter, thenucleosynthetic source(s) must have synthesised na, alpha, fe-peak andneutron-capture elements and in constant amounts for species heavier than si;no individual object can achieve such nucleosynthesis. we speculate that other,if not all, globular clusters may exhibit comparable abundance variations andcorrelations to ngc 6752 if subjected to a similarly precise analysis.

1312.4169	global and non-global parameters of horizontal branch morphology of  globular clusters	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gcs) is mainlydetermined by metallicity. however, the fact that gcs with almost the samemetallicity exhibit different hb morphologies demonstrates that at least onemore parameter is needed to explain the hb morphology. it has been suggestedthat one of these should be a global parameter that varies from gc to gc, andthe other a non-global parameter that varies within the gc. in this study weprovide empirical evidence corroborating this idea. we used the photometriccatalogs obtained with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) of the hubblespace telescope (hst) and analyse the cmds of 74 gcs. the hb morphology of oursample of gcs has been investigated on the basis of the two new parameters l1and l2 that measure the distance between the rgb and the coolest part of thehb, and the color extension of the hb, respectively. we find that l1 correlateswith both metallicity and age, whereas l2 most strongly correlates with themass of the hosting gc. the range of helium abundance among the stars in a gc,characterised by delta y and associated with the presence of multiple stellarpopulations, has been estimated in a few gcs to date. in these gcs we find aclose relationship among delta y, gc mass, and l2. we conclude that age andmetallicity are the main global parameters while the range of helium abundancewithin a gc is the main non-global parameter defining the hb morphology ofgalactic gcs.

1409.7230	helium and multiple populations in the massive globular cluster ngc6266  (m62)	recent studies suggest that the helium content of multiple stellarpopulations in globular clusters (gcs) is not uniform. the range of heliumvaries from cluster to cluster with more massive gcs having, preferentially,large helium spread. gcs with large helium variations also show extended-bluehorizontal branch (hb). i exploit hubble space telescope photometry toinvestigate multiple stellar populations in ngc6266 and infer their relativehelium abundance. this cluster is an ideal target to investigate the possibleconnection between helium, cluster mass, and hb morphology, as it exhibits anextended hb and is among the ten more luminous gcs in the milky way. theanalysis of color-magnitude diagrams from multi-wavelength photometry revealsthat also ngc6266, similarly to other massive gcs, hosts a double main sequence(ms), with the red and the blue component made up of the 79+-1% and the 21+-1%of stars, respectively. the red ms is consistent with a stellar population withprimordial helium while the blue ms is highly helium-enhanced by deltay=0.08+-0.01. furthermore, the red ms exhibits an intrinsic broadening that cannot be attributed to photometric errors only and is consistent with a spread inhelium of ~0.025 dex. the comparison between ngc6266 and other gcs hostinghelium-enriched stellar populations supports the presence of a correlationamong helium variations, cluster mass, and hb extension.

1410.2124	the carina project vii: towards the breaking of the age-metallicity  degeneracy of red giant branch stars using the c_ubi index	we present an analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data of the carinadsph galaxy, testing a new approach similar to that used to disentanglemultiple populations in galactic globular clusters (gcs). we show that a propercolour combination is able to separate a significant fraction of the red giantbranch (rgb) of the two main carina populations (the old one, \sim 12 gyr, andthe intermediate-age one, 4-8 gyr). in particular, the c_ubi=(u-b)-(b-i)pseudo-colour allows us to follow the rgb of both populations along a relevantportion of the rgb. we find that the oldest stars have more negative c_ubipseudo-colour than intermediate-age ones. we correlate the pseudo-colour of rgbstars with their chemical properties, finding a significant trend between theiron content and the c_ubi. stars belonging to the old population aresystematically more metal poor ([fe/h]=-2.32\pm0.08 dex) than theintermediate-age ones ([fe/h]=-1.82\pm0.03 dex). this gives solid evidence onthe chemical evolution history of this galaxy, and we have a new diagnosticthat can allow us to break the age-metallicity degeneracy of h-burning advancedevolutionary phases. we compared the distribution of stars in the c_ubi planewith theoretical isochrones, finding that no satisfactory agreement can bereached with models developed in a theoretical framework based on standardheavy element distributions. finally, we discuss possible systematicdifferences when compared with multiple populations in gcs.

1410.4570	stellar models of multiple populations in globular clusters. i. the main  sequence of ngc 6752	we present stellar atmosphere and evolution models of main sequence stars intwo stellar populations of the galactic globular cluster ngc 6752. thesepopulations represent the two extremes of light-element abundance variations inthe cluster. ngc 6752 is a benchmark cluster in the study of multiple stellarpopulations because of the rich array of spectroscopic abundances andpanchromatic hubble space telescope photometry. the spectroscopic abundancesare used to compute stellar atmosphere and evolution models. the syntheticspectra for the two populations show significant differences in the ultravioletand, for the coolest temperatures, in the near-infrared. the stellar evolutionmodels exhibit insignificant differences in the h-r diagram except on the lowermain sequence. the appearance of multiple sequences in the colour-magnitudediagrams (cmds) of ngc 6752 is almost exclusively due to spectral effectscaused by the abundance variations. the models reproduce the observed splittingand/or broadening of sequences in a range of cmds. the ultraviolet cmds aresensitive to variations in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen but the models are notreliable enough to directly estimate abundance variations from photometry. onthe other hand, the widening of the lower main sequence in the near-infraredcmd, driven by oxygen-variation via the water molecule, is well-described bythe models and can be used to estimate the range of oxygen present in a clusterfrom photometry. we confirm that it is possible to use multiband photometry toestimate helium variations among the different populations, with the caveatthat the estimated amount of helium-enhancement is model-dependent.

1508.01804	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. vi. the internal kinematics of the multiple stellar populations in  ngc 2808	numerous observational studies have revealed the ubiquitous presence ofmultiple stellar populations in globular clusters and cast many hard challengesfor the study of the formation and dynamical history of these stellar systems.in this letter we present the results of a study of the kinematic properties ofmultiple populations in ngc 2808 based on high-precision hubble space telescopeproper-motion measurements. in a recent study, milone et al. have identifiedfive distinct populations (a, b, c, d, and e) in ngc 2808. populations d and ecoincide with the helium-enhanced populations in the middle and the blue mainsequences (mms and bms) previously discovered by piotto et al.; populations a,b, and c correspond to the redder main sequence (rms) that in the piotto et al.was associated with the primordial stellar population. our analysis shows that,in the outermost regions probed (between about 1.5 and 2 times the clusterhalf-light radius), the velocity distribution of populations d and e isradially anisotropic (the deviation from an isotropic distribution issignificant at the ~3.5-sigma level). stars of populations d and e have asmaller tangential velocity dispersion than those of populations a, b, and c,while no significant differences are found in the radial-velocity dispersion.we present the results of a numerical simulation showing that the observeddifferences between the kinematics of these stellar populations are consistentwith the expected kinematic fingerprint of the diffusion towards the clusterouter regions of stellar populations initially more centrally concentrated.

1508.01932	the extended main sequence turn off cluster ngc1856: rotational  evolution in a coeval stellar ensemble	multiple or extended turnoffs in young clusters in the magellanic clouds haverecently received large attention. a number of studies have shown that they maybe interpreted as the result of a significant age spread (several 10^8yr inclusters aged 1--2 gyr), while others attribute them to a spread in stellarrotation. we focus on the cluster ngc 1856, showing a splitting in the upperpart of the main sequence, well visible in the color m_{f336w}-m_{f555w}$, anda very wide turnoff region. using population synthesis available from thegeneva stellar models, we show that the cluster data can be interpreted assuperposition of two main populations having the same age (~350myr), composedfor 2/3 of very rapidly rotating stars, defining the upper turnoff region andthe redder main sequence, and for 1/3 of slowly/non-rotating stars. since rapidrotation is a common property of the b-a type stars, the main question raisedby this model concerns the origin of the slowly/non-rotating component. binarysynchronization is a possible process behind the slowly/non-rotatingpopulation; in this case, many slowly/non-rotating stars should still be partof binary systems with orbital periods in the range from 4 to 500 days. suchperiods imply that roche lobe overflow occurs, during the evolution of theprimary off the main sequence, so most primaries may not be able to ignite corehelium burning, consistently why the lack of a red clump progeny of the slowlyrotating population.

1510.01376	measuring the vertical age structure of the galactic disc using  asteroseismology and saga	the existence of a vertical age gradient in the milky way disc has beenindirectly known for long. here, we measure it directly for the first time withseismic ages, using red giants observed by kepler. we use stroemgren photometryto gauge the selection function of asteroseismic targets, and derive colour andmagnitude limits where giants with measured oscillations are representative ofthe underlying population in the field. limits in the 2mass system are alsoderived. we lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effectsindependent of galaxy models. we find that low mass, i.e. old red giantsdominate at increasing galactic heights, whereas closer to the galactic planethey exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. parametrizing this as avertical gradient returns approximately 4 gyr/kpc for the disc we probe,although with a large dispersion of ages at all heights. the ages of stars showa smooth distribution over the last 10 gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescentevolution for the milky way disc since a redshift of about 2. we also find aflat age-metallicity relation for disc stars. finally, we show how to usesecondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity spread,and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing the ageing ofthe disc. this work highlights the power of asteroseismology for galacticstudies; however, we also emphasize the need for better constraints on stellarmass-loss, which is a major source of systematic age uncertainties in red giantstars.

1510.01468	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. v. constraints on formation scenarios	we build on the evidence provided by our legacy survey of galactic globularclusters (gc) to submit to a crucial test four scenarios currently entertainedfor the formation of multiple stellar generations in gcs. the observationalconstraints on multiple generations to be fulfilled are manifold, including gcspecificity, ubiquity, variety, predominance, discreteness, supernovaavoidance, p-capture processing, helium enrichment and mass budget. we arguethat scenarios appealing to supermassive stars, fast rotating massive stars andmassive interactive binaries violate in an irreparable fashion two or moreamong such constraints. also the scenario appealing to agb stars as producersof the material for next generation stars encounters severe difficulties,specifically concerning the mass budget problem and the detailed chemicalcomposition of second generation stars. we qualitatively explore ways possiblyallowing one to save the agb scenario, specifically appealing to a possiblerevision of the cross section of a critical reaction rate destroying sodium, oralternatively by a more extensive exploration of the vast parameter spacecontrolling the evolutionary behavior of agb stellar models. still, we cannotensure success for these efforts and totally new scenarios may have to beinvented to understand how gcs formed in the early universe.

1510.05086	the binary populations of eight globular clusters in the outer halo of  the milky way	we analyse color-magnitude diagrams of eight globular clusters (gcs) in theouter galactic halo. images were taken with the wide field channel of theadvanced camera for survey and the ultraviolet and visual channel of the widefield camera 3 on board of the hubble space telescope. we have determined thefraction of binary stars along the main sequence and combined results withthose of a recent paper where some of us have performed a similar analysis on59 galactic gcs. in total, binaries have been now studied homogeneously in 67gcs. we studied the radial and luminosity distributions of the binary systems,the distribution of their mass-ratios and investigated univariate relationswith several parameters of the host gcs. we confirm the anti-correlationbetween the binary fraction and the luminosity of the host cluster, and findthat low-luminosity clusters can host a large population in excess of ~40% inthe cluster core. however, our results do not support a significant correlationwith the cluster age as suggested in the literature. in most gcs, binaries aremore centrally concentrated than single stars. if the fraction of binaries isnormalised to the core binary fraction the radial density profiles follow acommon trend. it has a maximum in the center and declines by a factor of two ata distance of about two core radii from the cluster center. after dropping toits minimum at a radial distance of $\sim$5 core radii it stays approximatelyconstant at larger radii. we also find that the mass-ratio and the distributionof binaries as a function of the mass of the primary star is almost flat.

0810.1914	ground-based ccd astrometry with wide field imagers. iii. wfi@2.2m  proper-motion catalog of the globular cluster omega centauri	omega centauri is the most well studied globular cluster because of itsnumerous puzzling features. intensive spectroscopic follow-up observingcampaigns targeting stars at different positions on the color-magnitude diagrampromises to clarify some of these peculiarities. to able to target clustermembers reliably during spectroscopic surveys and both spatial and radialdistributions in the cluster outskirts without including field stars, a highquality proper-motion catalog of omega cen and membership probabilitydetermination are required. the only available wide field proper-motion catalogof omega cen is derived from photographic plates, and only for stars brighterthan b~16. using eso archive data, we create a new, ccd-based, proper-motioncatalog for this cluster, extending to b~20. we used the high precisionastrometric software developed specifically for data acquired by wfi@2.2mtelescope and presented in the first paper of this series. we achieved a goodcluster-field separation with a temporal base-line of only four years. wecorrected our photometry for sky-concentration effects. we provide calibratedphotometry for ubvri wide-band data plus narrow-band filter data centered onh_alpha for almost 360 000 stars. we can confirm that the omega cen metal-poorand the metal-rich components have the same proper motion, and demonstrate thatthe metal-intermediate component in addition exhibits the same mean motion asthe other rgb stars. we provided membership probability determination forpublished omega cen variable star catalogs. our catalog extends theproper-motion measurements to fainter than the cluster turn-off luminosity, andcovers a wide area (~33'x33') around the center of omega cen. our catalog isnow electronically available to the astronomical community.

0810.2248	mcao near-ir photometry of the globular cluster ngc 6388: mad  observations in crowded fields	deep photometry of crowded fields, such as galactic globular clusters, isseverely limited by the actual resolution of ground-based telescopes. on theother hand, the hubble space telescope does not provide the near-infrared (nir)filters needed to allow large color baselines. in this work we aim atdemonstrating how ground based observations can reach the required resolutionwhen using multi-conjugated adaptive optic (mcao) devices in the nir, such asthe experimental infrared camera (mad) available on the vlt. this isparticularly important since these corrections are planned to be available onall ground--based telescopes in the near future. we do this by combining theinfrared photometry obtained by mad/vlt with acs/hst optical photometry of ourscientific target, the bulge globular cluster ngc 6388, in which we imaged twofields. in particular, we constructed color-magnitude diagrams with anextremely wide color baseline in order to investigate the presence of multiplestellar populations in this cluster. from the analysis of the external field,observed with better seeing conditions, we derived the deepest optical-nir cmdof ngc 6388 to date. the high-precision photometry reveals that two distinctsub-giant branches are clearly present in this cluster. we also use the cmdfrom the central region to estimate the distance ((m-m)=15.33) and thereddening (e(b-v)=0.38) for this cluster. we estimate the age to be ~11.5+/-1.5 gyr. the large relative-age error reflects the bimodal distribution of thesgb stars. this study clearly demonstrates how mcao correction in the nir bandsimplemented on ground based telescopes can complement the high-resolutionoptical data from hst.

0810.2558	multiple stellar populations in magellanic clouds clusters. i. an  ordinary feature for intermediate age globulars in the lmc?	the discovery of multiple mss in ngc2808 and omega centauri, and multiplesgbs in ngc1851 and ngc6388 has challenged the long-held paradigm that gcsconsist of simple stellar populations. this picture has been furthercomplicated by recent studies of the lmc intermediate-age clusters, where themsto was found to be bimodal or broadened. we have undertaken a study ofarchival hst images of lmc and smc clusters with the aim of measuring thefrequency of clusters with evidence of multiple or prolonged star formationevents and determining their main properties. in this paper, we analyse the cmdof 16 intermediate-age lmc clusters. we find that 11 clusters show an anomalousspread (or split) in color and magnitude around the msto. we demonstrate thatthe observed feature is unequivocally associated to the clusters and that it isnot an artifact due to photometric errors, differential reddening or binaries.we confirm that ngc 1806 and ngc 1846 clearly exhibit two distinct mstos andobserve, for the first time, a double msto in ngc 1751. in these three clustersthe population corresponding to the brighter msto includes more than two-thirdsof cluster stellar population. we confirm the presence of multiple stellarpopulations in ngc 1783 and suggest that the msto of this cluster is formed bytwo distinct branches. in 7 clusters (eso057-sc075, hodge7, ngc1852, ngc1917,ngc1987, ngc2108, and ngc2154) we observed an intrinsic broadening of the mstothat may suggest that these clusters have experienced a prolonged period ofstar formation (150-250 myr). the cmds of ic2146, ngc1644, ngc1652, ngc1795 andngc1978 show no evidence of spread or bimodality. in summary 70$\pm$25% of oursample are not consistent with the simple, single stellar population hypotesis.
