0901.0711	the formation rates of population iii stars and chemical enrichment of  halos during the reionization era	[abridged] the first stars in the universe form out of pristine primordialgas clouds that have been radiatively cooled to a few hundreds of degreeskelvin either via molecular or atomic (lyman-alpha) hydrogen lines. thisprimordial mode of star formation is eventually quenched once radiative and/orchemical (metal enrichment) feedbacks mark the transition to population iistars. in this paper we present a model for the formation rate of populationiii stars based on press-schechter modeling coupled with analytical recipes forgas cooling and radiative feedback. our model also includes a novel treatmentfor metal pollution based on self-enrichment due to a previous episode ofpopulation iii star formation in progenitor halos. with this model we derivethe star formation history of population iii stars, their contribution to there-ionization of the universe and the time of the transition from populationiii star formation in minihalos to that in more massive halos where atomichydrogen cooling is also possible. we consider a grid of models highlightingthe impact of varying the values for the free parameters used, such as starformation and feedback efficiency. the most critical factor is the assumptionthat only one population iii star is formed in a halo. in this scenario, metalfree stars contribute only to a minor fraction of the total number of photonsrequired to re-ionize the universe. in addition, metal free star formation isprimarily located in minihalos and chemically enriched halos become thedominant locus of star formation very early in the life of the universe, atredshift z~25. if instead multiple metal free stars are allowed to form out ofa single halo, then there is an overall boost of population iii star formation,with a consequent significant contribution to the re-ionizing radiation budget.

0706.2653	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: i. the faint-end slope of the  lyman-break galaxy population at z~5	we present the udf05 project, a hst large program of deep acs (f606w, f775w,f850lp) and nicmos (f110w, f160w) imaging of three fields, two of whichcoincide with the nicp1-4 nicmos parallel observations of the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf). in this first paper we use the acs data for the nicp12 field, aswell as the original hudf acs data, to measure the uv luminosity function (lf)of z~5 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) down to very faint levels. specifically,based on a v-i, i-z selection criterion, we identify a sample of 101 and 133candidate z~5 galaxies down to z_{850}=28.5 and 29.25 magnitudes in the nicp12and in the hudf fields, respectively. using an extensive set of monte carlosimulations we derive corrections for observational biases and selectioneffects, and construct the rest-frame 1400 a lbg lf over the rangem_{1400}=[-21.4, -17.1], i.e. down to ~0.04 l* at z~5, and complement it withdata from the subaru deep field (sdf) from yoshida et al. (2006) to extend itto the brighter end (m_{1400}&gt;-22.2). we show that: (i) different assumptionsregarding the sed distribution of the lbg population, dust properties andintergalactic absorption result in a 25% variation in the number density oflbgs at z~5; (ii) under consistent assumptions for dust properties andintergalactic absorption, the hudf is about 30% under-dense in z~5 lbgsrelative to the nicp12 field, a variation which is well explained by cosmicvariance; (iii) the faint-end slope of the lf is independent of the specificassumptions for the input physical parameters, and has a value of alpha ~ -1.6,similar to the faint-end slope of the lf that has been measured for lbgs at z~3and z~6.

0909.1803	discovery of z~8 galaxies in the hudf from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  observations	we utilize the newly-acquired, ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations over the hudfto search for star-forming galaxies at z~8-8.5, only 600 million years fromrecombination, using a y_{105}-dropout selection. the new 4.7 arcmin**2 wfc3/irobservations reach to ~28.8 ab mag (5 sigma) in the y_{105}j_{125}h_{160}bands. these remarkable data reach ~1.5 ab mag deeper than the previous dataover the hudf, and now are an excellent match to the hudf optical acs data. forour search criteria, we use a two-color lyman-break selection technique toidentify z~8-8.5 y_{105}-dropouts. we find 5 likely z~8-8.5 candidates. thesources have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~28.3 ab mag and very blue uv-continuumslopes, with a median estimated beta of &lt;~-2.5 (where f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{\beta}). this suggests that z~8 galaxies are not only essentially dustfree but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. the observednumber of y_{105}-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20+/-6 sourcesexpected assuming no evolution from z~6, but is consistent with the 5 expectedextrapolating the bouwens et al. 2008 lf results to z~8. these results provideevidence that the evolution in the lf seen from z~7 to z~3 continues to z~8.the remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of wfc3/ir has enabled hst tocross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~8-9.

0909.5183	structure and morphologies of z~7-8 galaxies from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  imaging of the hudf	we present a first morphological study of z~7-8 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)from oesch et al. 2009 and bouwens et al. 2009 detected in ultra-deepnear-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) by the hudf09program. with an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies arefound to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness ofmu_j ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7galaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. by comparison tolower redshift lbgs it is found that only little size evolution takes placefrom z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in theirapparent profiles. the average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 forgalaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52for (0.12-0.3)l*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comovingsizes. the peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.however, a tail of larger galaxies (&gt;~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towardslater cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhancedaccretion of cold gas. additionally, the average star-formation surface densityof lbgs with luminosities (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} is nearly constant at sigma_{sfr}=1.9msun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similarstar-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. the above evolutionarytrends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possiblyincomplete.

0910.0001	very blue uv-continuum slopes of low luminosity z~7 galaxies from  wfc3/ir: evidence for extremely low metallicities?	we use the ultra-deep wfc3/ir data over the hudf and the early releasescience wfc3/ir data over the cdf-south goods field to quantify the broadbandspectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. we determine theuv-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxiesat later times to measure the evolution in beta. for luminous l*(z=3) galaxies,we measure a mean uv-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable tothe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. however, for the lowerluminosity 0.1l*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. this issubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just800 myr later, and even at z~5-6. in principle, the observed beta of -3.0 canbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebularemission is included the expected beta becomes &gt;~-2.7. to produce these veryblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms toreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. for example, a largeescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}&gt;~0.3) could minimize the contribution from thisred nebular emission. if this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7galaxies is &gt;~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

0910.0838	ultradeep infrared array camera observations of sub-l* z~7 and z~8  galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field: the contribution of low-luminosity  galaxies to the stellar mass density and reionization	we study the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) mid-infrared (rest-frameoptical) fluxes of 14 newly wfc3/ir-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5z=8 y_{105}-dropout galaxies. the wfc3/ir depth and spatial resolution allowaccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable fluxmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. none of the galaxies are detected to[3.6]=26.9 (ab, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detectionfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the y_{105}-dropouts. weconstruct average broadband seds using the stacked acs, wfc3, and irac fluxesand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellarmasses, and ages. for the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},(u-v)_{rest}=0.4, reddening a_v=0, stellar mass m*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9m_sun (salpeter imf). the best-fit ages ~300myr, m/l_v=0.2, andssfr=1.7gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. the sub-l* galaxiesobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and underfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustainedreionization at 7&lt;z&lt;11. in contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} y_{105}-dropoutshave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-completereliance on far-uv data. adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the m/l(z=8), thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab} &lt; -18 declines fromrho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 m_sun mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) &lt; 8 x 10^5 m_sunmpc^{-3}, following (1+z)^{-6} over 3&lt;z&lt;8. lower masses at z=8 would signifymore dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper iracobservations, long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope.

0911.1356	star formation rates and stellar masses of z=7-8 galaxies from irac  observations of the wfc3/ir ers and the hudf field	we investigate the spitzer/irac properties of 36 z~7 z-dropout galaxies and 3z~8 y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area wfc3/ir data of the earlyrelease science, the ultradeep hudf09, and wide-area nicmos data. we fitstellar population synthesis models to the seds to derive mean redshifts,stellar masses, and ages. the z~7 galaxies are best characterized bysubstantial ages (&gt;100 myr) and m/l_v~0.2. the main trend with decreasingluminosity is that of bluing of the far-uv slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.this can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowestluminosity galaxies (0.1 l*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth sfhs failto match the blue far-uv and moderately red h-[3.6] color. such colors mayrequire episodic sfhs with short periods of activity and quiescence ("on-off"cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. the stellar mass of oursample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with sfr according to log m* =8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log sfr, implying star formation may havecommenced at z&gt;10. no galaxies are found with sfrs much higher or lower thanthe past averaged sfr suggesting that the typical star formation timescales areprobably a substantial fraction of the hubble time. we report the first iracdetection of y-dropout galaxies at z~8. the average rest-frame u-v=0.3 (ab) ofthe 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar m/l. thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 is rho*(z=8) = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-1.0} x 10^6m_sun mpc^-3, following log rho*(z)= 10.6(+-0.6) - 4.4(+-0.7) log(1+z) [m_sunmpc^-3] over 3&lt;z&lt; 8.

0911.3368	the clustering properties of the first galaxies	we study the clustering properties of the first galaxies formed in theuniverse. we find that, due to chemical enrichment of the inter-stellar mediumby isolated population iii stars formed in mini-halos at redshift z&gt;30, the(chronologically) first galaxies are composed of metal-poor population ii starsand are highly clustered on small scales. in contrast, chemically pristinegalaxies in halos with mass m~10^8 m_sun may form at z&lt;20 in relativelyunderdense regions of the universe. this occurs once self-enrichment bypopulation iii in mini-halos is quenched by the build-up of an $h_2$photo-dissociating radiative background in the lyman-werner bands. we find thatthese chemically pristine galaxies are spatially uncorrelated. thus, we expectthat deep fields with the james webb space telescope may detect clusters ofchemically enriched galaxies but individual chemically pristine objects. wepredict that metal-free galaxies at 10 &lt;= z &lt;= 15$ have surface densities ofabout 80 per square arcmin and per unit redshift but most of them will be toofaint even for jwst. however, the predicted density makes these objectsinteresting targets for searches behind lensing clusters.

1001.5037	how well do cosmological simulations reproduce individual-halo  properties?	cosmological simulations of galaxy formation often rely on prescriptions forstar formation and feedback that depend on halo properties such as halo mass,central over-density, and virial temperature. in this paper we address theconvergence of individual halo properties, based on their number of particlesn, focusing in particular on the mass of halos near the resolution limit of asimulation. while it has been established that the halo mass function issampled on average down to n~30 particles, we show that individual haloproperties exhibit significant scatter, and some systematic biases, as oneapproaches the resolution limit. we carry out a series of cosmologicalsimulations using the gadget2 and enzo codes with n_p=64^3 to n_p=1024^3 totalparticles, keeping the same large-scale structure in the simulation box. weconsider boxes from l_{box} = 8 mpc/h to l_{box} = 512 mpc/h to probe differenthalo masses and formation redshifts. we cross-identify dark matter halos inboxes at different resolutions and measure the scatter in their properties. theuncertainty in the mass of single halos depends on the number of particles(scaling approximately as n^{-1/3}), but the rarer the density peak, the morerobust its identification. the virial radius of halos is very stable and can bemeasured without bias for halos with n&gt;30. in contrast, the average densitywithin a sphere containing 25% of the total halo mass is severelyunderestimated (by more than a factor 2) and the halo spin is moderatelyoverestimated for n&lt;100. if sub-grid physics is implemented upon a cosmologicalsimulation, we recommend that rare halos (~3sigma peaks) be resolved with n&gt;100particles and common halos (~1sigma peaks) with n&gt;400 particles to avoidexcessive numerical noise and possible systematic biases in the results.

1003.0280	the dynamical state of the globular cluster m10 (ngc 6254)	studying the radial variation of the stellar mass function in globularclusters (gcs) has proved a valuable tool to explore the collisional dynamicsleading to mass segregation and core collapse. in order to study the radialdependence of the luminosity and mass function of m 10, we used acs/hst deephigh resolution archival images, reaching out to approximately the cluster'shalf-mass radius (rhm), combined with deep wfpc2 images that extend our radialcoverage to more than 2 rhm. from our photometry, we derived a radial masssegregation profile and a global mass function that we compared with those ofsimulated clusters containing different energy sources (namely hard binariesand/or an imbh) able to halt core collapse and to quench mass segregation. aset of direct n-body simulations of gcs, with and without an imbh of mass 1% ofthe total cluster mass, comprising different initial mass functions (imfs) andprimordial binary fractions, was used to predict the observed mass segregationprofile and mass function. the mass segregation profile of m 10 is notcompatible with cluster models without either an imbh or primordial binaries,as a source of energy appears to be moderately quenching mass segregation inthe cluster. unfortunately, the present observational uncertainty on the binaryfraction in m10 does not allow us to confirm the presence of an imbh in thecluster, since an imbh, a dynamically non-negligible binary fraction (~ 5%), orboth can equally well explain the radial dependence of the cluster massfunction.

1004.0384	the galaxy luminosity function during the reionization epoch	the new wide field camera 3/ir observations on the hubble ultra-deep fieldstarted investigating the properties of galaxies during the reionization epoch.to interpret these observations, we present a novel approach inspired by theconditional luminosity function method. we calibrate our model to observationsat z=6 and assume a non-evolving galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation.we first compare model predictions against the luminosity function measured atz=5 and z=4. we then predict the luminosity function at z&gt;=7 under the soleassumption of evolution in the underlying dark-matter halo mass function. ourmodel is consistent with the observed z&gt;6.5 galaxy number counts in the hudfsurvey and suggests a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of theluminosity function: alpha(z&gt;8)&lt; -1.9 compared to alpha=-1.74 at z=6. althoughwe currently see only the brightest galaxies, a hidden population of lowerluminosity objects (l/l_{*}&gt; 10^{-4}) might provide &gt;75% of the totalreionizing flux. assuming escape fraction f_{esc}~0.2, clumping factor c~5, topheavy-imf and low metallicity, galaxies below the detection limit producecomplete reionization at z&gt;8. for solar metallicity and normal stellar imf,reionization finishes at z&gt;6, but a smaller c/f_{esc} is required for anoptical depth consistent with the wmap measurement. our model highlights thatthe star formation rate in sub-l_* galaxies has a quasi-linear relation todark-matter halo mass, suggesting that radiative and mechanical feedback wereless effective at z&gt;6 than today.

1005.1661	the evolution of the uv luminosity function from z ~ 0.75 to z ~ 2.5  using hst ers wfc3/uvis observations	we present uv luminosity functions (lfs) at 1500 angstrom derived from thehst early release science wfc3/uvis data acquired over ~50 arcmin^2 of thegoods-south field. the lfs are determined over the entire redshift rangez=0.75-2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts forlyman break galaxies (lbgs): (1) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshiftsto study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropoutsamples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. thecharacteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistentwith earlier work. however, the other schechter function parameters, thefaint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constantover the range z=0.75-2.5. using these lf determinations we find the uvluminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} fromz~0 to its peak at z~2.5. strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our lfsare all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift lbg studies.since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatterwith alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expectedflattening occurs. despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggestalpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. these new results from such a shallow earlydataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of wfc3/uvis for thethorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift rangez~0.5 to z~3.

1105.2038	lower-luminosity galaxies could reionize the universe: very steep  faint-end slopes to the uv luminosity functions at z&gt;=5-8 from the hudf09  wfc3/ir observations	the hudf09 data are the deepest near-ir observations ever, reaching to 29.5mag. luminosity functions (lf) from these new hudf09 data for 132 z\sim7 andz\sim8 galaxies are combined with new lfs for z\sim5-6 galaxies and the earlierz\sim4 lf to reach to very faint limits (&lt;0.05 l*(z=3)). the faint-end slopesalpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z\sim5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z\sim6), -2.01+/-0.21(z\sim7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z\sim8). slopes alpha\lesssim-2 lead to formallydivergent uv fluxes, though galaxies are not expected to form below \sim-10 abmag. these results have important implications for reionization. the weightedmean slope at z\sim6-8 is -1.87+/-0.13. for such steep slopes, and a faint-endlimit of -10 ab mag, galaxies provide a very large uv ionizing photon flux.while current results show that galaxies can reionize the universe by z\sim6,matching the thomson optical depths is more challenging. extrapolating thecurrent lf evolution to z&gt;8, taking alpha to be -1.87+/-0.13 (the mean value atz\sim6-8), and adopting typical parameters, we derive thomson optical depths of0.061_{-0.006}^{+0.009}. however, this result will change if the faint-endslope alpha is not constant with redshift. we test this hypothesis and find aweak, though uncertain, trend to steeper slopes at earlier times(dalpha/dz\sim-0.05+/-0.04), that would increase the thomson optical depths to0.079_{-0.017}^{+0.063}, consistent with recent wmap estimates(tau=0.088+/-0.015). it may thus not be necessary to resort to extremeassumptions about the escape fraction or clumping factor. nevertheless, theuncertainties remain large. deeper wfc3/ir+acs observations can furtherconstrain the ionizing flux from galaxies.

1105.2297	expanded search for z~10 galaxies from hudf09, ers, and candels data:  evidence for accelerated evolution at z&gt;8?	we search for z~10 galaxies over ~160 arcmin^2 of wfc3/ir data in the chandradeep field south, using the public hudf09, ers, and candels surveys, that reachto 5sigma depths ranging from 26.9 to 29.4 in h_160 ab mag. z&gt;~9.5 galaxycandidates are identified via j_125-h_160&gt;1.2 colors and non-detections in anyband blueward of j_125. spitzer irac photometry is key for separating thegenuine high-z candidates from intermediate redshift (z~2-4) galaxies withevolved or heavily dust obscured stellar populations. after removing 16 sourcesof intermediate brightness (h_160~24-26 mag) with strong irac detections, weonly find one plausible z~10 galaxy candidate in the whole data set, previouslyreported in bouwens et al. (2011). the newer data cover a 3x larger area andprovide much stronger constraints on the evolution of the uv luminosityfunction (lf). if the evolution of the z~4-8 lfs is extrapolated to z~10, sixz~10 galaxies are expected in our data. the detection of only one sourcesuggests that the uv lf evolves at an accelerated rate before z~8. theluminosity density is found to increase by more than an order of magnitude inonly 170 myr from z~10 to z~8. this increase is &gt;=4x larger than expected fromthe lower redshift extrapolation of the uv lf. we are thus likely witnessingthe first rapid build-up of galaxies in the heart of cosmic reionization.future deep hst wfc3/ir data, reaching to well beyond 29 mag, can enable a morerobust quantification of the accelerated evolution around z~10.

1109.0994	uv-continuum slopes at z~4-7 from the hudf09+ers+candels observations:  discovery of a well-defined uv-color magnitude relationship for z&gt;=4  star-forming galaxies	ultra-deep acs and wfc3/ir hudf+hudf09 data, along with the wide-areagoods+ers+candels data over the cdf-s goods field, are used to measure uvcolors, expressed as the uv-continuum slope beta, of star-forming galaxies overa wide range in luminosity (0.1l*(z=3) to 2l*(z=3)) at high redshift (z~7 toz~4). beta is measured using all acs and wfc3/ir passbands uncontaminated byly_alpha and spectral breaks. extensive tests show that our beta measurementsare only subject to minimal biases. using a different selection procedure,dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their beta measurements. toreconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found thatbeta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the samepassbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta.high-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame uv color-magnitude (cm)relationship that becomes systematically bluer towards fainter uv luminosities.no evolution is seen in the slope of the uv cm relationship in the first 1.5gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero-point to redder colors fromz~7 to z~4. this suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-definedsequence in the l(uv)-color (beta) plane (a "star-forming sequence"?). dustappears to be the principal factor driving changes in the uv color (beta) withluminosity. these new larger beta samples lead to improved dust extinctionestimates at z~4-7 and confirm that the extinction is still essentially zero atlow luminosities and high redshifts. inclusion of the new dust extinctionresults leads to (i) excellent agreement between the sfr density at z~4-8 andthat inferred from the stellar mass density, and (ii) to higher ssfrs at z&gt;~4,suggesting the ssfr may evolve modestly (by factors of ~2) from z~4-7 to z~2.

1110.0468	overdensities of y-dropout galaxies from the brightest-of-reionizing  galaxies survey: a candidate protocluster at redshift z~8	theoretical and numerical modeling of dark-matter halo assembly predicts thatthe most luminous galaxies at high redshift are surrounded by overdensities offainter companions. we test this prediction with hst observations acquired byour brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) survey, which identified four verybright z~8 candidates as y-dropout sources in four of the 23 non-contiguouswfc3 fields observed. we extend here the search for y-dropouts to fainterluminosities (m_* galaxies with m_ab\sim-20), with detections at &gt;5sigmaconfidence (compared to &gt;8sigma confidence adopted earlier) identifying 17 newcandidates. we demonstrate that there is a correlation between number counts offaint and bright y-dropouts at &gt;99.84% confidence. field borg58, which containsthe best bright z\sim8 candidate (m_ab=-21.3), has the most significantoverdensity of faint y-dropouts. four new sources are located within 70arcsec(corresponding to 3.1 comoving mpc at z=8) from the previously known brighterz\sim8 candidate. the overdensity of y-dropouts in this field has a physicalorigin to high confidence (p&gt;99.975%), independent of completeness andcontamination rate of the y-dropout selection. we modeled the overdensity bymeans of cosmological simulations and estimate that the principal dark matterhalo has mass m_h\sim(4-7)x10^11msun (\sim5sigma density peak) and issurrounded by several m_h\sim10^11msun halos which could host the fainterdropouts. in this scenario, we predict that all halos will eventually mergeinto a m_h&gt;2x10^14msun galaxy cluster by z=0. follow-up observations withground and space based telescopes are required to secure the z\sim8 nature ofthe overdensity, discover new members, and measure their precise redshift.

1201.0016	inferences on the distribution of ly-alpha emission of z~7 and z~8  galaxies	spectroscopic confirmation of galaxies at z~7 and above has been extremelydifficult, owing to a drop in intensity of ly-alpha emission in comparison withsamples at z~6. this crucial finding could potentially signal the ending ofcosmic reionization. however it is based on small datasets, often incompleteand heterogeneous in nature. we introduce a flexible bayesian framework, usefulto interpret such evidence. within this framework, we implement two simplephenomenological models: a smooth one, where the distribution of ly-alpha isattenuated by a factor \es with respect to z~6; a patchy one where a fraction\ep is absorbed/non-emitted while the rest is unabsorbed. from a compilation of39 observed z~7 galaxies we find \es=0.69+-0.12 and \ep=0.66+-0.16. the modelscan be used to compute fractions of emitters above any equivalent width w. forw&gt;25\aa, we find x^{25}_{z=7}=0.37+-0.11 (0.14+-0.06) for galaxies fainter(brighter) than m_{uv}=-20.25 for the patchy model, consistent with previouswork, but with smaller uncertainties by virtue of our full use of the data. atz~8 we combine new deep (5-\sigma flux limit 10^{-17}ergs^{-1}cm^{-2})keck-nirspec observations of a bright y-dropout identified by our borg survey,with those of three objects from the literature and find that the inference isinconclusive. we compute predictions for future near-infrared spectroscopicsurveys and show that it is challenging but feasible to constrain thedistribution of ly-alpha emitters at z~8 and distinguish between models.

1201.0755	the bright end of the uv luminosity function at z~8: new constraints  from candels data in goods-south	we present new z~8 galaxy candidates from a search over ~95 arcmin^2 ofwfc3/ir data, tripling the previous search area for bright z~8 galaxies. ouranalysis uses newly acquired wfc3/ir imaging data from the candels multi-cycletreasury program over the goods south field. these new data are combined withexisting deep optical acs imaging to search for relatively bright (m_uv &lt; -19.5mag) z~8 galaxy candidates using the lyman break technique. these newcandidates are used to determine the bright end of the uv luminosity function(lf) of star-forming galaxies at z~8. to minimize contamination from lowerredshift galaxies, we make full use of all optical acs data and impose strictnon-detection criteria based on an optical chi^2_opt flux measurement. in thewhole search area we identify 16 candidate z~8 galaxies, spanning a magnituderange h_160 = 25.7-27.9 mag. the new data show that the uv lf is a factor ~1.7xlower at m_uv &lt; -19.5 mag than determined from the hudf09 and ers data alone.combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the hudf09 and ersdata allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the z~8 uv lf yet.schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best-fitcharacteristic magnitude of m*(z=8) = -20.04+-0.46 mag. the faint-end slope isvery steep, though quite uncertain, with alpha = -2.06+-0.32. a combination ofwide area data with additional ultra-deep imaging will be required tosignificantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future.

1204.0517	detecting gravitationally lensed population iii galaxies with the hubble  space telescope and the james webb space telescope	small galaxies consisting entirely of population iii (pop iii) stars may format high redshifts, and could constitute one of the best probes of such stars.here, we explore the prospects of detecting gravitationally lensed pop iiigalaxies behind the galaxy cluster j0717.5+3745 (j0717) with both the hubblespace telescope (hst) and the upcoming james webb space telescope (jwst). byprojecting simulated catalogs of pop iii galaxies at z~7-15 through the j0717magnification maps, we estimate the lensed number counts as a function of fluxdetection threshold. we find that the ongoing hst survey clash, targeting atotal of 25 galaxy clusters including j0717, potentially could detect a smallnumber of pop iii galaxies if ~1% of the baryons in these systems have beenconverted into pop iii stars. using jwst exposures of j0717, this limit can bepushed to ~0.1% of the baryons. ultra-deep jwst observations of unlensed fieldsare predicted to do somewhat worse, but will be able to probe pop iii galaxieswith luminosities intermediate between those detectable in hst/clash and injwst observations of j0717. we also explain how current measurements of thegalaxy luminosity function at z=7-10 can be used to constrain pop iii galaxymodels with very high star formation efficiencies (~10% of the baryonsconverted into pop iii stars).

1204.3641	the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey: constraints on the bright  end of the z~8 luminosity function	we report the discovery of 33 lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidates at z~8detected in hubble space telescope (hst) wide field camera 3 (wfc3) imaging aspart of the brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) pure-parallel survey. theongoing borg survey currently has the largest area (274 arcmin^2) with y_098(or y_105), j_125, and h_160 band coverage needed to search for z~8 galaxies,about three times the current candels area, and slightly larger than what willbe the final candels wide component with y_105 data. our sample of 33relatively bright y_098-dropout galaxies have j_125 band magnitudes between25.5 and 27.4 mag. this is the largest sample of bright (j_125 &lt;~ 27.4) z~8galaxy candidates presented to date. combining our dataset with the hubbleultra-deep field (hudf09) dataset, we constrain the rest-frame ultravioletgalaxy luminosity function at z~8 over the widest dynamic range currentlyavailable. the combined datasets are well fitted by a schechter function, i.e.\phi(l) = \phi_* (l/l_*)^{\alpha}\ e^{-(l/l_*)}, without evidence for an excessof sources at the bright end. at 68% confidence, we derive \phi_* =(4.3^{+3.5}_{-2.1}) \times 10^{-4} mpc^{-3}, m_* = -20.26^{+0.29}_{-0.34}, anda very steep faint-end slope \alpha = -1.98^{+0.23}_{-0.22}. while the best-fitparameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between \phi_* and m_*,our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of thefaint-end power-law slope at z~8 compared to the best previous determination at+/-0.4. with a future expansion of the borg survey, combined with plannedultradeep wfc3/ir observations, it will be possible to further reduce thisuncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slopecompared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key roleplayed by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.

1209.3037	the spectral energy distributions of z~8 galaxies from the irac ultra  deep fields: emission lines, stellar masses, and specific star formation  rates at 650 myr	using new ultradeep spitzer/irac photometry from the irac ultradeep fieldprogram (iudf), we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 63y-dropout galaxy candidates at z~8, only 650myr after the big bang. the sourcesare selected from hst/acs+wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field (hudf),two hudf parallel fields, and wide area data over the candels/goods-south. thenew spitzer/irac data increase the coverage at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron to~120h over the hudf reaching depths of ~28 (ab,1 sigma). the improved depth andinclusion of brighter candidates result in direct &gt;3 sigma irac detections of20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at &gt; 5 sigma. the average[3.6]-[4.5] colors of irac detected galaxies at z~8 are markedly redder thanthose at z~7, observed only 130myr later. the simplest explanation is that wewitness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular[oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) moving through the irac bandpasses with redshift.assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z~7 and z~8we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of w([oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) = 670(+260,-170) angstrom contributing 0.56 (+0.16,-0.11) mag to the 4.5 micronfilter at z~8. the corresponding w(halpha) = 430 (+160,-110) angstrom impliesan average specific star formation rate of ssfr = 11 (+11,-5) gyr^-1 and astellar population age of 100 (+100,-50) myr. correcting the spectral energydistribution for the contribution of emission lines lowers the average best-fitstellar masses and mass-to-light ratios by x3, decreasing the integratedstellar mass density to rho*(z=8,muv&lt;-18)=0.6 (+0.4,-0.3) x 10^6 msun mpc^-3.

0712.0398	cosmic variance and its effect on the luminosity function determination  in deep high z surveys	we study cosmic variance in deep high redshift surveys and its influence onthe determination of the luminosity function for high redshift galaxies. forseveral survey geometries relevant for hst and jwst instruments, wecharacterize the distribution of the galaxy number counts. this is obtained bymeans of analytic estimates via the two point correlation function in extendedpress-schechter theory as well as by using synthetic catalogs extracted fromn-body cosmological simulations of structure formation. we adopt a simpleluminosity - dark halo mass relation to investigate the environment effects onthe fitting of the luminosity function. we show that in addition to variationsof the normalization of the luminosity function, a steepening of its slope isalso expected in underdense fields, similarly to what is observed within voidsin the local universe. therefore, to avoid introducing artificial biases,caution must be taken when attempting to correct for field underdensity, suchas in the case of hst udf i-dropout sample, which exhibits a deficit of brightcounts with respect to the average counts in goods. a public version of thecosmic variance calculator based on the two point correlation functionintegration is made available on the web.

1211.1010	a rest-frame optical view on z~4 galaxies i: color and age distributions  from deep irac photometry of the iudf10 and goods surveys	we present a study of rest-frame uv-to-optical color distributions for z~4galaxies based on the combination of deep hst/acs+wfc3/ir data withspitzer/irac imaging. in particular, we use new, ultra-deep data from the iracultradeep field program (iudf10). our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxiesselected as b-dropout lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the hudf and one of itsdeep parallel fields, the hudf09-2, as well as goods-north and south. thissample is used to investigate the uv continuum slopes beta and balmer breakcolors (j_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. the [4.5]filter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame opticalemission lines. we find that galaxies at m_z&lt;-21.5 (roughly corresponding tol*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. theuv continuum slopes and the j_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. the mostsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at theseredshifts is better described by an smc-like extinction curve, rather than thetypically assumed calzetti reddening. after correcting for dust, we find thatthe galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function ofluminosity. in contrast to some results from the literature, we find that onlya small fraction of galaxies shows balmer break colors which are consistentwith extremely young ages, younger than 100 myr. under the assumption of smoothstar-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies atm_z&lt;-19.75. our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars anddust in galaxies at z&gt;4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed inshort, intense bursts of star-formation.

1306.2950	uv-continuum slopes of &gt;4000 z~4-8 galaxies from the hudf/xdf, hudf09,  ers, candels-south, and candels-north fields	we measure the uv-continuum slope beta for over 4000 high-redshift galaxiesover a wide range of redshifts z~4-8 and luminosities from the hst hudf/xdf,hudf09-1, hudf09-2, ers, candels-n, and candels-s data sets. our new betaresults reach very faint levels at z~4 (-15.5 mag: 0.006 l*(z=3)), z~5 (-16.5mag: 0.014l*(z=3)), and z~6 and z~7 (-17 mag: 0.025 l*(z=3)). inconsistenciesbetween previous studies led us to conduct a comprehensive review of systematicerrors and develop a new technique for measuring beta that is robust againstbiases that arise from the impact of noise. we demonstrate, by object-by-objectcomparisons, that all previous studies, including our own and those done on thelatest hudf12 dataset, suffer from small systematic errors in beta. we findthat after correcting for the systematic errors (typically d(beta) ~0.1-0.2)all beta results at z~7 from different groups are in excellent agreement. themean beta we measure for faint (-18 mag: 0.1l*(z=3)) z~4, z~5, z~6, and z~7galaxies is -2.03+/-0.03+/-0.06 (random and systematic errors),-2.14+/-0.06+/-0.06, -2.24+/-0.11+/-0.08, and -2.30+/-0.18+/-0.13,respectively. our new beta values are redder than we have reported in the past,but bluer than other recent results. our previously reported trend of bluerbeta's at lower luminosities is confirmed, as is the evolution to bluer beta'sat high redshifts. beta appears to show only a mild luminosity dependencefaintward of m(uv,ab) ~ -19 mag, suggesting that the mean beta asymptotes to ~-2.2 to -2.4 for faint z&gt;~4 galaxies. at z~7, the observed beta's suggestnon-zero, but low dust extinction, and they agree well with values predicted incosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

1306.6888	gamma ray burst and star formation rates: the physical origin for the  redshift evolution of their ratio	gamma ray bursts (grbs) and galaxies at high redshift represent complementaryprobes of the star formation history of the universe. in fact, both the grbrate and the galaxy luminosity density are connected to the underlying starformation. here, we combine a star formation model for the evolution of thegalaxy luminosity function from z=0 to z=10 with a metallicity-dependentefficiency for grb formation to simultaneously predict the comoving grb rate.our model sheds light on the physical origin of the empirical relation oftenassumed between grb rate and luminosity density-derived star formation rate:rgrb(z) = \epsilon(z)*sfr_{obs}(z), with \epsilon(z) (1+z)^{1.2}. at z&lt;4,\epsilon(z) is dominated by the effects of metallicity evolution in the grbefficiency. our best-fitting model only requires a moderate preference forlow-metallicity, that is a grb rate per unit stellar mass about four timeshigher for log(z/zsun)&lt;-3 compared to log(z/zsun)&gt;0. models with totalsuppression of grb formation at log(z/zsun)&gt;0 are disfavored. at z&gt;4, most ofthe star formation happens in low-metallicity hosts with nearly saturatedefficiency of grb production per unit stellar mass. however at the same epoch,galaxy surveys miss an increasing fraction of the predicted luminosity densitybecause of flux limits, driving an accelerated evolution of \epsilon(z)compared to the empirical power-law fit from lower z. our findings areconsistent with the non-detections of grb hosts in ultradeep imaging at z&gt;5,and point toward current galaxy surveys at z&gt;8 only observing the top 15-20 %of the total luminosity density.

1309.2280	the most luminous z~9-10 galaxy candidates yet found: the luminosity  function, cosmic star-formation rate, and the first mass density estimate at  500 myr	[abridged] we present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (h_160 ~ 26 -27 mag ab) galaxy candidates at z~9-10 in the complete hst candels wfc3/irgoods-n imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy candidates that areknown, just ~500 myr after the big bang. two similarly bright sources are alsodetected in a systematic re-analysis of the goods-s data set. three of the fourgalaxies in goods-n are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deepspitzer/irac 4.5 micron data, as is one of the goods-s candidates. furthermore,the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is robustly detected also at3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat uv spectral energy distribution with aslope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity athigh redshift. the abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that theluminosity function evolves more significantly in phi_* than in l_* at z&gt;~8with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formationrate density for galaxies with sfr &gt;0.7 m_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitudeincrease in only 170 myr from z ~ 10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previousresults. based on the irac detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z~10,finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 m_sun. the cosmicstellar mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 m_sun mpc^-3 forgalaxies brighter than m_uv~-18. the remarkable brightness, and henceluminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity for deepspectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value ofadditional search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation inthe very early universe, and highlights the opportunities for jwst to map thebuildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z~10.

1407.7316	measurement of galaxy clustering at z~7.2 and the evolution of galaxy  bias from 3.8&lt;z&lt;8 in the xdf, goods-s and goods-n	lyman-break galaxy (lbg) samples observed during reionization ($z\gtrsim6$)with hubble space telescope's wide field camera 3 are reaching sizes sufficientto characterize their clustering properties. using a combined catalog from thehubble extreme deep field and candels surveys, containing $n=743$ lbgcandidates at z&gt;6.5 at a mean redshift of $z=7.2$, we detect a clear clusteringsignal in the angular correlation function (acf) at $\sim4\sigma$,corresponding to a real-space correlation length$r_{0}=6.7^{+0.9}_{-1.0}h^{-1}$cmpc. the derived galaxy bias$b=8.6^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ is that of dark-matter halos of$m=10^{11.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}}$m$_{\odot}$ at $z=7.2$, and highlights that galaxiesbelow the current detection limit ($m_{ab}\sim-17.7$) are expected inlower-mass halos ($m\sim10^{8}-10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$). we compute the acf oflbgs at $z\sim3.8-z\sim5.9$ in the same surveys. a trend of increasing bias isfound from $z=3.8$ ($b\sim3.0$) to $z=7.2$ ($b\sim8.6$), broadly consistentwith galaxies at fixed luminosity being hosted in dark-matter halos of similarmass at $4&lt;z&lt;6$, followed by a slight rise in halo masses at $z\sim7$($\sim2\sigma$ confidence). separating the data at the median luminosity of the$z=7.2$ sample ($m_{uv}=-19.4$) shows higher clustering at $z=5.9$ for brightgalaxies ($r_{0}=5.5^{+1.4}_{-1.5}h^{-1}$cmpc, $b=6.2^{+1.2}_{-1.5}$) comparedto faint galaxies ($r_{0}=1.9^{+1.1}_{-1.0}h^{-1}$cmpc, $b=2.7\pm1.2$) implyinga constant mass-to-light ratio $\frac{dlogm}{dlogl}\sim1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.8}$. asimilar trend is present in the $z=7.2$ sample with larger uncertainty.finally, our bias measurements allow us to investigate the fraction ofdark-matter halos hosting uv-bright galaxies (the duty-cycle, $\epsilon_{dc}$).at $z=7.2$ values near unity are preferred, which may be explained by theshortened halo assembly time at high-redshift.

1409.1228	first frontier field constraints on the cosmic star-formation rate  density at z~10 - the impact of lensing shear on completeness of  high-redshift galaxy samples	we search the complete hubble frontier field dataset of abell 2744 and itsparallel field for z~10 sources to further refine the evolution of the cosmicstar-formation rate density (sfrd) at z&gt;8. we independently confirm two imagesof the recently discovered triply-imaged z~9.8 source by zitrin et al. (2014)and set an upper limit for similar z~10 galaxies with red colors ofj_125-h_160&gt;1.2 in the parallel field of abell 2744. we utilize extensivesimulations to derive the effective selection volume of lyman-break galaxies atz~10, both in the lensed cluster field and in the adjacent parallel field.particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear toaccurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly-magnifiedsources. we show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness ata given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the criticalcurves. these effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on thedetectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantiallyreduce the expected number of highly-magnified sources. the detections andlimits from both pointings result in a sfrd which is higher by 0.4+-0.4 dexthan previous estimates at z~10 from blank fields. nevertheless, thecombination of these new results with all other estimates remain consistentwith a rapidly declining sfrd in the 170 myr from z~8 to z~10 as predicted bycosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in lambdacdm. oncebiases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for,the full six cluster and parallel frontier field program will be an extremelypowerful new dataset to probe the evolution of the galaxy population at z&gt;8before the advent of the jwst.

1502.03887	the impact of strong gravitational lensing on observed lyman-break  galaxy numbers at 4&lt;z&lt;8 in the goods and the xdf blank fields	detection of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at high-redshift can be affected bygravitational lensing induced by foreground deflectors not only in galaxyclusters, but also in blank fields. we quantify the impact of strongmagnification in the samples of $b$, $v$, $i$, $z$ $\&amp;$ $y$ lbgs ($4\lesssim z\lesssim8$) observed in the xdf and goods/candels fields, by investigating theproximity of dropouts to foreground objects. we find that $\sim6\%$ of brightlbgs ($m_{h_{160}}&lt;26$) at $z\sim7$ have been strongly lensed ($\mu&gt;2$) byforeground objects. this fraction decreases from $\sim 3.5\%$ at $z\sim6$ to$\sim1.5\%$ at $z\sim4$. since the observed fraction of strongly lensedgalaxies is a function of the shape of the luminosity function (lf), it can beused to derive schechter parameters, $\alpha$ and $m_{\star}$, independentlyfrom galaxy number counts. our magnification bias analysis yieldsschechter-function parameters in close agreement with those determined fromgalaxy counts albeit with larger uncertainties. extrapolation of our analysisto $z\gtrsim 8$ suggests that future surveys with jswt, wfirst and euclidshould find excess lbgs at the bright-end, even if there is an intrinsicexponential cutoff of number counts. finally, we highlight how themagnification bias measurement near the detection limit can be used as probe ofthe population of galaxies too faint to be detected. preliminary results usingthis novel idea suggest that the magnification bias at $m_{uv}\sim -18$ is notas strong as expected if $\alpha\lesssim -1.7$ extends well below the currentdetection limits in the xdf. at face value this implies a flattening of the lfat $m_{uv}\gtrsim-16.5$. however, selection effects and completeness estimatesare difficult to quantify precisely. thus, we do not rule out a steep lfextending to $m_{uv}\gtrsim -15$.

0804.4874	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: ii. constraints on reionization from  z-dropout galaxies	[abridged] we detect three (plus one less certain) z-dropout sources in twoseparate fields of our udf05 hst nicmos images. these z~7 lyman-break galaxy(lbg) candidates allow us to constrain the luminosity function (lf) of the starforming galaxy population at those epochs. by assuming a change in only m* andadopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values atz~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unitredshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a valueof m*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. this implies a steady evolution for the lbg lf out toz~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. thisputs a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whoseensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 myrbefore the epoch at which they are observed. in particular, a large fraction ofstars in the z~6 lbg population must form at redshifts well above z~7.extrapolating this steady evolution of the lf out to higher redshifts, weestimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, providedthat the faint-end slope of the z&gt;7 lf steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faintgalaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute asubstantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. this scenario giveshowever an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigmabelow the wmap-5 measurement. therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either thecurrently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z&gt;7, or thelf evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and acorresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

0807.3352	where can we really find the first stars' remnants today?	a number of recent numerical investigations concluded that the remnants ofrare structures formed at very high redshift, such as the very first stars andbright redshift z~6 qsos, are preferentially located at the center of the mostmassive galaxy clusters at redshift z=0. in this paper we readdress thisquestion using a combination of cosmological simulations of structure formationand extended press-schechter formalism and we show that the typical remnants ofpopulation iii stars are instead more likely to be found in a groupenvironment, that is in dark matter halos of mass ~2x10^{13} h^{-1}m_sun.similarly, the descendants of the brightest z~6 qsos are expected to be inmedium-sized clusters (mass of a few 10^{14} h^{-1}m_sun), rather than in themost massive superclusters (m&gt;10^{15} h^{-1}m_sun) found within the typical 1gpc^3 cosmic volume where a bright z~6 qso lives. the origin of past claimsthat the most massive clusters preferentially host these remnants is rooted inthe numerical method used to initialize their numerical simulations: only asmall region of the cosmological volume of interest was simulated withsufficient resolution to identify low-mass halos at early times, and thisregion was chosen to host the most massive halo in the cosmological volume atlate times. the conclusion that the earliest structures formed in the entirecosmological volume evolve into the most massive halo at late times was thusarrived at by construction. we demonstrate that, to the contrary, the firststructures to form in a cosmological region evolve into relatively typicalobjects at later times. we propose alternative numerical methods for simulatingthe earliest structures in cosmological volumes.

astro-ph;0210677	thermodynamical description of a family of partially relaxed stellar  systems	we examine the thermodynamical properties of a family of partially relaxed,anisotropic stellar systems, derived earlier from the boltzmann entropy underthe assumption that a third quantity q is conserved in addition to the totalenergy and the total number of stars. we now show that the family of modelsconforms to the paradigm of the gravothermal catastrophe, which is expected tooccur (in the presence of adequate energy transport mechanisms) when theone-parameter equilibrium sequence attains sufficiently high values of theconcentration parameter; these are the values for which the models are wellfitted by the r^(1/4) law. in the intermediate concentration regime the modelsbelonging to the sequence exhibit significant deviations from the r^(1/4) law.curiously, in the low-concentration regime, the global thermodynamicaltemperature associated with the models becomes negative when the models becometoo anisotropic so that they are unstable against the radial orbit instability;this latter behavior, while offering a new clue to the physical interpretationof the radial orbit instability, is at variance with respect to thelow-concentration limit of the classical case of the isotropic, isothermalsphere investigated by bonnor (1956) and lynden-bell &amp; wood (1968).

astro-ph;0411541	a family of models of partially relaxed stellar systems ii. comparison  with the products of collisionless collapse	[abridged] n-body simulations of collisionless collapse have offeredimportant clues to the construction of realistic stellar dynamical models ofelliptical galaxies. understanding this idealized and relatively simpleprocess, by which stellar systems can reach partially relaxed equilibriumconfigurations (characterized by isotropic central regions and radiallyanisotropic envelopes), is a prerequisite to more ambitious attempts atconstructing physically justified models of elliptical galaxies in which theproblem of galaxy formation is set in the generally accepted cosmologicalcontext of hierarchical clustering.  in a previous paper, we have discussed the dynamical properties of a familyof models of partially relaxed stellar systems (the f^{(\nu)} models), designedto incorporate the qualitative properties of the products of collisionlesscollapse at small and at large radii. here we revisit the problem of incompleteviolent relaxation, by making a direct comparison between the detailedproperties of such family of models and those of the products of collisionlesscollapse found in n-body simulations that we have run for the purpose.surprisingly, the models thus identified are able to match the simulateddensity distributions over nine orders of magnitude and also to provide anexcellent fit to the anisotropy profiles and a good representation of theoverall structure in phase space.

astro-ph;0508517	primordial binaries and intermediate mass black holes in globular  clusters	we present the first study of the dynamical evolution of a star cluster thatcombines a significant population of primordial binaries with the presence of acentral black hole. we use direct n-body simulations, with a black hole mass ofabout one percent of the total mass of the cluster.  the evolution of the binary population is strongly influenced by the presenceof the black hole, which gives the cluster a large core with a central densitycusp. starting from a plummer profile, we first encounter a phase, that lastapproximately 10 half-mass relaxation times, in which binaries are disruptedfaster compared to analogous simulations without a black hole. subsequently,however, binary disruption slows down significantly, due to the large coresize.  the dynamical interplay between the primordial binaries and the black holethus introduces new features with respect to the scenarios investigated so far,where the influence of the black hole and of the binaries have been consideredseparately. specifically, the pattern of binary destruction by anintermediate-mass black hole may leave a fingerprint that could be detectedobservationally.

astro-ph;0510154	partial suppression of the radial orbit instability in stellar systems	it is well known that the simple criterion proposed originally by polyachenkoand shukhman (1981) for the onset of the radial orbit instability, althoughbeing generally a useful tool, faces significant exceptions both on the side ofmildly anisotropic systems (with some that can be proved to be unstable) and onthe side of strongly anisotropic models (with some that can be shown to bestable). in this paper we address two issues: are there processes ofcollisionless collapse that can lead to equilibria of the exceptional type?what is the intrinsic structural property that is responsible for the sometimesnoted exceptional stability behavior? to clarify these issues, we haveperformed a series of simulations of collisionless collapse that start fromhomogeneous, highly symmetrized, cold initial conditions and, because of suchspecial conditions, are characterized by very little mixing. for these runs,the end-states can be associated with large values of the global pressureanisotropy parameter up to 2k_r/k_t \approx 2.75. the highly anisotropicequilibrium states thus constructed show no significant traces of radialanisotropy in their central region, with a very sharp transition to a radiallyanisotropic envelope occurring well inside the half-mass radius (around 0.2r_m). to check whether the existence of such almost perfectly isotropic"nucleus" might be responsible for the apparent suppression of the radial orbitinstability, we could not resort to equilibrium models with the abovecharacteristics and with analytically available distribution function; instead,we studied and confirmed the stability of configurations with thosecharacteristics by initializing n-body approximate equilibria (with givendensity and pressure anisotropy profiles) with the help of the jeans equations.

astro-ph;0602408	star clusters with primordial binaries: i. dynamical evolution of  isolated models	in order to interpret the results of complex realistic star clustersimulations, which rely on many simplifying approximations and assumptions, itis essential to study the behavior of even more idealized models, which canhighlight the essential physical effects and are amenable to more exactmethods. with this aim, we present the results of n-body calculations of theevolution of equal-mass models, starting with primordial binary fractions of 0- 100 %, with values of n ranging from 256 to 16384. this allows us toextrapolate the main features of the evolution to systems comparable inparticle number with globular clusters. in this range, we find that thesteady-state `deuterium main sequence' is characterized by a ratio of the coreradius to half-mass radius that follows qualitatively the analytical estimateby vesperini &amp; chernoff (1994), although the n dependence is steeper thanexpected. interestingly, for an initial binary fraction f greater than 10%, thebinary heating in the core during the post collapse phase almost saturates(becoming nearly independent of f), and so little variation in the structuralproperties is observed. thus, although we observe a significantly lower binaryabundance in the core with respect to the fokker-planck simulations by gao etal. (1991), this is of little dynamical consequence. at variance with the studyof gao et al. (1991), we see no sign of gravothermal oscillations before 150halfmass relaxation times. at later times, however, oscillations becomeprominent. we demonstrate the gravothermal nature of these oscillations.

astro-ph;0602409	star clusters with primordial binaries: ii. dynamical evolution of  models in a tidal field	[abridged] we extend our analysis of the dynamical evolution of simple starcluster models, in order to provide comparison standards that will aid ininterpreting the results of more complex realistic simulations. we augment ourprevious primordial-binary simulations by introducing a tidal field, andstarting with king models of different central concentrations. we present theresults of n-body calculations of the evolution of equal-mass models, startingwith primordial binary fractions of 0 - 100 %, and n values from 512 to 16384.we also attempt to extrapolate some of our results to the larger number ofparticles that are necessary to model globular clusters. we characterize thesteady-state `deuterium main sequence' phase in which primordial binaries aredepleted in the core in the process of `gravitationally burning'. in this phasewe find that the ratio of the core to half-mass radius, r_c/r_h, is similar tothat measured for isolated systems. in addition to the generation of energy dueto hardening and depletion of the primordial binary population, the overallevolution of the star clusters is driven by a competing process: the tidaldisruption of the system. we find that the depletion of primordial binariesbefore tidal dissolution of the system is possible only if the initial numberis below 0.05 n, in the case of a king model with w_0=7 and n=4096 (which isone of our longest living models). we compare our findings, obtained by meansof direct n-body simulations but scaled, where possible, to larger n, withsimilar studies carried out by means of monte carlo methods.

astro-ph;0606693	neutral gas density in damped lyman alpha systems	we estimate the intrinsic neutral gas density in damped lyman alpha systems($\omega_{hi}^{(dla)}$) in the redshift range $ 2.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$ fromthe dla sdss dr_3 sample of optically selected quasars. we take into accountself-consistently the obscuration on background quasars due to the dust presentin damped lyman alpha systems. we model the column density and redshiftdistribution of these systems by using both a non-parametric and a parametricapproach. under conservative assumptions on the dust content of damped lyman$\alpha$ systems, we show that selection effects lead to underestimating theintrinsic neutral gas density by at least $15\%$ with respect to the observedneutral gas density. over the redshift range $[2.2;5.5]$ we find$\omega_{hi}^{(dla)}=0.97^{+0.08+0.28}_{-0.06-0.15} \cdot 10^{-3}$, where thefirst set of error bars gives the $1\sigma$ random errors and the second setgives the modeling uncertainty dependent on the fraction of metals in dust -from 0\% to 50\%. this value compares with$\omega_{hi}^{(dla)}=0.82^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ ($1\sigma$ error bars), which isobtained when no correction for dust is introduced. in the model with half ofthe metals mass in dust we cannot constraint $\omega_{hi}^{(dla)}$ at aconfidence level higher than $90\%$. in this case there is indeed a probabilityof about $10\%$ that the intrinsic column density distribution of dla systemsis a power law $f(n_{hi}) \propto 1/n_{hi}^{~1.95}$. in contrast, with $25 \%$of the metals in dust - the most realistic estimate - a power law is ruled outat $99.5\%$ of confidence level.

astro-ph;0610342	star clusters with primordial binaries: iii. dynamical interaction  between binaries and an intermediate mass black hole	we present the first study of the dynamical evolution of an isolated starcluster that combines a significant population of primordial binaries with thepresence of a central black hole. we use equal-mass direct n-body simulations,with n ranging from 4096 to 16384 and a primordial binary ratio of 0-10%; theblack hole mass is about one percent of the total mass of the cluster. theevolution of the binary population is strongly influenced by the presence ofthe black hole, which gives the cluster a large core with a central densitycusp. starting from a variety of initial conditions (plummer and king models),we first encounter a phase, that last approximately 10 half-mass relaxationtimes, in which binaries are disrupted faster compared to analogous simulationswithout a black hole. subsequently, however, binary disruption slows downsignificantly, due to the large core size. the dynamical interplay between theprimordial binaries and the black hole thus introduces new features withrespect to the scenarios investigated so far, where the influence of the blackhole and of the binaries have been considered separately. a large core to halfmass radius ratio appears to be a promising indirect evidence for the presenceof a intermediate-mass black hole in old globular clusters.

0705.4223	predictions for triple stars with and without a pulsar in star clusters	though about 80 pulsar binaries have been detected in globular clusters sofar, no pulsar has been found in a triple system in which all three objects areof comparable mass. here we present predictions for the abundance of suchtriple systems, and for the most likely characteristics of these systems. ourpredictions are based on an extensive set of more than 500 direct simulationsof star clusters with primordial binaries, and a number of additional runscontaining primordial triples. our simulations employ a number n_{tot} of equalmass stars from n_{tot}=512 to n_{tot}=19661 and a primordial binary fractionfrom 0-50%. in addition, we validate our results against simulations withn=19661 that include a mass spectrum with a turn-off mass at 0.8 m_{sun},appropriate to describe the old stellar populations of galactic globularclusters. based on our simulations, we expect that typical triple abundances inthe core of a dense cluster are two orders of magnitude lower than the binaryabundances, which in itself already suggests that we don't have to wait toolong for the first comparable-mass triple with a pulsar to be detected.
