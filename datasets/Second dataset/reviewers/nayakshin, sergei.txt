0905.2896	dynamic monte carlo radiation transfer in sph. radiation pressure force  implementation	we present a new framework for radiation hydrodynamics simulations. gasdynamics is modelled by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) method,whereas radiation transfer is simulated via a time-dependent monte-carloapproach that traces photon packets. as a first step in the development of themethod, in this paper we consider the momentum transfer between radiation fieldand gas, which is important for systems where radiation pressure is high. thereis no fundamental limitations on the number of radiation sources, geometry orthe optical depth of the problems that can be studied with the method. however,as expected for any monte-carlo transfer scheme, stochastic noise presents aserious limitation. we present a number of tests that show that the errors ofthe method can be estimated accurately by considering poisson noisefluctuations in the number of photon packets that sph particles interact withper dynamical time. it is found that for a reasonable accuracy the momentumcarried by photon packets must be much smaller than a typical momentum of sphparticles. we discuss numerical limitations of the code, and future steps thatcan be taken to improve performance and applicability of the method.

0911.2434	simulations of momentum feedback by black hole winds	the observed super-massive black hole (smbh) mass -- galaxy velocitydispersion ($m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$) correlation may be established whenwinds/outflows from the smbh drive gas out of the potential wells of classicalbulges. here we present numerical simulations of this process in a staticisothermal potential. simple spherically symmetric models of smbh feedback atthe eddington luminosity can successfully explain the $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ andnuclear cluster mass $m_{\rm nc}-\sigma$ correlations, as well as why largerbulges host smbhs while smaller ones host nuclear star clusters. however thesemodels do not specify how smbhs feed on infalling gas whilst simultaneouslyproducing feedback that drives gas out of the galaxy.  more complex models with rotation and/or anisotropic feedback allow smbhs tofeed via a disc or regions not exposed to smbh winds, but in these morerealistic cases it is not clear why a robust $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ relationshould be established. in fact, some of the model predictions contradictobservations. for example, an isotropic smbh wind impacting on a disc (ratherthan a shell) of aspect ratio $h/r \ll 1$ requires the smbh mass to be largerby a factor $\sim r/h$, which is opposite to what is observed. we conclude thatunderstanding how a smbh feeds is as important a piece of the puzzle asunderstanding how its feedback affects its host galaxy.  finally, we note that in aspherical cases the smbh outflows inducedifferential motions in the bulge. this may pump turbulence that is known tohinder star formation in star forming regions. smbh feedback thus may not onlydrive gas out of the bulge but also reduce the fraction of gas turned intostars.

0912.1996	kelvin-helmholtz instabilities with godunov sph	numerical simulations for the non-linear development of kelvin-helmholtzinstability in two different density layers have been performed with theparticle-based method (godunov sph) developed by inutsuka (2002). the godunovsph can describe the kelvin-helmholtz instability even with a high densitycontrast, while the standard sph shows the absence of the instability across adensity gradient (agertz et al. 2007). the interaction of a dense blob with ahot ambient medium has been performed also. the godunov sph describes theformation and evolution of the fingers due to the combinations ofrayleigh-taylor, richtmyer-meshkov, and kelvin-helmholtz instabilities. theblob test result coincides well with the results of the grid-based codes. aninaccurate handling of a density gradient in the standard sph has been pointedout as the direct reason of the absence of the instabilities. an unphysicalforce happens at the density gradient even in a pressure equilibrium, andrepulses particles from the initial density discontinuity. therefore, theinitial perturbation damps, and a gap forms at the discontinuity. theunphysical force has been studied in terms of the consistency of a numericalscheme. contrary to the standard sph, the momentum equation of the godunov sphdoesnt use the particle approximation, and has been derived from the kernelconvolution or a new lagrangian function. the new lagrangian function used inthe godunov sph is more analogous to the real lagrangian function forcontinuum. the momentum equation of the godunov sph has much better linearconsistency, so the unphysical force is greatly reduced compared to thestandard sph in a high density contrast.

1001.3883	feeding smbhs through supersonic turbulence and ballistic accretion	it has long been recognised that the main obstacle to accretion of gas ontosupermassive black holes (smbhs) is large specific angular momentum. it isfeared that the gas settles in a large scale disc, and that accretion wouldthen proceed too inefficiently to explain the masses of the observed smbhs.here we point out that, while the mean angular momentum in the bulge is verylikely to be large, the deviations from the mean can also be significant.indeed, cosmological simulations show that velocity and angular momentum fieldsof gas flows onto galaxies are very complex. furthermore, inside bulges the gasvelocity distribution can be further randomised by the velocity kicks due tofeedback from star formation. we perform hydrodynamical simulations of gaseousrotating shells infalling onto an smbh, attempting to quantify the importanceof velocity dispersion in the gas at relatively large distances from the blackhole. we implement this dispersion by means of a supersonic turbulent velocityspectrum. we find that, while in the purely rotating case the circularisationprocess leads to efficient mixing of gas with different angular momentum,resulting in a low accretion rate, the inclusion of turbulence increases thisaccretion rate by up to several orders of magnitude. we show that this can beunderstood based on the notion of "ballistic" accretion, whereby densefilaments, created by convergent turbulent flows, travel through the ambientgas largely unaffected by hydrodynamical drag. we derive a simple analyticalformula that captures the numerical results to within a factor of a few.rescaling our results to astrophysical bulges, we argue that this "ballistic"mode of accretion could provide the smbhs with a sufficient supply of fuelwithout the need to channel the gas via large-scale discs or bars, andtherefore that star formation in bulges can be a strong catalyst for smbhaccretion.

1003.0605	the accretion disc particle method for simulations of black hole feeding  and feedback	black holes grow by accreting matter from their surroundings. however,angular momentum provides an efficient natural barrier to accretion and so onlythe lowest angular momentum material will be available to feed the black holes.the standard sub-grid model for black hole accretion in galaxy formationsimulations - based on the bondi-hoyle method - does not account for theangular momentum of accreting material, and so it is unclear how representativethe black hole accretion rate estimated in this way is likely to be. in thispaper we introduce a new sub-grid model for black hole accretion that naturallyaccounts for the angular momentum of accreting material. both the black holeand its accretion disc are modelled as a composite accretion disc particle. gasparticles are captured by the accretion disc particle if and only if theirorbits bring them within its accretion radius r_acc, at which point their massis added to the accretion disc and feeds the black hole on a viscous timescalet_visc. the resulting black hole accretion rate (dm/dt)_bh powers the accretionluminosity l_acc ~ (dm/dt)_bh, which drives black hole feedback. using a seriesof controlled numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our new accretion discparticle method is more physically self-consistent than the bondi-hoyle method.we also discuss the physical implications of the accretion disc particle methodfor systems with a high degree of rotational support, and we argue that them_bh-sigma relation in these systems should be offset from the relation forclassical bulges and ellipticals, as appears to be observed.

1007.4159	formation of planets by tidal downsizing of giant planet embryos	we hypothesise that planets are made by tidal downsizing of migrating giantplanet embryos. the proposed scheme for planet formation consists of thesesteps: (i) a massive young protoplanetary disc fragments at r ~ several tens tohundreds of au on gaseous clumps with masses of a few jupiter masses; (ii) theclumps cool and contract, and simultaneously migrate closer in to the parentstar; (iii) as earlier suggested by boss (1998), dust sediments inside the gasclumps to form terrestrial mass solid cores; (iv) if the solid core becomesmore massive than ~ 10 earth masses, a massive gas atmosphere collapses ontothe solid core; (v) when the gas clumps reach the inner few au from the star,tidal shear and evaporation due to stellar irradiation peel off the outermetal-poor envelope of the clump. if tidal disruption occurs quickly, while thesystem is still in stage (iii), a terrestrial planet core is left. if ithappens later, in stage (iv), a metal rich gas giant planet with a solid coreemerges from the envelope.

1007.4162	grain sedimentation inside giant planet embryos	in the context of massive fragmenting protoplanetary discs, boss (1998)suggested that grains can grow and sediment inside giant planet embryos formedat r ~ 5 au away from the star. several authors since then criticised thesuggestion. convection may prevent grain sedimentation, and the embryos cannoteven form so close to the parent star as cooling is too inefficient at thesedistances. here we reconsider the grain sedimentation process suggested by boss(1998) but inside an embryo formed, as expected in the light of the coolingconstraints, at r ~ 100 au. such embryos are much less dense and are alsocooler. we make analytical estimates of the process and also perform simplespherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamics simulations to test these ideas.we find that convection in our models does not become important before asomewhat massive (~ an earth mass, this is clarified in a followup paper) solidcore is built. turbulent mixing slows down dust sedimentation but isoverwhelmed by grain sedimentation when the latter grow to a centimetres size.the minimum time required for dust sedimentation to occur is a few thousandyears, and is a strong function of the embryo's mass, dust content and opacity.an approximate analytical criterion is given to delineate conditions in which agiant embryo contracts and heats up faster than dust can sediment. as boss etal (2002), we argue that core formation through grain sedimentation inside thegiant planet embryos may yield an unexplored route to form giant gas and giantice planets. the present model also stands at the basis of paper iii, where westudy the possibility of forming terrestrial planet cores by tidal disruptionand photoevaporation of the planetary envelope.

1007.4165	formation of terrestrial planet cores inside giant planet embryos	giant planet embryos are believed to be spawned by gravitational instabilityin massive extended (r ~ 100 au) protostellar discs. in a recent paper we haveshown that dust can sediment inside the embryos, as argued earlier by boss(1998) in a slightly different model. here we study numerically the next stageof this process -- the formation of a solid core. if conditions are conduciveto solid core formation, the centre of the gas cloud goes through the followingsequence of phases: (i) becomes grain (and metal) rich; (ii) forms aterrestrial mass solid core via a rapid collapse driven by self-gravity of thegrains; (iii) starts to accrete a gaseous atmosphere when the solid corereaches mass of a few to 10 earth masses. this sequence of events may buildeither terrestrial planet cores or metal rich giant planets inside the largergas reservoir of the giant planet embryo. in a companion letter we argue thattidal and irradiation effects from the parent star should disrupt the outermetal poor layers of the embryo, releasing nearly "ready to use" planets. wepropose this as an alternative way to build planets.

1010.1489	a numerical simulation of a "super-earth" core delivery from ~ 100 au to  ~ 8 au	we use sph simulations with an approximate radiative cooling prescription tomodel evolution of a massive and large ($\sim 100$ au) very youngprotoplanetary disc. we also model dust growth and gas-grain dynamics with asecond fluid approach. it is found that the disc fragments onto a large numberof $\sim 10$ jupiter mass clumps that cool and contract slowly. some of theclumps evolve onto eccentric orbits delivering them into the inner tens of au,where they are disrupted by tidal forces from the star. dust grows andsediments inside the clumps, displaying a very strong segregation, with thelargest particles forming dense cores in the centres. the density of the dustcores may exceed that of the gas and is limited only by the numericalconstraints, indicating that these cores should collapse into rocky planetarycores. one particular giant planet embryo migrates inward close enough to bedisrupted at about 10 au, leaving a self-bound solid core of about 7.5$\mearth$ mass on a low eccentricity orbit at a radius of $\sim$ 8 au. thesesimulations support the recent suggestions that terrestrial and giant planetsmay be the remnants of tidally disrupted giant planet embryos.

1010.1632	rotation of the solar system planets and the origin of the moon in the  context of the tidal downsizing hypothesis	it has been proposed recently that the first step in the formation of bothrocky and gas giant planets is dust sedimentation into a solid core inside agas clump (giant planet embryo). the clumps are then assumed to migrate closerto the star where their metal poor envelopes are sheared away by the tidalforces or by an irradiation-driven mass loss. we consider the implications ofthis hypothesis for natal rotation rates of both terrestrial and gas giantplanets. it is found that both types of planets may rotate near their break upangular frequencies at birth. the direction of the spin should coincide withthat of the parent disc and the star, except in cases of embryos that had closeinteractions or mergers with other embryos in the past. furthermore, the largerepository of specific angular momentum at birth also allows formation of closebinary rocky planets inside the same embryos. we compare these predictions withrotation rates of planets in the solar system and also question whether theearth-moon pair could have been formed within the same giant planet embryo.

1101.1035	the tidal downsizing hypothesis for planet formation and the composition  of solar system comets	comets are believed to be born in the outer solar system where thetemperature is assumed to have never exceeded t ~ 100 k. surprisingly,observations and samples of cometary dust particles returned to earth showedthat they are in fact made of a mix of ices, as expected, but also of materialsforged at high-temperatures (t ~ 1500 k). we propose a radically new viewregarding the origin of the high-temperature processed materials in comets,based on the recent "tidal downsizing" (td) hypothesis for planet formation. inthe latter, the outer proto-planetary disc is gravitationally unstable andforms massive giant planet embryos (ges). these hot (t ~ hundreds to 2000 k)and dense regions, immersed in the background cold and low density disc, areeventually disrupted. we propose that both planets and the high-t materials incomets are synthesised inside the ges. disruption of ges separates planets andsmall solids as the latter are "frozen-in" into gas and are peeled off togetherwith it. these small solids are then mixed with the ambient cold disccontaining ices before being incorporated into comets. several predictions ofthis picture may be testable with future observations of the solar system andexoplanets.

1102.4297	hot super earths: tidally downsized hot jupiters? the hot jupiter around  the metal poor star explained	recent kepler observations revealed an unexpected abundance of "hot"earth-size to neptune-size planets in the inner ~0.02-0.2 au from their parentstars. another "oddity" of recent observations is the discovery of a hotjupiter planet around a very metal poor star of extragalactic origin.  we point out that these observations have natural explanations in theframework of the tidal downsizing hypothesis, a new and an alternative modelfor planet formation. we show that disassociation of molecular hydrogen leadsto the "second collapse" of the giant planet embryos. the collapse forms muchdenser fluid configurations, closely resembling isolated proto-giant planets onthe hayashi track before they enter the degenerate "main sequence" phase. wefind that, in the early gas-rich phase of proto-planetary discs, theseconfigurations migrate inward more rapidly than they contract. they aretherefore tidally disrupted at characteristic distance of ~ 0.05 -0.1 au fromtheir parent stars. the disruption is likely to leave solid cores behind, whichwe identify with the hot super-earths observed by kepler. in addition, we showthat single hot jupiters (also found by the kepler telescope) are notsurprising in the context of td hypothesis. finally, formation of corelessgiant planets by the second collapse of the giant embryos occurs for eithervery massive embryos (more than ~ 20 jupiter masses) or very metal poor ones.we suggest that this process explains the extra-galactic hot jupiter.

1103.1846	hot super earths: disrupted young jupiters?	recent {\em kepler} observations revealed an unexpected abundance of "hot"earth-size to neptune-size planets in the inner $0.02-0.2$ au from their parentstars. we propose that these smaller planets are the remnants of massive giantplanets that migrated inward quicker than they could contract. we show thatsuch disruptions naturally occur in the framework of the tidal downsizinghypothesis for planet formation. we find that the characteristic planet-starseparation at which such "hot disruptions" occur is $r \approx 0.03-0.2$ au.this result is independent of the planet's embryo mass but is dependent on theaccretion rate in the disc. at high accretion rates, $\dot m \simgt10^{-6}\msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryo is unable to contract quickly enough and isdisrupted. at late times, when the accretion rate drops to $\dot m \simlt10^{-8} \msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryos migrate sufficiently slow to not bedisrupted. these "late arrivals" may explain the well known population of hotjupiters. if type i migration regime is inefficient, then our model predicts apile-up of planets at $r\sim 0.1$ au as the migration rate suddenly switchesfrom the type ii to type i in that region.

1109.1217	are smbhs shrouded by "super-oort" clouds of comets and asteroids?	the last decade has seen a dramatic confirmation that an in situ starformation is possible inside the inner parsec of the milky way. here we suggestthat giant planets, solid terrestrial-like planets, comets and asteroids mayalso form in these environments, and that this may have observationalimplications for active galactic nuclei (agn). like in debris discs around mainsequence stars, collisions of large solid objects should initiate strongfragmentation cascades. the smallest particles in such a cascade - themicroscopic dust - may provide a significant opacity. we put a number ofobservational and physical constraints on agn obscuring torii resulting fromsuch fragmentation cascades. we find that torii fed by fragmenting asteroidsdisappear at both low and high agn luminosities. at high luminosities, $l \siml_{\rm edd}$, where $l_{\rm edd}$ is the eddington limit, the agn radiationpressure blows out the microscopic dust too rapidly. at low luminosities, onthe other hand, the agn discs may avoid gravitational fragmentation into starsand solids. we also note that these fragmentation cascades may be responsiblefor astrophysically "large" dust particles of approximately micrometer sizesthat were postulated by some authors to explain unusual absorption propertiesof the agn torii.

1110.6316	fu ori outbursts and the planet-disc mass exchange	it has been recently proposed that giant protoplanets migrating inwardthrough the disc more rapidly than they contract could be tidally disruptedwhen they fill their roche lobes ~ 0.1 au away from their parent protostars.here we consider the process of mass and angular momentum exchange between thetidally disrupted planet and the surrounding disc in detail. we find that theplanet's adiabatic mass-radius relation and its ability to open a deep gap inthe disc determine whether the disruption proceeds as a sudden runaway or abalanced quasi-static process. in the latter case the planet feeds the innerdisc through its lagrangian l1 point like a secondary star in a stellar binarysystem. as the planet loses mass it gains specific angular momentum andnormally migrates in the outward direction until the gap closes. numericalexperiments show that planet disruption outbursts are preceded by long"quiescent" periods during which the disc inward of the planet is empty. thehole in the disc is created when the planet opens a deep gap, letting the innerdisc to drain onto the star while keeping the outer one stalled behind theplanet. we find that the mass-losing planet embedded in a realisticprotoplanetary disc spawns an extremely rich set of variability patterns. in asubset of parameter space, there is a limit cycle behaviour caused bynon-linear interaction between the planet mass loss and the disc hydrogenionisation instability. we suggest that tidal disruptions of young massiveplanets near their stars may be responsible for the observed variability ofyoung accreting protostars such as fu ori, exor and t tauri stars in general.

1110.6872	sgr a* flares: tidal disruption of asteroids and planets?	it is theoretically expected that a supermassive black hole (smbh) in thecentre of a typical nearby galaxy disrupts a solar-type star every ~ 10^5years, resulting in a bright flare lasting for months. sgr a*, the residentsmbh of the milky way, produces (by comparison) tiny flares that last onlyhours but occur daily. here we explore the possibility that these flares couldbe produced by disruption of smaller bodies - asteroids. we show that asteroidspassing within an au of sgr a* could be split into smaller fragments which thenvaporise by bodily friction with the tenuous quiescent gas accretion flow ontosgr a*. the ensuing shocks and plasma instabilities may create a transientpopulation of very hot electrons invoked in several currently popular modelsfor sgr a* flares, thus producing the required spectra. we estimate thatasteroids larger than ~ 10 km in size are needed to power the observed flares,with the maximum possible luminosity of the order 10^39 erg s^-1. assuming thatthe asteroid population per parent star in the central parsec of the milky wayis not too dissimilar from that around stars in the solar neighbourhood, weestimate the asteroid disruption rates, and the distribution of the expectedluminosities, finding a reasonable agreement with the observations. we alsonote that planets may be tidally disrupted by sgr a* as well, also veryinfrequently. we speculate that one such disruption may explain the putativeincrease in sgr a* luminosity ~ 300 yr ago.

1202.4725	modelling supermassive black hole growth: towards an improved sub-grid  prescription	accretion onto supermassive black holes (smbhs) in galaxy formationsimulations is frequently modelled by the bondi-hoyle formalism. here weexamine the validity of this approach analytically and numerically. we arguethat the character of the flow where one evaluates the gas properties isunlikely to satisfy the simple bondi-hoyle model. only in the specific case ofhot virialised gas with zero angular momentum and negligible radiative coolingis the bondi-hoyle solution relevant. in the opposite extreme, where the gas isin a state of free-fall at the evaluation radius due to efficient cooling andthe dominant gravity of the surrounding halo, the bondi-hoyle formalism can beerroneous by orders of magnitude in either direction. this may imposeartificial trends with halo mass in cosmological simulations by being wrong bydifferent factors for different halo masses. we propose an expression for thesub-grid accretion rate which interpolates between the free-fall regime and thebondi-hoyle regime, therefore taking account of the contribution of the halo tothe gas dynamics.

1203.1182	an alternative origin for debris rings of planetesimals	core accretion, the most widely accepted scenario for planet formation,postulates existence of km-sized solid bodies, called planetesimals, arrangedin a razor-thin disc in the earliest phases of planet formation. in the tidaldownsizing hypothesis, an alternative scenario for formation of planets, graingrowth, sedimentation and formation of planetary cores occur inside dense andmassive gas clumps formed in the outer cold disc by gravitational instability.as a clump migrates inward, tidal forces of the star remove all or most of thegas from the clump, downsizing it to a planetary mass body. here we argue thatsuch a clump may form not only the planetary core but also numerous smallerbodies. as an example, we consider the simplest case of bodies on circularorbits around the planetary core in the centre of the gas clump. bodies smallerthan 1 km suffer a strong enough aerodynamic drag, spiral in and accrete ontothe solid core rapidly; bodies in the planetesimal size range lose theircentrifugal support very slowly. we find that planetesimals orbiting theprotoplanetary core closely remain gravitationally bound to it; these may berelevant to formation of satellites of giant planets. planetesimals on moredistant orbits within the host clump are unbound from the protoplanet and areset on mildly eccentric heliocentric orbits, generically forming wide rings.these may correspond to debris discs around main sequence stars and the kuiperbelt in the solar system. for the latter in particular, our hypothesisnaturally explains the observed sharp outer edge and the "mass deficit" of thekuiper belt.

1203.3060	fermi bubbles in the milky way: the closest agn feedback laboratory  courtesy of sgr a*?	deposition of a massive ($10^4$ to $10^5 \msun$) giant molecular cloud (gmc)into the inner parsec of the galaxy is widely believed to explain the origin ofover a hundred unusually massive young stars born there $\sim 6$ myr ago. anunknown fraction of that gas could have been accreted by sgr a*, thesupermassive black hole (smbh) of the milky way. it has been recently suggestedthat two observed $\gamma$-ray-emitting bubbles emanating from the very centerof our galaxy were inflated by this putative activity of sgr a*. we run a suiteof numerical simulations to test whether the observed morphology of the bubblescould be due to the collimation of a wide angle outflow from sgr a* by thedisc-like central molecular zone (cmz), a well known massive repository ofmolecular gas in the central $\sim 200$ pc. we find that an eddington-limitedoutburst of sgr a* lasting $\simeq 1$ myr is required to reproduce themorphology of the {\it fermi} bubbles, suggesting that the gmc mass was $\sim10^5 \msun$ and it was mainly accreted by sgr a* rather than used to makestars. we also find that the outflow from sgr a* enforces strong angularmomentum mixing in the cmz disc, robustly sculpting it into a much narrowerstructure -- a ring -- perhaps synonymous with the recently reported "herschelring". in addition, we find that sgr a* outflow is likely to have inducedformation of massive star-forming gmcs in the cmz. in this scenario, the archesand quintuplet clusters, the two observed young star clusters in the centraltens of parsecs of the galaxy, and also gmcs such as sgr b2, owe theirexistence to the recent sgr a* activity.

1203.3450	the observed $m - \sigma$ relations imply that smbhs grow by cold  chaotic accretion	we argue that current observations of $m - \sigma$ relations for galaxies canbe used to constrain theories of super-massive black holes (smbh) feeding. inparticular, assuming that smbh mass is limited only by the feedback on the gasthat feeds it, we show that smbhs fed via a planar galaxy scale gas flow, suchas a disc or a bar, should be much more massive than their counterparts fed byquasi-spherical inflows. this follows from the relative inefficiency of agnfeedback on a flattened inflow. we find that even under the most optimisticconditions for smbh feedback on flattened inflows, the mass at which the smbhexpels the gas disc and terminates its own growth is a factor of several higherthan the one established for quasi-spherical inflows. any beaming of feedbackaway from the disc and any disc self-shadowing strengthens this result further.contrary to this theoretical expectation, recent observations have shown thatsmbh in pseudobulge galaxies (which are associated with barred galaxies) aretypically under- rather than over-massive when compared with their classicalbulge counterparts at a fixed value of $\sigma$. we conclude from this thatsmbhs are not fed by large (100 pc to many kpc) scale gas discs or bars, mostlikely because such planar flows are turned into stars too efficiently to allowany smbh growth. based on this and other related observational evidence, weargue that most smbhs grow by chaotic accretion of gas clouds with a small andnearly randomly distributed direction of angular momentum.

1207.7200	quasar feedback: accelerated star formation and chaotic accretion	growing supermassive black holes (smbh) are believed to influence theirparent galaxies in a negative way, terminating their growth by ejecting gas outbefore it could turn into stars. here we present some of the most sophisticatedsmbh feedback simulations to date showing that quasar's effects on galaxies arenot always negative. we find that when the ambient shocked gas cools rapidly,the shocked gas is compressed into thin cold dense shells, filaments andclumps. driving these high density features out is much more difficult thananalytical models predict since dense filaments are resilient to the feedback.however, in this regime quasars have another way of affecting the host -- bytriggering a massive star formation burst in the cold gas by over-pressurisingit. under these conditions smbhs actually accelerate star formation in thehost, having a positive rather than negative effect on their host galaxies. therelationship between smbh and galaxies is thus even more complex and symbioticthan currently believed. we also suggest that the instabilities found here mayencourage the chaotic agn feeding mode.

1302.0999	outflows of stars due to quasar feedback	quasar feedback outflows are commonly invoked to drive gas out of galaxies inthe early gas-rich epoch to terminate growth of galaxies. here we presentsimulations that show that agn feedback may drive not only gas but also starsout of their host galaxies under certain conditions. the mechanics of thisprocess is as following: (1) agn-driven outflows accelerate and compress gasfilling the host galaxy; (2) the accelerated dense shells becomegravitationally unstable and form stars on radial trajectories. for thespherically symmetric initial conditions explored here, the black hole needs toexceed the host's m_sigma mass by a factor of a few to accelerate the shellsand the new stars to escape velocities. we discuss potential implications ofthese effects for the host galaxies: (i) radial mixing of bulge stars with therest of the host; (ii) contribution of quasar outflows to galactic fountains assources of high-velocity clouds; (iii) wholesale ejection of hyper velocitystars out of their hosts, giving rise to type ii supernovae on galacticoutskirts, and contributing to reionization and metal enrichment of theuniverse; (iv) bulge erosion and even complete destruction in extreme casesresulting in overweight or bulgeless smbhs.

1302.1389	hydrogen-loosing planets in transition discs around young protostars	we point out that protoplanets created in the framework of the tidaldownsizing (td) theory for planet formation play a very important role for theevolution of accretion discs hosting them. since all td protoplanets areinitially as massive as $\sim 10$ jupiter masses, they are able to open verydeep gaps in their discs, and even completely isolate the inner disc flows fromthe outer ones. furthermore, in contrast to other planet formation theories, tdprotoplanets are mass donors for their protostars. one potentially observablesignature of planets being devoured by their protostars are fu ori likeoutbursts, and episodic protostar accretion more generally, as discussed by anumber of authors recently.  here we explore another observational implication of td hypothesis: dust poorinner accretion flows, which we believe may be relevant to some of the observedmm-bright transitional discs around protostars. in our model, a massiveprotoplanet interrupts the flow of the outer dust-rich disc on its protostar,and at the same time looses a part of its dust-poor envelope into the innerdisc. this then powers the observed gas-but-no-dust accretion onto the star.upon a more detailed investigation, we find that this scenario is quite naturalfor young massive discs but is less so for older discs, e.g., those whoseself-gravitating phase has terminated a fraction of a million year or more ago.this stems from the fact that td protoplanets of such an age should havecontracted significantly, and so are unlikely to loose much mass. therefore, weconclude that either (i) the population of "transition discs" with large holesand dust-poor accretion is much younger than generally believed; or (ii) thereis a poorly understood stage for late removal of dust-poor envelopes from tdplanets; (iii) another explanation for the observations is correct.

1306.0684	agn outflows trigger starbursts in gas-rich galaxies	recent well resolved numerical simulations of agn feedback have shown thatits effects on the host galaxy may be not only negative but also positive. inthe late gas poor phase, agn feedback blows the gas away and terminates starformation. however, in the gas-rich phase(s), agn outflows trigger starformation by over-compressing cold dense gas and thus provide positive feedbackon their hosts. in this paper we study this agn-triggered starburst effect. weshow that star formation rate in the burst increases until the star formationfeedback counteracts locally the agn outflow compression. globally, thispredicts a strong nearly linear statistical correlation between the agn andstarburst bolometric luminosities in disc galaxies, l_* \propto l_{agn}^{5/6}.the correlation is statistical only because agn activity may fluctuate on shorttime scales (as short as tens of years), and because agn may turn off but itseffects on the host may continue to last until the agn-driven outflow leavesthe host, which may be up to 10 times longer than the duration of the agnactivity. the coefficient in front of this relation depends on the clumpinessand morphology of the cold gas in the galaxy. a "maximum starburst" takes placein am azimuthally uniform gas disc, for which we derive an upper limit of l_*\sim 50 times larger than l_{agn} for typical quasars. for more clumpy and/orcompact cold gas distributions, the starburst luminosity decreases. we alsosuggest that similar agn-triggerred starbursts are possible in hosts of allgeometries, including during galaxy mergers, provided the agn is activated.finally, we note that due to the short duration of the agn activity phase theaccelerating influence of agn on starbursts may be much more common thanobservations of simultaneous agn and starbursts would suggest.

1306.2636	inverse compton x-ray signature of agn feedback	bright agn frequently show ultra-fast outflows (ufos) with outflow velocitiesvout ~0.1c. these outflows may be the source of agn feedback on their hostgalaxies sought by galaxy formation modellers. the exact effect of the outflowson the ambient galaxy gas strongly depends on whether the shocked ufos coolrapidly or not. this in turn depends on whether the shocked electrons share thesame temperature as ions (one temperature regime; 1t) or decouple (2t), as hasbeen recently suggested. here we calculate the inverse compton spectrum emittedby such shocks, finding a broad feature potentially detectable either inmid-to-high energy x-rays (1t case) or only in the soft x-rays (2t). we arguethat current observations of agn do not seem to show evidence for the 1tcomponent. the limits on the 2t emission are far weaker, and in fact it ispossible that the observed soft x-ray excess of agn is partially or fully dueto the 2t shock emission. this suggests that ufos are in the energy-drivenregime outside the central few pc, and must pump considerable amounts of notonly momentum but also energy into the ambient gas. we encourage x-rayobservers to look for the inverse compton components calculated here in orderto constrain agn feedback models further.

1306.4924	radiative feedback from protoplanets in self-gravitating protoplanetary  discs	it is well known that massive protoplanetary disc are gravitationallyunstable beyond tens of au from their parent star. the eventual fate of theself-gravitating gas clumps born in the disc is currently not understood,although the range of uncertainty is well known. if clumps migrate inwardrapidly, they are tidally disrupted, which may leave behind giant orterrestrial like planets. on the other hand, if clumps migrate less rapidly,they tend to accrete gas, becoming proto brown dwarfs or low mass companions tothe parent star. here we argue that radiative feedback of contracting clumps(protoplanets) on their discs is an important effect that has been overlookedin previous calculations. we show analytically that temperature in clump'svicinity may be high enough to support a quasi-static atmosphere if the clumpmass is below a critical value, $m_{\rm cr} \sim 6$ jupiter masses ($m_j$).this may arrest further gas accretion onto the clump and thus promote formationof planets rather than low mass companions. we use numerical simulations toevaluate these analytical conclusions by studying migration and accretion ofgas clumps as a function of their initial mass, $m_i$. simulations neglectingthe radiative preheating effect show that gas clumps with mass less than $\sim2 m_j$ migrate inward rapidly; more massive clumps result in low masscompanions. in contrast, simulations that include radiative preheating from theclump show that clumps as massive as $8 m_j$ migrate inward rapidly and end uptidally disrupted in the inner disc. we conclude that, with other parametersbeing equal, previous simulations neglecting radiative feedback fromself-gravitating clumps over-estimated the population of brown dwarfs and lowmass stellar companions and under-estimated the population of planets.

1306.4929	a link between feedback outflows and satellite galaxy suppression	we suggest a direct link between the two "missing" baryon problems ofcontemporary galaxy formation theory: (1) that large galaxies are known tocontain too little gas and stars and (2) that too few dwarf satellite galaxiesare observed around large galaxies compared with cosmological simulations. theformer can be explained by invoking some energetic process -- most likely agnor star formation feedback -- which expels to infinity a significant fractionof the gas initially present in the proto-galaxy, while the latter problem isusually explained by star formation feedback inside the dwarf or tidal and rampressure stripping of the gas from the satellite galaxy by its parent. here wepoint out that the host galaxy "missing" baryons, if indeed ejected atvelocities of hundreds to a thousand km s$^{-1}$, must also affect smallersatellite galaxies by stripping or shocking the gas there. we estimate thefraction of gas removed from the satellites as a function of the satellitegalaxy's properties. applying these results to a milky way like dark matterhalo, we find that this singular shock ram pressure stripping event may bequite efficient in removing the gas from the satellites provided that they areclose enough. we also use the orbital and mass modelling data for eightgalactic dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellites, and find that it is likely thatmany of them have been affected by the galactic outflow. we point out thatgalactic outflows of the host may also trigger a starburst in the satellitegalaxies by over-pressuring their gas discs. this process may be responsiblefor the formation of the globular clusters observed in some of the milky way'sdsphs (e.g. the fornax and sagittarius dsphs).

0705.0769	variable accretion and emission from the stellar winds in the galactic  centre	we present numerical simulations of stellar wind dynamics in the centralparsec of the galactic centre, studying in particular the accretion of gas onto sgr a*, the super-massive black hole. unlike our previous work, here we usestate-of-the-art observational data on orbits and wind properties of individualwind-producing stars. since wind velocities were revised upwards and non-zeroeccentricities were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of coldgas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. the accretion rate is dominated bya few close `slow wind stars' v_w &lt; 750 km/s, and is consistent with the bondiestimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. thisvariability is due to the stochastic in-fall of cold clumps of gas, as inearlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars. the present modelsfail to explain the high luminosity of sgr a* a few hundred years ago impliedby integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump witha small impact parameter could have caused it. finally, we show the possibilityof constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow wind stars' using nearinfra-red observations of gas in the central few arcseconds.

1311.4492	two-phase model for black hole feeding and feedback	we study effects of agn feedback outflows on multi-phase inter stellar medium(ism) of the host galaxy. we argue that smbh growth is dominated by accretionof dense cold clumps and filaments. agn feedback outflows overtake the coldmedium, compress it, and trigger a powerful starburst -- a positive agnfeedback. this predicts a statistical correlation between agn luminosity andstar formation rate at high luminosities. most of the outflow's kinetic energyescapes from the bulge via low density voids. the cold phase is pushed outwardonly by the ram pressure (momentum) of the outflow. the combination of thenegative and positive forms of agn feedback leads to an $m-\sigma$ relationsimilar to the result of king (2003). due to porosity of cold ism in the bulge,smbh influence on the low density medium of the host galaxy is significant evenfor smbh well below the $m-\sigma$ mass. the role of smbh feedback in our modelevolves in space and time with the ism structure. in the early gas rich phase,smbh accelerates star formation in the bulge. during later gas poor(red-and-dead) phases, smbh feedback is mostly negative everywhere due toscarcity of the cold ism.

1403.1813	core-assisted gas capture instability: a new mode of giant planet  formation by gravitationally unstable discs	giant planet formation in the core accretion (ca) paradigm is predicated bythe formation of a core, assembled by the coagulation of grains and later byplanetesimals within a protoplanetary disc. in contrast, in the discinstability paradigm, giant planet formation is believed to be independent ofcore formation: massive self-gravitating gas fragments cool radiatively andcollapse as a whole. we show that giant planet formation in the discinstability model may be also enhanced by core formation for reasons physicallyvery similar to the ca paradigm. in the model explored here, efficient grainsedimentation within an initial fragment (rather than the disc) leads to theformation of a core composed of heavy elements. we find that massiveatmospheres form around cores and undergo collapse as a critical core mass isexceeded, analogous to ca theory. the critical mass of the core to initiatesuch a collapse depends on the fragment mass and metallicity, as well as coreluminosity, but ranges from less than 1 to as much as $\sim80$ earth masses. wetherefore suggest that there are two channels for the collapse of a gaseousfragment to planetary scales within the disc instability model: (i) h$_2$dissociative collapse of the entire gaseous clump, and (ii) core-assisted gascapture, as presented here. we suggest that the first of these two is favouredin metal-poor environments and for fragments more massive than $\sim 5-10$jupiter masses, whereas the second is favored in metal-rich environments andfragments of lower mass.

1403.3933	energy- and momentum-conserving agn feedback outflows	it is usually assumed that outflows from luminous agn are either in theenergy-conserving (non-radiative) or in the momentum-conserving (radiative)regime. we show that in a non-spherical geometry the effects of both regimesmay manifest at the same time, and that it is the momentum of the outflow thatsets the $m_{\rm bh}-\sigma$ relation. considering an initially ellipticaldistribution of gas in the host galaxy, we show that a non-radiative outflowopens up a wide ``escape route'' over the paths of least resistance. most ofthe outflow energy escapes in that direction. at the same time, in thedirections of higher resistance, the ambient gas is affected mainly by theincident momentum from the outflow. quenching smbh growth requires quenchinggas delivery along the paths of highest resistance, and therefore, it is themomentum of the outflow that limits the black hole growth. we present ananalytical argument showing that such energy-conserving feedback bubblesdriving leaky ambient shells will terminate smbh growth once its mass reachesroughly the $m_\sigma$ mass derived earlier by king (2003) formomentum-conserving agn outflows. our simulations also have potentiallyimportant implications for observations of agn jet feedback and starburstgalaxy feedback. the collimation of the wide angle agn outflow away from thesymmetry plane, as found in our simulations, indicates that credit for workdone by such outflows may sometimes be mistakenly given to agn jets or starformation feedback since wide angle $v \sim 0.1 c$ outflows are harder toobserve and the phase when they are present may be short.

1405.5647	black hole feedback in a multiphase interstellar medium	ultrafast outflows (ufos) from supermassive black holes (smbhs) are thoughtto regulate the growth of smbhs and host galaxies, resulting in a number ofobservational correlations. we present high-resolution numerical simulations ofthe impact of a thermalized ufo on the ambient gas in the inner part of thehost galaxy. our results depend strongly on whether the gas is homogeneous orclumpy. in the former case all of the ambient gas is driven outward rapidly asexpected based on commonly used energy budget arguments, while in the latterthe flows of mass and energy decouple. carrying most of the energy, the shockedufo escapes from the bulge via paths of least resistance, taking with it onlythe low-density phase of the host. most of the mass is however in thehigh-density phase, and is affected by the ufo much less strongly, and may evencontinue to flow inwards. we suggest that the ufo energy leakage through thepores in the multiphase interstellar medium (ism) may explain why observedsmbhs are so massive despite their overwhelmingly large energy productionrates. the multiphase ism effects reported here are probably under-resolved incosmological simulations but may be included in prescriptions for activegalactic nuclei feedback in future simulations and in semi-analytical models.

0705.1686	forced accretion in stochastically fed agn and quasars	steady state accretion discs larger than ~ 0.01-0.1 pc are known to begravitationally unstable for the accretion rates needed to explainsuper-massive black hole (smbh) activity. we propose that smbh are fed by asuccession of mass deposition events with randomly directed angular momenta.because of incomplete angular momentum cancellation a warped accretion discforms in the inner few parsec. the orientation of the disc performs a randomwalk. deposition of new material promotes smbh accretion at rates much fasterthan viscous. observational implications of this picture include: (i) lighteraccretion discs that can fuel agn and quasars and yet avoid star formation at r&gt;&gt; 0.1 pc; (ii) star formation inside the disc is not a function of massaccretion rate only. it can take place at high or low accretion rates, e.g.,when too few clouds arrive in the inner region. an example of this might be thecentral parsec of our galaxy. (iii) the discs can form compton-thick obscuringstructures of ~ parsec size as required in agn unification models; (iv) fasterblack hole growth resulting from misalignment of the disc and the black holespin in the early universe; (v) isotropic deposition of smbh energy andmomentum feedback in the galaxy bulge. this may help explain the highefficiency with which it seems to be operating in the universe. (vi) nocorrelation between smbh activity and the presence of kiloparsec scale bars orgaseous discs in galactic bulges; (vii) bodily collisions between gaseouscomponents of merging galaxies facilitate production of gas streams feeding thecentre of the combined galaxy. mergers should thus be catalysts of smbh growth.(viii) conversely, galaxies experiencing fewer mergers are more likely to formmassive nuclear star clusters than feed their smbhs.

1411.5261	metal loading of giant gas planets	one of many challenges in forming giant gas planets via gravitational discinstability model (gi) is an inefficient radiative cooling of the pre-collapsefragments. since fragment contraction times are as long at $10^5 -10^7$ years,the fragments may be tidally destroyed sooner than they contract into gas giantplanets. here we explore the role of "pebble accretion" onto the pre-collapsegiant planets and find an unexpected result. despite larger dust opacity athigher metallicities, addition of metals actually accelerates -- rather thanslows down -- collapse of high opacity, relatively low mass giant gas planets($m_p$ below a few jupiter masses). a simple analytical theory that explainsthis result exactly in idealised simplified cases is presented. the theoryshows that planets with the central temperature in the range between $\sim$1000 to 2000k are especially sensitive to pebble accretion: addition of just$\sim 5$ to 10 % of metals by weight is sufficient to cause their collapse.these results show that dust grain physics and dynamics is essential for anaccurate modelling of self-gravitating disc fragments and their nearenvironments in the outer massive and cold protoplanetary discs.

1411.5264	tidal downsizing model. i. numerical methods: saving giant planets from  tidal disruptions	tidal downsizing (td) is a recently developed planet formation theory thatsupplements the classical gravitational disc instability (gi) model with planetmigration inward and tidal disruptions of gi fragments in the inner regions ofthe disc. numerical methods for a detailed population synthesis of td planetsare presented here. as an example application, the conditions under which gifragments collapse faster than they migrate into the inner $a\sim$ few au discare considered. it is found that most gas fragments are tidally or thermallydisrupted unless (a) their opacity is $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude less thanthe interstellar dust opacity at metallicities typical of the observed giantplanets, or (b) the opacity is high but the fragments accrete large dust grains(pebbles) from the disc. case (a) models produce very low mass solid cores($m_{\rm core} &lt; 0.1$ earth masses) and follow a negative correlation of giantplanet frequency with host star metallicity. in contrast, case (b) modelsproduce massive solid cores, correlate positively with host metallicity andexplain naturally while giant gas planets are over-abundant in metals.

1502.07585	tidal downsizing model. ii. planet-metallicity correlations	core accretion (ca), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation,requires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gasgiant planets. the observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzlingin the context of ca. while gas giant planets are found preferentially aroundmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than neptune orbit hosts with a widerange of metallicities. we propose an alternative interpretation of theseobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formationhypothesis called tidal downsizing (td). we perform population synthesiscalculations based on td, and find that the connection between the populationsof the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear andnot even monotonic. while gas giant planets formed in the simulations in theinner few au region follow a strong positive correlation with the host starmetallicity, the smaller planets do not. the simulated population of thesesmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at aroundthe solar metallicity. this result is driven by the fact that at lowmetallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,whereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores growcontract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. finally,simulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicitypreference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best knowndirectly imaged gas giant planet systems, hr 8799, is metal poor.

1503.02745	the role of feedback in accretion on low luminosity agn: sgr a* case  study	we present numerical models of the gas dynamics in the inner parsec of thegalactic centre. we follow the gas from its origin as stellar winds of severalobserved young massive stars, until it is either captured by the central blackhole, or leaves the system. unlike our previous models, we include an outflowfrom the inner accretion flow. two different kinds of outflows are modelled:(i) an instantaneous-response feedback mode, in which the outflow rate isdirectly proportional to the current black hole gas capture rate; and (ii) anoutburst mode, which is stronger but lasts for a limited time. the lattersituation may be particularly relevant to sgr a*, since there is evidence thatsgr a* was much brighter in the recent past. we find that both types of outflowperturb the gas dynamics near the bondi radius and the black hole capture ratesignificantly. the effects persist longer than the outflow itself. we alsocompare the effects of spherically symmetric and collimated outflows, and findthat the latter are far less efficient in transferring its energy to thesurrounding gas near the capture radius. our results imply that accretionfeedback is important for non-radiative accretion flows not only within butalso outside the capture radius. steady-state bondi accretion rate estimatesthat do not account for feedback outflows over-predict not only the accretionrate onto the black hole but also the capture rate at the bondi radius itself.finally, the steady-state assumption under which non-radiative flows have beenroutinely studied in the literature may have to be abandoned if accretionfeedback is bursty in nature.

1507.08283	the resolution bias: low resolution feedback simulations are better at  destroying galaxies	feedback from super-massive black holes (smbhs) is thought to play a key rolein regulating the growth of host galaxies. cosmological and galaxy formationsimulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph), which usually use afixed mass for sph particles, often employ the same sub-grid active galacticnuclei (agn) feedback prescription across a range of resolutions. it is thusimportant to ask how the impact of the simulated agn feedback on a galaxychanges when only the numerical resolution (the sph particle mass) changes. wepresent a suite of simulations modelling the interaction of an agn outflow withthe ambient turbulent and clumpy interstellar medium (ism) in the inner part ofthe host galaxy at a range of mass resolutions. we find that, with other thingsbeing equal, degrading the resolution leads to feedback becoming more efficientat clearing out all gas in its path. for the simulations presented here, thedifference in the mass of the gas ejected by agn feedback varies by more than afactor of ten between our highest and lowest resolution simulations. thishappens because feedback-resistant high density clumps are washed out at loweffective resolutions. we also find that changes in numerical resolution leadto undesirable artifacts in how the agn feedback affects the agn immediateenvironment.

1512.05712	a simple way to improve agn feedback prescription in sph simulations	agn feedback is an important ingredient in galaxy evolution, however itstreatment in numerical simulations is necessarily approximate, requiringsubgrid prescriptions due to the dynamical range involved in the calculations.we present a suite of sph simulations designed to showcase the importance ofthe choice of a particular subgrid prescription for agn feedback. weconcentrate on two approaches to treating wide-angle agn outflows: thermalfeedback, where thermal and kinetic energy is injected into the gas surroundingthe smbh particle, and virtual particle feedback, where energy is carried bytracer particles radially away from the agn. we show that the latter modelproduces a far more complex structure around the smbh, which we argue is a morephysically correct outcome. we suggest a simple improvement to the thermalfeedback model - injecting the energy into a cone, rather than sphericallysymmetrically - and show that this markedly improves the agreement between thetwo prescriptions, without requiring any noticeable increase in thecomputational cost of the simulation.

astro-ph;0005597	accretion disk models and their x-ray reflection signatures. i. local  spectra	x-ray illumination of accretion disks is an invaluable diagnostic of thestructure of these disks because of the associated iron k$\alpha$ emission.here we point out that the resulting reflected spectra depend very sensitivelyon the geometry of the x-ray source, and that this fact can be efficiently usedto test these models observationally. in particular, we discuss three differentaccretion disk geometries: the ``lamppost model'', accretion disks withmagnetic flares, and the model with a full corona overlying a cold thin disk.we show that in the case of the lamppost model, unless the x-ray luminosity ofthe central source is larger than that of the cold disk by a factor of 10 ormore, a significant fraction of iron in the ionized skin of the disk is in thehydrogen and helium-like ions. because these ions have large fluorescenceyields, the resulting reflected spectra look strongly ionized, with equivalentwidth (ew) of the line {\em increasing} with x-ray luminosity $l_x$ up to themaximum of $\sim 500$ ev. this situation contrasts to the magnetic flare model,where the large x-ray flux near flares completely ionizes the skin of the diskand thus the resulting spectra appear to be that from a neutral material. theline ew in this model {\em anti-correlates} with x-ray luminosity, and becomesarbitrarily small when $l_x$ is a good fraction of the eddington luminosity.finally, in the full corona case, due to the additional pressure and weight ofthe corona, the gas pressure (and its density) below the corona is always largeenough to make the gas very cool and effectively neutral. no highly ionizedskin forms in such a model. if the corona is thomson thin, then ew of the linedoes not depend on the accretion disk or corona luminosities for the fullcorona model.

astro-ph;0005603	ionization physics evidence for magnetic flare origin of x-rays in agn	we present full disk x-ray reflection spectra for two currently popularaccretion flow geometries for agn -- the lamppost model frequently used todiscuss the iron line reverberation in agn, and the model where the x-rays areproduced in magnetic flares above a cold accretion disk (ad). the lamppostspectra contain several spectroscopic features characteristic of highly ionizedmaterial that are not seen in the x-ray spectra of most agn. the magnetic flaremodel, on the other hand, produces reflected spectra that are roughly asuper-position of a power-law and a {\em neutral-like} reflection and ironk$\alpha$ line, and are thus more in line with typical agn x-ray spectra.furthermore, because of the difference in the ionization structure of theilluminated material in the two models, the line equivalent width increaseswith the x-ray luminosity, $l_x$, for the lamppost, and decreases with $l_x$for the flare model. in light of these theoretical insights, recent iron linereverberation studies of agn, the x-ray baldwin effect, and the general lack ofx-ray reflection features in distant quasars all suggest that, for highaccretion rates, the cold accretion disk is covered by a thomson thick,completely ionized skin. because the latter is only possible when the x-raysare concentrated to small emitting regions, we believe that this presents astrong evidence for the magnetic flare origin of x-rays in agn.

astro-ph;0106450	on time-dependent x-ray reflection by photoionized accretion disks:  implication for fe k-alpha line reverberation studies of agn	we perform a first study of time-dependent x-ray reflection in photo-ionizedaccretion disks. we assume a step-functional change in the x-ray flux and use asimplified prescription to describe the time evolution of the illuminated gasdensity profile in response to changes in the flux. we find that the dynamicaltime for re-adjustment of the hydrostatic balance is an important relaxationtime scale of the problem since it affects evolution of the ionization state ofthe reflector. because of this the fe k-alpha line emissivity depends on theshape and intensity of the illuminating flux in prior times, and hence it isnot a function of the instantaneous illuminating spectrum. moreover, during thetransition, a prominent helium-like component of the fe k-alpha line mayappear. as a result, the line flux may appear to be completely uncorrelatedwith x-ray continuum flux on time scales shorter than the dynamical time. inaddition, the time-dependence of the illuminating flux may leave imprints evenon the time-averaged line spectra, which may be used as an additional test ofaccretion disk geometry. our findings appear to be important for the proposedfe k-alpha line reverberation studies in lamppost-like geometries for accretionrates exceeding about $\sim 1%$ of the eddington value. however, most agn donot show helium-like lines that are prominent in such models, probablyindicating that these models are not applicable to real sources.

astro-ph;0302420	the frozen (inactive) disk in sgr a: freezing the accretion of the hot  gas too?	the black hole in our galactic center is extremely underluminous for theamount of hot gas available for accretion. theoretical understanding of thisfact rests on a likely but not entirely certain assumption that the electronsin the accreting gas are much cooler than the protons. in this case the hot gasas a whole is too hot to accrete, and is too tenous to radiate away itsgravitational energy. here we propose a drastically different picture of theaccretion process in sgr a* not based on the unchecked two-temperatureassumption. namely, we argue that there should exist a very cold inactive disk-- a remnant of a past stronger accretion activity in sgr a*. such a disk wouldbe a very efficient cooling surface for the hot flow. we show that undercertain conditions the cooling due to thermal conduction cannot be balanced bythe viscous heating in the hot flow. along with the heat, the hot flow losesits viscosity and thus ability to accrete. it settles (condences) onto the colddisk slighlty inside of the circularization radius. if the latter is verylarge, then the liberated energy, and the luminosity emitted, is orders ofmagnitude less than naively expected. we build a simple analytical model forthis flow and calculate the expected spectra that appear to be in a veryreasonble agreement with observations. strong additional support for thepresence of the inactive disk comes from the recent observations of x-rayflares in sgr a*. the properties of these flares are very similar to thoseproduced by stars passing through a cold disk.

astro-ph;0304126	x-ray flares from sgr a*: star-disk interactions?	sgr a*, the putative black hole in our galactic center (gc), is extraordinarydim in all frequencies. apparently the black hole is unable to accrete at thebondi accretion rate for some reason. another mystery of sgr a* is the recentlydiscovered large magnitude and short duration x-ray flares (baganoff et al.2001). here we point out that x-ray flares should be expected from starpassages through an inactive (i.e. formerly accreting) disk. there arethousands of stars in sgr a* stellar cluster, and each star will pass throughthe disk twice per orbit. a shock hot enough to emit x-rays is formed aroundthe star when the latter is inside the disk. we develop a simple yet somewhatdetailed model for the x-ray emission from the shock. the duration of theflares, their x-ray spectra, frequency of events, and weakness of emission inthe radio and near infra-red appear to be consistent with the availableobservations of x-ray flares. we therefore suggest that at least a fraction ofthe observed flares is due to the star-disk passages. such star-disk flares arealso of interest in the nuclei of nearby inactive galaxies, especially inconnection with perspective constellation-x and xeus x-ray missions.

astro-ph;0304533	bright stars and an inactive disk in sgr a* and other dormant galaxy  centers. i. the optically thick disk	cold inactive disks are believed to exist in low luminosity agn (llagn). theymay also exist in the nuclei of inactive galaxies and in the center of our owngalaxy. these disks would then be embedded in the observed dense nuclearstellar clusters. making the simplest assumption of an optically thick disk, weexplore several ways to detect the disk presence through its interaction withthe cluster. first of these is the eclipses of close bright stars by the disk.the second is the increase in the infrared flux of the disk due to illuminationof its surface by such stars during close passages. finally the surfacebrightness of the star cluster should show an anisotropy that depends on theinclination angle of the disk. we apply the first two of the methods to sgr a*,the super massive black hole in our galactic center. using the orbitalparameters of the close star s2, we strongly rule out a disk optically thick inthe near infrared unless it has a relatively large inner hole. for disks withno inner holes, we estimate that the data permit a disk with infrared opticaldepth no larger than about 0.01. such a disk could also be responsible for thedetected 3.8 microns excess in the spectrum of s2. the constraints on the diskthat we obtain here can be reconciled with the disk parameters needed toexplain the observed x-ray flares if dust particles in the disk have sizesgreater than ~ 30 microns. the destruction of small dust particles by strong uvheating and shocks from star passages through the disk, and grain growth during"quiescent" times, are mentioned as possible mechanisms of creating the unusualgrain size distribution.

astro-ph;0402469	feeding the black hole with condensing accretion flows: radiatively  efficient and radiatively inefficient cases	we study the accretion flow of a hot gas captured by the black hole gravityin the presence of a thin cold accretion disk. such geometrical arrangement isexpected in active galactic nuclei (agn) and in galactic x-ray binary systemsbecause both hot and cold gases are present in the black hole vicinity.previous astrophysical literature concentrated on the evaporation of the colddisk in the classical heat conduction limit. here we consider the inverseprocess, i.e. condensation of the hot gas onto the cold disk. we find twodistinct condensation regimes. (i) in the classical thermal conduction limit,the radiative cooling in the hot gas itself force condensation above a certaincritical accretion rate. most of the flow energy in this case is re-emitted asx-ray radiation. (ii) below a certain minimum accretion rate, the hot electronsare collisionless and the classical heat flux description becomes invalid. weuse the ``non-local'' heat flux approach borrowed from the terrestrial laserheated plasma experiments. due to their very large mean free path, the hotparticles penetrate deep into the cold disk where the radiative losses aresignificant enough to enable condensation. in this case the hot flow energy isinconspicuously re-radiated by the transition layer in many uv and especiallyoptical recombination lines (e.g., ly$\alpha$, $h\alpha$, h$\beta$) as well asvia the optically thick disk emission. we derive an approximate analyticalsolution for the dynamics of the hot condensing flow. if the cold disk isinactive, i.e. accumulating mass for a future accretion outburst, then thetwo-phase flows appear radiatively inefficient. these condensing solutions maybe relevant to \sgra, low luminosity agn, and transient binary accretingsystems in quiescence.

astro-ph;0403158	close stars and accretion in low luminosity active galactic nuclei	quasar accretion disks are believed to form stars by self-gravity. lowluminosity active galactic nuclei (llagn) are much dimmer galactic centers, andare often believed to be quasars that ran out of gaseous fuel. llagn accretiondisks should thus co-exist with thousands to millions of stars or proto-starsleft from the previous stronger accretion activity. in principle, these starsmay produce several important effects: (i) contribute to the optical/uv spectraof some llagn; (ii) reprocessing of the stellar radiation in the dusty diskscould dominate the llagn infra-red spectra; (iii) deplete the (accretion) gasdisk much faster than it can accrete onto the supper-massive black hole (smbh);(iv) stars, individually or in groups, may slow down and modulate the accretionflow significantly due to their inertia. in this way they may produce the llagncut-off disks; (v) alternatively, frequent enough stellar collisions andresulting stellar disruptions could keep the inner disk empty. here we explorethese ideas. we find that, despite ``low'' luminosities of llagn,unrealistically high stellar densities are required to make a sizable radiativecontribution to the (hst) optical/uv spectra of these galactic nuclei. stellarcontribution to the infrared spectrum is more likely. further, if llagn are ina quasi steady-state for as long as 10^7 years or more, too high stellardensities would again be required to significantly affect the dynamics ofaccretion flow. however, if llagn are ``short''-lived phenomena, e.g. t &lt; 10^5years, quiescent states of quiescence-outburst cycles, then embedded stars maybe much more important through the mass effects (iii) -- (v). with observationsof llagn becoming progressively better, it will be more and more difficult toneglect the presence of close stars in and around nuclear accretion disks.

astro-ph;0410455	using close stars as probes of hot accretion flow in sgr a*	the extremely hot and tenuous accretion flow in the immediate vicinity of sgra* is believed to be invisible (too dim) in the x-ray band, except for shortx-ray flares. here we point out that during pericenter passages, closebrightest stars irradiate the inner region of the accretion flow, providing aplenty of optical/uv photons. these seed photons are compton up-scattered bythe hot electrons of the accretion flow to higher frequencies, some into thex-ray band, potentially making the innermost accretion flow much brighter inx-rays than usual. we propose to use coordinated near infra-red and x-rayobservations of close star passages to put constraints onto sgr a* accretiontheories. the absence of a noticeable change in the steady emission of sgr a*as observed by chandra in the year 2002, when the star named s2 passed througha pericenter of its orbit, already rules out the hotter of the ``standard''advection-dominated accretion flows. the less dense accretion flows, inparticular the model of yuan et al.

astro-ph;0411791	warped accretion disks and the unification of active galactic nuclei	orientation of parsec-scale accretion disks in agn is likely to be nearlyrandom for different black hole feeding episodes. since agn accretion disks areunstable to self-gravity on parsec scales, star formation in these disks willcreate young stellar disks, similar to those recently discovered in ourgalactic center. the disks blend into the quasi-spherical star clusterenveloping the agn on time scales much longer than a likely agn lifetime.therefore, the gravitational potential within the radius of the black holeinfluence is at best axi-symmetric rather than spherically symmetric. here weshow that as a result, a newly formed accretion disk will be warped. for thesimplest case of a potential resulting from a thin stellar ring, we calculatethe disk precession rates, and the time dependent shape. we find that, for arealistic parameter range, the disk becomes strongly warped in few hundredorbital times. we suggest that this, and possibly other mechanisms of accretiondisk warping, have a direct relevance to the problem of agn obscuration, masingwarped accretion disks, narrow fe k-alpha lines, etc.

astro-ph;0602366	clumpy winds and the obscuration of active galactic nuclei	the role of star-formation driven outflows in the obscuration of the centralsource in the active galactic nuclei (agn) is discussed. the outflow from asub-parsec scale accretion disc is numerically modelled for parametersappropriate to the galactic centre. the resulting obscuration pattern is verypatchy, with some lines of sight becoming optically thick to thomsonscattering. a fixed observer would see column depth changing by factors of manyover time scales of order months to hundreds of years, depending on thephysical size of the outflow region. such winds may be relevant for obscurationof some agn and especially "changing look agn". however, averaged over the skyas seen from the central source, these winds are always optically thin unlesswind outflow rates are super-eddington. a simple scaling argument shows thatthis is true not only for stellar-driven winds but for any agn winds. wetherefore conclude that agn winds are unable to account for the vast majorityof optically thick obscured agn (a significant fraction of all agn). we suggestthat the most likely source of optically thick obscuration in agn is a warpedparsec scale accretion disc.

astro-ph;0611345	x-rays from cusps of compact remnants near galactic centres	compact remnants -- stellar mass black holes and neutron stars formed in theinner few parsec of galactic centres are predicted to sink into the centralparsec due to dynamical friction on low mass stars, forming a highconcentration cusp (morris 1993). same physical region may also contain veryhigh density molecular clouds and accretion discs that are needed to fuel smbhactivity. here we estimate gas capture rates onto the cusp of stellar remnants,and the resulting x-ray luminosity, as a function of the accretion disc mass.at low disc masses, most compact objects are too dim to be observable, whereasin the high disc case most of them are accreting at their eddington rates. wefind that for low accretion disc masses, compact remnant cusps may be moreluminous than the central smbhs. this ``diffuse'' emission may be of importancefor local moderately bright agn, especially low luminosity agn. we also brieflydiscuss how this expected emission can be used to put constraints on the blackhole cusp near our galactic centre.

astro-ph;0701141	simulations of star formation in a gaseous disc around sgr a* - a failed  agn	we numerically model fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable gaseous discunder conditions that may be appropriate for the formation of the young massivestars observed in the central parsec of our galaxy. in this study, we adopt asimple prescription with a locally constant cooling time. we find that, forcooling times just short enough to induce disc fragmentation, stars form with atop-heavy initial mass function (imf), as observed in the galactic centre (gc).for shorter cooling times, the disc fragments much more vigorously, leading tolower average stellar masses. thermal feedback associated with gas accretiononto protostars slows down disc fragmentation, as predicted by some analyticalmodels. we also simulate the fragmentation of a gas stream on an eccentricorbit in a combined sgr a* plus stellar cusp gravitational potential. thestream precesses, self-collides and forms stars with a top-heavy imf. none ofour models produces large enough co-moving groups of stars that could accountfor the observed ``mini star cluster'' irs13e in the gc. in all of thegravitationally unstable disc models that we explored, star formation takesplace too fast to allow any gas accretion onto the central super-massive blackhole. while this can help to explain the quiescence of `failed agn' such as sgra*, it poses a challenge for understanding the high gas accretion rates inferedfor many quasars.

astro-ph;0701410	can the soft excess in agn originate from disc reflection?	the soft excess seen in many agn is most probably due to partially ionizedmaterial moving at relativistic speeds close to the black hole. there arecurrently two potential geometries for this material, one where it is out ofthe line of sight, seen via reflection, e.g. the accretion disc, the otherwhere it is in the line of sight, seen in absorption e.g. a wind above thedisc. both models require apparent fine tuning of the ionization parameter ofthis material in order to produce the large jump in opacity at $\sim 0.7$ kevassociated with ovii/viii, as required to make the soft excess. however,chevalier et al (2006) show that these states rather naturally dominate theabsorption spectrum for soft x-ray spectra if the illuminated material is (atleast approximately) in pressure balance. here we explore whether hydrostaticpressure equilibrium in a disc can likewise naturally select the requiredionization states in reflection. we find the opposite. the soft excess x-rayexcess is much weaker in the hydrostatic models than it is in the constantdensity models. since even the constant density models cannot fit the largestsoft excesses seen without the intrinsic continuum being hidden from view, thismeans that reflection from a hydrostatic disc cannot realistically match thedata. even if the disc structure is instead more like a constant densityatmosphere, the required fine--tuning of the ionization parameter still remainsa problem for reflection models.

astro-ph;9709286	x-rays from magnetic flares in cygnus x-1: a unified model with seyfert  galaxies	some recent work has shown that the spectrum of seyfert 1 galaxies is verysimilar to that of several galactic black hole candidates (gbhcs) in their hardstate. however, the smallness of the observed reflection component in cygnusx-1, in addition to other constraints, seem to rule out the two-phase model(otherwise successful in the case of seyfert galaxies) for gbhcs. here, we showthat the latter conclusion is based on a number of key assumptions thatprobably are not valid when the overlying corona is patchy, e.g., when it iscomprised of localized magnetic flares above the disk. we show that in gbhcsthe energy deposited by the x-rays cannot be re-radiated fast enough tomaintain equilibrium, unless the x-ray skin heats up to the comptontemperature, at which point the gas is mostly ionized. this leads to asubstantially reduced cooling rate for the active regions due to thecorrespondingly smaller number of re-injected low-energy photons. we model thiseffect by introducing a transition layer situated between the corona and thecold disk, and find that the resulting spectrum is harder than that obtainedwith the standard (and unrealistic) two-phase model. we apply this model tocygnus x-1 and show that it can account for its observed spectrum. thisanalysis therefore seems to provide a consistentpicture for both seyfertgalaxies and gbhcs within the same framework, with differences arising due tothe changing physical conditionsin the two categories of sources, rather thandue to an ad hoc variation of the model parameters.

astro-ph;9909359	thermal instability and photoionized x-ray reflection in accretion disks	we study the x-ray illumination of an accretion disk. we relax thesimplifying assumption of constant gas density used in most previous studies;instead we determine the density from hydrostatic balance. it is found that thethermal ionization instability prevents the illuminated gas from attainingtemperatures at which the gas is unstable. in particular, the uppermost layersof the x-ray illuminated gas are found to be almost completely ionized and atthe local compton temperature ($\sim 10^7 - 10^8$ k); at larger depths, the gastemperature drops abruptly to form a thin layer with $t\sim 10^6$ k, while atyet larger depths it decreases sharply to the disk effective temperature. wefind that most of the fe k$\alpha$ line emission and absorption edge areproduced in the coolest, deepest layers, while the fe atoms in the hottest,uppermost layers are generally almost fully ionized, hence making a negligiblecontribution to reprocessing features in $\sim 6.4-10$ kev energy range. weprovide a summary of how x-ray reprocessing features depend on parameters ofthe problem. the results of our self-consistent calculations are bothquantitatively and qualitatively different from those obtained using theconstant density assumption. therefore, we conclude that x-ray reflectioncalculations should always utilize hydrostatic balance in order to provide areliable theoretical interpretation of observed x-ray spectra of agn and gbhcs.

astro-ph;9912455	on the x-ray heated skin of accretion disks	we present a simple analytical formula for the thomson depth of the x-rayheated skin of accretion disks valid at any radius and for a broad range ofspectral indices of the incident x-rays, accretion rates and black hole masses.we expect that this formula may find useful applications in studies of geometryof the inner part of accretion flows around compact objects, and in severalother astrophysically important problems, such as the recently observed x-ray``baldwin'' effect (i.e., monotonic decrease of fe line's equivalent width withthe x-ray luminosity of agn), the problem of missing lyman edge in agn, andline and continuum variability studies in accretion disks around compactobjects. we compute the reflected x-ray spectra for several representativecases and show that for hard x-ray spectra and large ionizing fluxes the skinrepresents a perfect mirror that does not produce any fe lines or absorptionfeatures. at the same time, for soft x-ray spectra or small ionizing fluxes,the skin produces very strong ionized absorption edge and highly ionized felines that should be observable in the reflected spectra.
