0903.2139	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. i. the transiting  planetary system wasp-5	we present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolarplanetary system wasp-5, obtained with the danish 1.54m telescope at eso lasilla. in order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussedthe telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter40 pixels (16 arcsec). data reduction was undertaken using standard aperturephotometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparisonstars. the resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag forthe first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. we construct detailed signal tonoise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to ourobservations. we model the light curves with the jktebop code and combine theresults with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary modelsto derive the physical properties of the wasp-5 system. we find that the planethas a mass of m_b = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033 mjup, a radius of r_b = 1.171 +/-0.056 +/- 0.012 rjup, a large surface gravity of g_b = 29.6 +/- 2.8 m/s2 and adensity of rho_b = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematicuncertainties). the planet's high equilibrium temperature of t_eq = 1732 +/- 80k makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.

0906.1050	pixel-lensing as a way to detect extrasolar planets in m31	we study the possibility to detect extrasolar planets in m31 throughpixel-lensing observations. using a monte carlo approach, we select thephysical parameters of the binary lens system, a star hosting a planet, and wecalculate the pixel-lensing light curve taking into account the finite sourceeffects. indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in m31microlensing events are mainly giant stars. light curves with detectableplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from thecorresponding paczy\'{n}ski shapes. we find that the time scale of planetarydeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source sizeincreases. this means that only few exposures per day, depending also on therequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetarycompanion. although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2m_{\rm {jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($m_{\rm p} &lt; 20 m_{\oplus}$) cancause significant deviations, at least in the observations with largetelescopes. however, even in the former case, the probability to finddetectable planetary features in pixel-lensing light curves is at most a fewpercent of the detectable events, and therefore many events have to becollected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in m31. our analysis alsosupports the claim that the anomaly found in the candidate event pa-99-n2towards m31 can be explained by a companion object orbiting the lens star.

0908.3836	lmc self lensing for ogle-ii microlensing observations	in the framework of microlensing searches towards the large magellanic cloud(lmc), we discuss the results presented by the ogle collaboration for theirogle-ii campaign \citep{lukas09}. we evaluate the optical depth, the durationand the expected rate of events for the different possible lens populations:both luminous, dominated by the lmc self lensing, and "dark", the would becompact halo objects (machos) belonging to either the galactic or to the lmchalo. the ogle-ii observational results, 2 microlensing candidate eventslocated in the lmc bar region with duration of 24.2 and 57.2 days, compare wellwith the expected signal from the luminous lens populations:$n_\mathrm{exp}=1.5$, with typical duration, for lmc self lensing, of about 50days. because of the small statistics at disposal, however, the conclusionsthat can be drawn as for the halo mass fraction, $f$, in form of compact haloobjects are not too severe. by means of a likelihood analysis we find an\emph{upper} limit for $f$, at 95% confidence level, of about 15% in the massrange $(10^{-2}-10^{-1}) \mathrm{m}_\odot$ and 26% for $0.5 \mathrm{m}_\odot$.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1508.06636	spitzer microlens measurement of a massive remnant in a well-separated  binary	we report the detection and mass measurement of a binary lensogle-2015-blg-1285la,b, with the more massive component having$m_1&gt;1.35\,m_\odot$ (80% probability). a main-sequence star in this mass rangeis ruled out by limits on blue light, meaning that a primary in this mass rangemust be a neutron star or black hole. the system has a projected separation$r_\perp= 6.1\pm 0.4\,{\rm au}$ and lies in the galactic bulge. thesemeasurements are based on the "microlens parallax" effect, i.e., comparing themicrolensing light curve as seen from $spitzer$, which lay at $1.25\,{\rm au}$projected from earth, to the light curves from four ground-based surveys, threein the optical and one in the near infrared. future adaptive optics imaging ofthe companion by 30m class telescopes will yield a much more accuratemeasurement of the primary mass. this discovery both opens the path and definesthe challenges to detecting and characterizing black holes and neutron stars inwide binaries, with either dark or luminous companions. in particular, wediscuss lessons that can be applied to future $spitzer$ and $kepler$ k2microlensing parallax observations.

1509.05609	larger and faster: revised properties and a shorter orbital period for  the wasp-57 planetary system from a pro-am collaboration	transits in the wasp-57 planetary system have been found to occur half anhour earlier than expected. we present ten transit light curves from amateurtelescopes, on which this discovery was based, thirteen transit light curvesfrom professional facilities which confirm and refine this finding, andhigh-resolution imaging which show no evidence for nearby companions. we usethese data to determine a new and precise orbital ephemeris, and measure thephysical properties of the system. our revised orbital period is 4.5s shorterthan found from the discovery data alone, which explains the early occurrenceof the transits. we also find both the star and planet to be larger and lessmassive than previously thought. the measured mass and radius of the planet arenow consistent with theoretical models of gas giants containing noheavy-element core, as expected for the sub-solar metallicity of the host star.two transits were observed simultaneously in four passbands. we use theresulting light curves to measure the planet's radius as a function ofwavelength, finding that our data are sufficient in principle but not inpractise to constrain its atmospheric properties. we conclude with a discussionof the current and future status of transmission photometry studies for probingthe atmospheres of gas-giant transiting planets.

0808.0004	inferring statistics of planet populations by means of automated  microlensing searches	(abridged) the study of other worlds is key to understanding our own, and notonly provides clues to the origin of our civilization, but also looks into itsfuture. rather than in identifying nearby systems and learning about theirindividual properties, the main value of the technique of gravitationalmicrolensing is in obtaining the statistics of planetary populations within themilky way and beyond. only the complementarity of different techniquescurrently employed promises to yield a complete picture of planet formationthat has sufficient predictive power to let us understand how habitable worldslike ours evolve, and how abundant such systems are in the universe. acooperative three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly monitoring ofmicrolensing targets, realized by means of an automated expert system and anetwork of ground-based telescopes is ready right now to be used to obtain afirst census of cool planets with masses reaching even below that of earthorbiting k and m dwarfs in two distinct stellar populations, namely thegalactic bulge and disk. the hunt for extra-solar planets acts as a principalscience driver for time-domain astronomy with robotic-telescope networksadopting fully-automated strategies. several initiatives, both into facilitiesas well as into advanced software and strategies, are supposed to see thecapabilities of gravitational microlensing programmes step-wise increasing overthe next 10 years. new opportunities will show up with high-precisionastrometry becoming available and studying the abundance of planets aroundstars in neighbouring galaxies becoming possible. finally, we should not missout on sharing the vision with the general public, and make its realization toprofit not only the scientists but all the wider society.

astro-ph;0304485	microlensing towards m31 with mdm data	we report the final analysis of a search for microlensing events in thedirection of the andromeda galaxy, which aimed to probe the macho compositionof the m31 halo using data collected during the 1998-99 observational campaignat the mdm observatory. in a previous paper, we discussed the results from afirst set of observations. here, we deal with the complete data set, and wetake advantage of some int observations in the 1999-2000 seasons. this mergingof data sets taken by different instruments turns out to be very useful, thestudy of the longer baseline available allowing us to test the uniquenesscharacteristic of microlensing events. as a result, all the candidatemicrolensing events previously reported turn out to be variable stars. wefurther discuss a selection based on different criteria, aimed at the detectionof short--duration events. we find three candidates whose positions areconsistent with self--lensing events, although the available data do not allowus to conclude unambiguously that they are due to microlensing.

astro-ph;0401374	the point-agape survey i: the variable stars in m31	the point-agape collaboration has been monitoring m31 for three seasons withthe wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope. in each season, data aretaken for one hour per night for roughly sixty nights during the six monthsthat m31 is visible. the two fields of view straddle the central bulge,northwards and southwards. we have calculated the locations, periods andamplitudes of 35414 variable stars in m31 as a by-product of our microlensingsearch. the variables are classified according to their period and amplitude ofvariation. they are classified into population i and ii cepheids, miras andsemi-regular long-period variables. the population i cepheids are associatedwith the spiral arms, while the central concentration of the miras andlong-period variables varies noticeably, the stars with brighter (and shorter)variations being much more centrally concentrated. a crucial role in themicrolensing experiment is played by the asymmetry signal. it was initiallyassumed that the variable stars would not be a serious problem as theirdistributions would be symmetric. we demonstrate that this assumption is notcorrect. we find that differential extinction associated with the dust lanescauses the variable star distributions to be asymmetric. the size and directionof the asymmetry of the variable stars is measured as a function of period andamplitude of variation. the implications of this discovery for the successfulcompletion of the microlensing experiments towards m31 are discussed.(abridged)

astro-ph;0403447	classical novae from the point-agape microlensing survey of m31 -- i.  the nova catalogue	the point-agape survey is an optical search for gravitational microlensingevents towards the andromeda galaxy (m31). as well as microlensing, the surveyis sensitive to many different classes of variable stars and transients. herewe describe the automated detection and selection pipeline used to identify m31classical novae (cne) and we present the resulting catalogue of 20 cncandidates observed over three seasons. cne are observed both in the bulgeregion as well as over a wide area of the m31 disk. nine of the cne are caughtduring the final rise phase and all are well sampled in at least two colours.the excellent light-curve coverage has allowed us to detect and classify cneover a wide range of speed class, from very fast to very slow. among thelight-curves is a moderately fast cn exhibiting entry into a deep transitionminimum, followed by its final decline. we have also observed in detail a veryslow cn which faded by only 0.01 mag day$^{-1}$ over a 150 day period. wedetect other interesting variable objects, including one of the longest periodand most luminous mira variables. the cn catalogue constitutes a uniquelywell-sampled and objectively-selected data set with which to study thestatistical properties of classical novae in m31, such as the global nova rate,the reliability of novae as standard-candle distance indicators and thedependence of the nova population on stellar environment. the findings of thisstatistical study will be reported in a follow-up paper.

astro-ph;0411186	the point-agape survey ii: an unrestricted search for microlensing  events towards m31	an automated search is carried out for microlensing events using a catalogueof 44554 variable superpixel lightcurves derived from our three-year monitoringprogram of m31. each step of our candidate selection is objective andreproducible by a computer. our search is unrestricted, in the sense that ithas no explicit timescale cut. so, it must overcome the awkward problem ofdistinguishing long-timescale microlensing events from long-period stellarvariables. the basis of the selection algorithm is the fitting of thesuperpixel lightcurves to two different theoretical models, using variable starand blended microlensing templates. only if microlensing is preferred is anevent retained as a possible candidate. further cuts are made with regard to(i) sampling, (ii) goodness of fit of the peak to a paczynski curve, (iii)consistency of the microlensing hypothesis with the absence of a resolvedsource, (iv) achromaticity, (v) position in the colour-magnitude diagram and(vi) signal-to-noise ratio. our results are reported in terms of first-levelcandidates, which are the most trustworthy, and second-level candidates, whichare possible microlensing but have lower signal-to-noise and are morequestionable. the pipeline leaves just 3 first-level candidates, all of whichhave very short full-width half-maximum timescale (&lt;5 days) and 3 second-levelcandidates, which have timescales of 31, 36 and 51 days respectively. we alsoshow 16 third-level lightcurves, as an illustration of the events that justfail the threshold for designation as microlensing candidates. they are almostcertainly mainly variable stars. two of the 3 first-level candidates correspondto known events (pa 00-s3 and pa 00-s4) already reported by the point-agapeproject. the remaining first-level candidate is new.

astro-ph;0504188	point-agape pixel lensing survey of m31 : evidence for a macho  contribution to galactic halos	the point-agape collaboration is carrying out a search for gravitationalmicrolensing toward m31 to reveal galactic dark matter in the form of machos(massive astrophysical compact halo objects) in the halos of the milky way andm31. a high-threshold analysis of 3 years of data yields 6 bright,short--duration microlensing events, which are confronted to a simulation ofthe observations and the analysis. the observed signal is much larger thanexpected from self lensing alone and we conclude, at the 95% confidence level,that at least 20% of the halo mass in the direction of m31 must be in the formof machos if their average mass lies in the range 0.5-1 m$_\odot$. this lowerbound drops to 8% for machos with masses $\sim 0.01$ m$_\odot$. in addition, wediscuss a likely binary microlensing candidate with caustic crossing. itslocation, some 32' away from the centre of m31, supports our conclusion that weare detecting a macho signal in the direction of m31.

astro-ph;0509493	classical novae from the point-agape microlensing survey of m31 -- ii.  rate and statistical characteristics of the nova population	we report the results of our statistical study of the point-agape cnecatalogue. the first sloan $r'$ and $i'$ analysis of the mmrd relationship inm31 is performed using the resulting point-agape cn catalogue. good fits areproduced to the mmrd in the two filters. however, we are unable to verify the$t_{15}$ relationship for either sloan filter. the subsequent analysis of ourautomated cn detection pipeline has provided us with the most thoroughknowledge of the completeness of a cn survey to-date. in addition, the largefield of view of the survey has permitted us to probe the outburst rate wellinto the galactic disk, unlike previous ccd imaging surveys. using thisanalysis we are able to probe the cn distribution of m31 and evaluate theglobal nova rate. using models of the galactic surface brightness of m31, weshow that the observed cn distribution consists of a separate bulge and diskpopulation. we also show that the m31 bulge cn eruption rate per unit $r'$ fluxis more than five times greater than that of the disk. we deduce a global m31cn rate of $65^{+16}_{-15}$ year$^{-1}$, a value much higher than found byprevious surveys. using the global rate, we derive a m31 bulge rate of$38^{+15}_{-12}$ year$^{-1}$ and a disk rate of $27^{+19}_{-15}$ year$^{-1}$.given our understanding of the completeness and an analysis of other sources oferror, we conclude that the true global nova rate of m31 is at least 50% higherthan was previously thought and this has consequent implications for thepresumed cn rate in the milky way. we deduce a galactic bulge rate of$14^{+6}_{-5}$ year$^{-1}$, a disk rate of $20^{+14}_{-11}$ year$^{-1}$ and aglobal galactic rate of $34^{+15}_{-12}$ year$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0607358	microlensing towards lmc: a study of the lmc halo contribution	we carry on a new analysis of the sample of macho microlensing candidatestowards the lmc. our main purpose is to determine the lens population to whichthe events may belong. we give particular emphasis to the possibility ofcharacterizing the milky way dark matter halo population with respect to thelmc one. indeed, we show that only a fraction of the events havecharacteristics that match those expected for lenses belonging to the machopopulation of the milky way halo. this suggests that this component cannotexplain all the candidates. accordingly, we challenge the view that the darkmatter halo fraction of both the milky way and the lmc halos are equal, andindeed we show that, for a macho mass in the range 0.1-0.3 m$_\odot$, the lmchalo fraction can be significantly larger than the milky way one. in thisperspective, our main conclusion is that up to about half of the observedevents could be attributed to the lmc macho dark matter halo.
