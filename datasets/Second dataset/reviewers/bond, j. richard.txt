0909.0503	preheating after modular inflation	we study (p)reheating in modular (closed string) inflationary scenarios, witha special emphasis on kahler moduli/roulette models. it is usually assumed thatreheating in such models occurs through perturbative decays. however, we findthat there are very strong non-perturbative preheating decay channels relatedto the particular shape of the inflaton potential (which is highly nonlinearand has a very steep minimum). preheating after modular inflation, proceedingthrough a combination of tachyonic instability and broad-band parametricresonance, is perhaps the most violent example of preheating after inflationknown in the literature. further, we consider the subsequent transfer of energyto the standard model sector in scenarios where the standard model particlesare confined to a d7-brane wrapping the inflationary blow-up cycle of thecompactification manifold or, more interestingly, a non-inflationary blow upcycle. we explicitly identify the decay channels of the inflaton in these twoscenarios. we also consider the case where the inflationary cycle shrinks tothe string scale at the end of inflation; here a field theoretical treatment ofreheating is insufficient and one must turn instead to a stringy description.we estimate the decay rate of the inflaton and the reheat temperature forvarious scenarios.

1006.5126	the atacama cosmology telescope: physical properties and purity of a  galaxy cluster sample selected via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present optical and x-ray properties for the first confirmed galaxycluster sample selected by the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 148 ghz maps over455 square degrees of sky made with the atacama cosmology telescope. thesemaps, coupled with multi-band imaging on 4-meter-class optical telescopes, haveyielded a sample of 23 galaxy clusters with redshifts between 0.118 and 1.066.of these 23 clusters, 10 are newly discovered. the selection of this sample isapproximately mass limited and essentially independent of redshift. we provideoptical positions, images, redshifts and x-ray fluxes and luminosities for thefull sample, and x-ray temperatures of an important subset. the mass limit ofthe full sample is around 8e14 msun, with a number distribution that peaksaround a redshift of 0.4. for the 10 highest significance sze-selected clustercandidates, all of which are optically confirmed, the mass threshold is 1e15msun and the redshift range is 0.167 to 1.066. archival observations fromchandra, xmm-newton, and rosat provide x-ray luminosities and temperatures thatare broadly consistent with this mass threshold. our optical follow-upprocedure also allowed us to assess the purity of the act cluster sample.eighty (one hundred) percent of the 148 ghz candidates with signal-to-noiseratios greater than 5.1 (5.7) are confirmed as massive clusters. the reportedsample represents one of the largest sze-selected sample of massive clustersover all redshifts within a cosmologically-significant survey volume, whichwill enable cosmological studies as well as future studies on the evolution,morphology, and stellar populations in the most massive clusters in theuniverse.

1007.5297	parameterizing and measuring dark energy trajectories from  late-inflatons	bulk dark energy properties are determined by the redshift evolution of itspressure-to-density ratio, $w_{de}(z)$. an experimental goal is to decide ifthe dark energy is dynamical, as in the quintessence (and phantom) modelstreated here. we show that a three-parameter approximation $w_{de}(z;\epsilon_s, \epsilon_{\phi\infty}, \zeta_s)$ fits well the ensemble oftrajectories for a wide class of late-inflaton potentials $v(\phi)$. markovchain monte carlo probability calculations are used to confront our $w_{de}(z)$trajectories with current observational information on type ia supernova,cosmic microwave background, galaxy power spectra, weak lensing and thelyman-${\alpha}$ forest. we find the best constrained parameter is a lowredshift slope parameter, $\epsilon_s \propto (\partial \ln v / \partial\phi)^2$ when the dark energy and matter have equal energy densities. atracking parameter $\epsilon_{\phi\infty}$ defining the high-redshift attractorof $1+w_{de}$ is marginally constrained. poorly determined is $\zeta_s$,characterizing the evolution of $\epsilon_s$, and a measure of $\partial^2 \lnv / \partial \phi^2$ . the constraints we find already rule out some popularquintessence and phantom models, or restrict their potential parameters. wealso forecast how the next generation of cosmological observations improve theconstraints: by a factor of about five on $\epsilon_s$ and$\epsilon_{\phi\infty}$, but with $\zeta_s$ remaining unconstrained (unless thetrue model significantly deviates from $\lambda$cdm). thus potentialreconstruction beyond an overall height and a gradient is not feasible for thelarge space of late-inflaton models considered here.

1010.1025	the atacama cosmology telescope: cosmology from galaxy clusters detected  via the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample ofsunyaev-zel'dovich-selected galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wavesurvey by the atacama cosmology telescope. the cluster sample used in thisanalysis consists of 9 optically-confirmed high-mass clusters comprising thehigh-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 squaredegrees of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 ghz. we focus on the most massivesystems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics andcosmology derived from sz surveys. we describe the scaling relation betweencluster mass and sz signal with a 4-parameter fit. marginalizing over thevalues of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives sigma_8 =0.851 +/- 0.115 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.35 for a spatially-flat wcdm cosmologicalmodel with wmap 7-year priors on cosmological parameters. this gives a modestimprovement in statistical uncertainty over wmap 7-year constraints alone.fixing the scaling relation between cluster mass and sz signal to a fiducialrelation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by x-rayobservations, we find sigma_8 = 0.821 +/- 0.044 and w = -1.05 +/- 0.20. theseresults are consistent with constraints from wmap 7 plus baryon acousticoscillations plus type ia supernoava which give sigma_8 = 0.802 +/- 0.038 and w= -0.98 +/- 0.053. a stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample comparedto clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement.these results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both theastrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived fromthem are broadly consistent with current models.

1108.2043	primordial gravitational wave detectability with deep small-sky cmb  experiments	we use bayesian estimation on direct t-q-u cmb polarization maps to forecasterrors on the tensor-to- scalar power ratio r, and hence on primordialgravitational waves, as a function of sky coverage fsky. this method filtersthe quadratic pixel-pixel space into the optimal combinations needed for rdetection for cut skies, providing enhanced information over a first-steplinear separation into a combination of e, b and mixed modes, and ignoring thelatter. with current computational power and for typical resolutionsappropriate for r detection, the large matrix inversions required are accurateand fast. we explore two classes of experiments. one is motivated by a longduration balloon experiment like spider, with pixel noise \propto \sqrt{fsky}for a specified observing period, but also applies to ground-based arrayexperiments. we find that, ignoring systematic effects and foregrounds, anexperiment with spider-like noise over fsky ~0.02-0.2 could place a 2sigma_r~0.014 (~95% cl) bound, rising to 0.02 with an l-dependent foreground residual.we contrast this with a planck-like fixed instrumental noise as fsky varies,which gives a galaxy-masked (fsky = 0.75) 2sigma_r ~0.015, rising to ~0.05 withthe foreground residuals. using for a figure of merit the (marginalized) 1dshannon entropy of r, taken relative to the first 2003 wmap1 cmb-onlyconstraint, gives -1.7 (-1.9) bits from the 2010 wmap7+act (2011 wmap7+spt)data, forecasts of -6 bits from spider (plus planck), of up to -11 bits forpost-planck satellites and -13 bits for a perfect cosmic variance limitedexperiment. we thus confirm the wisdom of the current strategy for r detectionof deeply probed patches covering the fsky minimum-error trough with balloonand ground experiments.

1108.3950	the cosmic background imager 2	we describe an upgrade to the cosmic background imager instrument to increaseits surface brightness sensitivity at small angular scales. the upgradeconsisted of replacing the thirteen 0.9-m antennas with 1.4-m antennasincorporating a novel combination of design features, which provided excellentsidelobe and spillover performance for low manufacturing cost. off-the-shelfspun primaries were used, and the secondary mirrors were oversized and shapedrelative to a standard cassegrain in order to provide an optimum compromisebetween aperture efficiency and low spillover lobes. low-order distortions inthe primary mirrors were compensated for by custom machining of the secondarymirrors. the secondaries were supported on a transparent dielectric foam coneto minimize scattering. the antennas were tested in the complete instrument,and the beam shape and spillover noise contributions were as expected. wedemonstrate the performance of the telescope and the inter-calibration with theprevious system using observations of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in thecluster abell 1689. the enhanced instrument has been used to study the cosmicmicrowave background, the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and diffuse galacticemission.

1110.4608	semi-blind eigen-analyses of recombination histories using cmb data	cosmological parameter measurements from cmb experiments such as planck,actpol, sptpol and other high resolution follow-ons fundamentally rely on theaccuracy of the assumed recombination model, or one with well prescribeduncertainties. deviations from the standard recombination history might suggestnew particle physics or modified atomic physics. here we treat possibleperturbative fluctuations in the free electron fraction, $\xe(z)$, by asemi-blind expansion in densely-packed modes in redshift. from these weconstruct parameter eigenmodes, which we rank order so that the lowest modesprovide the most power to probe the $\xe(z)$ with cmb measurements. since theeigenmodes are effectively weighed by the fiducial $\xe$ history, they arelocalized around the differential visibility peak, allowing for an excellentprobe of hydrogen recombination, but a weaker probe of the higher redshifthelium recombination and the lower redshift highly neutral freeze-out tail. weuse an information-based criterion to truncate the mode hierarchy, and showthat with even a few modes the method goes a long way towards morphing afiducial older {\sc recfast} $x_{\rm e,i} (z)$ into the new and improved {\sccosmorec} and {\sc hyrec} $x_{\rm e,f} (z)$ in the hydrogen recombinationregime, though not well in the helium regime. without such a correction, thederived cosmic parameters are biased. we discuss an iterative approach forupdating the eigenmodes to further hone in on $x_{\rm e,f} (z)$ if largedeviations are indeed found. we also introduce control parameters thatdownweight the attention on the visibility peak structure, e.g., focusing theeigenmode probes more strongly on the $\xe (z)$ freeze-out tail, as would beappropriate when looking for the $\xe$ signature of annihilating or decayingelementary particles.

1412.5591	cosmic bubble and domain wall instabilities i: parametric amplification  of linear fluctuations	this is the first paper in a series where we study collisions of nucleatedbubbles taking into account the effects of small initial (quantum) fluctuationsin a fully 3+1-dimensional setting. in this paper, we consider the evolution oflinear fluctuations around highly symmetric though inhomogeneous backgrounds.we demonstrate that a large degree of asymmetry develops over time from tinyfluctuations superposed upon planar and so(2,1) symmetric backgrounds. thesefluctuations arise from zero-point vacuum oscillations, so excluding them byenforcing a spatial symmetry is inconsistent in a quantum treatment. weconsider the limit of two colliding planar walls, with fluctuation modefunctions characterized by the wavenumber transverse to the collision directionand a longitudinal shape along the collision direction $x$, which we solve for.initially, the fluctuations obey a linear wave equation with a time- andspace-dependent mass $m_{eff}(x,t)$. when the walls collide multiple times,$m_{eff}$ oscillates in time. we use floquet theory to study the fluctuationsand generalize techniques familiar from preheating to the case with manycoupled degrees of freedom. this inhomogeneous case has bands of unstabletransverse wavenumbers $k_\perp$ with exponentially growing mode functions.from the detailed spatial structure of the mode functions in $x$, we identifyboth broad and narrow parametric resonance generalizations of the homogeneous$m_{eff}(t)$ case of preheating. the unstable $k_\perp$ modes arelongitudinally localized, yet can be described as quasiparticles in thebogoliubov sense. we define an effective occupation number to show they arecreated in bursts for the case of well-defined collisions in the background.the transverse-longitudinal coupling accompanying nonlinearity radically breaksthis localized particle description, with nonseparable 3d modes arising.

1505.01857	cosmic bubble and domain wall instabilities ii: fracturing of colliding  walls	we study collisions between nearly planar domain walls including the effectsof small initial nonplanar fluctuations. these perturbations represent thesmall fluctuations that must exist in a quantum treatment of the problem. in aprevious paper, we demonstrated that at the linear level a subset of thesefluctuations experience parametric amplification as a result of their couplingto the planar symmetric background. here we study the full three-dimensionalnonlinear dynamics using lattice simulations, including both the early timeregime when the fluctuations are well described by linear perturbation theoryas well as the subsequent stage of fully nonlinear evolution. we find that thenonplanar fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the overall evolution of thesystem. specifically, once these fluctuations begin to interact nonlinearly thesplit into a planar symmetric part of the field and the nonplanar fluctuationsloses its utility. at this point the colliding domain walls dissolve, with theendpoint of this being the creation of a population of oscillons in thecollision region. the original (nearly) planar symmetry has been completelydestroyed at this point and an accurate study of the system requires the fullthree-dimensional simulation.

1505.02162	cosmic bubble and domain wall instabilities iii: the role of oscillons  in three-dimensional bubble collisions	we study collisions between pairs of bubbles nucleated in an ambient falsevacuum. for the first time, we include the effects of small initial (quantum)fluctuations around the instanton profiles describing the most likely initialbubble profile. past studies of this problem neglect these fluctuations andwork under the assumption that the collisions posess an exact so(2,1) symmetry.we use three-dimensional lattice simulations to demonstrate that fordouble-well potentials, small initial perturbations to this symmetry can beamplified as the system evolves. initially the amplification is well-describedby linear perturbation theory around the so(2,1) background, but the onset ofstrong nonlinearities amongst the fluctuations quickly leads to a drasticbreaking of the original so(2,1) symmetry and the production of oscillons inthe collision region. we explore several single-field models, and we find it ishard to both realize inflation inside of a bubble and produce oscillons in acollision. finally, we extend our results to a simple two-field model. theadditional freedom allowed by the second field allows us to construct viableinflationary models that allow oscillon production in collisions. the breakingof the so(2,1) symmetry allows for a new class of observational signatures frombubble collisions that do not posess azimuthal symmetry, including theproduction of gravitational waves which cannot be supported by an so(2,1)spacetime.

astro-ph;0112499	probing sz source detection with gasdynamical simulations	the huge worldwide investment in cmb experiments should make thesunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect a key probe of the cosmic web in the near future.for the promise to be realized, substantial development of simulation andanalysis tools to relate observation to theory is needed. the high nonlinearityand dissipative/feedback gas physics lead to highly non-gaussian patterns thatare much more difficult to analyze than gaussian primary anisotropies for whichthe procedures are reasonably well developed. historical forecasts for what cmbexperiments might see used semi-analytic tools, including large scale mapconstructions, with localized and simplified pressure structures distributed ona point process of (clustered) sources. hydro studies beyond individualcluster/supercluster systems were inadequate, but now large-volume simulationswith high resolution are beginning to shift the balance. we illustrate this byapplying ``gasoline'' (parallelized tree+sph) computations to construct sz mapsand derive statistical measures. we believe rapid monte carlo simulations usingparameterized templates centered on point processes informed by optical andother means on the observational side, and by hydro simulations on the theoryside, should play an important role in pipelines to analyze the new sz fielddata. we show that localized sources should dominate upcoming sz experiments,identify sources in the maps under filtering and noise levels expected forthese experiments, use the rcs photometric optical survey as an example ofredshift localization, and discuss whether cosmic web patterns such assuperclusters can be enhanced when such extra source information is supplied.

astro-ph;0502330	cmb observations from the cbi and vsa: a comparison of coincident maps  and parameter estimation methods	we present coincident observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)from the very small array (vsa) and cosmic background imager (cbi) telescopes.the consistency of the full datasets is tested in the map plane and the fourierplane, prior to the usual compression of cmb data into flat bandpowers. of thethree mosaics observed by each group, two are found to be in excellentagreement. in the third mosaic, there is a 2 sigma discrepancy between thecorrelation of the data and the level expected from monte carlo simulations.this is shown to be consistent with increased phase calibration errors on vsadata during summer observations. we also consider the parameter estimationmethod of each group. the key difference is the use of the variance windowfunction in place of the bandpower window function, an approximation used bythe vsa group. a re-evaluation of the vsa parameter estimates, using bandpowerwindows, shows that the two methods yield consistent results.

astro-ph;0607209	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from patchy reionization: the view  from the simulations	we present the first calculation of the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect due to the inhomogeneus reionization of the universe based on detailedlarge-scale radiative transfer simulations of reionization. the resulting skypower spectra peak at l=2000-8000 with maximum values ofl(l+1)c_l/(2pi)_{max}~4-7x10^{-13}. the scale roughly corresponds to thetypical ionized bubble sizes observed in our simulations, of ~5-20 mpc. the kszanisotropy signal from reionization dominates the primary cmb signal abovel=3000. at large scales the patchy ksz signal depends only on the sourceefficiencies. it is higher when sources are more efficient at producingionizing photons, since such sources produce larger ionized regions, onaverage, than less efficient sources. the introduction of sub-grid gas clumpingin the radiative transfer simulations produce significantly more power at smallscales, but has little effect at large scales. the patchy reionization kszsignal is dominated by the post-reionization signal from fully-ionized gas, butthe two contributions are of similar order at scales l~3000-10^4, indicatingthat the ksz anisotropies from reionization are an important component of thetotal ksz signal at these scales.

astro-ph;0609592	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from radiative transfer  simulations of patchy reionization	we present the first calculation of the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect due to the inhomogeneous reionization of the universe based on detailedlarge-scale radiative transfer simulations of reionization. the resulting skypower spectra peak at l=2000-8000 with maximum values ofl^2c_l~1\times10^{-12}. the peak scale is determined by the typical size of theionized regions and roughly corresponds to the ionized bubble sizes observed inour simulations, ~5-20 mpc. the ksz anisotropy signal from reionizationdominates the primary cmb signal above l=3000. this predicted ksz signal atarcminute scales is sufficiently strong to be detectable by upcomingexperiments, like the atacama cosmology telescope and south pole telescopewhich are expected to have ~1' resolution and ~muk sensitivity. the extendedand patchy nature of the reionization process results in a boost of the peaksignal in power by approximately one order of magnitude compared to a uniformreionization scenario, while roughly tripling the signal compared with thatbased upon the assumption of gradual but spatially uniform reionization. atlarge scales the patchy ksz signal depends largely on the ionizing sourceefficiencies and the large-scale velocity fields: sources which produce photonsmore efficiently yield correspondingly higher signals. the introduction ofsub-grid gas clumping in the radiative transfer simulations producessignificantly more power at small scales, and more non-gaussian features, buthas little effect at large scales. the patchy nature of the reionizationprocess roughly doubles the total observed ksz signal for l~3000-10^4 comparedto non-patchy scenarios with the same total electron-scattering optical depth.

astro-ph;9402043	cmb broad-band power spectrum estimation	the natural outcome of theoretical calculations of microwave backgroundanisotropy is the angular power spectrum ${\cal c}_\ell$ as a function ofmultipole number $\ell$. experimental ${\cal c}_\ell$'s are needed for directcomparison. estimation procedures using statistics linear in the pixelamplitudes as well as the conventional but less useful quadratic combinationsare described. for most current experiments, a single broad-band poweramplitude is all that one can get with accuracy. results are given for thecapri-meeting detections. mapping experiments, sensitive to many base-lines,can also give spectral ``colour'' information, either with a series ofcontiguous narrow-band powers or as parameterized by a local ``colour'' index$n_{\delta t}$ (scale invariant is -2, white noise is 0). bayesian analyses ofthe full first year dmr and firs maps give very similar band-powers (\eg$q_{rms,ps}=17.9 \pm 2.9 \mu k$ {\it c.f.} $18.6 \pm 4.7 \mu k$ for $n_{\deltat}=-2$) and colour indices (with 1 and 2 sigma error bars) $n_{\deltat}+3=2.0^{+0.4;+0.7}_{-0.4;-1.0}$ and $ 1.8^{+0.6;+0.9}_{-0.8;-1.3}$ ({\itc.f.} the value 1.15 for a ``standard'' scale invariant cdm model). the 53 and90 ghz dmr maps, as well as the firs map, have residual short-distance noisewhich steepens $n_{\delta t}$. allowing the pixel error bars to increaseabsorbs much of the residual, but further exploration is needed to see if asecond residual evident in the data which is responsible for the high$n_{\delta t}$ is from systematic errors or is physical.

astro-ph;9512142	implications of the background radiation for cosmic structure formation	the cmb is a remarkably distortionless blackbody, and this stronglyconstrains the amount of energy that can have been injected at high redshift,thereby limiting the role that hydrodynamical amplification can have played incosmic structure formation. the current data on primary anisotropies (thosecalculated using linear response theory) provide very strong support for thegravitational instability theory and encouraging support that the initialfluctuation spectrum was not far off the scale invariant form that inflation(and defect) models prefer. by itself, the (low resolution) 4-year dmr dataallow relatively precise \sigma_8 normalization factors for density fluctuationspectra and rough information on the large scale slope of the anisotropy power,thereby focusing our attention on a relatively narrow set of viable models.useful formulae relating the dmr bandpower to \sigma_8 and post-inflationscalar and tensor power spectra measures are given. smaller angle data areconsistent with these models, and will soon be powerful enough to stronglyselect among the possibilities, although there remains much room for surprises.in spite of foregrounds, future high resolution experiments should be able toallow precise determination of many combinations of the cosmological parametersthat define large scale structure formation theories: mode(adiabatic/isocurvature, gravity wave content), shape functions, amplitudes,and various mean energy densities. secondary anisotropies arising fromnonlinear structures will be invaluable probes of shorter-distance aspects ofstructure formation theories.

astro-ph;9702212	constraints on compact hyperbolic spaces from cobe	the (large angle) cobe dmr data can be used to probe the global topology ofour universe on scales comparable to and just beyond the present ``horizon''.for compact topologies, the two main effects on the cmb are: [1] the breakingof statistical isotropy in characteristic patterns determined by the photongeodesic structure of the manifold and [2] an infrared cutoff in the powerspectrum of perturbations imposed by the finite spatial extent. to make adetailed confrontation of these effects with the cobe maps requires thecomputation of the pixel-pixel temperature correlation function for eachtopology and for each orientation of it relative to the sky. we present ageneral technique using the method of images for doing this in compacthyperbolic (ch) topologies which does not require spatial eigenmodedecomposition. we demonstrate that strong constraints on compactness followfrom [2] and that these limits can be improved by exploiting the details of thegeodesic structure for each individual topology ([1]), as we show for the flat3-torus and selected ch models.

astro-ph;9804041	computing cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic spaces	the measurements of cmb anisotropy have opened up a window for probing theglobal topology of the universe on length scales comparable to and beyond thehubble radius. for compact topologies, the two main effects on the cmb are: (1)the breaking of statistical isotropy in characteristic patterns determined bythe photon geodesic structure of the manifold and (2) an infrared cutoff in thepower spectrum of perturbations imposed by the finite spatial extent. wepresent a completely general scheme using the regularized method of images forcalculating cmb anisotropy in models with nontrivial topology, and apply it tothe computationally challenging compact hyperbolic topologies. this newtechnique eliminates the need for the difficult task of spatial eigenmodedecomposition on these spaces. we estimate a bayesian probability for aselection of models by confronting the theoretical pixel-pixel temperaturecorrelation function with the cobe-dmr data. our results demonstrate thatstrong constraints on compactness arise: if the universe is small compared tothe `horizon' size, correlations appear in the maps that are irreconcilablewith the observations. if the universe is of comparable size, the likelihoodfunction is very dependent upon orientation of the manifold wrt the sky. whilemost orientations may be strongly ruled out, it sometimes happens that for aspecific orientation the predicted correlation patterns are preferred over theconventional infinite models.

astro-ph;9808040	the canada-uk deep submillimetre survey: first submillimetre images, the  source counts, and resolution of the background	we present the first results of a deep unbiased submillimetre survey carriedout at 450 and 850 microns. we detected 12 sources at 850 microns, giving asurface density of sources with 850-micron flux densities &gt; 2.8mjy of of0.49+-0.16 per square arcmin. the sources constitute 20-30% of the backgroundradiation at 850 microns and thus a significant fraction of the entirebackground radiation produced by stars. this implies, through the connectionbetween metallicity and background radiation, that a significant fraction ofall the stars that have ever been formed were formed in objects like thosedetected here. the combination of their large contribution to the backgroundradiation and their extreme bolometric luminosities make these objectsexcellent candidates for being proto-ellipticals. optical astronomers haverecently shown that the uv-luminosity density of the universe increases by afactor of about 10 between z=0 and z=1 and then decreases again at higherredshifts. using the results of a parallel submillimetre survey of the localuniverse, we show that both the submillimetre source density and background canbe explained if the submillimetre luminosity density evolves in a similar wayto the uv-luminosity density. thus, if these sources are ellipticals in theprocess of formation, they may be forming at relatively modest redshifts.

astro-ph;9901047	the canada-uk deep sub-millimeter survey ii: first identifications,  redshifts and implications for galaxy evolution	identifications are sought for 12 sub-mm sources detected by eales et al(1998). six are securely identified, two have probable identifications and fourremain unidentified with i_ab &gt; 25. spectroscopic and estimated photometricredshifts indicate that four of the sources have z &lt; 1, and four have 1 &lt; z &lt;3, with the remaining four empty field sources probably lying at z &gt; 3. thespectral energy distributions of the identifications are consistent with thoseof high extinction starbursts such as arp 220. the far-ir luminosities of thesources at z &gt; 0.5 are of order 3 x 10^12 h_50^-2 l_sun, i.e. slightly largerthan that of arp 220. based on this small sample, the cumulative bolometricluminosity function shows strong evolution to z ~ 1, but weaker or possiblyeven negative evolution beyond. the redshift dependence of the far-irluminosity density does not appear, at this early stage, to be inconsistentwith that seen in the ultraviolet luminosity density. assuming that the energysource in the far-ir is massive stars, the total luminous output fromstar-formation in the universe is probably dominated by the far-ir emission.the detected systems have individual star-formation rates (exceeding 300h_50^-2 m_o yr^-1) that are much higher than seen in the ultraviolet selectedsamples, and which are sufficient to form substantial stellar populations ondynamical timescales of 10^8 yr. the association with merger-like morphologiesand the obvious presence of dust makes it attractive to identify these systemsas forming the metal-rich spheroid population, in which case we would inferthat much of this activity has occurred relatively recently, at z ~ 2.

astro-ph;9912124	cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic universes i: computing correlation  functions	cmb anisotropy measurements have brought the issue of global topology of theuniverse from the realm of theoretical possibility to within the grasp ofobservations. the global topology of the universe modifies the correlationproperties of cosmic fields. in particular, strong correlations are predictedin cmb anisotropy patterns on the largest observable scales if the size of theuniverse is comparable to the distance to the cmb last scattering surface. wedescribe in detail our completely general scheme using a regularized method ofimages for calculating such correlation functions in models with nontrivialtopology, and apply it to the computationally challenging compact hyperbolicspaces. our procedure directly sums over images within a specified radius,ideally many times the diameter of the space, effectively treats more distantimages in a continuous approximation, and uses cesaro resummation to furthersharpen the results. at all levels of approximation the symmetries of the spaceare preserved in the correlation function. this new technique eliminates theneed for the difficult task of spatial eigenmode decomposition on these spaces.although the eigenspectrum can be obtained by this method if desired, at agiven level of approximation the correlation functions are more accuratelydetermined. we use the 3-torus example to demonstrate that the method worksvery well. we apply it to power spectrum as well as correlation functionevaluations in a number of compact hyperbolic (ch) spaces. application to thecomputation of cmb anisotropy correlations on ch spaces, and the observationalconstraints following from them, are given in a companion paper.

astro-ph;9912144	cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic universes ii: cobe maps and limits	we calculate the cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic universe models usingthe regularized method of images described in paper-i, including the'line-of-sight `integrated sachs-wolfe' effect, as well as the last-scatteringsurface terms. we calculate the bayesian probabilities for a selection ofmodels by confronting our theoretical pixel-pixel temperature correlationfunctions with the cobe-dmr data. our results demonstrate that strongconstraints on compactness arise: if the universe is small compared to the`horizon' size, correlations appear in the maps that are irreconcilable withthe observations. this conclusion is qualitatively insensitive to the mattercontent of the universe, in particular, the presence of a cosmologicalconstant. if the universe is of comparable size to the 'horizon', thelikelihood function is very dependent upon orientation of the manifold wrt thesky. while most orientations may be strongly ruled out, it sometimes happensthat for a specific orientation the predicted correlation patterns arepreferred over those for the conventional infinite models. the full bayesiananalysis we use is the most complete statistical test that can be done on thecobe maps, taking into account all possible signals and their variances in thetheoretical skies, in particular the high degree of anisotropic correlationthat can exist. we show that standard visual measures for comparing theoreticalpredictions with the data such as the isotropized power spectrum $c_\ell$ arenot so useful in small compact spaces because of enhanced cosmic varianceassociated with the breakdown of statistical isotropy.
