0903.0652	a search for multi-planet systems using the hobby-eberly telescope	extrasolar multiple-planet systems provide valuable opportunities for testingtheories of planet formation and evolution. the architectures of the knownmultiple-planet systems demonstrate a fascinating level of diversity, whichmotivates the search for additional examples of such systems in order to betterconstrain their formation and dynamical histories. here we describe acomprehensive investigation of 22 planetary systems in an effort to answerthree questions: 1) are there additional planets? 2) where could additionalplanets reside in stable orbits? and 3) what limits can these observationsplace on such objects? we find no evidence for additional bodies in any ofthese systems; indeed, these new data do not support three previously announcedplanets (hd 20367b: udry et al. 2003, hd 74156d: bean et al. 2008, and 47 umac: fischer et al. 2002). the dynamical simulations show that nearly all of the22 systems have large regions in which additional planets could exist in stableorbits. the detection-limit computations indicate that this study is sensitiveto close-in neptune-mass planets for most of the systems targeted. we concludewith a discussion on the implications of these non-detections.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1102.0605	kepler's first rocky planet: kepler-10b	nasa's kepler mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency ofearth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of sun-like stars. the missionreached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rockyplanet, kepler-10b. two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemerist[bjd]=2454964.57375+n*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris t[bjd]=2454971.6761+n*45.29485 days.statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established theviability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-upobservations. forty precision doppler measurements were used to confirm thatthe short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. the parent staris bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. photometry was collected at1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsationfrequencies. modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of thefundamental stellar properties. kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5gyr) but otherwise sun-like main sequence star with teff=5627 +/- 44 k,mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 msun, and rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 rsun. physical modelssimultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision dopplermeasurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of kepler-10b thatspeak to its rocky composition: mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 mearth, rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036rearth, and density=8.8 +/- 2.9 gcc. kepler-10b is the smallest transitingexoplanet discovered to date.

1102.1730	koi-54: the kepler discovery of tidally-excited pulsations and  brightenings in a highly eccentric binary	kepler observations of the star hd 187091 (kid 8112039, hereafter koi-54)revealed a remarkable light curve exhibiting sharp periodic brightening eventsevery 41.8 days with a superimposed set of oscillations forming a beatingpattern in phase with the brightenings. spectroscopic observations revealedthat this is a binary star with a highly eccentric orbit, e=0.83. we are ableto match the kepler light curve and radial velocities with a nearly face-on(i=5.5 degree) binary star model in which the brightening events are caused bytidal distortion and irradiation of nearly identical a stars during their closeperiastron passage. the two dominant oscillations in the light curve,responsible for the beating pattern, have frequencies that are the 91st and90th harmonic of the orbital frequency. the power spectrum of the light curve,after removing the binary star brightening component, reveals a large number ofpulsations, 30 of which have a signal-to-noise ratio &gt; 7. nearly all of thesepulsations have frequencies that are either integer multiples of the orbitalfrequency or are tidally-split multiples of the orbital frequency. this patternof frequencies unambiguously establishes the pulsations as resonances betweenthe dynamic tides at periastron and the free oscillation modes of one of thestars. koi-54 is only the 4th star to show such a phenomenon, and is by far therichest in terms of excited modes.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1106.5509	silicon and oxygen abundances in planet-host stars	the positive correlation between planet detection rate and host star ironabundance lends strong support to the core accretion theory of planetformation. however, iron is not the most significant mass contributor to thecores of giant planets. since giant planet cores are thought to grow fromsilicate grains with icy mantles, the likelihood of gas giant formation shoulddepend heavily on the oxygen and silicon abundance of the planet formationenvironment. here we compare the silicon and oxygen abundances of a set of 76planet hosts and a control sample of 80 metal-rich stars without any knowngiant planets. our new, independent analysis was conducted using highresolution, high signal-to-noise data obtained at mcdonald observatory. becausewe do not wish to simply reproduce the known planet-metallicity correlation, wehave devised a statistical method for matching the underlying [fe/h]distributions of our two sets of stars. we find a 99% probability that planetdetection rate depends on the silicon abundance of the host star, over andabove the observed planet-metallicity correlation. we do not detect any suchcorrelation for oxygen. our results would thus seem to suggest that grainnucleation, rather than subsequent icy mantle growth, is the important limitingfactor in forming giant planets via core accretion. based on our results andinterpretation, we predict that planet detection should correlate with hoststar abundance for refractory elements responsible for grain nucleation andthat no such trends should exist for the most abundant volatile elementsresponsible for icy mantle growth.

1109.1802	a survey of alkali line absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres	we obtained over 90 hours of spectroscopic observations of four exoplanetarysystems with the hobby-eberly telescope (het). observations were taken intransit and out of transit, and we analyzed the differenced spectra---i.e., thetransmission spectra---to inspect it for absorption at the wavelengths of theneutral sodium (\ion{na}{1}) doublet at $\lambda\lambda5889, 5895$ and neutralpotassium (\ion{k}{1}) at $\lambda7698$. we used the transmission spectrum at\ion{ca}{1} $\lambda6122$---which shows strong stellar absorption but is not analkali metal resonance line that we expect to show significant absorption inthese atmospheres---as a control line to examine our measurements forsystematic errors. we use an empirical monte carlo method to quantity thesesystematic errors. in a reanalysis of the same dataset using a reduction andanalysis pipeline that was derived independently, we confirm the previouslyseen \ion{na}{1} absorption in hd 189733b at a level of$(-5.26\pm1.69)\times10^{-4}$ (the average value over a 12 \aa{} integrationband to be consistent with previous authors). additionally, we tentativelyconfirm the \ion{na}{1} absorption seen in hd 209458b (independently bymultiple authors) at a level of $(-2.63\pm0.81)\times10^{-4}$, though theinterpretation is less clear. furthermore, we find \ion{na}{1} absorption of$(-3.16\pm2.06)\times10^{-4}$ at $&lt;3\sigma$ in hd 149026b; features apparent inthe transmission spectrum are consistent with real absorption and indicate thismay be a good target for future observations to confirm. no other results(\ion{na}{1} in hd 147506b and \ion{ca}{1} and \ion{k}{1} in all four targets)are significant to $\geq 3\sigma$, although we observe some features that weargue are primarily artifacts.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1203.4484	a detection of h-alpha in an exoplanetary exosphere	we report on a search for h-alpha absorption in four exoplanets. strongfeatures at h-alpha are observed in the transmission spectra of both hd 189733band hd 209458b. we attempt to characterize and remove the effects of stellarvariability in hd 189733b, and along with an empirical monte carlo test theresults imply a statistically significant transit-dependent feature of(-8.72+/-1.48)x10^-4 integrated over a 16 angstrom band relative to theadjacent continuum. we interpret this as the first detection of this line in anexoplanetary atmosphere. a previous detection of ly-alpha in hd 189733b'satmosphere allows us to calculate an excitation temperature for hydrogen,t_exc=2.6x10^4 k. this calculation depends significantly on certain simplifyingassumptions. we explore these assumptions and argue that t_exc is very likelymuch greater than the radiative equilibrium temperature (the temperature theplanet is assumed to be at based on stellar radiation and the planetarydistance) of hd 189733b. a large t_exc implies a very low density that is notin thermodynamic equilibrium the planet's lower atmosphere. we argue that then=2 hydrogen required to cause h-alpha absorption in the atmosphere is createdas a result of the greater uv flux at hd 189733b, which has the smallest orbitand most chromospherically active central star in our sample. though theoverall integration of hd 209458b's transmission spectrum over a wide band isconsistent with zero, it contains a dramatic, statistically significant featurein the transmission spectrum with reflectional symmetry. we discuss possiblephysical processes that could cause this feature. our remaining two targets (hd147506b and hd 149026b) do not show any clear features, so we place upperlimits on their h-alpha absorption levels.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1206.4037	doppler tomography of transiting exoplanets: a prograde, low-inclined  orbit for the hot jupiter corot-11b	we report the detection of the doppler shadow of the transiting hot jupitercorot-11b. our analysis is based on line-profile tomography of time-series,keck/hires high-resolution spectra acquired during the transit of the planet.we measured a sky-projected, spin-orbit angle of 0.1 +/- 2.6 degrees, which isconsistent with a very low-inclined orbit with respect to the stellar rotationaxis. we refined the physical parameters of the system using a markov chainmonte carlo simultaneous fitting of the available photometric and spectroscopicdata. an analysis of the tidal evolution of the system shows how the currentlymeasured obliquity and its uncertainty translate into an initial absolute valueof less than about 10 degrees on the zero-age main sequence, for an expectedaverage modified tidal quality factor of the star q'* &gt; 4 x 10^6. this isindicative of an inward migration scenario that would not have perturbed theprimordial low obliquity of corot-11b. taking into account the effectivetemperature and mass of the planet host star (teff=6440 k, m*=1.23 msun), thesystem can be considered a new telling exception to the recently proposedtrend, according to which relatively hot and massive stars (teff&gt;6250 k, m*&gt;1.2msun) seem to be preferentially orbited by hot jupiters with high obliquity.

1208.3499	transit timing observations from kepler: vii. confirmation of 27 planets  in 13 multiplanet systems via transit timing variations and orbital stability	we confirm 27 planets in 13 planetary systems by showing the existence ofstatistically significant anti-correlated transit timing variations (ttvs),which demonstrates that the planet candidates are in the same system, andlong-term dynamical stability, which places limits on the masses of thecandidates---showing that they are planetary. %this overall method of planetconfirmation was first applied to \kepler systems 23 through 32. all of thesenewly confirmed planetary systems have orbital periods that place them nearfirst-order mean motion resonances (mmrs), including 6 systems near the 2:1mmr, 5 near 3:2, and one each near 4:3, 5:4, and 6:5. in addition, severalunconfirmed planet candidates exist in some systems (that cannot be confirmedwith this method at this time). a few of these candidates would also be nearfirst order mmrs with either the confirmed planets or with other candidates.one system of particular interest, kepler-56 (koi-1241), is a pair of planetsorbiting a 12th magnitude, giant star with radius over three times that of thesun and effective temperature of 4900 k---among the largest stars known to hosta transiting exoplanetary system.

1208.3712	the neptune-sized circumbinary planet kepler-38b	we discuss the discovery and characterization of the circumbinary planetkepler-38b. the stellar binary is single-lined, with a period of 18.8 days, andconsists of a moderately evolved main-sequence star (m_a = 0.949 +/- 0.059solar masses and r_a = 1.757 +/- 0.034 solar radii) paired with a low-mass star(m_b = 0.249 +/- 0.010 solar masses and r_b = 0.2724 +/- 0.0053 solar radii) ina mildly eccentric (e=0.103) orbit. a total of eight transits due to acircumbinary planet crossing the primary star were identified in the keplerlight curve (using kepler quarters 1 through 11), from which a planetary periodof 105.595 +/- 0.053 days can be established. a photometric dynamical model fitto the radial velocity curve and kepler light curve yields a planetary radiusof 4.35 +/- 0.11 earth radii, or 1.12 +/- 0.03 neptune radii. since the planetis not sufficiently massive to observably alter the orbit of the binary fromkeplerian motion, we can only place an upper limit on the mass of the planet of122 earth masses (7.11 neptune masses or 0.384 jupiter masses) at 95%confidence. this upper limit should decrease as more kepler data becomeavailable.

1208.5709	revisiting rho 1 cancri e: a new mass determination of the transiting  super-earth	we present a mass determination for the transiting super-earth rho 1 cancri ebased on nearly 700 precise radial velocity (rv) measurements. this extensiverv data set consists of data collected by the mcdonald observatory planetsearch and published data from lick and keck observatories (fischer et al.2008). we obtained 212 rv measurements with the tull coude spectrograph at theharlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope and combined them with a new doppler reductionof the 131 spectra that we have taken in 2003-2004 with thehigh-resolution-spectrograph (hrs) at the hobby-eberly telescope (het) for theoriginal discovery of rho 1 cancri e. using this large data set we obtain a5-planet keplerian orbital solution for the system and measure an rvsemi-amplitude of k = 6.29 +/- 0.21 m/s for rho 1 cnc e and determine a mass of8.37 +/- 0.38 m_earth. the uncertainty in mass is thus less than 5%. thisplanet was previously found to transit its parent star (winn et al. 2011,demory et al. 2011), which allowed them to estimate its radius. combined withthe latest radius estimate from gillon et al. (2012), we obtain a mean densityof rho = 4.50 +/- 0.20 g/cm^3. the location of rho 1 cnc e in the mass-radiusdiagram suggests that the planet contains a significant amount of volitales,possibly a water-rich envelope surrounding a rocky core.

1211.6091	h-alpha activity of old m dwarfs: stellar cycles and mean activity  levels for 93 low-mass stars in the solar neighborhood	through the mcdonald observatory m dwarf planet search, we have acquirednearly 3,000 high-resolution spectra of 93 late-type (k5-m5) stars over morethan a decade using het/hrs. this sample provides a unique opportunity toinvestigate the occurrence of long-term stellar activity cycles for low-massstars. in this paper, we examine the stellar activity of our targets asreflected in the h-alpha feature. we have identified periodic signals for 6stars, with periods ranging from days to more than 10 years, and find long-termtrends for 7 others. stellar cycles with p &gt; 1 year are present for at least 5%of our targets. additionally, we present an analysis of the time-averagedactivity levels of our sample, and search for correlations with other stellarproperties. in particular, we find that more massive, earlier type (m0-m2)stars tend to be more active than later type dwarfs. furthermore,high-metallicity stars tend to be more active at a given stellar mass. we alsoevaluate h-alpha variability as a tracer of activity-induced radial velocity(rv) variation. for the m dwarf gj 1170, h-alpha variation reveals stellaractivity patterns matching those seen in the rvs, mimicking the signal of agiant planet, and we find evidence that the previously identified stellaractivity cycle of gj 581 may be responsible for the recently retracted planet f(vogt et al. 2012) in that system. in general, though, we find that h-alpha isnot frequently correlated with rv at the precision (typically 6-7 m/s) of ourmeasurements.

1301.6147	a search for exozodiacal clouds with kepler	planets embedded within dust disks may drive the formation of large scaleclumpy dust structures by trapping dust into resonant orbits. detection andsubsequent modeling of the dust structures would help constrain the mass andorbit of the planet and the disk architecture, give clues to the history of theplanetary system, and provide a statistical estimate of disk asymmetry forfuture exoearth-imaging missions. here we present the first search for theseresonant structures in the inner regions of planetary systems by analyzing thelight curves of hot jupiter planetary candidates identified by the keplermission. we detect only one candidate disk structure associated with koi 838.01at the 3-sigma confidence level, but subsequent radial velocity measurementsreveal that koi 838.01 is a grazing eclipsing binary and the candidate diskstructure is a false positive. using our null result, we place an upper limiton the frequency of dense exozodi structures created by hot jupiters. we findthat at the 90% confidence level, less than 21% of kepler hot jupiters createresonant dust clumps that lead and trail the planet by ~90 degrees with opticaldepths &gt;~5*10^-6, which corresponds to the resonant structure expected for alone hot jupiter perturbing a dynamically cold dust disk 50 times as dense asthe zodiacal cloud.

0801.4403	spitzer observations of the hyades: circumstellar debris disks at 625  myr of age	we use the spitzer space telescope to search for infrared excess at 24, 70,and 160 micron due to debris disks around a sample of 45 fgk-type members ofthe hyades cluster. we supplement our observations with archival 24 and 70micron spitzer data of an additional 22 fgk-type and 11 a-type hyades membersin order to provide robust statistics on the incidence of debris disks at 625myr of age an era corresponding to the late heavy bombardment in the solarsystem. we find that none of the 67 fgk-type stars in our sample show evidencefor a debris disk, while 2 out of the 11 a-type stars do so. this difference indebris disk detection rate is likely to be due to a sensitivity bias in favorof early-type stars. the fractional disk luminosity, l_dust/l*, of the disksaround the two a-type stars is ~4.0e-5, a level that is below the sensitivityof our observations toward the fgk-type stars. however, our sensitivity limitsfor fgk-type stars are able to exclude, at the 2-sigma level, frequencieshigher than 12% and 5% of disks with l_dust/l* &gt; 1.0e-4 and l_dust/l* &gt; 5.0e-4,respectively. we also use our sensitivity limits and debris disk models toconstrain the maximum mass of dust, as a function of distance from the stars,that could remain undetected around our targets.

1405.7695	three regimes of extrasolar planets inferred from host star  metallicities	approximately half of the extrasolar planets (exoplanets) with radii lessthan four earth radii are in orbits with short periods. despite their sheerabundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. the availableevidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rockyplanets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thickhydrogen and helium gas envelopes. understanding the transition from thegaseous planets to earth-like rocky worlds is important to estimate the numberof potentially habitable planets in our galaxy and provide constraints onplanet formation theories. here we report the abundances of heavy elements(that is, the metallicities) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanetcandidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into threepopulations defined by statistically distinct (~ 4.5{\sigma}) metallicityregions. we interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes ofterrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 earth radii), gas dwarf planetswith rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 earthradii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 earth radii). thesetransitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates,implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solidinventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating thestructure of planetary systems.

1406.0512	a misaligned prograde orbit for kepler-13 ab via doppler tomography	transiting planets around rapidly rotating stars are not amenable to preciseradial velocity observations, such as are used for planet candidate validation,as they have wide, rotationally broadened stellar lines. such planets can,however, be observed using doppler tomography, wherein the stellar absorptionline profile distortions during transit are spectroscopically resolved. thisallows the validation of transiting planet candidates and the measurement ofthe stellar spin-planetary orbit (mis)alignment, an important statistical probeof planetary migration processes. we present doppler tomographic observationswhich provide a direct confirmation of the hot jupiter kepler-13 ab, and alsoshow that the planet has a prograde, misaligned orbit, with lambda = 58.6 +/-2.0 degrees. our measured value of the spin-orbit misalignment is insignificant disagreement with the value of lambda = 23 +/- 4 degrees previouslymeasured by barnes et al.

1409.8156	kepler-424 b: a "lonely" hot jupiter that found a companion	hot jupiter systems provide unique observational constraints for migrationmodels in multiple systems and binaries. we report on the discovery of thekepler-424 (koi-214) two-planet system, which consists of a transiting hotjupiter (kepler-424b) in a 3.31-d orbit accompanied by a more massive outercompanion in an eccentric (e=0.3) 223-d orbit. the outer giant planet,kepler-424c, is not detected to transit the host star. the masses of bothplanets and the orbital parameters for the second planet were determined usingprecise radial velocity (rv) measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het)and its high resolution spectrograph (hrs). in stark contrast to smallerplanets, hot jupiters are predominantly found to be lacking any nearbyadditional planets, the appear to be "lonely" (e.g. steffen et al.~2012). thismight be a consequence of a highly dynamical past of these systems. thekepler-424 planetary system is a system with a hot jupiter in a multiplesystem, similar to upsilon andromedae. we also present our results forkepler-422 (koi-22), kepler-77 (koi-127; gandolfi et al.~2013), kepler-43(koi-135; bonomo et al.~2012), and kepler-423 (koi-183). these results arebased on spectroscopic data collected with the nordic optical telescope (not),the keck 1 telescope and het. for all systems we rule out false positives basedon various follow-up observations, confirming the planetary nature of thesecompanions. we performed a comparison with planetary evolutionary models whichindicate that these five hot jupiters have a heavy elements content between 20and 120 m_earth.

1501.02807	stellar activity and its implications for exoplanet detection on gj 176	we present an in-depth analysis of stellar activity and its effects on radialvelocity (rv) for the m2 dwarf gj 176 based on spectra taken over 10 years fromthe high resolution spectrograph on the hobby-eberly telescope. these data aresupplemented with spectra from previous observations with the hires and harpsspectrographs, and v- and r-band photometry taken over 6 years at the dyer andfairborn observatories. previous studies of gj 176 revealed a super-earthexoplanet in an 8.8-day orbit. however, the velocities of this star are alsoknown to be contaminated by activity, particularly at the 39-day stellarrotation period. we have examined the magnetic activity of gj 176 using thesodium i d lines, which have been shown to be a sensitive activity tracer incool stars. in addition to rotational modulation, we see evidence of along-term trend in our na i d index, which may be part of a long-periodactivity cycle. the sodium index is well correlated with our rvs, and we showthat this activity trend drives a corresponding slope in rv. interestingly, therotation signal remains in phase in photometry, but not in the spectralactivity indicators. we interpret this phenomenon as the result of one or morelarge spot complexes or active regions which dominate the photometricvariability, while the spectral indices are driven by the overall magneticactivity across the stellar surface. in light of these results, we discuss thepotential for correcting activity signals in the rvs of m dwarfs.

0705.3228	a planetary system around hd 155358: the lowest metallicity planet host  star	we report the detection of two planetary mass companions to the solar-typestar hd 155358. the two planets have orbital periods of 195.0 and 530.3 days,with eccentricities of 0.11 and 0.18. the minimum masses for these planets are0.89 and 0.50 jupiter masses respectively. the orbits are close enough to eachother, and the planets are sufficiently massive, that the planets aregravitationally interacting with each other, with their eccentricities andarguments of periastron varying with periods of 2300--2700 years. while largeuncertainties remain in the orbital eccentricities, our orbital integrationcalculations indicate that our derived orbits would be dynamically stable forat least 10^8 years. with a metallicity [fe/h] of -0.68, hd 155358 is tied withthe k1iii giant planet host star hd 47536 for the lowest metallicity of anyplanet host star yet found. thus, a star with only 21% of the heavy-elementcontent of our sun was still able to form a system of at least two jovian-massplanets and have their orbits evolve to semi-major axes of 0.6-1.2 au.

astro-ph;0009423	evidence for a long-period planet orbiting epsilon eridani	high precision radial velocity (rv) measurements spanning the years1980.8--2000.0 are presented for the nearby (3.22 pc) k2 v star $\epsilon$ eri.these data, which represent a combination of six independent data sets takenwith four different telescopes, show convincing variations with a period of$\approx$ 7 yrs. a least squares orbital solution using robust estimationyields orbital parameters of period, $p$ = 6.9 yrs, velocity $k$-amplitude $=$19 {\ms}, eccentricity $e$ $=$ 0.6, projected companion mass $m$ sin $i$ = 0.86$m_{jupiter}$, and semi-major axis $a_2$ $=$ 3.3 au. ca ii h&amp;k s-indexmeasurements spanning the same time interval show significant variations withperiods of 3 and 20 yrs, yet none at the rv period. if magnetic activity wereresponsible for the rv variations then it produces a significantly differentperiod than is seen in the ca ii data. given the lack of ca ii variation withthe same period as that found in the rv measurements, the long-lived andcoherent nature of these variations, and the high eccentricity of the impliedorbit, keplerian motion due to a planetary companion seems to be the mostlikely explanation for the observed rv variations. the wide angular separationof the planet from the star (approximately 1 arc-second) and the long orbitalperiod make this planet a prime candidate for both direct imaging andspace-based astrometric measurements.

astro-ph;0204216	searching for planets in the hyades ii: some implications of stellar  magnetic activity	the hyades constitute a homogeneous sample of stars ideal for investigatingthe dependence of planet formation on the mass of the central star. due totheir youth, hyades members are much more chromospherically active than starstraditionally surveyed for planets using high precision radial velocity (rv)techniques. therefore, we have conducted a detailed investigation of whethermagnetic activity of our hyades target stars will interfere with our ability tomake precise rv searches for substellar companions. we measure chromosphericactivity (which we take as a proxy for magnetic activity) by computing theequivalent of the r'hk activity index from the ca ii k line. &lt;r'hk&gt; is notconstant in the hyades: we confirm that it decreases with increasingtemperature in the f stars, and also find it decreases for stars cooler thanmid-k. we examine correlations between simultaneously measured r'hk and rvusing both a classical statistical test and a bayesian odds ratio test. we findthat there is a significant correlation between r'hk and the rv in only 5 ofthe 82 stars in this sample. thus, simple rprime hk-rv correlations willgenerally not be effective in correcting the measured rv values for the effectsof magnetic activity in the hyades. we argue that this implies long timescaleactivity variations (of order a few years; i.e., magnetic cycles or growth anddecay of plage regions) will not significantly hinder our search for planets inthe hyades if the stars are closely monitored for chromospheric activity. thetrends in the rv scatter (sigma'_v) with &lt;r'hk&gt;, vsini, and p_rot for our starsis generally consistent with those found in field stars in the lick planetsearch data, with the notable exception of a shallower dependence of sigma'_von &lt;r'hk&gt; for f stars.

astro-ph;0305110	a planetary companion to gamma cephei a	we report on the detection of a planetary companion in orbit around theprimary star of the binary system $\gamma$ cephei. high precision radialvelocity measurements using 4 independent data sets spanning the time interval1981--2002 reveal long-lived residual radial velocity variations superimposedon the binary orbit that are coherent in phase and amplitude with a period or2.48 years (906 days) and a semi-amplitude of 27.5 m s$^{-1}$. we performed acareful analysis of our ca ii h &amp; k s-index measurements, spectral linebisectors, and {\it hipparcos} photometry. we found no significant variationsin these quantities with the 906-d period. we also re-analyzed the ca ii$\lambda$8662 {\aa} measurements of walker et al. (1992) which showed possibleperiodic variations with the ``planet'' period when first published. thisanalysis shows that periodic ca ii equivalent width variations were onlypresent during 1986.5 -- 1992 and absent during 1981--1986.5. furthermore, arefined period for the ca ii $\lambda$8662 {\aa} variations is 2.14 yrs,significantly less than residual radial velocity period. the most likelyexplanation of the residual radial velocity variations is a planetary masscompanion with $m$ sin $i$ = 1.7 $m_{jupiter}$ and an orbital semi-major axisof $a_2$ $=$ 2.13 au. this supports the planet hypothesis for the residualradial velocity variations for $\gamma$ cep first suggested by walker et al.(1992). with an estimated binary orbital period of 57 years $\gamma$ cep is theshortest period binary system in which an extrasolar planet has been found.this system may provide insights into the relationship between planetary andbinary star formation.

astro-ph;0603007	determination of the orbit of the planetary companion to the metal rich  star hd 45350	we present the precise radial velocity (rv) data for the metal-rich star hd45350 collected with the harlan j. smith (hjs) 2.7 m telescope and thehobby-eberly telescope (het) at mcdonald observatory. this star was noticed byus as a candidate for having a giant planetary companion in a highly eccentricorbit, but the lack of data close to periastron left the amplitude and thusmass of the planet poorly constrained. marcy et al. (2005) announced thepresence of the planet based on their keck/hires data, but those authors alsocautioned that the remaining uncertainties in the orbital solution might belarge due to insufficient data near periastron passage. in order to close thisphase gap we exploited the flexible queue scheduled observing mode of the hetto obtain intensive coverage of the most recent periastron passage of theplanet. in combination with the long term data from the hjs 2.7 m telescope wedetermine a keplerian orbital solution for this system with a period of 962days, an eccentricity of e=0.76 and a velocity semi-amplitude k of 57.4 m/s.the planet has a minimum mass of m sin i = 1.82 +- 0.14 m_jup and an orbitalsemi-major axis of a = 1.92 +-0.07 au.

astro-ph;0604171	detection limits from the mcdonald observatory planet search program	based on the long-term radial-velocity surveys carried out with the mcdonaldobservatory 2.7m harlan j. smith telescope from 1988 to the present, we deriveupper limits to long-period giant planet companions for 31 nearby stars. datafrom three phases of the mcdonald observatory 2.7m planet-search program havebeen merged together and for 17 objects, data from the pioneeringcanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) radial-velocity program have also beenincluded in the companion-limits determination. for those 17 objects, thebaseline of observations is in excess of 23 years, enabling the detection orexclusion of giant planets in orbits beyond 8 au. we also consider thepossibility of eccentric orbits in our computations. at an orbital separationof 5.2 au, we can exclude on average planets of m sin i &gt; 2.0+/-1.1 mjup (e=0)and m sin i &gt; 4.0+/-2.8 mjup (e=0.6) for 25 of the 31 stars in this survey.however, we are not yet able to rule out "true jupiters," i.e. planets of m sini ~ 1 mjup in 5.2 au orbits. these limits are of interest for the spaceinterferometry mission (sim), terrestrial planet finder (tpf), and darwinmissions which will search for terrestrial planets orbiting nearby stars, manyof which are included in this work.

astro-ph;0610247	the extrasolar planet epsilon eridani b - orbit and mass	hubble space telescope observations of the nearby (3.22 pc), k2 v starepsilon eridani have been combined with ground-based astrometric and radialvelocity data to determine the mass of its known companion. we model theastrometric and radial velocity measurements simultaneously to obtain theparallax, proper motion, perturbation period, perturbation inclination, andperturbation size. because of the long period of the companion, \eps b, weextend our astrometric coverage to a total of 14.94 years (including the threeyear span of the \hst data) by including lower-precision ground-basedastrometry from the allegheny multichannel astrometric photometer. radialvelocities now span 1980.8 -- 2006.3. we obtain a perturbation period, p = 6.85+/- 0.03 yr, semi-major axis, alpha =1.88 +/- 0.20 mas, and inclination i =30.1 +/- 3.8 degrees. this inclination is consistent with a previously measureddust disk inclination, suggesting coplanarity. assuming a primary mass m_* =0.83 m_{\sun}, we obtain a companion mass m = 1.55 +/- 0.24 m_{jup}. given therelatively young age of epsilon eri (~800 myr), this accurate exoplanet massand orbit can usefully inform future direct imaging attempts. we predict thenext periastron at 2007.3 with a total separation, rho = 0.3 arcsec at positionangle, p.a. = -27 degrees. orbit orientation and geometry dictate that epsiloneri b will appear brightest in reflected light very nearly at periastron.radial velocities spanning over 25 years indicate an acceleration consistentwith a jupiter-mass object with a period in excess of 50 years, possiblyresponsible for one feature of the dust morphology, the inner cavity.

astro-ph;9712312	on the nature of the radial velocity variability of aldebaran: a search  for spectral line bisector variations	the shape of the ti i 6303.8 a spectral line of aldebaran as measured by theline bisector was investigated using high signal-to-noise, high resolutiondata. the goal of this study was to understand the nature of the 643-day periodin the radial velocity for this star reported by hatzes and cochran. variationsin the line bisector with the radial velocity period would provide strongevidence in support of rotational modulation or stellar pulsations as the causeof the 643-day period. a lack of any bisector variability at this period wouldsupport the planet hypothesis. variations in the line asymmetries are foundwith a period of 49.93 days. these variations are uncorrelated with 643-dayperiod found previously in the radial velocity measurements. it is demonstratedthat this 50-day period is consistent with an m=4 nonradial sectoral g-modeoscillation. the lack of spectral variability with the radial velocity periodof 643 days may provide strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that thisvariability stems from the reflex motion of the central star due to a planetarycompanion having a mass of 11 jupiter masses. however, this long-periodvariability may still be due to a low order (m=2) pulsation mode since thesewould cause bisector variations less than the error measurement.

astro-ph;9712313	a search for variability in the spectral line shapes of tau bootis: does  this star really have a planet?	an analysis is made of the spectral line shapes of tau bootis using highresolution (0.026 a) and high signal-to-noise (s/n~400) data in an effort toconfirm the planet hypothesis for this star. changes in the line shape arequantified using spectral line bisectors and line residuals. we detect novariations in either of these quantities above the level of the noise in thedata. one spectral line, fe i 6213 a, does show a hint of sinusoidal variationsin the bisector velocity span when phased to the radial velocity period of 3.3days, but this is not seen in the bisectors for two other lines, nor in theline residuals. comparisons of the data to the bisector and residual variationsexpected for nonradial pulsations indicate that we can exclude those sectoralnonradial modes having m&gt;2 and all sectoral modes with k&gt;1, where k is theratio of the horizontal to vertical velocities for the pulsations. the lack ofline shape variability and the 469 m/s radial velocity amplitude is stillconsistent with nonradial sectoral modes m=1, and possibly m=2, but with k~1,which is at least 3 orders of magnitude less than the predicted value given the3.3 day period of tau bootis. such low values of k can probably be excludedgiven the lack of photometric variations for this star. although themeasurements presented here do not prove, without any doubt, that tau boo has aplanetary companion, they do add significantly to the increasing body ofevidence in favor of this hypothesis.

astro-ph;9712316	further evidence for the planet around 51 pegasi	the discovery of the planet around the solar-type star 51 pegasi marked awatershed in the search for extrasolar planets. since then seven othersolar-type stars have been discovered, of which several have surprisingly shortorbital periods, like the planet around 51 peg. these planets were detectedusing the indirect technique of measuring variations in the doppler shifts oflines in the spectra of the primary stars. but it is possible that oscillationsof the stars themselves (or other effects) could mimic the signature of theplanets, particularly around the short-period planets. the apparent lack ofspectral and brightness variations, however, led to widespread acceptance thatthere is a planet around 51 peg. this conclusion was challenged by theobservation of systematic variations in the line profile shapes of 51 peg,which suggested stellar oscillations. if these observations are correct, thenthere is no need to invoke a planet around 51 peg to explain the data. here wereport observations of 51 peg at a much higher spectral resolution than thosein ref.9, in which we find no evidence for systematic changes in the lineshapes. the data are most consistent with a planetary companion to 51 peg.
