0903.0862	co line emission in the halo of a radio galaxy at z=2.6	we report the detection of luminous co(3-2) line emission in the halo of thez=2.6 radio galaxy (hzrg) txs0828+193, which has no detected counterpart atoptical to mid-infrared wavelengths implying a stellar mass &lt; few x10^9 m_sunand relatively low star-formation rates. with the iram pdbi we find two coemission line components at the same position at ~80 kpc distance from the hzrgalong the axis of the radio jet, with different blueshifts of few 100 km s^-1relative to the hzrg and a total luminosity of ~2x10^10 k km s^-1 pc^2 detectedat 8 sigma significance. hzrgs have significant galaxy overdensities andextended halos of metal-enriched gas often with embedded clouds or filaments ofdenser material, and likely trace very massive dark-matter halos. the coemission may be associated with a gas-rich, low-mass satellite galaxy withlittle on-going star formation, in contrast to all previous co detections ofgalaxies at similar redshifts. alternatively, the co may be related to a gascloud or filament and perhaps jet-induced gas cooling in the outer halo,somewhat in analogy with extended co emission found in low-redshift galaxyclusters.

0905.0854	the link between scuba and spitzer: cold galaxies at z&lt;1	we show that the far-ir properties of distant luminous and ultraluminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are on average divergent from analogoussources in the local universe. our analysis is based on spitzer mips and iracdata of l_ir&gt;10^10 l_solar, 70um-selected objects in the 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 redshift rangeand supported by a comparison with the iras bright galaxy sample. the majorityof the objects in our sample are described by spectral energy distributions(seds) which peak at longer wavelengths than local sources of equivalent totalinfrared luminosity. this shift in sed peak wavelength implies a noticeablechange in the dust and/or star-forming properties from z~0 to the earlyuniverse, tending towards lower dust temperatures, indicative of strongevolution in the cold dust, `cirrus', component. we show that these objects arepotentially the missing link between the well-studied local ir-luminousgalaxies, spitzer ir populations and scuba sources -- the z&lt;1 counterparts ofthe cold z&gt;1 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) discovered in blank-fieldsubmillimetre surveys. the herschel space observatory is well placed to fullycharacterise the nature of these objects, as its coverage extends over a majorpart of the far-ir/submm sed for a wide redshift range.

0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

0906.1817	investigating the far-ir/radio correlation of star forming galaxies to  z=3	in order to examine the far-ir/radio correlation at high redshift we havestudied the spitzer 70um/far-infrared (far-ir) properties of sub-mjy radiosources from the 13^h xmm-newton/chandra deep field by redshift and galaxytype: active galactic nucleus (agn) or star forming galaxy (sfg). we directlydetect 70um counterparts (at &gt;3sigma significance) for 22.5% (92/408) of theradio sources, while for the rest we perform stacking analysis by redshift andgalaxy type. for the sources detected at 70um we find that the median andscatter of the observed flux density ratio, q70, are similar to previousresults in the literature, but with a slight decrease in q70 towards higherredshifts. of the radio sources detected at 70um 8/92 were already classifiedas agn, but two of which maybe sfgs. for the stacked sources we obtain adetection for the sfgs at every redshift bin which implies they have mean fluxdensities a factor ~5 below the original 70um detection limit. for the stackedagn we obtain a detection only in our highest redshift bin (1&lt;~z&lt;~5) where wemay be sampling hot dust associated with the agn at rest-frame 12-35um. thecombined observed mean value of q70 for the sfgs (detected and non-detected at70um) decreases gradually with redshift, consistent with tracks derived fromempirical spectral energy distributions (seds) of local sfgs. upon closerinspection and when comparing with tracks of appropriate luminosity, the valuesof q70 broadly agree at low redshift. however, at z~1, the observed q70 (forulirgs) is 2sigma below the value seen for local ulirgs tracks, implying adifference in the sed between local and z~1 ulirgs. at higher redshifts, theconvergence of the tracks and the higher uncertainties in q70 do not allow usto determine if such a difference persists.

0911.4134	the comoving infrared luminosity density: domination of cold galaxies  across 0&lt;z&lt;1	in this paper we examine the contribution of galaxies with different infrared(ir) spectral energy distributions (seds) to the comoving infrared luminositydensity, a proxy for the comoving star formation rate (sfr) density. wecharacterise galaxies as having either a cold or hot ir sed depending uponwhether the rest-frame wavelength of their peak ir energy output is above orbelow 90um. our work is based on a far-ir selected sample both in the localuniverse and at high redshift, the former consisting of iras 60um-selectedgalaxies at z&lt;0.07 and the latter of spitzer 70um selected galaxies across0.1&lt;z&lt;1. we find that the total ir luminosity densities for eachredshift/luminosity bin agree well with results derived from other deepmid/far-ir surveys. at z&lt;0.07 we observe the previously known results: thatmoderate luminosity galaxies (l_ir&lt;10^11 lsun) dominate the total luminositydensity and that the fraction of cold galaxies decreases with increasingluminosity, becoming negligible at the highest luminosities. conversely, abovez=0.1 we find that luminous ir galaxies (l_ir&gt;10^11 lsun), the majority ofwhich are cold, dominate the ir luminosity density. we therefore infer thatcold galaxies dominate the ir luminosity density across the whole 0&lt;z&lt;1 range,hence appear to be the main driver behind the increase in sfr density up to z~1whereas local luminous galaxies are not, on the whole, representative of thehigh redshift population.

1002.3365	mid-infrared variability from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	we use the multi-epoch, mid-infrared spitzer deep, wide-field survey toinvestigate the variability of 474,179 objects in 8.1 deg^2 of the ndwfs bootesfield. we perform a difference image analysis of the four available epochsbetween 2004 and 2008, focusing on the deeper 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. we findthat 1.1% of the studied sample meet our standard selection criteria for beingclassed as a variable source. we require that the 3.6 and 4.5 micronlight-curves are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.8) and that their joint varianceexceeds that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2 sigma. we thenexamine the mid-ir colors of the variable sources and match them with x-raysources from the xbootes survey, radio catalogs, 24 micron-selected agncandidates, and spectroscopically identified agns from the agn and galaxyevolution survey (ages). based on their mid-ir colors, most of the variablesources are agns (76%), with smaller contributions from stars (11%), galaxies(6%), and unclassified objects. most of the stellar, galaxy and unclassifiedsources are false positives. for our standard selection criteria, 11-12% of themid-ir counterparts to x-ray sources, 24 micron-selected agn candidates andspectroscopically identified agns show variability. mid-ir agn variability canbe well described by a single power-law structure function with a power-lawindex of 0.5 at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and an amplitude of 0.1 mag onrest-frame time scales of 2 years. the variability amplitude is higher forshorter rest-frame wavelengths and lower luminosities.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1008.4588	galaxy protocluster candidates around z ~ 2.4 radio galaxies	we study the environments of 6 radio galaxies at 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.6 usingwide-field near-infrared images. we use colour cuts to identify galaxies inthis redshift range, and find that three of the radio galaxies are surroundedby significant surface overdensities of such galaxies. the excess galaxies thatcomprise these overdensities are strongly clustered, suggesting they arephysically associated. the colour distribution of the galaxies responsible forthe overdensity are consistent with those of galaxies that lie within a narrowredshift range at z ~ 2.4. thus the excess galaxies are consistent with beingcompanions of the radio galaxies. the overdensities have estimated masses inexcess of 10^14 solar masses, and are dense enough to collapse into virizalisedstructures by the present day: these structures may evolve into groups orclusters of galaxies. a flux-limited sample of protocluster galaxies with k &lt;20.6 mag is derived by statistically subtracting the fore- and backgroundgalaxies. the colour distribution of the protocluster galaxies is bimodal,consisting of a dominant blue sequence, comprising 77 +/- 10% of the galaxies,and a poorly populated red sequence. the blue protocluster galaxies havesimilar colours to local star-forming irregular galaxies (u -v ~ 0.6),suggesting most protocluster galaxies are still forming stars at the observedepoch. the blue colours and lack of a dominant protocluster red sequenceimplies that these cluster galaxies form the bulk of their stars at z &lt; 3.

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1009.3778	selection of ulirgs in infrared and submm surveys	we examine the selection characteristics of infrared and sub-mm surveys withiras, spitzer, blast, herschel and scuba and identify the range of dusttemperatures these surveys are sensitive to, for galaxies in the ulirgluminosity range (12&lt;log(lir)&lt;13), between z=0 and z=4. we find that the extentof the redshift range over which surveys are unbiased is a function of thewavelength of selection, flux density limit and ulirg luminosity. shortwavelength (&lt;200{\mu}m) surveys with iras, spitzer/mips and herschel/pacs aresensitive to all sed types in a large temperature interval (17-87k), over asubstantial fraction of their accessible redshift range. on the other hand,long wavelength (&gt;200{\mu}m) surveys with blast, herschel/ spire and scuba aresignificantly more sensitive to cold ulirgs, disfavouring warmer seds even atlow redshifts. we evaluate observations in the context of survey selectioneffects, finding that the lack of cold ulirgs in the local (z&lt;0.1) universe isnot a consequence of selection and that the range of ulirg temperatures seenlocally is only a subset of a much larger range which exists at high redshift.we demonstrate that the local luminosity-temperature (l-t) relation, whichindicates that more luminous sources are also hotter, is not applicable in thedistant universe when extrapolated to the ulirg regime, because the scatter inobserved temperatures is too large. finally, we show that the differencebetween the ulirg temperature distributions locally and at high redshift is notthe result of galaxies becoming colder due to an l-t relation which evolves asa function of redshift. instead, they are consistent with a picture where theevolution of the infrared luminosity function is temperature dependent, i.e.cold galaxies evolve at a faster rate than their warm counterparts.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

0709.4069	large amounts of optically-obscured star formation in the host galaxies  of some type-2 quasars	we present hubble space telescope images, and spectral energy distributionsfrom optical to infrared wavelengths for a sample of six 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 type-2quasars selected in the mid-infrared using data from the spitzer spacetelescope. all the host galaxies show some signs of disturbance. most seem topossess dusty, star-forming disks. the disk inclination, estimated from theaxial ratio of the hosts, correlates with the depth of the silicate feature inthe mid-infrared spectra, implying that at least some of the reddening towardsthe agn arises in the host galaxy. the star formation rates in these objects,as inferred from the strengths of the pah features and far-infrared continuum,range from 3-90 msun/yr, but are mostly much larger than those inferred fromthe [oii]3727 emission line luminosity, due to obscuration. taken together withstudies of type-2 quasar hosts from samples selected in the optical and x-ray,this is consistent with previous suggestions that two types of extinctionprocesses operate within the type-2 quasar population, namely a component dueto the dusty torus in the immediate environment of the agn, and a more extendedcomponent due to a dusty, star forming disk.

1108.4037	ultra steep spectrum radio sources in the lockman hole: servs  identifications and redshift distribution at the faintest radio fluxes	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources have been successfully used toselect powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z&gt;~2). typically restricted tolarge-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has graduallybecome possible to extend the uss search to sub-mjy levels, thanks to therecent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. here a firstdetailed analysis of the nature of the faintest uss sources is presented. byusing giant metrewave radio telescope and very large array radio observationsof the lockman hole at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz, a sample of 58 uss sources, with610 mhz integrated fluxes above 100 microjy, is assembled. deep infrared dataat 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the spitzer extragalactic representative volumesurvey (servs) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of thesesources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](ab)=19.8 mag.spectroscopic redshifts for 14 uss sources, together with photometric redshiftestimates, improved by the use of the deep servs data, for a further 19objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 andtailing off at high redshifts. the remaining 25 uss sources, with no redshiftestimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]&gt;22-23 mag, from local measurements), whichsuggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mjy usspopulation. the comparison with the square kilometre array design studiessimulated skies models indicate that fanaroff-riley type i radio sources andradio-quiet active galactic nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest usspopulation, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the usstechnique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at thesub-mjy level.

1206.5821	rapid coeval black hole and host galaxy growth in mrc 1138-262: the  hungry spider	we present a detailed study of the infrared spectral energy distribution ofthe high-redshift radio galaxy mrc 1138-26 at z = 2.156, also known as thespiderweb galaxy. by combining photometry from spitzer, herschel and laboca wefit the rest-frame 5-300 um emission using a two component, starburst andactive galactic nucleus (agn), model. the total infrared (8 - 1000 um)luminosity of this galaxy is (1.97+/-0.28)x10^13 lsun with (1.17+/-0.27) and(0.79+/-0.09)x10^13 lsun due to the agn and starburst components respectively.the high derived agn accretion rate of \sim20% eddington, and the measured starformation rate (sfr) of 1390pm150 msun/yr, suggest that this massive system isin a special phase of rapid central black hole and host galaxy growth, likelycaused by a gas rich merger in a dense environment. the accretion rate issufficient to power both the jets and the previously observed large outflow.the high sfr and strong outflow suggest this galaxy could potentially exhaustits fuel for stellar growth in a few tens of myr, although the likely merger ofthe radio galaxy with nearby satellites suggest bursts of star formation mayrecur again on time scales of several hundreds of myr. the age of the radiolobes implies the jet started after the current burst of star formation, andtherefore we are possibly witnessing the transition from a merger-inducedstarburst phase to a radio-loud agn phase. we also note tentative evidence for[cii]158um emission. this paper marks the first results from the herschelgalaxy evolution project (project herge), a systematic study of theevolutionary state of 71 high redshift, 1 &lt; z &lt; 5.2, radio galaxies.

1208.3079	herschel-atlas: multi-wavelength seds and physical properties of 250  micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5	we present a pan-chromatic analysis of an unprecedented sample of 1402 250micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5 (mean z = 0.24) from the herschel-atlassurvey. we complement our herschel 100-500 micron data with uv-k-bandphotometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey and apply themagphys energy-balance technique to produce pan-chromatic seds for arepresentative sample of 250 micron selected galaxies spanning the most recent5 gyr of cosmic history. we derive estimates of physical parameters, includingstar formation rates, stellar masses, dust masses and infrared luminosities.the typical h-atlas galaxy at z &lt; 0.5 has a far-infrared luminosity in therange 10^10 - 10^12 lsolar (sfr: 1-50 msolar/yr) thus is broadly representativeof normal star forming galaxies over this redshift range. we show that 250micron-selected galaxies contain a larger mass of dust at a given infra-redluminosity or star formation rate than previous samples selected at 60 micronfrom iras. we derive typical seds for h-atlas galaxies, and show that theemergent sed shape is most sensitive to specific star formation rate. theoptical-uv seds also become more reddened due to dust at higher redshifts. ourtemplate seds are significantly cooler than existing infra-red templates. theymay therefore be most appropriate for inferring total ir luminosities frommoderate redshift submillimetre selected samples and for inclusion in models ofthe lower redshift submillimetre galaxy populations.

1209.5399	jet and torus orientations in high redshift radio galaxies	we examine the relative orientation of radio jets and dusty tori surroundingthe agn in powerful radio galaxies at z &gt; 1. the radio core dominance r = p(20ghz) /p(500 mhz) serves as an orientation indicator, measuring the ratiobetween the anisotropic doppler-beamed core extended core emission and theisotropic lobe emission. assuming a fixed cylindrical geometry for the hot,dusty torus, we derive its inclination i by fitting optically-thick radiativetransfer models to spectral energy distributions obtained with the spitzerspace telescope. we find a highly significant anti-correlation (p &lt; 0.0001)between r and i in our sample of 35 type 2 agn combined with a sample of 18 z =1 3cr sources containing both type 1 and 2 agn. this analysis providesobservational evidence both for the unified scheme of agn and for the commonassumption that radio jets are in general perpendicular to the plane of thetorus. the use of inclinations derived from mid-infrared photometry breaksseveral degeneracies which have been problematic in earlier analyses. weillustrate this by deriving the core lorentz factor gamma from the r-ianti-correlation, finding gamma &gt; 1.3.

1210.4932	a population of z&gt;2 far-infrared herschel-spire selected starbursts	we present spectroscopic observations for a sample of 36 herschel-spire250-500um selected galaxies (hsgs) at 2&lt;z&lt;5 from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). redshifts are confirmed as part of a largeredshift survey of herschel-spire-selected sources covering ~0.93deg^2 in sixextragalactic legacy fields. observations were taken with the keck i lowresolution imaging spectrometer (lris) and the keck ii deep imagingmulti-object spectrograph (deimos). precise astrometry, needed forspectroscopic follow-up, is determined by identification of counterparts at24um or 1.4ghz using a cross-identification likelihood matching method.individual source luminosities range from log(l_ir/lsun)=12.5-13.6(corresponding to star formation rates 500-9000msun/yr, assuming a salpeterimf), constituting some of the most intrinsically luminous, distant infraredgalaxies yet discovered. we present both individual and composite rest-frameultraviolet spectra and infrared spectral energy distributions (seds). theselection of these hsgs is reproducible and well characterized across largeareas of sky in contrast to most z&gt;2 hylirgs in the literature which aredetected serendipitously or via tailored surveys searching only for high-zhylirgs; therefore, we can place lower limits on the contribution of hsgs tothe cosmic star formation rate density at (7+-2)x10^(-3)msun/yr h^3mpc^(-3) atz~2.5, which is &gt;10% of the estimated total star formation rate density (sfrd)of the universe from optical surveys. the contribution at z~4 has a lower limitof 3x10^(-3)msun/yr h^3 mpc^(-3), ~&gt;20% of the estimated total sfrd. thishighlights the importance of extremely infrared-luminous galaxies with highstar formation rates to the build-up of stellar mass, even at the earliestepochs.

1301.6012	co(1-0) detection of molecular gas in the massive spiderweb galaxy (z=2)	the high-redshift radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 (`spiderweb galaxy'; z = 2.16),is one of the most massive systems in the early universe and surrounded by adense `web' of proto-cluster galaxies. using the australia telescope compactarray, we detected co(1-0) emission from cold molecular gas -- the rawingredient for star formation -- across the spiderweb galaxy. we infer amolecular gas mass of m(h2) = 6x10^10 m(sun) (for m(h2)/l'(co)=0.8). while thebulk of the molecular gas coincides with the central radio galaxy, there areindications that a substantial fraction of this gas is associated withsatellite galaxies or spread across the inter-galactic medium on scales of tensof kpc. in addition, we tentatively detect co(1-0) in the star-formingproto-cluster galaxy hae 229, 250 kpc to the west. our observations areconsistent with the fact that the spiderweb galaxy is building up its stellarmass through a massive burst of widespread star formation. at maximum starformation efficiency, the molecular gas will be able to sustain the currentstar formation rate (sfr ~ 1400 m(sun)/yr, as traced by seymour et al.) forabout 40 myr. this is similar to the estimated typical lifetime of a majorstarburst event in infra-red luminous merger systems.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1307.3556	herschel reveals the obscured star formation in hizels h\alpha\ emitters  at z=1.47	we describe the far-infrared (fir; rest-frame 8--1000\mu m) properties of asample of 443 h\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies in the cosmos and udsfields detected by the hizels imaging survey. sources are identified usingnarrow-band filters in combination with broad-band photometry to uniformlyselect h\alpha\ (and [oii] if available) emitters in a narrow redshift slice atz = 1.47+/-0.02. we use a stacking approach in spitzer, herschel (from pep andhermes surveys) and aztec images to describe their typical fir properties. wefind that hizels galaxies with observed h\alpha\ luminosities of ~ 10^{8.1-9.1}lo have bolometric fir luminosities of typical lirgs, l_fir ~ 10^{11.48+/-0.05}lo. combining the h\alpha\ and fir luminosities, we derive median sfr = 32+/-5mo/yr and h\alpha\ extinctions of a(h\alpha) = 1.0+/-0.2 mag. perhapssurprisingly, little difference is seen in typical hizels extinction levelscompared to local star-forming galaxies. we confirm previous empirical stellarmass (m*) to a(h\alpha) relations and the little or no evolution up to z =1.47. for hizels galaxies, we provide an empirical parametrisation of the sfras a function of (u-z)_rest colours and 3.6\mu m photometry. we find that theobserved h\alpha\ luminosity is a dominant sfr tracer when (u-z)_rest ~&lt; 0.9mag or when 3.6\mu m photometry &gt; 22 mag (vega) or when m* &lt; 10^9.7 mo. we donot find any correlation between the [oii]/h\alpha\ and fir luminosity,suggesting that this emission line ratio does not trace the extinction of themost obscured star-forming regions. the luminosity-limited hizels sample tendsto lie above of the so-called `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies,especially at low m*. this work suggests that obscured star formation is linkedto the assembly of m*, with deeper potential wells in massive galaxiesproviding dense, heavily obscured environments in which stars can form rapidly.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

0802.4105	the star formation history of the universe as revealed by deep radio  observations	discerning the exact nature of the sub-mjy radio population has beenhistorically difficult due to the low luminosity of these sources at mostwavelengths. using deep ground based optical follow-up and observations fromthe spitzer space telescope we are able to disentangle the radio-selectedactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star forming galaxy (sfg) populations for thefirst time in a deep multi-frequency vla/merlin survey of the 13^hxmm-newton/chandra deep field. the discrimination diagnostics include radiomorphology, radio spectral index, radio/near-ir and mid-ir/radio flux densityratios. we are now able to calculate the extragalactic euclidean normalisedsource counts separately for agn and sfgs. we find that while sfgs dominate atthe faintest flux densities and account for the majority of the up-turn in thecounts, agn still make up around one quarter of the counts at ~5 ujy (1.4 ghz).using radio luminosity as an unobscured star formation rate (sfr) measure weare then able to examine the comoving sfr density of the universe up to z=3which agrees well with measures at other wavelengths. we find a roughcorrelation of sfr with stellar mass for both the sample presented here and asample of local radio-selected sfgs from the 6df-nvss survey. this work alsoconfirms the existence of, and provides alternative evidence for, the evolutionof distribution of star formation by galaxy mass: ``downsizing''. as both thesesamples are sfr-selected, this result suggests that there is a maximum sfr fora given galaxy that depends linearly on its stellar mass. the low``characteristic times'' (inverse specific sfr) of the sfgs in our sample aresimilar to those of the 6df-nvss sample, implying that most of these sourcesare in a current phase of enhanced star formation.

1409.1218	why z &gt; 1 radio-loud galaxies are commonly located in proto-clusters	distant powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (rlagn) tend to reside indense environments and are commonly found in proto-clusters at z &gt; 1.3. weexamine whether this occurs because rlagn are hosted by massive galaxies, whichpreferentially reside in rich environments. we compare the environments ofpowerful rlagn at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 from the carla survey to a sample ofradio-quiet galaxies matched in mass and redshift. we find the environments ofrlagn are significantly denser than those of radio-quiet galaxies, implyingthat not more than 50% of massive galaxies in this epoch can host powerfulradio-loud jets. this is not an observational selection effect as we find noevidence to suggest it is easier to observe the radio emission when the galaxyresides in a dense environment. we therefore suggest that the dense mpc-scaleenvironment fosters the formation of a radio-jet from an agn. we show that thenumber density of potential rlagn host galaxies is consistent with every &gt;10^14 solar mass cluster having experienced powerful radio-loud feedback ofduration ~60 myr during 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. this feedback could heat theintracluster medium to the extent of 0.5-1 kev per gas particle, which couldlimit the amount of gas available for further star formation in theproto-cluster galaxies.

1410.3730	an excess of dusty starbursts related to the spiderweb galaxy	we present apex laboca 870 micron observations of the field around thehigh-redshift radio galaxy mrc1138-262 at z=2.16. we detect 16 submillimetergalaxies in this ~140 square arcmin bolometer map with flux densities in therange 3-11 mjy. the raw number counts indicate a density of submillimetergalaxies (smgs) that is up to four times that of blank field surveys. based onan exquisite multiwavelength database, including vla 1.4 ghz radio and infraredobservations, we investigate whether these sources are members of theprotocluster structure at z=2.2. using herschel pacs+spire and spitzer mipsphotometry, we derive reliable far-infrared photometric redshifts for allsources. follow-up vlt isaac and sinfoni near-infrared spectra confirm thatfour of these smgs have redshifts of z=2.2. we also present evidence thatanother smg in this field, detected earlier at 850 micron, has a counterpartthat exhibits halpha and co(1-0) emission at z=2.15. including the radio galaxyand two smgs with far-ir photometric redshifts at z=2.2, we conclude that atleast eight submm sources are part of the protocluster at z=2.16 associatedwith the radio galaxy mrc1138-262. we measure a star formation rate densitysfrd ~1500 msun yr^-1 mpc^-3, four magnitudes higher than the global sfrd ofblank fields at this redshift. strikingly, these eight sources are concentratedwithin a region of 2 mpc (the typical size of clusters in the local universe)and are distributed within the filaments traced by the halpha emitters atz=2.2. this concentration of massive, dusty starbursts is not centered on thesubmillimeter-bright radio galaxy which could support the infalling of thesesources into the cluster center. approximately half (6/11) of the smgs that arecovered by the halpha imaging data are associated with halpha emitters,demonstrating the potential of tracing smg counterparts with this population(abridged).

1412.6512	revealing the physics and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters with  ska continuum surveys	in this chapter we provide an overview of the science enabled by radiocontinuum surveys in the ska era, focusing on galaxy/galaxy cluster physics andevolution studies, and other relevant continuum science in the &gt;2020 scientificframework. we outline a number of 'reference' radio-continuum surveys for ska1that can address such topics, and comprehensively discuss the most criticalscience requirements that we have identified. we highlight what should beachieved by ska1, to guarantee a major leap forwards with respect to thepre-ska era, considering the science advances expected in the coming years withexisting and upcoming telescopes (jvla, lofar, emerlin, and the three skaprecursors: mwa, askap and meerkat). in this exercise we take in due accountalso the other waveband facilities coming online at the same time (e.g. euclid,lsst, etc.), which tackle overlapping scientific goals, but in a differentmanner. in this respect particular attention has been payed to ensure that theproposed reference surveys are able to exploit the existing synergies with suchfacilities, so as to generate strong involvement from all astronomicalcommunities, and leave a lasting legacy value. it is clear that a certaindegree of freedom is allowed to some of the observational parameters. webelieve it is very important to best fine-tune such parameters taking intoproper account existing commensalities with ska1 surveys addressing otherscience areas (hi galaxy science, magnetism, cosmology).

0705.2031	the 12um iso-eso-sculptor and 24um spitzer faint counts reveal a  population of ulirg/agn/dusty massive ellipticals evolution by types and  cosmic star formation	multi-wavelength galaxy number counts provide clues on the nature of galaxyevolution. the interpretation per galaxy type with the new code pegase.3 of the12mu (iso) and 24mu (spitzer) faint galaxy counts provide new constraints onthe dust and stellar emission. it also reveals the nature of ulirgs (l/lsun &gt;10^12) and informs on the cosmic star formation history and the time-scales formass build-up. we firstly present the faint galaxy counts at 12um derived fromthe catalogue of the iso-eso-sculptor survey (iso-ess) in a companion paper(seymour et al. 2007) which go down to 0.24 mjy after corrections forincompleteness. we check that they are consistent with iso number counts at15um. secondly we show that the ``normal'' scenarios which fit the deepuv-optical-near-ir counts with pegase.2 (fioc et al. 1999), are unsuccessful inmodelling the strong excess simultaneously observed in the cumulative anddifferential counts at 12um, 15um and 24um. based on observed 12mu and 25muiras luminosity functions and optical/mid-ir colors, we finally succeed inmodelling cumulative and differential counts by only changing 9% of normalgalaxies (1/3 of the ellipticals) into ultra-bright dusty elliptical galaxies,interpreted as ulirgs. this ulirg population has similarities with high-zradio-galaxy hosts. no number density evolution is included. the herschelobservatory will hopefully confirm these results.

1505.00949	a co-rich merger shaping a powerful and hyper-luminous infrared radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy	in the low-redshift universe, the most powerful radio sources are oftenassociated with gas-rich galaxy mergers or interactions. we here presentevidence for an advanced, gas-rich (`wet') merger associated with a powerfulradio galaxy at a redshift of z~2. this radio galaxy, mrc 0152-209, is the mostinfrared-luminous high-redshift radio galaxy known in the southern hemisphere.using the australia telescope compact array, we obtained high-resolutionco(1-0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with hst/wfpc2 imagingand wht long-slit spectroscopy. we find that, while roughly m(h2) ~ 2 x10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy,another m(h2) ~ 3 x 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ is spread across a total extent of~60 kpc. most of this widespread co(1-0) appears to follow prominent tidalfeatures visible in the rest-frame near-uv hst/wfpc2 imaging. ly$\alpha$emission shows an excess over heii, but a deficiency over l(ir), which islikely the result of photo-ionisation by enhanced but very obscured starformation that was triggered by the merger. in terms of feedback, the radiosource is aligned with widespread co(1-0) emission, which suggests that thereis a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of coldmolecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. its optical appearance, combinedwith the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of mrc0152-209, leads us to adopt the name `dragonfly galaxy'.

0805.1914	the type iib sn 2008ax: spectral and light curve evolution	we present spectroscopy and photometry of the he-rich supernova (sn) 2008ax.the early-time spectra show prominent p-cygni h lines, which decrease with timeand disappear completely about two months after the explosion. in the sameperiod he i lines become the most prominent spectral features. sn 2008axdisplays the ordinary spectral evolution of a type iib supernova. a stringentpre-discovery limit constrains the time of the shock breakout of sn 2008ax towithin only a few hours. its light curve, which peaks in the b band about 20days after the explosion, strongly resembles that of other he-richcore-collapse supernovae. the observed evolution of sn 2008ax is consistentwith the explosion of a young wolf-rayet (of wnl type) star, which had retaineda thin, low-mass shell of its original h envelope. the overall characteristicsof sn 2008ax are reminiscent of those of sn 1993j, except for a likely smallerh mass. this may account for the findings that the progenitor of sn 2008ax wasa wnl star and not a k supergiant as in the case of sn 1993j, that a prominentearly-time peak is missing in the light curve of sn 2008ax, and that halpha isobserved at higher velocities in sn 2008ax than in sn 1993j.

0805.2143	mid-infrared spectra of high redshift (z&gt;2) radio galaxies	we present the first mid-infrared spitzer/infrared spectrograph (irs)observations of powerful radio galaxies at z&gt;2. these radio galaxies, 4c +23.56(z=2.48) and 6c j1908+7220 (z=3.53), both show strong mid-infrared continua,but with 6c j1908+7220 also showing strong pah emission at rest-frame 6.2 and7.7um. in 4c+23.56 we see no obvious pah features above the continuum. the pahemission in 6c j1908+7220 is the amongst the most distant observed to date andimplies that there is a large instantaneous star formation rate (sfr). this isconsistent with the strong detection of 6c j1908+7220 at far-ir and sub-mmwavelengths, indicative of large amounts of cold dust, ~10^9msun. powerfulradio galaxies at lower redshifts tend to have weak or undetectable pahfeatures and typically have lower far-ir luminosities. in addition, 4c 23.56shows moderate silicate absorption as seen in less luminous radio galaxies,indicating tau_{9.7um}=0.3+/-0.05. this feature is shifted out of the observedwavelength range for 6c j1908+7220. the correlation of strong pah features withlarge amounts of cold dust, despite the presence of a powerful agn, is inagreement with other recent results and implies that star formation at highredshift is, in some cases at least, associated with powerful, obscured agn.

1507.00350	the formation history of massive cluster galaxies as revealed by carla	we use a sample of 37 of the densest clusters and protoclusters across $1.3\le z \le 3.2$ from the clusters around radio-loud agn (carla) survey to studythe formation of massive cluster galaxies. we use optical $i'$-band andinfrared 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m images to statistically select sources withinthese protoclusters and measure their median observed colours; $\langlei'-[3.6] \rangle$. we find the abundance of massive galaxies within theprotoclusters increases with decreasing redshift, suggesting these objects mayform an evolutionary sequence, with the lower redshift clusters in the samplehaving similar properties to the descendants of the high redshiftprotoclusters. we find that the protocluster galaxies have an approximatelyunevolving observed-frame $i'-[3.6]$ colour across the examined redshift range.we compare the evolution of the $\langle i'-[3.6] \rangle$ colour of massivecluster galaxies with simplistic galaxy formation models. taking the fullcluster population into account, we show that the formation of stars within themajority of massive cluster galaxies occurs over at least 2gyr, and peaks at $z\sim 2$-3. from the median $i'-[3.6]$ colours we cannot determine the starformation histories of individual galaxies, but their star formation must havebeen rapidly terminated to produce the observed red colours. finally, we showthat massive galaxies at $z&gt;2$ must have assembled within 0.5gyr of themforming a significant fraction of their stars. this means that few massivegalaxies in $z&gt;2$ protoclusters could have formed via dry mergers.

1507.07044	hermes: disentangling active galactic nuclei and star formation in the  radio source population	we separate the extragalactic radio source population above ~50 ujy intoactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star-forming sources. the primary method ofour approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed using spitzer/irac and mips and herschel/spire photometry, of 380radio sources in the extended chandra deep field-south. from the fitted seds,we determine the relative agn and star-forming contributions to their infraredemission. with the inclusion of other agn diagnostics such as x-ray luminosity,spitzer/irac colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming totalinfrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 ghz flux density, qir, we determine whetherthe radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an agn.the majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an agnat some wavelength. of the sources with agn signatures, 58 per cent are hybridsystems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. thisimplies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their starformation have a high agn fraction. below a 1.4 ghz flux density of 1 mjy,along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from purestar-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20-65 per cent ofthe sources. this result suggests that hybrid sources have a significantcontribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable agn, to theobserved flattening of the source counts at ~1mjy for the extragalactic radiosource population.

0808.2414	properties of x-ray selected broad absorption line quasars	broad absorption line quasars (commonly termed balqsos) contain the mostdramatic examples of agn-driven winds. the high absorbing columns in thesewinds, ~10^24 cm^-2, ensure that balqsos are generally x-ray faint. this highx-ray absorption means that almost all balqsos have been discovered throughoptical surveys, and so what little we know about their x-ray properties isderived from very bright optically-selected sources. a small number of x-rayselected balqsos (xbalqsos) have, however, recently been found in deep x-raysurvey fields. in this paper we investigate the x-ray and rest-frame uvproperties of five xbalqsos for which we have obtained xmm-newton epic x-rayspectra and deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. we find that, although thexbalqsos have an alpha_ox steeper by ~0.5 than normal qsos, their medianalpha_ox is nevertheless flatter by 0.30 than that of a comparable sample ofoptically selected balqsos (obalqsos). we rule out the possibility that thehigher x-ray to optical flux ratio is due to intrinsic optical extinction. wefind that the amount of x-ray and uv absorption due to the wind in xbalqsos issimilar, or perhaps greater than, the corresponding wind absorption inobalqsos, so the flatter alpha_ox cannot be a result of weaker wind absorption.we conclude that these xbalqsos have intrinsically higher x-ray to optical fluxratios than the obalqso sample with which we compare them.

astro-ph;0510733	vimos-vlt and spitzer observations of a radio galaxy at z=2.5	we present: 1) a kinematic and morphological study of the giant lya nebulaassociated with the radio galaxy mrc2104-242 (z = 2.49) based on integral fieldspectroscopic vimos data from vlt; 2) a photometric study of the host (proto?)galaxy based on spitzer space telescope data.  the galaxy appears to be embedded in a giant (&gt;120 kpc) gas reservoir thatsurrounds it completely. the kinematic properties of the nebula suggest that itis a rotating structure, which would imply a lower limit to the dynamical massof ~3 x 1e11 msun. an alternate scenario is that the gas is infalling. such aprocess would be able to initiate and sustain significant central starburstactivity, although it is likely to contribute with less than 10% of the totalstellar mass of the galaxy.  the near- to mid-ir spectral energy distribution of the radio galaxy suggeststhe existence of a reddened, e(b-v)=0.4(+/-)0 .1$, evolved stellar populationof age &gt;~ 1.8 gyr and mass 5(+/-)2 x 1e11 msun. the implied formation redshiftis z_f &gt;~ 6. this stellar mass is similar to the stellar masses found formassive early-type galaxies at z~2 in deep, near-infrared surveys.

astro-ph;0604015	x-ray spectra of sources in the 13h xmm-newton / chandra deep field	we present the x-ray spectra of 86 optically-identified sources in the 13hxmm-newton/chandra deep field which have &gt;70 x-ray counts. the sample consistsof 50 broad line agn, 25 narrow emission line galaxies, 6 absorption linegalaxies, and 5 galactic stars. the majority (42/50) of the broad line agn havex-ray spectra which are consistent with a power law shape. they have a meanphoton index of gamma = 2.0 +- 0.1 and an intrinsic dispersion sigma = 0.4 +-0.1. five blagn show a deficit of soft x-rays, indicating absorption.significant absorption is more common in the narrow emission line galaxies(13/25) and absorption line galaxies (2/6) than in the broad line agn (5/50),but is not universal in any of these classes of object. the majority of the 20absorbed sources have x-ray spectra consistent with a simple cold photoelectricabsorber, but 6/20 require more complex models with either an additionalcomponent of soft x-ray emitting plasma, or an ionised absorber. of the 16galaxies which do not show evidence for x-ray absorption, only 2 objects arelikely to be powered by star formation, and both have 2-10 kev x-rayluminosities of &lt;= 10^40 cgs. the x-ray emission in the other 14 unabsorbednelgs and galaxies is most likely powered by agn, which are not detected in theoptical because they are outshone by their luminous host galaxies. the galacticstars show multi-temperature thermal spectra which peak between 0.5 and 1 kev.star/agn discrimination is possible for 4 of the 5 stars solely from theirx-ray spectra.

astro-ph;0612134	the star-formation history of the universe as revealed from deep radio  observations of the 13h xmm-newton/chandra deep field	discerning the exact nature of the faint (sub-mjy) radio population has beenhistorically difficult due to the low luminosity of these sources at mostwavelengths. using deep observations from chandra/xmm-newton/spitzer and groundbased follow up we are able to disentangle the agn and star-forming populationsfor the first time in a deep multi-frequency gmrt/vla/merlin survey. the manydiagnostics include radio luminosity, morphology, radio to mid-ir flux densityratios, radio to optical flux density ratios and radio spectral indices.further diagnostics, e.g. optical spectra x-ray spectra/hardness ratios, ircolours indicate the presence of the agn {\em independent} of whether the radioemission is powered by agn or star-formation. we are able to examine thestar-formation history of the universe up to z=2.5 in a unique way based on anunbiased star-formation rate indicator, radio luminosity. this work provides analternative perspective on the distribution of star-formation by mass,``downsizing'' and allows us to examine the prevalence of agn in star-bursts.

astro-ph;0612143	an extreme rotation measure in the high-redshift radio galaxy pks  b0529-549	we present the results of a radio polarimetric study of the high-redshiftradio galaxy pks b0529-549 (z=2.575), based on high-resolution 12 mm and 3 cmimages obtained with the australia telescope compact array (atca). the sourceis found to have a rest-frame faraday rotation measure of -9600 rad m^{-2}, thelargest seen thus far in the environment of a z &gt; 2 radio galaxy. in addition,the rest-frame faraday dispersion in the screen responsible for the rotation iscalculated to be 5800 rad m^{-2}, implying rotation measures as large as -15400rad m^{-2}. using supporting near-ir imaging from the very large telescope(vlt), we suggest that the rotation measure originates in the ly-alpha halosurrounding the host galaxy, and estimate the magnetic field strength to be ~10microgauss. we also present a new optical spectrum of pks b0529-549 obtainedwith the new technology telescope (ntt), and propose that the emission-lineratios are best described by a photoionization model. furthermore, the hostgalaxy is found to exhibit both hot dust emission at 8.0 microns andsignificant internal visual extinction (~1.6 mag), as inferred from spitzerspace telescope near/mid-ir imaging.
