0812.3956	a sensitive search for [nii] emission in a z=6.4 quasar host galaxy	we present a sensitive search for the ^3p_1-&gt;^3p_0 ground state finestructure line at 205 microns of ionized nitrogen ([nii]) in one of the highestredshift quasars (j1148+5251 at z=6.42) using the iram 30m telescope. the lineis not detected at a (3 sigma) depth of 0.47 jy km s^-1, corresponding to a[nii] luminosity limit of l_[nii] &lt; 4.0x10^8 l_sun and a l_[nii]/l$_fir ratioof &lt;2x10^-5. in parallel, we have observed the co(j=6-5) line in j1148+5251,which is detected at a flux level consistent with earlier interferometricobservations. using our earlier measurements of the [cii] 158 micron linestrength, we derive an upper limit for the [nii]/[cii] line luminosity ratio of~1/10 in j1148+5251. our upper limit for the [cii]/[nii] ratio is similar tothe value found for our galaxy and m82 (the only extragalactic system where the[nii] line has been detected to date). given the non-detection of the [nii]line we can only speculate whether or not high-z detections are within reach ofcurrently operating observatories. however, [nii] and other fine strucure lineswill play a critical role in characterizing the interstellar medium at thehighest redshifts (z&gt;7) using the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array(alma), for which the highly excited rotational transitions of co will beshifted outside the accessible (sub-)millimeter bands.

0902.0662	a kiloparsec-scale hyper-starburst in a quasar host less than 1 gigayear  after the big bang	the host galaxy of the quasar sdss j114816.64+525150.3 (at redshift z=6.42,when the universe was &lt;1 billion years old) has an infrared luminosity of2.2x10^13 l_sun, presumably significantly powered by a massive burst of starformation. in local examples of extremely luminous galaxies such as arp220, theburst of star formation is concentrated in the relatively small central regionof &lt;100pc radius. it is unknown on which scales stars are forming in activegalaxies in the early universe, which are likely undergoing their initial burstof star formation. we do know that at some early point structures comparable tothe spheroidal bulge of the milky way must have formed. here we report aspatially resolved image of [cii] emission of the host galaxy ofj114816.64+525150.3 that demonstrates that its star forming gas is distributedover a radius of ~750pc around the centre. the surface density of the starformation rate averaged over this region is ~1000 m_sun/yr/kpc^2. this surfacedensity is comparable to the peak in arp220, though ~2 orders of magnitudeslarger in area. this vigorous star forming event will likely give rise to amassive spheroidal component in this system.

0902.2131	multi-frequency imaging of the galaxy cluster abell 2163 using the  sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we used the apex-sz and laboca bolometer cameras on the apex telescope to mapthe decrement of the sunyaev-zeldovich effect at 150 ghz and the increment at345 ghz toward the galaxy cluster abell 2163. the sze images were used to modelthe radial density and temperature distribution of the icm, and to derive thegas mass fraction in the cluster under the assumption of hydrostaticequilibrium. we used the isothermal beta model to fit the szedecrement/increment radial profiles. we performed a simple, non-parametricde-projection of the radial density and temperature profiles, in conjunctionwith xmm-newton x-ray data, under the simplifying assumption of sphericalsymmetry. we combined the peak sze signals derived in this paper with publishedsze measurements of this cluster to derive the cluster line-of-sight bulkvelocity and the central comptonization, using priors on the icm temperature.we find that the best-fit isothermal model to the sze data is consistent withthe icm properties implied by the x-ray data, particularly inside the central 1mpc radius. although the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and sphericalsymmetry may not be optimal for this complex system, the results obtained underthese assumptions are consistent with x-ray and weak-lensing measurements. thisshows the applicability of the simple joint sze and x-ray de-projectiontechnique described in this paper for clusters with a wide range of dynamicalstates.

0904.3939	constraints on the high-l power spectrum of millimeter-wave anisotropies  from apex-sz	we present measurements of the angular power spectrum of millimeter waveanisotropies with the apex-sz instrument. apex-sz has mapped 0.8 square degreesof sky at a frequency of 150 ghz with an angular resolution of 1'. these newmeasurements significantly improve the constraints on anisotropy power at 150ghz over the range of angular multipoles 3000 &lt; l &lt; 10,000, limiting the totalastronomical signal in a flat band power to be less than 105 microk^2 at 95%cl. we expect both submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies and to a lesser extentsecondary cmb anisotropies from the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) tosignificantly contribute to the observed power. subtracting the sze powerspectrum expected for sigma_8=0.8 and masking bright sources, the best fitvalue for the remaining power is c_l = 1.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8} x 10^{-5} micro k^2(1.7^{+1.4}_{-1.3} jy^2 sr^{-1}). this agrees well with model predictions forpower due to submillimeter-bright, dusty galaxies. comparing this power to thepower detected by blast at 600 ghz, we find the frequency dependence of thesource fluxes to be s_nu ~ nu^{2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.2}} if both experiments measurethe same population of sources. simultaneously fitting for the amplitude of thesze power spectrum and a poisson distributed point source population, we placean upper limit on the matter fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 &lt; 1.18 at 95%confidence.

0910.2821	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south	we present a sensitive 870 micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs) using laboca on the apex telescope. the laboca ecdfssubmillimetre survey (less) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ecdfsand has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mjy/beam. less is thus the largestcontiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. the noise propertiesof our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected byconfusion noise. we present a catalog of 126 smgs detected with a significancelevel above 3.7 sigma. the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative topreviously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies thatdominate the extragalactic background light (ebl). this is in line with theunderdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populationsin the ecdfs (bzks, drgs,optically bright agn and massive k-band selectedgalaxies). the differential source counts in the full field are well describedby a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from otherfields. we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across thefield. the integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count modelsaccount for &gt;65% of the estimated ebl from cobe measurements. we haveinvestigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two-pointcorrelation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales&lt;1'. assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typicalredshift distribution for the smgs we derive a spatial correlation length ofr_0=13+/-6 h^-1 mpc.

0910.5756	molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous  galaxies at z&gt;1	[abridged] we present interferometric co observations of twelve z~2submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (sfrgs) which are thought tobe ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) possibly dominated by warmer dust(t_dust ~&gt; 40 k) than submillimetre galaxies (smgs) of similar luminosities.four other co-observed sfrgs are included from the literature, and allobservations are taken at the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in thecompact configuration. ten of the sixteen sfrgs observed in co (63%) aredetected at &gt;4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 m_sun.sfrgs trend slightly above the local ulirg l_fir-l'_co relation. since sfrgsare about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar columinosities to smgs, this suggests sfrgs are slightly more efficient starformers than smgs at the same redshifts. sfrgs also have a narrow mean co linewidth, 320+-80km/s. sfrgs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous&gt;5*10^12 l_sun smgs and those of local ulirgs and are consistent withintermediate stage major mergers. we suspect that more moderate-luminositysmgs, not yet surveyed in co, would show similar molecular gas properties tosfrgs. the agn fraction of sfrgs is consistent with smgs and is estimated to be0.3+-0.1, suggesting that sfrgs are observed near the peak phase of starformation activity and not in a later, post-smg enhanced agn phase. this cosurvey of sfrgs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey ofherschel and scuba-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with smgs.better constraints on co properties of a diverse high-z ulirg population areneeded from alma to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,and what role ulirgs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellarsystems in the early universe.

0911.3905	non-parametric modeling of the intra-cluster gas using apex-sz bolometer  imaging data	we demonstrate the usability of mm-wavelength imaging data obtained from theapex-sz bolometer array to derive the radial temperature profile of the hotintra-cluster gas out to radius r_500 and beyond. the goal is to study thephysical properties of the intra-cluster gas by using a non-parametricde-projection method that is, aside from the assumption of spherical symmetry,free from modeling bias. we use publicly available x-ray imaging data from thexmm-newton observatory and our sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) imaging datafrom the apex-sz experiment at 150 ghz to de-project the density andtemperature profiles for the relaxed cluster abell 2204. we derive the gasdensity, temperature and entropy profiles assuming spherical symmetry, andobtain the total mass profile under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium.for comparison with x-ray spectroscopic temperature models, a re-analysis ofthe recent chandra observation is done with the latest calibration updates.using the non-parametric modeling we demonstrate a decrease of gas temperaturein the cluster outskirts, and also measure the gas entropy profile. theseresults are obtained for the first time independently of x-ray spectroscopy,using sze and x-ray imaging data. the contribution of the sze systematicuncertainties in measuring t_e at large radii is shown to be small compared tothe chandra systematic spectroscopic errors. the upper limit on m_200 derivedfrom the non-parametric method is consistent with the nfw model prediction fromweak lensing analysis.

0912.1598	high-resolution co and radio imaging of z~2 ulirgs: extended co  structures, and implications for the universal star formation law	we present high spatial resolution (0.4", ~3.5 kpc) pdbi interferometric dataon three ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2: two submillimetregalaxies and one submillimetre faint star forming radio galaxy. the threegalaxies have been ro- bustly detected in co rotational transitions, either12co(j=4-3) or 12co(j=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to beaccurately constrained. these are the highest spatial resolution observationsobserved to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation co emission inz~2 ulirgs. the galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. high-resolution (0.3") combined merlin-vlaobservations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formationbehaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the coobservations. this 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatialdistribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can thereforecalculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allowsus to place the three systems in the context of a kennicutt-schmidt (ks)-stylestar formation law. we find a difference in size between the co and radioemission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of theco emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may leadto error. this size difference also causes the star formation efficiencieswithin systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. we also find, with our newaccurate sizes, that smgs lie significantly above the ks relation, indicatingthat stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in otherhigh-z star forming galaxies.

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1005.3422	cool gas and dust in m33: results from the herschel m33 extended survey  (herm33es)	we present an analysis of the first space-based far-ir-submm observations ofm 33, which measure the emission from the cool dust and resolve the giantmolecular cloud complexes. with roughly half-solar abundances, m33 is a firststep towards young low-metallicity galaxies where the submm may be able toprovide an alternative to co mapping to measure their h$_2$ content. in thisletter, we measure the dust emission cross-section $\sigma$ using spire andrecent co and \hi\ observations; a variation in $\sigma$ is present from anear-solar neighborhood cross-section to about half-solar with the maximumbeing south of the nucleus. calculating the total h column density from themeasured dust temperature and cross-section, and then subtracting the \hi\column, yields a morphology similar to that observed in co. the h$_2$/\hi\ massratio decreases from about unity to well below 10% and is about 15% averagedover the optical disk. the single most important observation to reduce thepotentially large systematic errors is to complete the co mapping of m 33.

1006.2137	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: a  photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies	[abridged] we derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-irphotometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) selected at 870um by laboca observations in the ecdfs. the medianphotometric redshift of identified smgs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile rangeis z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z&gt;3) smgs. we derive asimple redshift estimator for smgs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which isaccurate to delta_z~0.4 for smgs at z&lt;4. a statistical analysis of sourcesaround unidentified smgs identifies a population of likely counterparts with aredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% ofthe unidentified smgs. this confirms that the bulk of the undetected smgs arecoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-ir. we conclude that ~15% of allthe smgs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z&gt;3 and hence ~30%of all smgs have z&gt;3. we estimate that the full s_870um&gt;4mjy smg population hasa median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. in contrast to previous suggestions we find nosignificant correlation between s_870um and redshift. the median stellar massof the smgs derived from sed fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10msun and theinterquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10msun, although we caution that uncertaintyin the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in thesestellar masses. the median characteristic dust temperature of smgs is35.9\pm1.4k and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3k. the infrared luminosityfunction shows that smgs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-ir luminosities andluminosity density than those at z=1-2. this is mirrored in the evolution ofthe star-formation rate density (sfrd) for smgs which peaks at z~2. the maximumcontribution of bright smgs to the global sfrd (~5% for smgs with s_870um&gt;4mjy;~50% for smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy) also occurs at z~2.

1103.3263	redshift evolution of the 1.4 ghz volume averaged radio luminosity  function in clusters of galaxies	by cross-correlating large samples of galaxy clusters with publicly availableradio source catalogs, we construct the volume-averaged radio luminosityfunction (rlf) in clusters of galaxies, and investigate its dependence oncluster redshift and mass. in addition, we determine the correlation betweenthe cluster mass and the radio luminosity of the brightest source within 50 kpcfrom the cluster center. we use two cluster samples: the optically selectedmaxbcg cluster catalog and a composite sample of x-ray selected clusters. theradio data come from the vla nvss and first surveys. we use scaling relationsto estimate cluster masses and radii to get robust estimates of clustervolumes. we determine the projected radial distribution of sources, for whichwe find no dependence on luminosity or cluster mass. background and foregroundsources are statistically accounted for, and we account for confusion of radiosources by adaptively degrading the resolution of the radio source surveys. wedetermine the redshift evolution of the rlf under the assumption that itsoverall shape does not change with redshift. our results are consistent with apure luminosity evolution of the rlf in the range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3 from theoptical cluster sample. the x-ray sample extends to higher redshift and yieldsresults also consistent with a pure luminosity evolution. we find no directevidence of a dependence of the rlf on cluster mass from the present data,although the data are consistent with the most luminous sources only beingfound in high-mass systems.

1105.1128	radio studies of galaxy formation: dense gas history of the universe	line and continuum studies at centimeter through submillimeter wavelengthsaddress probe deep into the earliest, most active and dust obscured phases ofgalaxy formation, and reveal the molecular and cool atomic gas. we summarizethe techniques of radio astronomy to perform these studies, then review theprogress on radio studies of galaxy formation. the dominant work over the lastdecade has focused on massive, luminous starburst galaxies (submm galaxies andagn host galaxies). the far infrared luminosities are ~ 1e13 lsun, implyingstar formation rates, sfr &gt; 1e3 msun/year. molecular gas reservoirs are foundwith masses: m(h_2) &gt; 1e10 (alpha/0.8}) msun. the co excitation in theseluminous systems is much higher than in low redshift spiral galaxies. imagingof the gas distribution and dynamics suggests strongly interacting and merginggalaxies, indicating gravitationally induced, short duration (~ 1e7 year)starbursts. these systems correspond to a major star formation episode inmassive galaxies in proto-clusters at intermediate to high redshift. recently,radio observations have probed the more typical star forming galaxy population(sfr ~ 100 msun/year), during the peak epoch of universal star formation (z ~1.5 to 2.5). these observations reveal massive gas reservoirs withouthyper-starbursts, and show that active star formation occurs over a wide rangein galaxy stellar mass. the conditions in this gas are comparable to thosefound in the milky way disk. a key result is that the peak epoch of starformation in the universe also corresponds to an epoch when the baryon contentof star forming galaxies was dominated by molecular gas, not stars. we considerthe possibility of tracing out the dense gas history of the universe, andperform initial, admittedly gross, calculations. abridged

1201.2558	dust and gas power-spectrum in m33 (herm33es)	power spectra of de-projected images of late-type galaxies in gas and/or dustemission are very useful diagnostics of the dynamics and stability of theirinterstellar medium. previous studies have shown that the power spectra can beapproximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500pc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the twocorresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. we present athorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at severalwavelengths in the nearby galaxy m33. in particular, we use the recentlyobtained images at five wavelengths by pacs and spire onboard herschel. thelarge dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determineclearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations withwavelength. the break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24and 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in athicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined tothe plane. the slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. numericalsimulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,like m33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.varying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain arange of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicelybracket the data. the small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3dbehaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes thestructures, by increasing the gas turbulence. m33 appears to correspond to afiducial model with an sfr of $\sim$ 0.7 mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energycoupled to the gas kinematics.

1204.6668	adaptable radiative transfer innovations for submillimetre telescopes  (artist) - dust polarisation module (dustpol)	we present a new publicly available tool (dustpol) aimed to model thepolarised thermal dust emission. the module dustpol, which is publiclyavailable, is part of the artist (adaptable radiative transfer innovations forsubmillimetre telescopes) package, which also offers tools for modelling thepolarisation of line emission together with a model library and a python-baseduser interface. dustpol can easily manage analytical as well as pre-griddedmodels to generate synthetic maps of the stokes i, q, and u parameters. thesemaps are stored in fits format which is straightforwardly read by the datareduction software used, e.g., by the atacama large millimeter array (alma).this turns dustpol into a powerful engine for the prediction of the expectedpolarisation features of a source observed with alma or the planck satellite aswell as for the interpretation of existing submillimetre observations obtainedwith other telescopes. dustpol allows the parameterisation of the maximumdegree of polarisation and we find that, in a prestellar core, if there isdepolarisation, this effect should happen at densities of 10^6 cm-3 or larger.we compare a model generated by dustpol with the observational polarisationdata of the low-mass class 0 object ngc 1333 iras 4a, finding that the totaland the polarised emission are consistent.

1205.1511	a survey of molecular gas in luminous sub-millimetre galaxies	we present the results from a survey for 12co emission in 40 luminoussub-millimetre galaxies (smgs), with 850um fluxes of s850 = 4 - 20 mjy,conducted with the plateau de bure interferometer. we detect 12co emission in32 smgs at z~1.2 - 4.1, including 16 smgs not previously published. usingmultiple 12co line (j_up =2 - 7) observations, we derive a median spectral lineenergy distribution for luminous smgs and use this to estimate a mean gas massof (5.3 +/- 1.0) \times 10^10 msun. we report the discovery of a fundamentalrelationship between 12co fwhm and 12co line luminosity in high-redshiftstarbursts, which we interpret as a natural consequence of the baryon-dominateddynamics within the regions probed by our observations. we use far-infraredluminosities to assess the star-formation efficiency in our smgs, finding asteepening of the l'co-lfir relation as a function of increasing 12co j_uptransition. we derive dynamical masses and molecular gas masses, and use theseto determine the redshift evolution of the gas content of smgs, finding thatthey do not appear to be significantly more gas rich than less vigorouslystar-forming galaxies at high redshifts. finally, we collate x-rayobservations, and study the interdependence of gas and dynamical properties ofsmgs with their agn activity and supermassive black hole masses (mbh), findingthat smgs lie significantly below the local m_bh-sigma relation. we concludethat smgs represent a class of massive, gas-rich ultraluminous galaxies withsomewhat heterogeneous properties, ranging from starbursting disc-like systemswith l~10^12 l_sun, to the most highly star-forming mergers in the universe.

0711.1320	clumpy photon-dominated regions in carina. i. [ci] and mid-j co lines in  two 4'x4' fields	the carina region is an excellent astrophysical laboratory for studying thefeedback mechanisms of newly born, very massive stars within their natal giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) at only 2.35 kpc distance. we use a clumpy pdr model toanalyse the observed intensities of atomic carbon and co and to derive theexcitation conditions of the gas. the nanten2-4m submillimeter telescope wasused to map the [ci] 3p1-3p0, 3p2-3p1 and co 4-3, 7-6 lines in two 4'x4'regions of carina where molecular material interfaces with radiation from themassive star clusters. one region is the northern molecular cloud near thecompact ob cluster tr14, and the second region is in the molecular cloud southof etacar and tr16. these data were combined with 13co sest spectra, hires/iras60um and 100um maps of the fir continuum, and maps of 8um irac/spitzer and msxemission. we used the hires far-infrared dust data to create a map of the fuvfield heating the gas. the northern region shows an fuv field of a few 1000 indraine units while the field of the southern region is about a factor 10weaker. we constructed models consisting of an ensemble of small sphericallysymmetric pdr clumps within the 38" beam (0.43pc), which follow canonicalpower-law mass and mass-size distributions. we find that an average local clumpdensity of 2x10**5 cm-3 is needed to reproduce the observed line emission attwo selected interface positions. stationary, clumpy pdr models reproduce theobserved cooling lines of atomic carbon and co at two positions in the carinanebula.

1205.6470	millimeter imaging of submillimeter galaxies in the cosmos field:  redshift distribution	we present new iram pdbi 1.3mm continuum observations at ~1.5" resolution of28 smgs previously discovered with the 870um bolometer laboca at apex withinthe central 0.7deg2 of the cosmos field. 19 out of the 28 laboca sources weredetected with the pdbi at a &gt;~3sigma level of ~1.4mjy/b. a combined analysis ofthis new sample with existing interferometrically identified smgs in the cosmosfield yields the following results: 1) &gt;~15%, and possibly up to ~40% ofsingle-dish detected smgs consist of multiple sources, 2) statisticalidentifications of multi-wavelength counterparts to the single-dish smgs yieldthat only ~50% of these single-dish smgs have real radio or ir counterparts, 3)~18% of interferometric smgs have only radio or even no multi-wavelengthcounterpart at all, and 4) ~50-70% of z&gt;~3 smgs have no radio counterparts downto an rms of 7-12ujy at 1.4ghz. using the exact interferometric positions toidentify proper multi-wavelength counterparts allows us to determine accuratephotometric redshifts for these sources. the redshift distributions of thecombined and the individual 1.1mm and 870um selected samples have a higher meanand broader width than the redshift distributions derived in previous studies.our sample supports the previous tentative trend that on average brighterand/or mm-selected smgs are located at higher redshifts. there is a tentativeoffset between the mean redshift for the 1.1mm (&lt;z&gt;=3.1+/-0.4) and 870um(&lt;z&gt;=2.6+/-0.4) selected samples, with the 1.1mm sources lying on average athigher redshifts. based on our nearly complete sample of aztec 1.1mm smgswithin a uniform 0.15deg2 area we infer a higher surface density of z&gt;~4 smgsthan predicted by current cosmological models. in summary, our findings implythat (sub-)millimeter interferometric identifications are crucial to buildstatistically complete and unbiased samples of smgs.

1206.2641	the intense starburst hdf850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z=5.2 in the  hubble deep field	the hubble deep field (hdf) is a region in the sky that provides one of thedeepest multi-wavelength views of the distant universe and has led to thedetection of thousands of galaxies seen throughout cosmic time. an early map ofthe hdf at a wavelength of 850 microns that is sensitive to dust emissionpowered by star formation revealed the brightest source in the field, dubbedhdf850.1. for more than a decade, this source remained elusive and, despitesignificant efforts, no counterpart at shorter wavelengths, and thus noredshift, size or mass, could be identified. here we report, using a millimeterwave molecular line scan, an unambiguous redshift determination for hdf850.1 ofz=5.183. this places hdf850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z~5.2 in the hdf,corresponding to a cosmic age of only 1.1 gyr after the big bang. this redshiftis significantly higher than earlier estimates and higher than most of the &gt;100sub-millimeter bright galaxies identified to date. the source has a starformation rate of 850 m_sun/yr and is spatially resolved on scales of 5 kpc,with an implied dynamical mass of ~1.3x10^11 m_sun, a significant fraction ofwhich is present in the form of molecular gas. despite our accurate redshiftand position, a counterpart arising from starlight remains elusive.

1207.1301	mapping the cold dust temperatures and masses of nearby kingfish  galaxies with herschel	taking advantage of the sensitivity and angular resolution of the herschelspace observatory at far-infrared and submm wavelengths, we aim to characterizethe physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies and study therobustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbodymodels. for a pilot subsample of the kingfish program, we perform 2 temperaturefits of the spitzer and herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warmand a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.at global scales,we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and tc(19.1 to 25.1k).wecompute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustnessof the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. when the emissivityis fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.when theemissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniformfitted emissivities.gathering resolved elements in a tc-beta_c diagramunderlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.it remains difficultto assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, ormixing along the line of sight and in the beam. we finally observe in bothcases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and barends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in theselocations).we also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptionsabout the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverageused in the fits. we show that modified blackbody fits using a shallowemissivity (beta_c &lt; 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared tothe beta_c &lt; 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 forinstance.the working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: massesincrease from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.

1207.2795	deep observations of co line emission from star-forming galaxies in a  cluster candidate at z=1.5	we report results from a deep jansky very large array (jvla) search for co1-0 line emission from galaxies in a candidate galaxy cluster at z~1.55 in thecosmos field. we target 4 galaxies with optical spectroscopic redshifts in therange z=1.47-1.59. two of these 4 galaxies, id51613 and id51813, are nominallydetected in co line emission at the 3-4 sigma level. we find co luminosities of2.4x10^10 k km/s pc^2 and 1.3x10^10 k km/s pc^2, respectively. taking advantagefrom the clustering and 2-ghz bandwidth of the jvla, we perform a search foremission lines in the proximity of optical sources within the field of view ofour observations. we limit our search to galaxies with k&lt;23.5 (ab) andz_phot=1.2-1.8. we find 2 bright optical galaxies to be associated withsignificant emission line peaks (&gt;4 sigma) in the data cube, which we identifywith the co line emission. to test the reliability of the line peaks found, weperformed a parallel search for line peaks using a bayesian inference method.monte carlo simulations show that such associations are statisticallysignificant, with probabilities of chance association of 3.5% and 10.7% for id51207 and id 51380, respectively. modeling of their optical/ir seds indicatesthat the co detected galaxies and candidates have stellar masses and sfrs inthe range (0.3-1.1)x10^11 m_sun and 60-160 m_sun/yr, with sfes comparable tothat found in other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. by comparingthe space density of co emitters derived from our observations with the spacedensity derived from previous co detections at z~1.5, and with semi-analyticpredictions for the co luminosity function, we suggest that the latter tend tounderestimate the number of co galaxies detected at high-redshift. finally, weargue about the benefits of future blind co searches in clustered fields withupcoming submm/radio facilities.

1410.7412	the far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies  in the sfr-m* plane up to z 2	[abridged] we study the evolution of the radio spectral index andfar-infrared/radio correlation (frc) across the star-formation rate-stellarmasse (i.e. sfr-m*) plane up to z 2. we start from a m*-selected sample ofgalaxies with reliable sfr and redshift estimates. we then grid the sfr-m*plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radioluminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the frc index (i.e. qfir) ofeach sfr-m*-z bin. the infrared luminosities of our sfr-m*-z bins are estimatedusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observationsobtained with herschel. their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices(i.e. alpha, where snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4ghz and610mhz flux densities from the vla and gmrt, respectively. our far-infrared andradio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields-goods-n/s, ecdfs, and cosmos- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. using thismethodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and frc index ofstar-forming galaxies with m*&gt;10^10msun and 0&lt;z&lt;2.3. we find thatalpha^1.4ghz_610mhz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with thedistance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane(i.e. delta_log(ssfr)_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). instead,star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonicalvalue of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated bynon-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. we find that qfir displays amoderate but statistically significant redshift evolution asqfir(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previousliterature. finally, we find no significant correlation between qfir anddelta_log(ssfr)_ms, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of ourredshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

0806.3022	thermal emission from warm dust in the most distant quasars	we report new continuum observations of fourteen z~6 quasars at 250 ghz andfourteen quasars at 1.4 ghz. we summarize all recent millimeter and radioobservations of the sample of the thirty-three quasars known with5.71&lt;=z&lt;=6.43, and present a study of the rest frame far-infrared (fir)properties of this sample. these quasars were observed with the max plankmillimeter bolometer array (mambo) at 250 ghz with mjy sensitivity, and 30% ofthem were detected. we also recover the average 250 ghz flux density of themambo undetected sources at 4 sigma, by stacking the on-source measurements.the derived mean radio-to-uv spectral energy distributions (seds) of the fullsample and the 250 ghz non-detections show no significant difference from thatof lower-redshift optical quasars. obvious fir excesses are seen in theindividual seds of the strong 250 ghz detections, with fir-to-radio emissionratios consistent with that of typical star forming galaxies. most 250ghz-detected sources follow the l_{fir}--l_{bol} relationship derived from asample of local ir luminous quasars (l_{ir}&gt;10^{12}l_{\odot}), while theaverage l_{fir}/l_{bol} ratio of the non-detections is consistent with that ofthe optically-selected pg quasars. the mambo detections also tend to haveweaker ly\alpha emission than the non-detected sources. we discuss possible firdust heating sources, and critically assess the possibility of active starformation in the host galaxies of the z~6 quasars. the average star formationrate of the mambo non-detections is likely to be less than a few hundredm_{\odot} yr^{-1}, but in the strong detections, the host galaxy star formationis probably at a rate of \gtrsim10^{3} m_{\odot} yr^{-1}, which dominates thefir dust heating.

astro-ph;0201330	dust emission and star formation toward a redshift 5.5 qso	we report observations of the low-luminosity z = 5.50 quasar rdj030117+002025 (rd0301 hereafter) at 250 ghz (1.20mm) using the max-planckmillimeter bolometer (mambo) array at the iram 30-meter telescope. the quasarwas detected with a 1.2mm flux density of 0.87 +-0.20 mjy. the lack ofdetectable 1.4 ghz radio emission indicates that the millimeter emission is ofthermal nature, making rd0301 the most distant dust-emission source known. whenmatching a 50k grey body thermal far-infrared (fir) spectrum to the observedmillimeter flux we imply a fir luminosity ~4x10^12 l_sun, which is comparableto the quasar's optical luminosity. if the fir luminosity arises from massivestar formation, the implied star formation rate would be ~600 m_sun/yr,comparable to that of the starburst galaxies which dominate the average starformation and fir emission in the early universe. the fir luminosity of rd0301is close to the average of that found in optically far more luminoushigh-redshift quasars. the comparably high millimeter to optical brightnessratio of rd0301 is further evidence for that there is no strong correlationbetween the optical and millimeter brightness of high-redshift quasars,supporting the idea that in high-redshift quasars the dust is not heated by theagn, but by starbursts.

astro-ph;0307408	high-excitation co in a quasar host galaxy at z=6.42	we report the detection of high excitation co emission from the most distantquasar currently known, sdss j114816.64+525150.3 (hereafter j1148+5251), at aredshift z=6.419. the co (j=6-5) and (j=7-6) lines were detected using the iramplateau de bure interferometer, showing a width of ~280 km/s. an upper fluxlimit for the co (j=1-0) line was obtained from observations with theeffelsberg 100-meter telescope. assuming no gravitational magnification, weestimate a molecular gas mass of ~2x10^10 m_sun. using the co (3-2)observations by walter et al. (2003), a comparison of the line flux ratios withpredictions from a large velocity gradient model suggests that the gas islikely of high excitation, at densities ~10^5 cm^-3 and a temperature ~100 k.since in this case the co lines appear to have moderate optical depths, the gasmust be extended over a few kpc. the gas mass detected in j1148+5251 can fuelstar formation at the rate implied by the far-infrared luminosity for less than10 million years, a time comparable to the dynamical time of the region. thegas must therefore be replenished quickly, and metal and dust enrichment mustoccur fast. the strong dust emission and massive, dense gas reservoir at z~6.4provide further evidence that vigorous star formation is co-eval with the rapidgrowth of massive black holes at these early epochs of the universe.

astro-ph;0508064	first detection of [cii]158um at high redshift: vigorous star formation  in the early universe	we report the detection of the 2p_3/2 -&gt; 2p_1/2 fine-structure line of c+ at157.74 micron in sdssj114816.64+525150.3 (hereafter j1148+5251), the mostdistant known quasar, at z=6.42, using the iram 30-meter telescope. this is thefirst detection of the [cii] line at high redshift, and also the firstdetection in a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (l_fir &gt; 10^13 lsun). the [cii]line is detected at a significance level of 8 sigma and has a luminosity of 4.4x 10^9 lsun. the l_[cii]/l_fir ratio is 2 x 10^-4, about an order of magnitudesmaller than observed in local normal galaxies and similar to the ratioobserved in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. the [cii] line luminosityindicates that the host galaxy of this quasar is undergoing an intense burst ofstar formation with an estimated rate of ~3000 msun/yr. the detection of c+ insdss j1148+5251 suggests a significant enrichment of metals at z ~ 6 (age ofthe universe ~870 myr), although the data are consistent with a reduced carbonto oxygen ratio as expected from chemical evolutionary models of the earlyphases of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0509898	a robust sample of submillimetre galaxies: constraints on the prevalence  of dusty, high-redshift starbursts	the modest significance of most sources detected in current submm surveys canpotentially compromise some analyses due to the inclusion of spurious sourcesin catalogues typically selected at &gt;3.0-3.5sigma. here, we develop and apply adual-survey extraction technique to scuba and mambo images of the lockman hole.cut above 5sigma, our catalogue of smgs is more robust than previous samples,with a reduced likelihood of real, but faint smgs (beneath and around theconfusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. the effective fluxlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-ghz image. the former issensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latterprobes the z&lt;3 regime. a high fraction of our robust smgs (~80%) have radiocounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggeststhat very distant smgs (z&gt;&gt;3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of thebright smg population. this implies that almost all of the bright smgpopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. we usethese radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positionaluncertainty in smg catalogues. we then go on to outline the acquisition ofredshifts for radio-identified smgs, from sample selection in the submm, tocounterpart selection in the radio and optical/ir, to slit placement onspectrograph masks. we determine a median of z=2.05 +/- 0.41 from a sample ofsix secure redshifts for unambigious radio-identified submm sources and z=2.14+/- 0.27 when we include submm sources with multiple radio counterparts and/orless reliable redshifts. these figures are consistent with previous estimates,suggesting that our knowledge of the median redshift of bright smgs populationhas not been biased by the low significance of the source catalogues employed.

astro-ph;0511319	high-resolution millimeter imaging of submillimeter galaxies	we present sub-arcsecond resolution iram pdbi interferometry of eightsubmillimeter galaxies at redshifts from 2 to 3.4, where we detect continuum at1mm and/or co lines at 3 and 1 mm. the co 3-2/4-3 line profiles in five of thesources are double-peaked, indicative of orbital motion either in a singlerotating disk or of a merger of two galaxies. the millimeter line and continuumemission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain tight upperlimits to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. the median fwhm diameter forthese sources and the previously resolved sources, smmj023952-0136 andsmmj140104+0252 is less than or equal to 0.5" (4 kpc). the compactness of thesources does not support a scenario where the far-ir/submm emission comes froma cold, very extended dust distribution. these measurements clearly show thatthe submillimeter galaxies we have observed resemble scaled-up and more gasrich versions of the local universe, ultra-luminous galaxy (ulirg) population.their central densities and potential well depths are much greater than inother redshift 2-3 galaxy samples studied so far. they are comparable to thoseof elliptical galaxies or massive bulges. the smg properties fulfill thecriteria of 'maximal' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gasreservoir of 10^10-10^11 solar masses is converted to stars on a few dynamicaltimescales.

astro-ph;0604124	synchrotron emission from the t tauri binary system v773 tau a	the pre-main sequence binary system v773 tau a shows remarkable flaringactivity around periastron passage. here, we present the observation of such aflare at a wavelength of 3 mm (90 ghz) performed with the plateau de bureinterferometer. we examine different possible causes for the energy lossesresponsible for the e-folding time of 2.3 hours of that flare. we excludesynchrotron, collisional, and inverse compton losses because they are notconsistent with observational constraints, and we propose that the fading ofthe emission is due to the leakage of electrons themselves at each reflectionbetween the two mirror points of the magnetic structure partially trappingthem. the magnetic structure compatible with both our leakage model andprevious observations is that of a helmet streamer that, as in the solar case,can occur at the top of the x-ray-emitting, stellar-sized coronal loops of oneof the stars. the streamer may extend up to 20 r and interact with the coronaof the other star at periastron passage, causing recurring flares. the inferredmagnetic field strength at the two mirror points of the helmet streamer is inthe range 0.12 - 125 g, and the corresponding lorentz factor, gamma, of thepartially trapped electrons is in the range 20 &lt; gamma &lt; 632. we therefore ruleout that the emission could be of gyro-synchrotron nature: the derived highlorentz factor proves that the nature of the emission at 90 ghz from thispre-main binary system is synchrotron radiation.  based on observations carried out with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer. iram is supported by insu/cnrs (france), mpg (germany), and ign(spain).

astro-ph;0605077	radio and millimeter observations of z~2 luminous qsos	we present very large array observations at 1.4 and 5 ghz of a sample of 16quasi-stellar objects (qsos) at z = 1.78 to 2.71. half of the chosen quasarsare bright at mm wavelengths (250 or 350 ghz) while the other half were notdetected at mm wavelengths; the former qsos were detected at 1.4 ghz, in mostcases at high significance (s/n &gt; ~7), but only three of the latter sourceswere detected at radio frequencies, and only at lower significance (s/n ~ 3).the data are consistent with a correlation between the mm and radio fluxesindicating a physical connection between the mechanisms responsible for theradio and mm emission. however, this conclusion is based on data which includesmany upper limits, and deeper observations are clearly needed to verify thiscorrelation.  all eight mm detected qsos are detected in the radio continuum, with radioflux densities consistent with the radio-to-fir correlation for low z starforming galaxies. however, four of these have flatter spectral indices than istypical for star forming galaxies (i.e. greater than -0.5) suggesting thatradiation from the central agn dominates the observed radio emission. all thesources detected at 1.4 ghz are spatially unresolved, with the size limitstypically &lt; 1'' = 6 kpc. high star formation rate galaxies at low redshift aretypically nuclear starbursts, with sizes &lt; 1 kpc. hence, the current radio sizelimits are insufficient to constrain the emission model (agn or starburst).

astro-ph;0609574	search for cold debris disks around m-dwarfs	debris disks are believed to be related to planetesimals left over aroundstars after planet formation has ceased. the frequency of debris disks aroundm-dwarfs which account for 70% of the stars in the galaxy is unknown whileconstrains have already been found for a- to k-type stars. we have searched forcold debris disks around 32 field m-dwarfs by conducting observations at lambda= 850 microns with the scuba bolometerarray camera at the jcmt and at lambda =1.2mm with the mambo array at the iram 30-m telescopes. this is the firstsurvey of a large sample of m-dwarfs conducted to provide statisticalconstraints on debris disks around this type of stars. we have detected a newdebris disk around the m0.5 dwarf gj842.2 at lambda = 850 microns, providingevidence for cold dust at large distance from this star (~ 300au). by combiningthe results of our survey with the ones of liu et al. (2004), we estimate forthe first time the detection rate of cold debris disks around field m-dwarfswith ages between 20 and 200 myr. this detection rate is 13^{+6}_{-8} % and isconsistent with the detection rate of cold debris disks (9 - 23 %) around a- tok-type main sequence stars of the same age. this is an indication that colddisks may be equally prevalent across stellar spectral types.

astro-ph;0611535	the effect of noise in dust emission maps on the derivation of column  density, temperature and emissivity spectral index	we have mapped the central 10'x10' of the dense core tmc-1c at 450, 850 and1200 microns using scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope and mambo on theiram 30m telescope. we show that although one can, in principle, use images atthese wavelengths to map the emissivity spectral index, temperature and columndensity independently, noise and calibration errors would have to be less than2% to accurately derive these three quantities from a set of three emissionmaps. because our data are not this free of errors, we use our emission maps tofit the dust temperature and column density assuming a constant value of theemissivity spectral index and explore the effects of noise on the derivedphysical parameters. we find that the derived extinction values for tmc-1c arelarge for a starless core (80 mag av), and the derived temperatures are low (6k) in the densest regions of the core, using our derived value of beta = 1.8.

astro-ph;9907436	studying high redshift star forming galaxies at centimeter and  millimeter wavelengths	we discuss various aspects of centimeter and millimeter wavelength continuumand line observations of high redshift star forming galaxies. perhaps the mostimportant lesson is that sensitive observations at submm through cm wavelengthsreveal a population of active star forming galaxies at high redshift which areunseen in deep optical surveys due to dust obscuration. current models suggestthat this population represents the formation of the spheroidal components ofgalaxies at z between 2 and 5, constituting about half of the total amount ofcosmic star formation from the big bang to the present. high resolution imagingat cm wavelengths provides sub-arcsecond astrometry, and can be used to searchfor gravitational lensing and/or for the presence of an agn. radio continuumobservations provide unique information on the magnetic fields in earlygalaxies, and give a gross indication of the star formation rate, while theradio-to-submm spectral index provides a rough indication of source redshift.low j transitions of co are redshifted into the cm bands for z &gt; 2, allowingfor sensitive searches for co emission over large volumes at high redshift. wepresent recent results from the very large array (vla), and from the new 230ghz mpifr bolometer array at the iram 30m telescope. a wide field survey withthe bolometer array indicates a cut-off in the source distribution function atfir luminosities &gt; 3e12 l_sun. lastly, we summarize the scientific promise ofthe new vla.

0810.1293	mambo 1.2mm observations of luminous starbursts at z~2 in the swire  fields	we report on--off pointed mambo observations at 1.2 mm of 61 spitzer-selectedstar-forming galaxies from the swire survey. the sources are selected on thebasis of bright 24um fluxes (f_24um&gt;0.4mjy) and of stellar dominatednear-infrared spectral energy distributions in order to favor z~2 starburstgalaxies. the average 1.2mm flux for the whole sample is 1.5+/-0.2 mjy. ouranalysis focuses on 29 sources in the lockman hole field where the average1.2mm flux (1.9+/-0.3 mjy) is higher than in other fields (1.1+/-0.2 mjy). theanalysis of the sources multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionsindicates that they are starburst galaxies with far-infrared luminosities~10^12-10^13.3 lsun, and stellar masses of ~0.2-6 x10^11 m_sun. compared tosub-millimeter selected galaxies (smgs), the swire-mambo sources are amongthose with the largest 24um/millimeter flux ratios. the origin of such largeratios is investigated by comparing the average mid-infrared spectra and thestacked far-infrared spectral energy distributions of the swire-mambo sourcesand of smgs. the mid-infrared spectra exhibit strong pah features, and a warmdust continuum. the warm dust continuum contributes to ~34% of the mid-infraredemission, and is likely associated with an agn component. this constribution isconsistent with what is found in smgs. the large 24um/1.2mm flux ratios arethus not due to agn emission, but rather to enhanced pah emission compared tosmgs. the analysis of the stacked far-infrared fluxes yields warmer dusttemperatures than typically observed in smgs. our selection favors warmultra-luminous infrared sources at high-z, a class of objects that is rarelyfound in smg samples. our sample is the largest spitzer-selected sampledetected at millimeter wavelengths currently available.

0810.3405	molecular gas in a submillimeter galaxy at z=4.5: evidence for a major  merger at 1 billion years after the big bang	we report the detection of co molecular line emission in the z=4.5millimeter-detected galaxy cosmos_j100054+023436 (hereafter: j100+0234) usingthe iram plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) and nrao's very large array(vla). the co(4-3) line as observed with pdbi has a full line width of ~1000km/s, an integrated line flux of 0.66 jy km/s, and a co luminosity of 3.2e10l_sun. comparison to the 3.3sigma detection of the co(2-1) line emission withthe vla suggests that the molecular gas is likely thermalized to the j=4-3transition level. the corresponding molecular gas mass is 2.6e10 m_sun assumingan ulirg-like conversion factor. from the spatial offset of the red- andblue-shifted line peaks and the line width a dynamical mass of 1.1e11 m_sun isestimated assuming a merging scenario. the molecular gas distribution coincideswith the rest-frame optical and radio position of the object while being offsetby 0.5'' from the previously detected ly$\alpha$ emission. j1000+0234 exhibitsvery typical properties for lower redshift (z~2) sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs)and thus is very likely one of the long sought after high redshift (z&gt;4)objects of this population. the large co(4-3) line width taken together withits highly disturbed rest-frame uv geometry suggest an ongoing major mergerabout a billion years after the big bang. given its large star formation rate(sfr) of &gt;1000 m_sun/yr and molecular gas content this object could be theprecursor of a 'red-and-dead' elliptical observed at a redshift of z=2.
