0905.0866	the impact of nebular emission on the ages of z~6 galaxies	we examine the influence of nebular continuous and line emission in highredshift star forming galaxies on determinations of their age, formationredshift and other properties from sed fits. we include nebular emissionconsistently with the stellar emission in our sed fitting tool and analysedifferentially a sample of 10 z~6 galaxies in the goods-s field studied earlierby eyles et al. (2007). we find that the apparent balmer/4000 ang breaksobserved in a number of z~6 galaxies detected at &gt;~3.6 micron with irac/spitzercan be mimicked by the presence of strong restframe optical emission lines,implying in particular younger ages than previously thought. applying thesemodels to the small sample of z~6 galaxies, we find that this effect may leadto a typical downward revision of their stellar ages by a factor ~3. inconsequence their average formation redshift may drastically be reduced, andthese objects may not have contributed to cosmic reionisation at z&gt;6.extinction and stellar mass estimates may also be somewhat modified, but to alesser extent. careful sed fits including nebular emission and treatingproperly uncertainties and degeneracies are necessary for more accuratedeterminations of the physical parameters of high-z galaxies.

0905.1329	on the origin of lyman-alpha absorption in nearby starbursts and  implications for other galaxies	(abridged) despite the privileged position that lyman-alpha (lya) emissionline holds in the exploration of the distant universe and modern observationalcosmology, the origin of the observed diversity of lya profiles remains to bethoroughly explained. observations of nearby star forming galaxies bring theirbatch of apparent contradictions between lya emission and their physicalparameters, and call for a detailed understanding of the physical processes atwork. izw 18, one of the most metal-poor galaxies known is of particularinterest in this context.  we use a 3d lya radiation transfer code to model hubble space telescope (hst)observations of izw 18 and to fit its lya spectrum. different geometricalconfigurations of the source and the neutral gas are explored.  the integrated lya profile of nw region of izw 18 is reproduced using theobserved small amount of dust (e(b-v) ~ 0.05) and a spherical hi shell withn(hi) = 6.5 x 10^(21) cm^(-2). such a high column density makes it possible totransform a strong lya emission (ew(lya) = 60 a) into a damped absorption evenwith a small extinction. when a slab geometry is applied and a given line ofsight is chosen, the lya profile can be successfully reproduced with no dust atall and n(hi) = 3 x 10^(21) cm^(-2). the spatial variations of the profileshape are naturally explained by radiation transfer effects. in the case ofoutflowing inter stellar medium (ism), as commonly observed in lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs), a high n(h) and dust content are required to observe lya inabsorption. for nearly static neutral gas as observed in izw 18 and other lowluminosity galaxies only a small amount of dust is required provided asufficiently high n(h) covers the galaxy.

0906.5349	empirical estimate of lyman-alpha escape fraction in a statistical  sample of lyman-alpha emitters	the lyman-alpha (lya) recombination line is a fundamental tool for galaxyevolution studies and modern observational cosmology. however, subsequentinterpretations are still prone to a number of uncertainties. besides numericalefforts, empirical data are urgently needed for a better understanding of lyaescape process. we empirically estimate the lyman-alpha escape fractionfesc(lya) in a statistically significant sample of z ~ 0 - 0.3 galaxies inorder to calibrate high-redshift lyman-alpha observations. an opticalspectroscopic follow-up of a sub-sample of 24 lyman-alpha emitters (laes)detected by galex at z ~ 0.2-0.3, combined with a uv-optical sample of localstarbursts, both with matched apertures, allow us to quantify the dustextinction through balmer lines, and to estimate the lyman-alpha escapefraction from the halpha flux corrected for extinction in the framework of therecombination theory. the global escape fraction of lyman-alpha radiation spansnearly the entire range of values, from 0.5 to 100 %, and fesc(lya) clearlydecreases with increasing nebular dust extinction e(b-v). several objects showfesc(lya) greater than fesc(continuum) which may be an observational evidencefor clumpy ism geometry or for an aspherical ism. selection biases and aperturesize effects may still prevail between z ~ 0.2-0.3 laes and local starbursts,which may explain the difference observed for fesc(lya).

0912.3267	the h-alpha luminosity function at redshift 2.2: a new determination  using vlt/hawk-i	we aim to place new, strengthened constraints on the luminosity function (lf)of h-alpha emitting galaxies at redshift z=2.2, and to further constrain theinstantaneous star-formation rate density of the universe (rho*). we have usedthe new hawk-i instrument at eso-vlt to obtain extremely deep narrow-band(line; nb2090) and broad-band (continuum; ks) imaging observations. the targetfield is in the goods-south, providing us with a rich multi-wavelengthauxiliary data set, which we utilise for redshift confirmation and to estimatedust content. we use this new data to measure the faint-end slope (alpha) oflf(h-alpha) with unprecedented precision. the data are well fit by a schechterfunction and also a single power-law, yielding alpha=(-1.72 +/- 0.20) and(-1.77 +/- 0.21), respectively. thus we are able to confirm the steepening ofalpha from low- to high-z predicted by a number of authors and observed atother wavelengths. we combine our lf data-points with those from a muchshallower but wider survey at z=2.2 (geach et al. 2008), constructing a lfspanning a factor of 50 in luminosity. re-fitting the schechter parameters, weobtain log l*=(43.07+/-0.22)erg s^-1 ; log phi*=(-3.45+/-0.52)mpc^-3 ;alpha=(-1.60+/-0.15). we integrate over lf(halpha) and apply a correction fordust attenuation to determine the instantaneous cosmic star-formation ratedensity at z=2 without assuming alpha or extrapolating it from lower-z. ourmeasurement of rho* is (0.215+/-0.090) msun yr^-1 mpc^-3, integrated over arange of 37 &lt;log(lhhalpha / erg s^-1) &lt; 47.

1002.1090	on the physical properties of z~6-8 galaxies	we analyse the spectral energy distributions (seds) of the most distantgalaxies discovered with the hubble space telescope and from the cosmos surveyand determine their physical properties, such as stellar age and mass, dustattenuation, and star-formation rate. we use our sed fitting tool including theeffects of nebular emission to analyse three samples of z ~6-8 galaxies withobserved magnitudes j_ab~23 to 29. our models cover a wide parameter space. wefind that the physical parameters of most galaxies cover a wide range ofacceptable values. stellar ages, in particular, are not strongly constrained,even for objects detected longward of the balmer break. as already pointed outearlier, the effects of nebular lines significantly affect the agedeterminations of star-forming galaxies at z ~6-8. we find no need for stellarpopulations with extreme metallicities or other non-standard assumptions (imf,escape fraction) to explain the observed properties of faint z-dropoutgalaxies. albeit with large uncertainties, our fit results show indications ofdust attenuation in some of the z ~6-8 galaxies, which have best-fit values ofa_v up to ~1. furthermore, we find a possible trend of increasing dustattenuation with galaxy mass, and a relatively large scatter in specificstar-formation rates, sfr/m*. the physical parameters of very high-z galaxiesmay be more uncertain than indicated by previous studies. dust attenuationseems also to be present in some z ~6-8 galaxies, and may be correlated withgalaxy mass, as is also the case for sfr.

1002.4876	escape of about five per cent of lyman-alpha photons from high-redshift  star-forming galaxies	the lyman-alpha (lya) emission line is the primary observational signature ofstar-forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and has enabled the compilationof large samples of galaxies with which to study cosmic evolution. the resonantnature of the line, however, means that lya photons scatter in the neutralinterstellar medium of their host galaxies, and their sensitivity to absorptionby interstellar dust may therefore be enhanced greatly. this implies that thelya luminosity may be significantly reduced, or even completely suppressed.hitherto, no unbiased empirical test of the escaping fraction (f_esc) of lyaphotons has been performed at high redshifts. here we report that the averagefesc from star-forming galaxies at redshift z = 2.2 is just 5 per cent byperforming a blind narrowband survey in lya and ha. this implies that numerousconclusions based on lya-selected samples will require upwards revision by anorder of magnitude and we provide a benchmark for this revision. we demonstratethat almost 90 per cent of star-forming galaxies emit insufficient lya to bedetected by standard selection criteria. both samples show an anti-correlationof fesc with dust content, and we show that lya- and ha-selection recoverspopulations that differ substantially in dust content and fesc.

1008.2114	predicted uv properties of very metal-poor starburst galaxies	we study the expected properties of starbursts in order to provide the pointof reference for interpretation of high-z galaxy surveys and of very metal-poorgalaxies. we concentrate mainly on the uv characteristics such as the ionizingspectra, the uv continuum, the ly alpha and heii 1640 a line and two-photoncontinuum emission. we use evolutionary synthesis models covering metallicitiesfrom pop iii to solar and a wide range of imfs. we also combine the syntheticseds with the cloudy photoionization code for more accurate predictions ofnebular emission, and to study possible departures from case b assumed in thesynthesis models. the ionizing fluxes, uv continuum properties, and predictedly alpha and heii 1640 a line strengths are presented for synthesis modelscovering a wider range of parameter space than our earlier calculations. strongdepartures from case b predictions are obtained for ly alpha and two-photoncontinuum at low metallicities. at low nebular densities both are shown to beenhanced proportionally to the mean energy carried by the lyman continuumphotons emitted by the ionizing source. larger ly alpha equivalent widths aretherefore predicted at low metallicity. the heii 1640 a line can be weaker thancase b predicts (in terms of flux as well as the equivalent width) due to itsionization parameter dependence and to the enhanced underlying two-photoncontinuum. our results have implications for the interpretation of star-formingmetal-poor and/or high redshift galaxies, for galaxies among the ly alphaemitters (lae) and lyman break galaxy (lbg) populations, and for searches ofpopulation iii stars in the distant universe.

1010.4796	on the redshift-evolution of the lyman-alpha escape fraction and the  dust content of galaxies	the ly-alpha emission line has been proven a powerful tool by which to studyevolving galaxies at the highest redshifts. however, in order to use lya as aphysical probe of galaxies, it becomes vital to know the lya escape fraction(fesclya). unfortunately, due to the resonant nature of lya, fesclya may varyunpredictably and requires empirical measurement. here we compile lyaluminosity functions between redshift z=0 and 8 and, combined with h-alpha andultraviolet data, assess how fesclya evolves with redshift. we find a strongupwards evolution in fesclya over the range z=0.3-6, which is well-fit by thepower-law fesclya \propto (1+z)^\xi, with \xi =(2.57_-0.12^+0.19). thispredicts that fesclya should reach unity at z=11.1. by comparing fesclya ande(b-v) in individual galaxies we derive an empirical relationship betweenfesclya and e(b-v), which includes resonance scattering and can explain theredshift evolution of fesclya between z=0 and 6 purely as a function of theevolution in the dust content of galaxies. beyond z~6.5, fesclya drops moresubstantially; an effect attributed to either ionizing photon leakage, or anincrease in the neutral gas fraction of the intergalactic medium. whiledistinguishing between those two scenarios may be extremely challenging, byframing the problem this way we remove the uncertainty of the halo mass fromlya-based tests of reionization. we finally derive a new method by which toestimate the dust content of galaxies based purely upon the observed lya and uvlfs. these data are characterized by an exponential with an e-folding redshiftof ~3.5.

1101.1073	a new perspective on globular clusters, their initial mass function, and  their contribution to the stellar halo and to cosmic reionisation	we examine various implications from a dynamical and chemical model ofglobular clusters (gcs), which successfully reproduces the observed abundancepatterns and the multiple populations of stars in these systems assumingchemical enrichment from fast rotating massive stars. using the model ofdecressin et al. (2007) we determine the ratio between the observed,present-day mass of globular clusters and their initial stellar mass as afunction of the stellar initial mass function (imf). we also compute the massof low-mass stars ejected, and the amount of hydrogen ionising photons emittedby the proto globular clusters. typically, we find that the initial masses ofgcs must be ~8-10 times (or up to 25 times, if second generation stars alsoescape from gcs) larger than the present-day stellar mass. the present-daygalactic gc population must then have contributed to approximately 5-8%(10-20%) of the low-mass stars in the galactic halo. we also show that thedetection of second generation stars in the galactic halo, recently announcedby different groups, provides a new constraint on the gc initial mass function(gcimf). these observations appear to rule out a power-law gcimf, whereas theyare compatible with a log-normal one. finally, the high initial masses alsoimply that gcs must have emitted a large amount of ionising photons in theearly universe. our results reopen the question on the initial mass function ofgcs, and reinforce earlier conclusions that old gcs could have represented asignificant contribution to reionise the inter-galactic medium at highredshift.

1104.2520	optical dropout galaxies lensed by the cluster a2667	we investigate the nature and the physical properties of z, y and j-dropoutgalaxies selected behind the lensing cluster a2667. this field is part of ourproject aimed at identifying z~7-10 candidates accessible to spectroscopicstudies, based on deep photometry with eso/vlt hawk-i and fors2 (zyjh andks-band images, ab(3 sigma)~26-27) on a sample of lensing clusters extractedfrom our multi-wavelength combined surveys with spitzer, hst, and herschel. inthis paper we focus on the complete y and j-dropout sample, as well as thebright z-dropouts fulfilling the selection criteria by capak et al. (2011). 10candidates are selected within the common field of ~33 arcmin2 (effective areaonce corrected for contamination and lensing dilution). all of them aredetected in h and ks bands in addition to j and/or irac 3.6/4.5, withh(ab)~23.4 to 25.2, and have modest magnification factors. although best-fitphotometric redshifts place all these candidates at high-z, the contaminationby low-z interlopers is estimated at 50-75% level based on previous studies,and the comparison with the blank-field wircam ultra-deep survey (wuds). thesame result is obtained when photometric redshifts include a luminosity prior,allowing us to remove half of the original sample as likely z~1.7-3 interloperswith young stellar pulations and strong extinction. two additional sourcesamong the remaining sample could be identified at low-z based on a detection at24 microns and on the hst z_850 band. these low-z interlopers are not welldescribed by current templates given the large break, and cannot be easilyidentified based solely on optical and near-ir photometry. given the estimateddust extinction and high sfrs, some of them could be also detected in the ir orsub-mm bands. after correction for likely contaminants, the observed counts atz&gt;7.5 seem to be in agreement with an evolving lf.

1111.6373	the importance of nebular emission for sed modeling of distant  star-forming galaxies	we highlight and discuss the importance of accounting for nebular emission inthe seds of high redshift galaxies, as lines and continuum emission cancontribute significantly or subtly to broad-band photometry. physicalparameters such as the galaxy age, mass, star-formation rate, dust attenuationand others inferred from sed fits can be affected to different extent by thetreatment of nebular emission.  we analyse a large sample of lyman break galaxies from z~3-6, and show somemain results illustrating e.g. the importance of nebular emission fordeterminations of the mass-sfr relation, attenuation and age. we suggest that afairly large scatter in such relations could be intrinsic. we find that themajority of objects (~60-70%) is better fit with seds accounting for nebularemission; the remaining galaxies are found to show relatively weak or noemission lines. our modeling, and supporting empirical evidence, suggests theexistence of two categories of galaxies, "starbursts" and "post-starbursts"(lower sfr and older galaxies) among the lbg population, and relatively shortstar-formation timescales.

(2011) reported a very high redshift galaxy candidate: alensed j-band dropout (a2667-j1). j1 has a photometric redshift of z=9.6-12,the probability density function for which permits no low or intermediate zsolution. we here report new spectroscopic observations of this galaxy withvlt/xshooter, which show clear [oiii]5007aa, ly-alpha, h-alpha, and h-betaemission and place the galaxy firmly at z=2.082. the oxygen lines contributeonly ~25% to the h-band flux, and do not significantly affect the dropoutselection of j1. after correcting the broadband fluxes for line emission, weidentify two roughly equally plausible natures for a2667-j1: either it is youngheavily reddened starburst, or a maximally old system with a very pronounced4000aa break, upon which a minor secondary burst of star formation issuperimposed. fits show that to make a 3 sigma detection of this object in theb-band (v-band), imaging of depth ab=30.2 (29.5) would be required - despitethe relatively bright nir magnitude, we would need optical data of equivalentdepth to the hubble ultra deep field to rule out the mid-z solution on purelyphotometric grounds. assuming that this stellar population can be scaled to thenir magnitudes of recent hst/wfc3 ir-selected galaxies, we conclude thatinfeasibly deep optical data ab~32 would be required for the same level ofsecurity. there is a population of galaxies at z~2 with continuum colours alonethat mimic those of our z=7-12 candidates.

1308.6577	on the influence of physical galaxy properties on lyman-alpha escape in  star-forming galaxies	[abridged] among the different observational techniques used to selecthigh-redshift galaxies, the hydrogen recombination line lyman-alpha (lya) is ofparticular interest as it gives access to the measurement of cosmologicalquantities such as the star formation rate of distant galaxy populations.however, the interpretation of this line and the calibration of suchobservables is still subject to serious uncertainties. therefore, it importantto understand under what conditions the lya line can be used as a reliable starformation diagnostic tool. we use a sample of 24 lya emitters at z ~ 0.3 withan optical spectroscopic follow-up to calculate the lya escape fraction and itsdependency upon different physical properties. we also examine the reliabilityof lya as a star formation rate indicator. we combine these observations with acompilation of lya emitters selected at z = 0 - 0.3 to assemble a largersample. the lya escape fraction depends clearly on the dust extinctionfollowing the relation fesc(lya) = c(lya) x 10^(-0.4 e(b-v) k(lya)), but with ashallower slope than previously reported, with k(lya) ~ 6.67 and c(lya) = 0.22.however, the correlation does not follow the expected curve for a simple dustattenuation. we explore the various mechanisms than lead to fesc(lya) valuesabove the continuum extinction curve, i.e. to an enhancement of the lya output.we also observe that the strength of lya and the escape fraction appearunrelated to the galaxy metallicity. regarding the reliability of lya as a starformation rate (sfr) indicator, we show that the deviation of sfr(lya) from thetrue sfr (as traced by the uv continuum) is a function of the observed sfr(uv),which can be seen as the decrease of fesc(lya) with increasing uv luminosity.moreover, we observe a redshift-dependence of this relationship revealing theunderlying evolution of fesc(lya) with redshift.

1308.6578	the lyman alpha reference sample: ii. hst imaging results, integrated  properties and trends	we report upon new results regarding the lya output of galaxies, derived fromthe lyman alpha reference sample (lars), focusing on hubble space telescopeimaging. for 14 galaxies we present intensity images in lya, halpha, and uv,and maps of halpha/hbeta, lya equivalent width (ew), and lya/halpha. we presentlya and uv light profiles and show they are well-fitted by s\'ersic profiles,but lya profiles show indices systematically lower than those of the uv (napprox 1-2 instead of &gt;~4). this reveals a general lack of the centralconcentration in lya that is ubiquitous in the uv. photometric growth curvesincrease more slowly for lya than the fuv, showing that small apertures mayunderestimate the ew. for most galaxies, however, flux and ew curves flatten byradii ~10 kpc, suggesting that if placed at high-z, only a few of our galaxieswould suffer from large flux losses. we compute global properties of the samplein large apertures, and show total luminosities to be independent of all otherquantities. normalized lya throughput, however, shows significant correlations:escape is found to be higher in galaxies of lower star formation rate, dustcontent, mass, and several quantities that suggest harder ionizing continuumand lower metallicity. eight galaxies could be selected as high-z lya emitters,based upon their luminosity and ew. we discuss the results in the context ofhigh-z lya and uv samples. a few galaxies have ews above 50 aa, and one showsf_esclya of 80%; such objects have not previously been reported at low-z.

1403.5444	the effects of stellar rotation. ii. a comprehensive set of starburst99  models	we present a new set of synthesis models for stellar populations obtainedwith starburst99, which are based on new stellar evolutionary tracks withrotation. we discuss models with zero rotation velocity and with velocities of40% of the break-up velocity on the zero-age main-sequence. these values areexpected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellarpopulations. the new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous andhotter due to a larger convective core and enhanced surface abundances. thisresults in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral energy distribution ofa population containing massive stars. the changes are most significant at theshortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to afactor of 5 is predicted. we also show that high equivalent widths ofrecombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very young age but can beachieved at ages as late as 10 myr. comparison of these two boundary cases (0and 40% of the break-up velocity) will allow users to evaluate the effects ofrotation and provide guidance for calibrating the stellar evolution models. wealso introduce a new theoretical ultraviolet spectral library built from thepotsdam wolf-rayet (powr) atmospheres. its purpose is to help identifysignatures of wolf-rayet stars in the ultraviolet whose strength is sensitiveto the particulars of the evolution models. the new models are available forsolar and 1/7th solar metallicities. a complete suite of models can begenerated on the starburst99 website (www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/). theupdated starburst99 package can be retrieved from this website as well.

0802.4123	a photometric survey for lyalpha-heii dual emitters: searching for  population iii stars in high-redshift galaxies	we present a new photometric search for high-z galaxies hosting populationiii (popiii) stars based on deep intermediate-band imaging observationsobtained in the subaru deep field (sdf), by using suprime-cam on the subarutelescope. by combining our new data with the existing broad-band andnarrow-band data, we searched for galaxies which emit strongly both in ly_alphaand in heii 1640 (``dual emitters'') that are promising candidates forpopiii-hosting galaxies, at 3.93&lt;z&lt;4.01 and 4.57&lt;z&lt;4.65. although we found 10``dual emitters'', most of them turn out to be [oii]-[oiii] dual emitters orh_beta-(h_alpha+[nii]) dual emitters at z&lt;1, as inferred from their broad-bandcolors and from the ratio of the equivalent widths. no convincing candidate ofly_alpha-heii dual emitter of sfr_popiii &gt; 2 msun/yr was found by ourphotometric search in 4.03 x 10^5 mpc^3 in the sdf. this result disfavors lowfeedback models for popiii star clusters, and implies an upper-limit of thepopiii sfr density of sfrd_popiii &lt; 5 x 10^-6 msun/yr/mpc^3. this new selectionmethod to search for popiii-hosting galaxies should be useful in futurenarrow-band surveys to achieve the first observational detection ofpopiii-hosting galaxies at high redshifts.

1409.0512	new constraints on the faint-end of the uv luminosity function at z~7-8  using the gravitational lensing of the hubble frontier fields cluster a2744	exploiting the power of gravitational lensing, the hubble frontier fields(hff) program aims at observing six massive galaxy clusters to explore thedistant universe far beyond the depth limits of blank field surveys. using thecomplete hubble space telescope observations of the first hff cluster abell2744, we report the detection of 50 galaxy candidates at $z \sim 7$ and eightcandidates at $z \sim 8$ in a total survey area of 0.96 arcmin$^{2}$ in thesource plane. three of these galaxies are multiply-imaged by the lensingcluster. using an updated model of the mass distribution in the cluster we wereable to calculate the magnification factor and the effective survey volume foreach galaxy in order to compute the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function atboth redshifts 7 and 8. our new measurements extend the $z \sim 7$ uv lf downto an absolute magnitude of $m_{uv} \sim -15.5$. we find a characteristicmagnitude of $m^{\star}_{uv}=-20.63^{+0.69}_{-0.56}$ mag and a faint-end slope$\alpha = -1.88^{+0.17}_{-0.20}$ close to previous determinations in blankfields. we show here for the first time that this slope remains steep down tovery faint luminosities of 0.01$l^{\star}$. although prone to largeuncertainties, our results at $z \sim 8$ also seem to confirm a steep faint-endslope below 0.1$l^{\star}$. the hff program is therefore providing an extremelyefficient way to study the faintest galaxy populations at $z &gt; 7$ that wouldotherwise be inaccessible with current instrumentation. the full sample of sixgalaxy clusters will provide yet better constraints on the build-up of galaxiesat early epochs and their contribution to cosmic reionization.

1501.04726	the science case for multi-object spectroscopy on the european elt	this white paper presents the scientific motivations for a multi-objectspectrograph (mos) on the european extremely large telescope (e-elt). the moscase draws on all fields of contemporary astronomy, from extra-solar planets,to the study of the halo of the milky way and its satellites, and from resolvedstellar populations in nearby galaxies out to observations of the earliest'first-light' structures in the partially-reionised universe. the materialpresented here results from thorough discussions within the community over thepast four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a commonstrategy toward realising a mos capability on the e-elt. the cases have beendistilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define themosaic instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and'high definition'). when combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of thee-elt, mosaic will be the world's leading mos facility. in analysing therequirements we also identify a high-multiplex mos for the longer-term plansfor the e-elt, with an even greater multiplex (&gt;1000 targets) to enable studiesof large-scale structures in the high-redshift universe. following the greenlight for the construction of the e-elt the mos community, structured throughthe mosaic consortium, is eager to realise a mos on the e-elt as soon aspossible. we argue that several of the most compelling cases for elt science,in highly competitive areas of modern astronomy, demand such a capability. forexample, mos observations in the early stages of e-elt operations will beessential for follow-up of sources identified by the james webb space telescope(jwst). in particular, multi-object adaptive optics and accurate skysubtraction with fibres have both recently been demonstrated on sky, makingfast-track development of mosaic feasible.

1503.01157	the lyman alpha reference sample: v. the impact of neutral ism  kinematics and geometry on lyman alpha escape	we present high-resolution far-uv spectroscopy of the 14 galaxies of thelyman alpha reference sample; a sample of strongly star-forming galaxies at lowredshifts ($0.028 &lt; z &lt; 0.18$). we compare the derived properties to globalproperties derived from multi band imaging and 21 cm hi interferometry andsingle dish observations, as well as archival optical sdss spectra. besides thelyman $\alpha$ line, the spectra contain a number of metal absorption featuresallowing us to probe the kinematics of the neutral ism and evaluate the opticaldepth and and covering fraction of the neutral medium as a function ofline-of-sight velocity. furthermore, we show how this, in combination withprecise determination of systemic velocity and good ly$\alpha$ spectra, can beused to distinguish a model in which separate clumps together fully cover thebackground source, from the "picket fence" model named by heckman et al.(2011). we find that no one single effect dominates in governing ly$\alpha$radiative transfer and escape. ly$\alpha$ escape in our sample coincides with amaximum velocity-binned covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.9$ and bulk outflowvelocities of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$, although a number of galaxies showthese characteristics and yet little or no ly$\alpha$ escape. we find thatly$\alpha$ peak velocities, where available, are not consistent with a strongbackscattered component, but rather with a simpler model of an intrinsicemission line overlaid by a blueshifted absorption profile from the outflowingwind. finally, we find a strong anticorrelation between h$\alpha$ equivalentwidth and maximum velocity-binned covering factor, and propose a heuristicexplanatory model.

1504.01734	evidence for popiii-like stellar populations in the most luminous  lyman-$\alpha$ emitters at the epoch of re-ionisation: spectroscopic  confirmation	faint lyman-$\alpha$ (ly$\alpha$) emitters become increasingly rarer towardsthe re-ionisation epoch (z~6-7). however, observations from a very large(~5deg$^2$) ly$\alpha$ survey at z=6.6 (matthee et al. 2015) show that this isnot the case for the most luminous emitters. here we present follow-upobservations of the two most luminous z~6.6 ly$\alpha$ candidates in the cosmosfield: `masosa' and `cr7'. we used x-shooter, sinfoni and fors2 (vlt), anddeimos (keck), to confirm both candidates beyond any doubt. we find redshiftsof z=6.541 and z=6.604 for masosa and cr7, respectively. masosa has a strongdetection in ly$\alpha$ with a line width of $386\pm30$ km/s (fwhm) and withhigh ew$_0$ (&gt;200 \aa), but it is undetected in the continuum. cr7, with anobserved ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $10^{43.93\pm0.05}$erg/s is the most luminously$\alpha$ emitter ever found at z&gt;6. cr7 reveals a narrow ly$\alpha$ line with$266\pm15$ km/s fwhm, being detected in the nir (rest-frame uv, with$\beta=-2.3\pm0.1$) with an excess in $j$, and also strongly detected inirac/spitzer. we detect a narrow heii1640$\aa$ emission line ($6\sigma$) whichexplains the excess seen in the $j$ band photometry (ew$_0$~80 \aa). we find noother emission lines from the uv to the nir in our x-shooter spectra(heii/oiii]1663a&gt;3 and heii/ciii]1908a&gt;2.5). we find that cr7 is best explainedby a combination of a popiii-like population which dominates the rest-frame uvand the nebular emission, and a more normal stellar population which dominatesthe mass. hst/wfc3 observations show that the light is indeed spatiallyseparated between a very blue component, coincident with ly$\alpha$ and heiiemission, and two red components (~5 kpc away), which dominate the mass. ourfindings are consistent with theoretical predictions of a popiii wave, withpopiii star formation migrating away from the original sites of star formation.

(2007). a simple geometry of a sphericallyexpanding shell of hi is adopted.  results : the variety of observed lya profiles is successfully reproduced.most objects show outflow velocities of 150-200 km/s; two objects are mostlikely quasi-static. the radial hi column density ranges from nh=2.10^{19} to7.10^{20} cm^{-2}. our lya profile fits yield values of e(b-v)~0.05-0.2 for thegas extinction. we find indications for a dust-to-gas ratio higher than thegalactic value, and for a substantial scatter. the escape fraction of lyaphotons is found to be determined primarily by the extinction, and a simple fitformula is proposed. intrinsic ew(lya)~50-100 angstroms are found for 8/11objects, as expected for stellar populations forming constantly over longperiods (&gt; 10-100 myr). in three cases we found indications for youngerpopulations. correlations between the observed ew(lya) and other observablessuch as fwhm(lya), e(b-v),sfr(uv) etc, are reproduced. we also show that thereis a clear overlap between lbgs and laes. radiation transfer and dust effectsexplain the increase of the lae/lbg ratio, and a higher percentage of lbgs withstrong lya emission with increasing redshift.

1512.00860	the lyman alpha reference sample vi: lyman alpha escape from the edge-on  disk galaxy mrk1486	while numerical simulations suggest that the strength of the lyman alpha(lya) line of star-forming disk galaxies strongly depends on the inclination atwhich they are observed (i.e. from edge-on to face-on, we expect to see achange from an attenuated lya line to a strong lya emission line), recentobservations with the hubble space telescope (hst) have highlighted fewlow-redshift highly inclined (edge-on) disk galaxies that breaks this trend. weaim to understand how a strong lya emission line is able to escape from one ofthose inclined disk galaxies, named mrk1486 (z=0.0338). for that purpose weused a large set of hst imaging and spectroscopic data to investigate both theism structure and the dominant source of lya radiation inside mrk1486.moreover, we used a 3d monte carlo lya radiation transfer code to study theradiative transfer of lya and uv continuum photons inside a 3d geometry ofneutral hydrogen (hi) and dust that models the ism structure at the galaxycenter. the analysis of ifu halpha spectroscopic data of mrk1486 indicates thepresence of two bipolar galactic winds of hi gas above and bellow the diskplane of mrk1486. furthermore, comparing different diagnostic diagrams (such as[oiii]5007/hbeta versus [oi]6300/halpha) to photo- and shock-ionization models,we find that the lya production of mrk1486 is dominated by photoionizationinside the galaxy disk. from this perspective, our numerical simulationssucceed in reproducing the strength and spectral shape of the observed lya lineof mrk1486 by assuming a scenario in which the lya photons are produced insidethe disk, travel along the galactic winds and scatter on cool hi materialstoward the observer. as bipolar galactic winds are ubiquitous in star-formingdisk galaxies, this mechanism may explain the origin of strong lya emissionlines recently observed from highly inclined galaxies at high-redshift.

astro-ph;0010643	on ionization effects and abundance ratios in damped lyman alpha systems	the similarity between observed velocity structures of al iii and singlyionized species in damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) suggests the presence ofionized gas in the regions where most metal absorption lines are formed. asimplified model consisting of region 1) a plane-parallel ionization boundedregion illuminated by an internal radiation field, and region 2) a neutralregion with a negligible metal content is considered. we calculatephotoionization equilibrium models for region 1, and constrain the ionizationparameter by the observed n(al iii)/n(si ii) column density ratio. under theseconditions we find that ionization effects are important. if these effects aretaken into account, the element abundance ratios in dlas are quite consistentwith those observed in milky way stars and in h ii regions of locallow-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies. in particular we cannot excludethe same primary n origin in both dlas and metal-poor galaxies. no depletion ofheavy elements on dust grains needs to be invoked, although our models do notexclude the presence of little depletion. although highly simplified andrelying on the strong assumption of a significantly lower metal content inregion 2, our model appears to be supported by recent data on a local dla andit is not in contradiction with the current knowledge on high redshift dlas. ifcorrect, it offers a clear simplification in the understanding of heavy elementabundance ratios in dlas and their comparison with the local universe.

astro-ph;0102228	the evolution of emission lines in hii galaxies	we constructed diagnostic diagrams using emission line ratios and equivalentwidths observed in several samples of hii galaxies. the diagrams are comparedto predictions from new photoionization models for evolving starbursts. we findthat hii galaxies from objective-prism surveys are not reproduced by models ofinstantaneous starbursts surrounded by constant density, ionization bounded hiiregions. the observed relations between emission line ratios and hb equivalentwidth (w(hb)) can be understood if older stellar populations are not negligiblein hii galaxies. also, different dust obscuration for stars and gas and leakageof lyman continuum photons from the observed hii regions can be important. as aresult, hii galaxies selected from objective-prism surveys are unlikely tocontain many objects in which the most recent starburst is older than about5~myr. the observed increase of [oi]/hb with decreasing w(hb) can result fromthe dynamical effects of winds and supernovae. this interpretation providesalso a natural explanation of the small range of ionization parameters in gianthii regions. the [oiii]/hb vs [oii]/hb diagnostic diagram cannot be fullyunderstood in terms of pure photoionization models and indicate the need foradditional heating sources. the [nii]/[oii] ratio is shown to increase as w(hb)decreases. a possible explanation is an n/o increase due to gradual enrichmentby winds from wolf-rayet stars on a time scale of 5 myr.

astro-ph;0210462	the transition from population iii to normal galaxies: ly-a and heii  1640 emission and the ionising properties of high redshift starburst galaxies	we examine spectral properties of the ionising continua, the lyman-break, andthe ly-a and heii 1640 recombination lines in starbursts. the transition fromprimordial galaxies to currently observed metallicities, is examined. for theaverage properties of starbursts, the main findings are: 1) the lyman continuumflux increases with decreasing metallicity. for a universal salpeter imf from1-100 msun the enhancement reaches typically a factor of ~3 between solarmetallicity and pop iii objects. 2) while for metallicities z &gt;~ 1/50 zsun theamplitude of the lyman-break depends little on z, a reduction by a factor ~2 isfound at lower z, due to the strong increase of the average stellartemperature. 3) using theoretical models and empirical constraints we discussthe expected evolution of the hardness of he+ to h ionising photons withmetallicity and possible uncertainties. we also provide a simple estimate ofthe possible impact of hot wr like stars on q(he+)/q(h) at very lowmetallicities. 4) calibrations for star formation rate determinations fromvarious recombination lines at all metallicities and for various imfs arederived.  for young bursts the maximum ly-a equivalent width is shown to increasestrongly with decreasing metallicity for the same imf. however, for well knownreasons, the ly-a emission predicted likely represents an upper limit.non-negligible heii 1640 emission due to stellar photoionisation appears to belimited to very low metallicities and population iii objects.(abridgedabstract)

astro-ph;0401416	stellar population in llagn.i: ground-based observations	(abridge): we present a spectroscopic study of the stellar populations of lowluminosity agn (llagn). our main goal is to determine whether the stars wholive in the innermost (100 pc-scale) regions of these galaxies are in some wayrelated to the emission line properties, which would imply a link between thestellar population and the ionization mechanism. high signal to noise, groundbased long-slit spectra in the 3500--5500 a interval were collected for 60galaxies.our main findings are: (1) few llagn have a detectable young (&lt; 10myr) starburst component, indicating that very massive stars do not contributesignificantly to the optical continuum. in particular, no features due towolf-rayet stars were convincingly detected. (2) high order balmer absorptionlines of hi (hobls), on the other hand, are detected in 40% of llagn.  these features, which are strongest in 100 myr--1 gyr intermediate agestellar populations, are accompanied by diluted metal absorption lines andbluer colors than other objects in the sample. (3) these intermediate agepopulations are very common (50 %) in llagn with relatively weak [oi] emission,but rare (10 %) in llagn with stronger [oi]. this is intriguing since llagnwith weak [oi] have been previously hypothesized to be ``transition objects''in which both an agn and young stars contribute to the emission-lineexcitation. massive stars, if present, are completely outshone by intermediateage and old stars in the optical. this happens in at least a couple of objectswhere independent uv spectroscopy detects young starbursts not seen in theoptical. (4) objects with predominantly old stars span the whole range of[oi]/halpha values, but (5) sources with significant young and/or intermediateage populations are nearly all (90%) weak [oi] emitters.

astro-ph;0506685	stellar populations and lya emission in two lensed z&gt;~6 galaxies	we present an analysis of two strongly lensed galaxies at z=6.56 and z ~ 7for which multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations are available.for one source the data include recent hst and spitzer observations. using ansed fitting technique considering a number of parameters we attempt toconstrain the properties of their stellar populations and their intrinsic lyaemission. the following main results are obtained for the individual galaxies:* triple arc in abell 2218: the most likely redshift of this source is z ~6.0-7.2. sed fits indicate generally a low extinction but do not stronglyconstrain the star formation (sf) history. best fits have typical ages of ~3 to400 myr. the apparent 4000ang break observed recently from combination ofirac/spitzer and hst observations, can also equally well be reproduced with thetemplate of a young (~3-5 myr). the estimated sfr is typically ~1 msun/yr, inagreement with previous estimates. the unknowns on the age and star formationhistory could easily explain the apparent absence of lya in this galaxy. *abell 370 hcm 6a: the available lya and continuum observations indicate twopossible solutions: 1) a young burst or ongoing constant sf with non-negligibleextinction or 2) a composite young+"old" stellar population. in the first caseone obtains a best fit a_v ~ 0.5-1.8 at a 1 sigma level. in consequence weobtain sfr ~ 11-41 msun/yr, higher than earlier estimates, and we estimate afairly high total luminosity (l ~ (1-4)*10^{11} lsun) for this galaxy, in therange lirg. a lya transmission of ~23-90% is estimated from our best fitmodels. other properties remain largely unconstrained. in case of compositestellar populations the sfr, mass, and luminosity estimate is lower. the twoscenarios may be distinguishable with irac/spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5micron.

astro-ph;0507278	o stars with weak winds: the galactic case	we study the stellar and wind properties of a sample of galactic o dwarfs totrack the conditions under which weak winds (i.e mass loss rates lower than ~1e-8 msol/yr) appear. the sample is composed of low and high luminosity dwarfsincluding vz stars and stars known to display qualitatively weak winds.atmosphere models including non-lte treatment, spherical expansion and lineblanketing are computed with the code cmfgen. both uv and ha lines are used toderive wind properties while optical h and he lines give the stellarparameters. mass loss rates of all stars are found to be lower than expectedfrom the hydrodynamical predictions of vink et al. (2001). for stars with logl/lsol &gt; 5.2, the reduction is by less than a factor 5 and is mainly due to theinclusion of clumping in the models. for stars with log l/lsol &lt; 5.2 thereduction can be as high as a factor 100. the inclusion of x-ray emission inmodels with low density is crucial to derive accurate mass loss rates from uvlines. the modified wind momentum - luminosity relation shows a significantchange of slope around this transition luminosity. terminal velocities of lowluminosity stars are also found to be low. the physical reason for such weakwinds is still not clear although the finding of weak winds in galactic starsexcludes the role of a reduced metallicity. x-rays, through the change in theionisation structure they imply, may be at the origin of a reduction of theradiative acceleration, leading to lower mass loss rates. a betterunderstanding of the origin of x-rays is of crucial importance for the study ofthe physics of weak winds.

astro-ph;0606134	constraining the population of 6 &lt; z &lt; 10 star-forming galaxies with  deep near-ir images of lensing clusters	(abridged) we present the first results of our deep survey of lensingclusters aimed at constraining the abundance of star-forming galaxies atz~6-10. deep near-ir photometry of two lensing clusters (a1835 and ac114) wasobtained with isaac/vlt. these images, combined with existing data in theoptical bands, including hst images, were used to select very high redshiftcandidates at z&gt;~6 among the optical-dropouts. we have identified 18(8) firstand second-category optical dropouts in a1835 (ac114), detected in more thanone filter up to h(vega)~23.8 (ab~25.2,uncorrected for lensing). among them,8(5) exhibit homogeneous seds compatible with star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~6,and 5(1) are more likely intermediate-redshift eros based on luminosityconsiderations. we have also identified a number of fainter sources in thesefields fulfilling our photometric selection and located around the criticallines. we use all these data to make a first attempt at constraining thedensity of star-forming galaxies present at 6&lt;z&lt;10 using lensing clusters.taken at face value, it appears that the number of candidates found seems to behigher than the one achieved in blank fields with similar photometric depth inthe near-ir. the luminosity function derived for z&gt;6 candidates appearscompatible with that of lbgs at z~3. the turnover observed by bouwens et al.(2005) towards the bright end relative to the z~3 lf is not observed in thissample. also the upper limit for the uv sfr density at z~6-10 is compatiblewith the usual values derived at z~5-6, but higher than the estimates obtainedin the nicmos ultra deep field (udf). increasing the number of blank andlensing fields with ultra-deep near-ir photometry is essential to get moreaccurate constraints on the abundance of z&gt;6 galaxies.

astro-ph;0703699	models for massive stellar populations with rotation	we present and discuss evolutionary synthesis models for massive stellarpopulations generated with the starburst99 code in combination with a new setof stellar evolution models accounting for rotation. the new stellar evolutionmodels were compiled from several data releases of the geneva group and coverheavy-element abundances ranging from twice solar to one fifth solar. theevolution models were computed for rotation velocities on the zero-agemain-sequence of 0 and 300 km/s and with the latest revision of stellarmass-loss rates. since the mass coverage is incomplete, in particular atnon-solar chemical composition, our parameter study is still preliminary andmust be viewed as exploratory. stellar population properties computed withstarburst99 and the new evolution models show some marked differences incomparison with models obtained using earlier tracks. since individual starsnow tend to be more luminous and bluer when on the blue side of thehertzsprung-russell diagram, the populations mirror this trend. for instance,increases by factors of two or more are found for the light-to-mass ratios atultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, as well as for the output of hydrogenionizing photons. if these results are confirmed once the evolution models havematured, recalibrations of certain star-formation and initial mass functionindicators will be required.

astro-ph;9606042	about the initial mass function and heii emission in young starbursts	we demonstrate that it is crucial to account for the evolution of thestarburst population in order to derive reliable numbers of o stars fromintegrated spectra for burst ages t &gt; 2 - 3 myr. in these cases the method ofvacca &amp; conti (1992) and vacca (1994) systematically underestimates the numberof o stars. therefore the current wr/o number ratios in wolf-rayet (wr)galaxies are overestimated. this questions recent claims about flat imf slopes(alpha ~ 1-2) in these objects. if the evolution of the burst is properlytreated we find that the observations are indeed compatible with a salpeterimf, in agreement with earlier studies.  including recent predictions from non-lte, line blanketed model atmosphereswhich account for stellar winds, we synthesize the nebular and wr heii 4686emission in young starbursts. for metallicities 1/5 &lt;= z/z_sun &lt;= 1 we predicta strong nebular heii emission due to a significant fraction of wc stars inearly wr phases of the burst. for other metallicities broad wr emission willalways dominate the heii emission. our predictions of the nebular heiiintensity agree well with the observations in wr galaxies and an importantfraction of the giant hii regions where nebular heii is detected. we proposefurther observational tests of our result.

(1994, 1997), and appropriateevolutionary models. from their parameters we argue that most of these starscan be regarded as wnl stars, and do hence not necessarily represent a peculiarclass. we suggest that some apparent differences with well known wr stars canbe understood in terms of their core burning stage and/or other changes due toa high metallicity. based on our present knowledge we conclude that in youngclusters with central stellar densities up to rho_c ~ 10.**(5-6) msun/pc**3 nocompelling evidence for a secondary effect influencing the evolution of massivestars has yet been found.

astro-ph;9611067	combined stellar structure and atmosphere models for massive stars. iv.  the impact on the ionization structure of single star hii regions	we study the impact of modern stellar atmospheres that take into account theeffects of stellar winds, departures from lte and line blanketing ("costar"models) on the ionization structure of hii regions. results from a large gridof photoionization models are presented. due to a flatter energy distributionin the hei continuum, compared to the widely used kurucz models, generallyhigher ionic ratios are obtained.  we find that n+/o+ and ne++/o++ can be safely used as direct indicators ofn/o and ne/o abundance ratios in hii regions, over a wide range ofastrophysical situations.  the roughly constant observed value of ne++/o++ ionic ratios in galactic hiiregions is naturally reproduced by photoionization models using costar fluxes,while kurucz models at solar metallicity fail to reproduce this behaviour. thisgives support to ionizing fluxes from non-lte atmospheres including stellarwinds and line blanketing. however, we also point out that tests of stellaratmosphere models from observations of hii regions are hampered by a lack ofstrong constraints on the ionization parameter.

astro-ph;9611068	combined stellar structure and atmosphere models for massive stars. iii.  spectral evolution and revised ionising fluxes of o3-b0 stars	we provide an extensive set of theoretical spectral energy distributions ofmassive stars derived from our "combined stellar structure and atmospheremodels". the calculations covering the entire main sequence evolution forinitial masses m_i=20 - 120 msun (o3-b0 stars of all luminosity classes) areused for a systematic study of the ionizing fluxes of o and early b stars. wedemonstrate the importance of accounting simultaneously for non-lte effects,line blanketing and stellar winds. the main results from our spectra are thefollowing: (1) the flux in the heii continuum is increased by 2 to 3 (3 to 6)orders of magnitudes compared to predictions from plane parallel non-lte (lte)model atmospheres. (2) the flux in the hei continuum is increased due tonon-lte effects. however, we find that it is also influenced by wind effects.the combined effect of a mass outflow and line blanketing leads to a flatterenergy distribution in the hei continuum, which confirms the results ofsellmaier et al. (1996) for a wider range of stellar parameters. (3) the fluxin the lyman continuum is also modified due to line blanketing and the presenceof a stellar winds, although to a lesser degree than the spectrum at higherenergies. we derive revised ionizing fluxes for o3 to b0 stars based on therecent teff and gravity calibrations of vacca et al. (1996). the total numberof lyman continuum photons is found to be slightly lower than previousderivations. due to the increased flux in the hei continuum the hardness ratioof the hei to h continuum is increased by 1.6 to 2.5 depending on spectral typeand luminosity class. a critical discussion of current model assumptions showsthat for stars of types later than b0, having weak stellar winds, reliablepredictions of ionizing fluxes are not yet possible.

astro-ph;9902334	starburst99: synthesis models for galaxies with active star formation	starburst99 is a comprehensive set of model predictions forspectrophotometric and related properties of galaxies with active starformation. the models are an improved and extended version of the data setpreviously published by leitherer &amp; heckman (1995). we have upgraded our codeby implementing the latest set of stellar evolution models of the geneva groupand the model atmosphere grid compiled by lejeune et al. (1997). severalpredictions which were not included in the previous publication are shown herefor the first time. the models are presented in a homogeneous way for fivemetallicities between z = 0.040 and 0.001 and three choices of the initial massfunction. the age coverage is 10^6 to 10^9 yr. we also show the spectral energydistributions which are used to compute colors and other quantities. the fulldata set is available for retrieval athttp://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/. this website allows users to runspecific models with non-standard parameters as well. we also make the sourcecode available to the community.

astro-ph;9909203	what heats the bright hii regions in i zw 18?	we have used the radiation field from a starburst population synthesis modelappropriate for the brightest hii region of izw 18 to perform a photoionizationmodel analysis of this object. we have investigated whether, with the observednebular density distribution as revealed by the hst images and a total stellarradiation compatible with the observed uv flux, the constraints represented bythe observed ionization structure, the heii/hbeta ratio, the halpha flux andthe electron temperature indicated by the [oiii] 4363/5007 ratio can bereproduced. we have found that, even taking into account strong deviations fromthe adopted spectral energy distribution of the ionizing radiation and theeffect of additional x-rays, the photoionization models yield too low a4363/5007 ratio by about 30 %. this discrepancy is significant and poses aninteresting problem, which cannot be solved by expected inaccuracies in theatomic data. the missing energy may be of the same order of magnitude as theone provided by the stellar photons or lower, depending on the way it acts onthe 4363 line. elemental abundance determinations in i zw 18 are affected bythis problem. before the nature of the missing heating source and itsinteractions with the nebular gas are better understood it is, however, notpossible to estimate the typical uncertainties by which standard empiricalmethods are affected. other topics discussed include: nebular heii emission,photon leakage, [oi] 6300 emission, reddening, ionization correction factors.(abridged abstract)

astro-ph;9910180	gamma-ray line emission from ob associations and young open clusters	ob associations and young open clusters constitute the most prolificnucleosynthesis sites in our galaxy. the combined activity of stellar winds andcore-collapse supernovae ejects significant amounts of freshly synthesisednuclei into the interstellar medium. radioactive isotopes, such as 26al or60fe, that have been co-produced in such events may eventually be observed bygamma-ray instruments through their characteristic decay-line signatures. inorder to study such signatures and to derive constraints on the involvednucleosynthesis processes, we developed a multi-wavelength evolutionarysynthesis model for massive star associations. we apply this model toassociations and clusters in the well-studied cygnus region for which were-determined the stellar census based on photometric and spectroscopic data.in particular we study the relation between 1.809 mev gamma-ray line emissionand ionising flux, since the latter has turned out to provide an excellenttracer of the global galactic 1.809 mev emission. we compare our model tocomptel 1.8 mev gamma-ray line observations from which we derive limits on therelative contributions from massive stars and core-collapse supernovae to theactual 26al content in this region. based on our model we make predictionsabout the expected 26al and 60fe line signatures in the cygnus region. thesepredictions make the cygnus region a prime target for the future integralmission.
