0707.0737	the causes of halo shape changes induced by cooling baryons: disks  versus substructures	cold dark matter cosmogony predicts triaxial dark matter halos, whereasobservations find quite round halos. this is most likely due to thecondensation of baryons leading to rounder halos. we examine the halo phasespace distribution basis for such shape changes. triaxial halos are supportedby box orbits, which pass arbitrarily close to the density center. the decreasein triaxiality caused by baryons is thought to be due to the scattering ofthese orbits. we test this hypothesis with simulations of disks grown insidetriaxial halos. after the disks are grown we check whether the phase spacestructure has changed by evaporating the disks and comparing the initial andfinal states. while the halos are substantially rounder when the disk is atfull mass, their final shape after the disk is evaporated is not much differentfrom the initial. likewise, the halo becomes (more) radially anisotropic whenthe disk is grown, but the final anisotropy is consistent with the initial.only if the baryons are unreasonably compact or massive does the halo changeirreversibly. we show that the character of individual orbits is not generallychanged by the growing mass. thus the central condensation of baryons does notdestroy enough box orbits to cause the shape change. rather, box orbits merelybecome rounder along with the global potential. however, if angular momentum istransferred to the halo, either via satellites or via bars, a largeirreversible change in the halo distribution occurs. the ability of satellitesto alter the phase space distribution of the halo is of particular concern togalaxy formation simulations since halo triaxiality can profoundly influencethe evolution of disks.

1007.0579	from planetesimals to terrestrial planets: n-body simulations including  the effects of nebular gas and giant planets	we present results from a suite of n-body simulations that follow theaccretion history of the terrestrial planets using a new parallel treecode thatwe have developed. we initially place 2000 equal size planetesimals between0.5--4.0 au and the collisional growth is followed until the completion ofplanetary accretion (&gt; 100 myr). all the important effect of gas in laminardisks are taken into account: the aerodynamic gas drag, the disk-planetinteraction including type i migration, and the global disk potential whichcauses inward migration of secular resonances as the gas dissipates. we varythe initial total mass and spatial distribution of the planetesimals, the timescale of dissipation of nebular gas, and orbits of jupiter and saturn. we endup with one to five planets in the terrestrial region. in order to maintainsufficient mass in this region in the presence of type i migration, the timescale of gas dissipation needs to be 1-2 myr. the final configurations andcollisional histories strongly depend on the orbital eccentricity of jupiter.if today's eccentricity of jupiter is used, then most of bodies in theasteroidal region are swept up within the terrestrial region owing to theinward migration of the secular resonance, and giant impacts betweenprotoplanets occur most commonly around 10 myr. if the orbital eccentricity ofjupiter is close to zero, as suggested in the nice model, the effect of thesecular resonance is negligible and a large amount of mass stays for a longperiod of time in the asteroidal region. with a circular orbit for jupiter,giant impacts usually occur around 100 myr, consistent with the accretion timescale indicated from isotope records. however, we inevitably have an earth sizeplanet at around 2 au in this case. it is very difficult to obtain spatiallyconcentrated terrestrial planets together with very late giant impacts.

1104.0949	haloes gone mad: the halo-finder comparison project	[abridged] we present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter haloproperties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. thesecodes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (fof),spherical-overdensity (so) and phase-space based algorithms. we furtherintroduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allowshalo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against thosepresented here. this set includes mock haloes containing various levels anddistributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as acosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. all thehalo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location ofour mock haloes. they further returned lists of particles (potentially)belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of thecircular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. all the findersbased in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was locatedclose to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the massrecovered varies from finder to finder. those finders based in phase spacecould resolve central substructure although they found difficulties inaccurately recovering its properties. via a resolution study we found that mostof the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than30-40 particles. however, also here the phase space finders excelled byresolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. by comparing the halo findersusing a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkablywell on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass,position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).

0711.1162	the formation of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies and nucleated dwarf  galaxies	ultra compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) have similar properties as massiveglobular clusters or the nuclei of nucleated galaxies. recent observationssuggesting a high dark matter content and a steep spatial distribution withingroups and clusters provide new clues as to their origins. we performhigh-resolution n-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations designedto elucidate two possible formation mechanisms for these systems: the mergingof globular clusters in the centre of a dark matter halo, or the massivelystripped remnant of a nucleated galaxy. both models produce density profiles aswell as the half light radii that can fit the observational constraints.however, we show that the first scenario results to ucds that are underluminousand contain no dark matter. this is because the sinking process ejects most ofthe dark matter particles from the halo centre. stripped nuclei give a morepromising explanation, especially if the nuclei form via the sinking of gas,funneled down inner galactic bars, since this process enhances the central darkmatter content. even when the entire disk is tidally stripped away, the nucleusstays intact and can remain dark matter dominated even after severe stripping.total galaxy disruption beyond the nuclei only occurs on certain orbits anddepends on the amount of dissipation during nuclei formation. by comparing thetotal disruption of cdm subhaloes in a cluster potential we demonstrate thatthis model also leads to the observed spatial distribution of ucds which can betested in more detail with larger data sets.

1206.5302	toward an accurate mass function for precision cosmology	cosmological surveys aim to use the evolution of the abundance of galaxyclusters to accurately constrain the cosmological model. in the context oflcdm, we show that it is possible to achieve the required percent levelaccuracy in the halo mass function with gravity-only cosmological simulations,and we provide simulation start and run parameter guidelines for doing so. someprevious works have had sufficient statistical precision, but lacked robustverification of absolute accuracy. convergence tests of the mass function with,for example, simulation start redshift can exhibit false convergence of themass function due to counteracting errors, potentially misleading one to inferoverly optimistic estimations of simulation accuracy. percent level accuracy ispossible if initial condition particle mapping uses second order lagrangianperturbation theory, and if the start epoch is between 10 and 50 expansionfactors before the epoch of halo formation of interest. the mass function forhalos with fewer than ~1000 particles is highly sensitive to simulationparameters and start redshift, implying a practical minimum mass resolutionlimit due to mass discreteness. the narrow range in converged start redshiftsuggests that it is not presently possible for a single simulation to captureaccurately the cluster mass function while also starting early enough to modelaccurately the numbers of reionisation era galaxies, whose baryon feedbackprocesses may affect later cluster properties. ultimately, to fully exploitcurrent and future cosmological surveys will require accurate modeling ofbaryon physics and observable properties, a formidable challenge for whichaccurate gravity-only simulations are just an initial step.

1304.0585	structure finding in cosmological simulations: the state of affairs	the ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations ofcosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for theiranalysis. during the past decade, the art of object finding in thesesimulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. amultitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques havebeen spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will providethe same (physical) information about the structures of interest. here wesummarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": weinvestigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders.to this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods,clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties.we observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objectsleading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and vmax function,but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by allfinders differ. the strength of the variation, however, depends on the propertystudied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak valueof the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derivedquantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. our study indicatesthat the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codesstems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent --the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles isimplemented. we close with a discussion of the relevance and implications ofthe scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.

0806.1689	formation and accretion history of terrestrial planets from runaway  growth through to late time: implications for orbital eccentricity	remnant planetesimals might have played an important role in reducing theorbital eccentricities of the terrestrial planets after their formation viagiant impacts. however, the population and the size distribution of remnantplanetesimals during and after the giant impact stage are unknown, becausesimulations of planetary accretion in the runaway growth and giant impactstages have been conducted independently. here we report results of directn-body simulations of the formation of terrestrial planets beginning with acompact planetesimal disk. the initial planetesimal disk has a total mass andangular momentum as observed for the terrestrial planets, and we vary the width(0.3 and 0.5au) and the number of planetesimals (1000-5000). this initialconfiguration generally gives rise to three final planets of similar size, andsometimes a fourth small planet forms near the location of mars. since asufficient number of planetesimals remains, even after the giant impact phase,the final orbital eccentricities are as small as those of the earth and venus.

astro-ph;0011041	tidal stirring and the origin of dwarf spheroidals in the local group	n-body/sph simulations are used to study the evolution of dwarf irregulargalaxies (dirrs) entering the dark matter halo of the milky way or m31 onplunging orbits. we propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution ofgas rich, rotationally supported dirrs, mostly found at the outskirts of thelocal group (lg), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dsphs)or dwarf ellipticals (des), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals.the initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive darkmatter halos and reproduce nearby dirrs. repeated tidal shocks at thepericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and triggerdynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component.after only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (lsb) dirrs are transformed intodsphs, while high surface brightness (hsb) dirrs evolve into des. thisevolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relationobserved for lg dwarfs. dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, likethe archetypical dirr gr8, are turned into draco or ursa minor, the faintestand most dark matter dominated among lg dsphs. if disks include a gaseouscomponent, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts ofstar formation. the resulting star formation histories are in good qualitativeagreement with those derived using hst color-magnitude diagrams for localdsphs.

astro-ph;0110386	tidal debris of dwarf spheroidals as a probe of structure formation  models	recent observations suggest that carina and other nearby dwarf spheroidalgalaxies are surrounded by unbound stars tidally stripped by the milky way. werun high-resolution n-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within themilky way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with darkmatter potentials as those implied by current structure formation models. weshow that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or withcuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter ($c &lt; 5$) lead to flatouter stellar density profiles like that of carina for a variety of orbitalconfigurations. on the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars fromcuspy dark matter halos with concentrations as high as predicted by cdm modelsat the mass scale of dwarf galaxies ($c \simgt 10$) and the data can only bereproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. our simulations show that carina islosing mass at a fractional rate $&lt; 0.1$ gyr$^{-1}$ and its mass-to-light ratiocould be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected alongthe line of sight. we follow the evolution of the tidal debris within atriaxial clumpy cold dark matter milky way halo which causes differentialprecession and small scale heating of the stellar streams. this renders theiruse as a dynamical tracer of the galactic potential practically useless, butdoes provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. models with warmdark matter (wdm) or fluid dark matter (fdm) produce dwarf halos with lowercentral densities than cdm and would be consistent with the observed tidaltails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current dataon nearby dwarf spheroidals. galactic halos in fdm are smooth and spherical andwould be favored by the detection of coherent streams.

astro-ph;0203004	the structural evolution of substructure	we investigate the evolution of substructure in cold dark matter halos usingn-body simulations of tidal stripping of substructure halos (subhalos) within astatic host potential. we find that halos modeled following the navarro, frenk&amp; white (nfw) mass profile lose mass continuously due to tides from the massivehost, leading to the total disruption of satellite halos with small tidalradii. the structure of stripped nfw halos depends mainly on the fraction ofmass lost, and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the originalnfw profile. we apply these results to substructure in the milky way, andconclude that the dark matter halos surrounding its dwarf spheroidal (dsph)satellites have circular velocity curves that peak well beyond the luminousradius at velocities significantly higher than expected from the stellarvelocity dispersion. our modeling suggests that the true tidal radii of dsphslie well beyond the putative tidal cutoff observed in the surface brightnessprofile, suggesting that the latter are not really tidal in origin but ratherfeatures in the light profile of limited dynamical relevance. for draco, inparticular, our modeling implies that its tidal radius is much larger thanderived by irwin &amp; hatzidimitriou (1995), lending support to the interpretationof recent sloan survey data by odenkirchen et al. (2001). similarly, our modelsuggests that carina's halo has a peak circular velocity of ~55 km/s, which mayhelp explain how this small galaxy has managed to retain enough gas to undergoseveral bursts of star formation. our results imply a close correspondencebetween the most massive subhalos expected in a cdm universe and the knownsatellites of the milky way, and suggest that only subhalos with peak circularvelocities below 35 km/s lack readily detectable luminous counterparts.

astro-ph;0304549	two body relaxation in cdm simulations	n-body simulations of the hierarchical formation of cosmic structures sufferfrom the problem that the first objects to form always contain just a fewparticles. although relaxation is not an issue for virialised objectscontaining millions of particles, collisional processes will always dominatewithin the first structures that collapse. first we quantify how the relaxationvaries with resolution, softening, and radius within isolated equilibrium andnon-equilibrium cuspy haloes. we then attempt to determine how this numericaleffect propagates through a merging hierarchy by measuring the local relaxationrates of each particle throughout the hierarchical formation of a dark matterhalo. the central few percent of the final structures - a region which onemight naively think is well resolved at the final time since the haloescontains about 10^6 particles - suffer from high degrees of relaxation. it isnot clear how to interpret the effects of the accumulated relaxation rate, butwe argue that it describes a region within which one should be careful abouttrusting the numerical results. substructure haloes are most affected byrelaxation since they contain few particles at a constant energy for the entiresimulation. we show that relaxation will flatten a cusp in just a few meanrelaxation times of a halo. we explore the effect of resolution on the degreeof relaxation and we find that increasing n slowly reduces the degree ofrelaxation proportional to n^{-0.25} rather than proportional to n. simulatedwith the same relative mass resolution (i.e. equal numbers of particles)cluster mass objects suffer significantly more relaxation than galaxy massobjects since they form relatively late and therefore more of the particlesspend more time in small n haloes.

astro-ph;0312544	evolution of the density profiles of dark matter haloes	we use numerical simulations in a lambda cdm cosmology to model densityprofiles in a set of 16 dark matter haloes with resolutions of up to 7 millionparticles within the virial radius. these simulations allow us to followrobustly the formation and evolution of the central cusp over a large massrange of 10^11 to 10^14 m_sun, down to approximately 0.5% of the virial radius,and from redshift 5 to the present. the cusp of the density profile is set atredshifts of 2 or greater and remains remarkably stable to the present time,when considered in non-comoving coordinates. we fit our haloes to a 2 parameterprofile where the steepness of the asymptotic cusp is given by gamma, and itsradial extent is described by the concentration, c_gamma. in our simulations,we find gamma = 1.4 - 0.08log(m/m_*) for haloes of 0.01m_* to 1000m_*, with alarge scatter of gamma ~ +/-0.3$; and c_gamma = 8*m/m_*^{-0.15}, with a largem/m_* dependent scatter roughly equal to +/- c_gamma. our redshift zero haloeshave inner slope parameters ranging approximately from r^{-1} to r^{-1.5}, witha median of roughly r^{-1.3}. this 2 parameter profile fit works well for allour halo types, whether or not they show evidence of a steep asymptotic cusp.we also model a cluster in power law cosmologies of p ~ k^n (n=0,-1,-2,-2.7).we find larger concentration radii and shallower cusps for steeper n. theminimum resolved radius is well described by the mean interparticle separation.the trend of steeper and more concentrated cusps for smaller $m/m_*$ haloesclearly shows that dwarf sized lambda cdm haloes have, on average,significantly steeper density profiles within the inner few percent of thevirial radius than inferred from recent observations. code to reproduce thisprofile can be downloaded from http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/~reed/profile.html

astro-ph;0402160	velocity and spatial biases in cdm subhalo distributions	we present a statistical study of substructure within a sample of lcdmclusters and galaxies simulated with up to 25 million particles. with thousandsof subhalos per object we can accurately measure their spatial clustering andvelocity distribution functions and compare these with observational data. thesubstructure properties of galactic halos closely resembles those of galaxyclusters with a small scatter in the mass and circular velocity functions. thevelocity distribution function is non-maxwellian and flat topped with anegative kurtosis of about -0.7. within the virial radius the velocity bias$b=\sigma_{\rm sub}/\sigma_{\rm dm}\sim 1.12 \pm 0.04$, increasing to b &gt; 1.3within the halo centers. slow subhalos are much less common, due to physicaldisruption by gravitational tides early in the merging history. this leads to aspatially anti-biased subhalo distribution that is well fitted by a coredisothermal. observations of cluster galaxies do not show such biases which weinterpret as a limitation of pure dark matter simulations - we estimate that weare missing half of the halo population which has been destroyed by physicalovermerging. high resolution hydrodynamical simulations are required to studythese issues further. if cdm is correct then the cluster galaxies must survivethe tidal field, perhaps due to baryonic inflow during elliptical galaxyformation. spirals can never exist near the cluster centers and the ellipticalgalaxies there will have little remaining dark matter. this implies that themorphology-density relation is set {\it before} the cluster forms, rather thana subsequent transformation of disks to s0's by virtue of the clusterenvironment.

astro-ph;0406034	dark matter subhaloes in numerical simulations	we use cosmological lcdm numerical simulations to model the evolution of thesubstructure population in sixteen dark matter haloes with resolutions of up toseven million particles within the virial radius. the combined substructurecircular velocity distribution function (vdf) for hosts of 10^11 to 10^14 msunat redshifts from zero to two or higher has a self-similar shape, isindependent of host halo mass and redshift, and follows the relation:dn/dv=(1/8)(v_cmax/v_cmax,host)^-4. halo to halo variance in the vdf is afactor of roughly two to four. at high redshifts, we find preliminary evidencefor fewer large substructure haloes (subhaloes). specific angular momenta aresignificantly lower for subhaloes nearer the host halo centre where tidalstripping is more effective. the radial distribution of subhaloes is marginallyconsistent with the mass profile for r &gt;~ 0.3r_vir, where the possibility ofartificial numerical disruption of subhaloes can be most reliably excluded byour convergence study, although a subhalo distribution that is shallower thanthe mass profile is favoured. subhalo masses but not circular velocitiesdecrease toward the host centre. subhalo velocity dispersions hint at apositive velocity bias at small radii. there is a weak bias toward morecircular orbits at lower redshift, especially at small radii. we additionallymodel a cluster in several power law cosmologies of p ~ k^n, and demonstratethat a steeper spectral index, n, results in significantly less substructure.

astro-ph;0407407	fate of supermassive black holes and evolution of the m(bh)-sigma  relation in merging galaxies: the effect of gaseous dissipation	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the orbital evolution of supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) using high-resolution self-consistent gasdynamicalsimulations of binary equal- and unequal-mass mergers of disk galaxies. thegalaxy models are consistent with the lcdm paradigm of structure formation andthe simulations include the effects of radiative cooling and star formation. wefind that equal-mass mergers always lead to the formation of a close smbh pairat the center of the remnant with separations limited solely by the adoptedforce resolution of ~ 100 pc. instead, the final smbh separation inunequal-mass mergers depends sensitively on how the central structure of themerging galaxies is modified by dissipation. in the absence of dissipation, thesatellite galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completedleaving its smbh wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnantfor the formation of a close pair. in contrast, we show that gas coolingfacilitates the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companiongalaxy to tidal disruption. moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxiesconstructed to obey the m(bh)-sigma relation, move relative to it depending onwhether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless merger, regardless of themass ratio of the merging systems. collisionless simulations reveal thatremnants tend to move away from the mean relation highlighting the role ofgas-poor mergers as a possible source of scatter.  in dissipational mergers, the interplay between strong gas inflows associatedwith the formation of massive nuclear disks and the consumption of gas by starformation provides the necessary fuel to the smbhs and allows the mergerremnants to satisfy the relation.

astro-ph;0412312	the gravitational and hydrodynamical interaction between the lmc and the  galaxy	we use high resolution n-body/sph simulations to study the hydrodynamical andgravitational interaction between the large magellanic cloud and the milky way.we model the dark and hot extended halo components as well as thestellar/gaseous disks of the two galaxies. both galaxies are embedded inextended cuspy lcdm dark matter halos. we follow the previous four gyrs of thelmc's orbit such that it ends up with the correct location and orientation onthe sky. tidal forces elongate the lmc's disk, forcing a bar and creating astrong warp and diffuse stellar halo, although very few stars become unbound.the stellar halo may account for some of the microlensing events. ram-pressurefrom a low density ionised halo is then sufficient to remove 1.4e8 msolar ofgas from the lmc's disk forming a great circle trailing stream around thegalaxy. the column density of stripped gas falls by two orders of magnitude 100degrees from lmc. the lmc does not induce any response in the milky way disk.on the contrary, the tides raised by the milky way determine the truncation ofthe satellite at about 11 kpc. after several gyrs of interaction the gas diskof the lmc is smaller than the stellar disk due to ram pressure and its sizecompares well with the observational data.

astro-ph;0502213	on the survival and disruption of earth mass cdm micro-haloes	neutralino dark matter leads to the formation of numerous earth mass darkmatter haloes at redshifts z\approx 60 (diemand et al. 2005). these abundantcdm micro-haloes have cuspy density profiles that can easily withstand thegalactic tidal field at the solar radius. zhao, taylor, silk &amp; hooper(astro-ph/0502049) concluded that ``...the majority of dark mattersubstructures with masses \sim 10^{-6}m_o will be tidally disrupted due tointeractions with stars in the galactic halo''. however these authors assumed ahalo density of stars that is at least an order of magnitude higher thanobserved. we show that the appropriate application of the impulse approximationis to the regime of multiple encounters, not single disruptive events asadopted by zhao et al., which leads to a survival time of several hubble times.therefore we do not expect the tidal heating by galactic stars to affect theabundance of micro-haloes. disk crossing will cause some mass loss but thecentral cores are likely to survive and could be detected as gamma-ray sourceswith proper motions of several arc minutes per year.

astro-ph;0504277	simultaneous ram pressure and tidal stripping; how dwarf spheroidals  lost their gas	we perform high-resolution n-body+sph simulations of gas-rich dwarf galaxysatellites orbiting within a milky way-sized halo and study for the first timethe combined effects of tides and ram pressure. the structure of the galaxymodels and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance to thoseexpected in a lcdm universe.while tidal stirring of disky dwarfs producesobjects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarfspheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirelyremove their gas component. gravitational tides can aid ram pressure strippingby diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce barformation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult.this inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively.assuming a low density of the hot galactic corona consistent with observationalconstraints, dwarfs with v_{peak} &lt; 30 km/s can be completely stripped of theirgas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. instead, dwarfs withmore massive dark haloes and v_{peak} &gt; 30 km/s lose most or all of their gascontent only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partiallycounteracting the bar-driven inflow. we show that the ionizing radiation fromthe cosmic uv background at z &gt; 2 can provide the required heating. in theseobjects most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenterpassage,explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in dracoand ursa minor. the stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressureconfined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densitiescomparable to the hi clouds recently discovered around m31.(abridged)

astro-ph;0506125	radial distribution and strong lensing statistics of satellite galaxies  and substructure using high resolution lcdm hydrodynamical simulations	we analyse the number density and radial distribution of substructures andsatellite galaxies using cosmological simulations that follow the gas dynamicsof a baryonic component, including shock heating, radiative cooling and starformation within the hierarchical concordance lcdm model. we find that thedissipation of the baryons greatly enhances the survival of subhaloes,expecially in the galaxy core, resulting in a radial distribution of satellitegalaxies that closely follows the overall mass distribution in the inner partof the halo. hydrodynamical simulations are necessary to resolve the adiabaticcontraction and dense cores of galaxies, resulting in a total number ofsatellites a factor of two larger than found in pure dark matter simulation, ingood agreement with the observed spatial distribution of satellite galaxieswithin galaxies and clusters. convergence tests show that the coreddistribution found by previous authors in pure n-body simulations was due tophysical overmerging of dark matter only structures.  we proceed to use a ray-shooting technique in order to study the impact ofthese additional substructures on the number of violations of the cusp causticmagnification relation. we develop a new approach to try to disentangle theeffect of substructures from the intrinsic discreteness of n-body simulations.even with the increased number of substructures in the centres of galaxies, weare not able to reproduce the observed high numbers of discrepancies observedin the flux ratios of multiply lensed quasars.

astro-ph;0510370	globular clusters, satellite galaxies and stellar haloes from early dark  matter peaks	the milky way contains several distinct old stellar components that provide afossil record of its formation. we can understand their spatial distributionand kinematics in a hierarchical formation scenario by associating theproto-galactic fragments envisaged by searle and zinn (1978) with the rarepeaks able to cool gas in the cold dark matter density field collapsing atredshift z&gt;10. we use hierarchical structure formation simulations to explorethe kinematics and spatial distribution of these early star-forming structuresin galaxy haloes today. most of the proto-galaxies rapidly merge, their stellarcontents and dark matter becoming smoothly distributed and forming the innergalactic halo. the metal-poor globular clusters and old halo stars becometracers of this early evolutionary phase, centrally biased and naturallyreproducing the observed steep fall off with radius. the most outlying peaksfall in late and survive to the present day as satellite galaxies. the observedradial velocity dispersion profile and the local radial velocity anisotropy ofmilky way halo stars are successfully reproduced in this model. if this epochof structure formation coincides with a suppression of further cooling intolower sigma peaks then we can reproduce the rarity, kinematics and spatialdistribution of satellite galaxies as suggested by bullock et al. (2000).reionisation at z=12+/-2 provides a natural solution to the missing satellitesproblem. measuring the distribution of globular clusters and halo light onscales from galaxies to clusters could be used to constrain global versus localreionisation models. if reionisation occurs contemporary, our model predicts aconstant frequency of blue globulars relative to the host halo mass, except fordwarf galaxies where the average relative frequencies become smaller.

astro-ph;0601115	angular momentum transport and disk morphology in sph simulations of  galaxy formation	we perform controlled n-body/sph simulations of disk galaxy formation bycooling a rotating gaseous mass distribution inside equilibrium cuspy sphericaland triaxial dark matter halos. we systematically study the angular momentumtransport and the disk morphology as we increase the number of dark matter andgas particles from 10^4 to 10^6, and decrease the gravitational softening from2 kpc to 50 parsecs. the angular momentum transport, disk morphology and radialprofiles depend sensitively on force and mass resolution. at low resolution,similar to that used in most current cosmological simulations, the cold gascomponent has lost half of its initial angular momentum via differentmechanisms. the angular momentum is transferred primarily to the hot halocomponent, by resolution-dependent hydrodynamical and gravitational torques,the latter arising from asymmetries in the mass distribution. in addition,disk-particles can lose angular momentum while they are still in the hot phaseby artificial viscosity. in the central disk, particles can transfer away over99% of their initial angular momentum due to spiral structure and/or thepresence of a central bar. the strength of this transport also depends on forceand mass resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability, lowmass resolution enhances the spiral structure. this complex interplay betweenresolution and angular momentum transfer highlights the complexity ofsimulations of galaxy formation even in isolated haloes. with 10^6 gas and darkmatter particles, disk particles lose only 10-20% of their original angularmomentum, yet we are unable to produce pure exponential profiles.

astro-ph;0601404	does the fornax dwarf spheroidal have a central cusp or core?	the dark matter dominated fornax dwarf spheroidal has five globular clustersorbiting at ~1 kpc from its centre. in a cuspy cdm halo the globulars wouldsink to the centre from their current positions within a few gyrs, presenting apuzzle as to why they survive undigested at the present epoch. we show that asolution to this timing problem is to adopt a cored dark matter halo. we usenumerical simulations and analytic calculations to show that, under theseconditions, the sinking time becomes many hubble times; the globularseffectively stall at the dark matter core radius. we conclude that the fornaxdwarf spheroidal has a shallow inner density profile with a core radiusconstrained by the observed positions of its globular clusters. if the phasespace density of the core is primordial then it implies a warm dark matterparticle and gives an upper limit to its mass of ~0.5 kev, consistent with thatrequired to significantly alleviate the substructure problem.

astro-ph;0602003	the age dependence of galaxy clustering	we construct mock galaxy catalogues to analyse clustering properties of alambda cold dark matter (lcdm) universe within a cosmological dark mattersimulation of sufficient resolution to resolve structure down to the scale ofdwarfs. we show that there is a strong age-clustering correlation for objectslikely to host luminous galaxies, which includes the satellite halo (subhalo)population. older mock galaxies are significantly more clustered in ourcatalog, which consists of satellite haloes as well as the central peaks ofdiscrete haloes, selected solely by peak circular velocity. this age dependenceis caused mainly by the age-clustering relation for discrete haloes, recentlyfound by gao et al., acting mostly on field members, combined with the tendencyfor older mock galaxies to lie within groups and clusters, where galaxyclustering is enhanced. our results suggest that the clustering age dependenceis manifested in real galaxies. at small scales (less than ~5 mpc/h), the verysimple assumption that galaxy colour depends solely on halo age is inconsistentwith the strength of the observed clustering colour trends, where red galaxiesbecome increasingly more clustered than blue galaxies toward smaller scales,suggesting that luminosity weighted galaxy ages do not closely trace theassembly epoch of their dark matter hosts. the age dependence is present but ismuch weaker for satellite haloes lying within groups and clusters than for theglobal population.

astro-ph;9903164	cold collapse and the core catastrophe	we show that a universe dominated by cold dark matter fails to reproduce therotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies, one of the key problems thatit was designed to resolve. we perform numerical simulations of the formationof dark matter halos, each containing \gsim 10^6 particles and resolved to0.003 times the virial radius, allowing an accurate comparison with rotationcurve data. a good fit to both galactic and cluster sized halos can be achievedusing the density profile rho(r) \propto [(r/r_s)^1.5(1+(r/r_s)^1.5)]^-1, wherer_s is a scale radius. this profile has a steeper asymptotic slope, rho(r)\propto r^-1.5, and a sharper turnover than found by lower resolution studies.the central structure of relaxed halos that form within a hierarchical universehas a remarkably small scatter (unrelaxed halos would not host disks). wecompare the results with a sample of dark matter dominated, low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies with circular velocities in the range 100-300 km/s.the rotation curves of disks within cold dark matter halos rise too steeply tomatch these data which require a constant mass density in the central regions.the same conclusion is reached if we compare the scale free shape of observedrotation curves with the simulation data. it is important to confirm theseresults using stellar rather than hi rotation curves for lsb galaxies. we testthe effects of introducing a cut-off in the power spectrum that may occur in auniverse dominated by warm dark matter. in this case halos form by a monolithiccollapse but the final density profile hardly changes, demonstrating that themerger history does not play a role in determining the halo structure.

astro-ph;9910166	density profiles and substructure of dark matter halos: converging  results at ultra-high numerical resolution	can n-body simulations reliably determine the structural properties of darkmatter halos? focussing on a virgo-sized galaxy cluster, we increase theresolution of current ``high resolution simulations'' by almost an order ofmagnitude to examine the convergence of the important physical quantities. wehave 4 million particles within the cluster and force resolution 0.5 kpc/h(0.05% of the virial radius). the central density profile has a logarithmicslope of -1.5, as found in lower resolution studies of the same halo,indicating that the profile has converged to the ``physical'' limit down toscales of a few kpc. also the abundance of substructure is consistent with thatderived from lower resolution runs; on the scales explored, the mass andcircular velocity functions are close to power laws of exponents ~ -1.9 and -4.overmerging appears to be globally unimportant for suhalos with circularvelocities &gt; 100 km/s. we can trace most of the cluster progenitors from z=3 tothe present; the central object (the dark matter analog of a cd galaxy)isassembled between z=3 and 1 from the merging of a dozen halos with v_circ \sim300 km/s. the mean circular velocity of the subhalos decreases by ~ 20% over 5billion years, due to tidal mass loss. the velocity dispersions of halos anddark matter globally agree within 10%, but the halos are spatially anti-biased,and, in the very central region of the cluster, they show positive velocitybias; however, this effect appears to depend on numerical resolution.

0812.1216	massive black hole recoil in high resolution hosts	the final inspiral and coalescence of a black hole binary can produce highlybeamed gravitational wave radiation. to conserve linear momentum, the blackhole remnant can recoil with "kick" velocity as high as 4000 km/s. we presenttwo sets of full n-body simulations of recoiling massive black holes (mbh) inhigh-resolution, non-axisymmetric potentials. the host to the first set ofsimulations is the main halo of the via lactea i simulation (diemand et al.2007). the nature of the resulting orbits is investigated through a numericalmodel where orbits are integrated assuming an evolving, triaxial nfw potential,and dynamical friction is calculated directly from the velocity dispersionalong the major axes of the main halo of via lactea i. by comparing thetriaxial case to a spherical model, we find that the wandering time spent bythe mbh is significantly increased due to the asphericity of the halo. forkicks larger than 200 km/s, the remnant mbh does not return to the inner 200 pcwithin 1 gyr, a timescale an order of magnitude larger than the upper limit ofthe estimated qso lifetime. the second set of simulations is run using theoutcome of a high-resolution gas-rich merger (mayer et al. 2007) as hostpotential. in this case, a recoil velocity of 500 km/s cannot remove the mbhfrom the nuclear region.

0812.2033	the graininess of dark matter haloes	we use the recently completed one billion particle via lactea ii lambdacdmsimulation to investigate local properties like density, mean velocity,velocity dispersion, anisotropy, orientation and shape of the velocitydispersion ellipsoid, as well as structure in velocity space of dark matterhaloes. we show that at the same radial distance from the halo centre, theseproperties can deviate by orders of magnitude from the canonical, sphericallyaveraged values, a variation that can only be partly explained by triaxialityand the presence of subhaloes. the mass density appears smooth in the centralrelaxed regions but spans four orders of magnitude in the outskirts, bothbecause of the presence of subhaloes as well as of underdense regions and holesin the matter distribution. in the inner regions the local velocity dispersionellipsoid is aligned with the shape ellipsoid of the halo. this is not true inthe outer parts where the orientation becomes more isotropic. the clumpystructure in local velocity space of the outer halo can not be well describedby a smooth multivariate normal distribution. via lactea ii also shows thepresence of cold streams made visible by their high 6d phase space density.generally, the structure of dark matter haloes shows a high degree ofgraininess in phase space that cannot be described by a smooth distributionfunction.

0706.1270	the cosmic code comparison project	current and upcoming cosmological observations allow us to probe structureson smaller and smaller scales, entering highly nonlinear regimes. in order toobtain theoretical predictions in these regimes, large cosmological simulationshave to be carried out. the promised high accuracy from observations make thesimulation task very demanding: the simulations have to be at least as accurateas the observations. this requirement can only be fulfilled by carrying out anextensive code validation program. the first step of such a program is thecomparison of different cosmology codes including gravitation interactionsonly. in this paper we extend a recently carried out code comparison project toinclude five more simulation codes. we restrict our analysis to a smallcosmological volume which allows us to investigate properties of halos. for thematter power spectrum and the mass function, the previous results hold, withthe codes agreeing at the 10% level over wide dynamic ranges. we extend ouranalysis to the comparison of halo profiles and investigate the halo count as afunction of local density. we introduce and discuss paraview as a flexibleanalysis tool for cosmological simulations, the use of which immenselysimplifies the code comparison task.
