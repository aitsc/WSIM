0905.3741	planet-planet scattering in planetesimal disks	we study the final architecture of planetary systems that evolve under thecombined effects of planet-planet and planetesimal scattering. using n-bodysimulations we investigate the dynamics of marginally unstable systems of gasand ice giants both in isolation and when the planets form interior to aplanetesimal belt. the unstable isolated systems evolve under planet-planetscattering to yield an eccentricity distribution that matches that observed forextrasolar planets. when planetesimals are included the outcome depends uponthe total mass of the planets. for system masses exceeding about one jupitermass the final eccentricity distribution remains broad, whereas for lower massplanetary systems a combination of divergent orbital evolution andrecircularization of scattered planets results in a preponderance of nearlycircular final orbits. we also study the fate of marginally stable multipleplanet systems in the presence of planetesimal disks, and find that for highplanet masses the majority of such systems evolve into resonance. a significantfraction lead to resonant chains that are planetary analogs of jupiter'sgalilean satellites. we predict that a transition from eccentric tonear-circular orbits will be observed once extrasolar planet surveys detectsub-jovian mass planets at orbital radii of 5-10 au.

1001.3409	planet-planet scattering in planetesimal disks ii: predictions for outer  extrasolar planetary systems	we develop an idealized dynamical model to predict the typical properties ofouter extrasolar planetary systems, at radii beyond 5 au. our hypothesis isthat dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by acombination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with anexterior disk of small bodies ("planetesimals"). using 5,000 long durationn-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50earth mass primordial planetesimal disk. for large planet masses (above that ofsaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observedeccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smallerradii). we explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invokingstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. for lower massplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, suddenjumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization ofscattered low-mass planets in the disk. we present distributions of the finaleccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass andinitial system architecture. we predict a transition to lower eccentricitiesfor low mass planets at radii where disks influence the dynamics. radialvelocity measurements capable of detecting planets with k~5 m/s and periods inexcess of 10 years will constrain this regime. we also study the population ofresonant and non-resonant multiple planet systems. we show that, among systemswith jupiter-mass planets that avoid close encounters, the planetesimal diskacts as a damping mechanism that frequently populates mean motion resonances.resonant chains ought to be common among massive planets in outer planetarysystems.

1002.3611	connections between local and global turbulence in accretion disks	we analyze a suite of global magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) accretion disksimulations in order to determine whether scaling laws for turbulence driven bythe magnetorotational instability, discovered via local shearing box studies,are globally robust. the simulations model geometrically-thin disks with zeronet magnetic flux and no explicit resistivity or viscosity. we show that thelocal maxwell stress is correlated with the self-generated local verticalmagnetic field in a manner that is similar to that found in local simulations.moreover, local patches of vertical field are strong enough to stimulate andcontrol the strength of angular momentum transport across much of the disk. wedemonstrate the importance of magnetic linkages (through the low-densitycorona) between different regions of the disk in determining the local field,and suggest a new convergence requirement for global simulations -- thevertical extent of the corona must be fully captured and resolved. finally, weexamine the temporal convergence of the average stress, and show that aninitial long-term secular drift in the local flux-stress relation dies away ona time scale that is consistent with turbulent mixing of the initial magneticfield.

1007.1989	particle transport in evolving protoplanetary disks: implications for  results from stardust	samples returned from comet 81p/wild 2 by stardust confirm that substantialquantities of crystalline silicates were incorporated into the comet atformation. we investigate the constraints that this observation places uponprotoplanetary disk physics, assuming that outward transport of particlesprocessed at high temperatures occurs via advection and turbulent diffusion inan evolving disk. we also look for constraints on particle formation locations.our results are based upon 1d disk models that evolve with time under theaction of viscosity and photoevaporation, and track solid transport using anensemble of individual particle trajectories. we find that two classes of diskmodel are consistent with the stardust findings. one class features a highparticle diffusivity (a schmidt number sc &lt; 1), which suffices to diffuseparticles up to 20 microns in size outward against the mean gas flow. for sc &gt;1, such models are unlikely to be viable, and significant outward transportrequires that the particles of interest settle into a midplane layer thatexperiences an outward gas flow. in either class of models, the mass of innerdisk material that reaches the outer disk is a strong function of the disk'sinitial compactness. hence, models of grain transport within steady-state disksunderestimate the efficiency of outward transport. neither model results insustained outward transport of very large particles exceeding a mm in size. weshow that the transport efficiency generally falls off rapidly with time.hence, high-temperature material must be rapidly incorporated into icy bodiesto avoid fallback, and significant radial transport may only occur during theinitial phase of rapid disk evolution. it may also vary substantially betweendisks depending upon their initial mass distributions. we discuss implicationsfor spitzer observations of crystalline silicates in t tauri disks.

1104.0007	debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation	circumstantial evidence suggests that most known extra-solar planetarysystems are survivors of violent dynamical instabilities. here we explore howgiant planet instabilities affect the formation and survival of terrestrialplanets. we simulate planetary system evolution around sun-like stars frominitial conditions that comprise: an inner disk of planetesimals and planetaryembryos, three giant planets at jupiter-saturn distances, and a massive outerplanetesimal disk. we then calculate dust production rates and debris disk sedsassuming that each planetesimal particle represents an ensemble of smallerbodies in collisional equilibrium. we predict a strong correlation between thepresence of terrestrial planets and debris disks, mediated by the giantplanets. strong giant planet instabilities destroy all rocky material -including fully-formed terrestrial planets if the instabilities occur late -along with the icy planetesimals. stable or weakly unstable systems allowterrestrial planets to accrete and significant dust to be produced in theirouter regions. stars older than ~100 myr with bright cold dust emission (at ~70microns) signpost the dynamically calm environments conducive to efficientterrestrial accretion. we predict that while the typical eccentricities ofterrestrial planets are small, there should exist a novel class of terrestrialplanet system whose single planet undergoes large amplitude oscillations ineccentricity and inclination. by scaling to the observed semimajor axisdistribution of giant exoplanets, we estimate that terrestrial exoplanets inthe same systems should be a few times more abundant at 0.5 au than giant orterrestrial exoplanets at 1 au. finally, we discuss the solar system, whichappears to be unusual in combining a rich terrestrial planet system with a lowdust content.

1105.1789	turbulence in global simulations of magnetized thin accretion disks	we use a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thinaccretion disk to investigate the locality and detailed structure of turbulencedriven by the magnetorotational instability (mri). the model disk has an aspectratio $h / r \simeq 0.07$, and is computed using a higher-order godunov mhdscheme with accurate fluxes. we focus the analysis on late times after thesystem has lost direct memory of its initial magnetic flux state. the diskenters a saturated turbulent state in which the fastest growing modes of themri are well-resolved, with a relatively high efficiency of angular momentumtransport $&lt; &lt; \alpha &gt; &gt; \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-2}$. the accretion stresspeaks at the disk midplane, above and below which exists a moderatelymagnetized corona with patches of superthermal field. by analyzing the spatialand temporal correlations of the turbulent fields, we find that the spatialstructure of the magnetic and kinetic energy is moderately well-localized (withcorrelation lengths along the major axis of $2.5h$ and $1.5h$ respectively),and generally consistent with that expected from homogenous incompressibleturbulence. the density field, conversely, exhibits both a longer correlationlength and a long correlation time, results which we ascribe to the importanceof spiral density waves within the flow. consistent with prior results, we showthat the mean local stress displays a well-defined correlation with the localvertical flux, and that this relation is apparently causal (in the sense of theflux stimulating the stress) during portions of a global dynamo cycle. we arguethat the observed flux-stress relation supports dynamo models in which thestructure of coronal magnetic fields plays a central role in determining thedynamics of thin-disk accretion.

1107.3561	turbulent linewidths in protoplanetary disks: predictions from numerical  simulations	sub-mm observations of protoplanetary disks now approach the acuity needed tomeasure the turbulent broadening of molecular lines. these measurementsconstrain disk angular momentum transport, and furnish evidence of theturbulent environment within which planetesimal formation takes place. we uselocal magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations of the magnetorotationalinstability (mri) to predict the distribution of turbulent velocities in lowmass protoplanetary disks, as a function of radius and height above themid-plane. we model both ideal mhd disks, and disks in which ohmic dissipationresults in a dead zone of suppressed turbulence near the mid-plane. under idealconditions, the disk mid-plane is characterized by a velocity distribution thatpeaks near v \simeq 0.1cs (where cs is the local sound speed), while supersonicvelocities are reached at z &gt; 3h (where h is the pressure scale height).residual velocities of v \approx 0.01cs persist near the mid-plane in deadzones, while the surface layers remain active. anisotropic variation of thelinewidth with disk inclination is modest. we compare our mhd results tohydrodynamic simulations in which large-scale forcing is used to initiatesimilar turbulent velocities. we show that the qualitative trend of increasingv with height, seen in the mhd case, persists for forced turbulence and islikely a generic property of disk turbulence. percent level determinations of vat different heights within the disk, or spatially resolved observations thatprobe the inner disk containing the dead zone region, are therefore needed totest whether the mri is responsible for protoplanetary disk turbulence.

1108.5174	the butterfly effect in the extreme-mass ratio inspiral problem	measurements of gravitational waves from the inspiral of a stellar-masscompact object into a massive black hole are unique probes to test generalrelativity (gr) and mbh properties, as well as the stellar distribution aboutthese holes in galactic nuclei. current data analysis techniques can provide uswith parameter estimation with very narrow errors. however, an emri is not atwo-body problem, since other stellar bodies orbiting nearby will influence thecapture orbit. any deviation from the isolated inspiral will induce a small,though observable deviation from the idealised waveform which could bemisinterpreted as a failure of gr. based on conservative analysis of masssegregation in a milky way like nucleus, we estimate that the possibility thatanother star has a semi-major axis comparable to that of the emri isnon-negligible, although probably very small. this star introduces anobservable perturbation in the orbit in the case in which we consider only lossof energy via gravitational radiation. when considering the two first-ordernon-dissipative post-newtonian contributions (the periapsis shift of theorbit), the evolution of the orbital elements of the emri turns out to bechaotic in nature. the implications of this study are twofold. from the oneside, the application to testing gr and measuring mbhs parameters with thedetection of emris in galactic nuclei with a millihertz mission will be evenmore challenging than believed. from the other side, this behaviour could inprinciple be used as a signature of mass segregation in galactic nuclei.

1108.5382	hydrodynamic outcomes of planet scattering in transitional discs	a significant fraction of unstable multiple planet systems likely scatterduring the transitional disc phase as gas damping becomes ineffectual. using anensemble of fargo hydrodynamic simulations and mercury n-body integrations, wedirectly follow planet-disc and planet-planet interactions through the clearingphase and on through 50 myr of dynamical evolution. disc clearing occurs viax-ray driven photoevaporation. the hydrodynamic evolution of individualscattering systems is complex, and involves phases in which massive planetsorbit within eccentric gaps, or accrete directly from the disc without a gap.comparing the results to a gas-free model, we find that the n-body dynamics andhydrodynamics of scattering into one- and two-planet final states are almostidentical. the eccentricity distributions in these channels are almostunaltered by the presence of gas. the hydrodynamic simulations, however, alsoform low eccentricity three-planet systems in long-term stable configurations,and the admixture of these systems results in modestly lower eccentricities inhydrodynamic as opposed to gas-free simulations. the incidence of thesethree-planet systems is likely a function of the initial conditions; differentplanet setups (number or spacing) may change the character of this result. weanalyze the properties of surviving multiple planet systems, and show that onlya small fraction (a few percent) enter mean-motion resonances after scattering,while a larger fraction form stable resonant chains and avoid scatteringentirely. our results remain consistent with the hypothesis that exoplaneteccentricity results from scattering, though the detailed agreement betweenobservations and gas-free simulation results is likely coincidental. we discussthe prospects for testing scattering models by observing planets ornon-axisymmetric gas structure in transitional discs.

1201.3622	debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation. ii dependence  of exoplanet architectures on giant planet and disk properties	we present models for the formation of terrestrial planets, and thecollisional evolution of debris disks, in planetary systems that containmultiple unstable gas giants. we previously showed that the dynamics of thegiant planets introduces a correlation between the presence of terrestrialplanets and debris disks. here we present new simulations that show that thisconnection is qualitatively robust to changes in: the mass distribution of thegiant planets, the width and mass distribution of the outer planetesimal disk,and the presence of gas in the disk. we discuss how variations in theseparameters affect the evolution. systems with equal-mass giant planets undergothe most violent instabilities, and these destroy both terrestrial planets andthe outer planetesimal disks that produce debris disks. in contrast, systemswith low-mass giant planets efficiently produce both terrestrial planets anddebris disks. a large fraction of systems with low-mass outermost giant planetshave stable gaps between these planets that are frequently populated byplanetesimals. planetesimal belts between outer giant planets may affect debrisdisk seds. if earth-mass seeds are present in outer planetesimal disks, thedisks radially spread to colder temperatures. we argue that this may explainthe very low frequency of &gt; 1 gyr-old solar-type stars with observed 24 micronexcesses. among the (limited) set of configurations explored, the bestcandidates for hosting terrestrial planets at ~1 au are stars older than 0.1-1gyr with bright debris disks at 70 micron but with no currently-known giantplanets. these systems combine evidence for rocky building blocks, with giantplanet properties least likely to undergo destructive dynamical evolution. wepredict an anti-correlation between debris disks and eccentric giant planets,and a positive correlation between debris disks and terrestrial planets.

1203.0314	emergent mesoscale phenomena in magnetized accretion disc turbulence	we study how the structure and variability of magnetohydrodynamic (mhd)turbulence in accretion discs converge with domain size. our results are basedon a series of vertically stratified local simulations, computed using theathena code, that have fixed spatial resolution, but varying radial andazimuthal extent (from \delta r = 0.5h to 16h, where h is the vertical scaleheight). we show that elementary local diagnostics of the turbulence, includingthe shakura-sunyaev {\alpha} parameter, the ratio of maxwell stress to magneticenergy, and the ratio of magnetic to fluid stresses, converge to within theprecision of our measurements for spatial domains of radial size lx \geq 2h. weobtain {\alpha} = 0.02-0.03, consistent with recent results. very small domains(lx = 0.5h) return anomalous results, independent of spatial resolution. theconvergence with domain size is only valid for a limited set of diagnostics:larger spatial domains admit the emergence of dynamically important mesoscalestructures. in our largest simulations, the maxwell stress shows a significantlarge scale non-local component, while the density develops long-livedaxisymmetric perturbations (zonal flows) at the 20% level. most strikingly, thevariability of the disc in fixed-sized patches decreases strongly as thesimulation volume increases. we find generally good agreement between ourlargest local simulations and global simulations with comparable spatialresolution. there is no direct evidence that the presence of curvature terms orradial gradients in global calculations materially affect the turbulence,except to perhaps introduce an outer radial scale for mesoscale structures. thedemonstrated importance of mean magnetic fields, seen in both large local andglobal simulations implies that the growth and saturation of these fields islikely of critical importance for the evolution of accretion discs.

1203.2940	global variation of the dust-to-gas ratio in evolving protoplanetary  discs	recent theories suggest planetesimal formation via streaming and/orgravitational instabilities may be triggered by localized enhancements in thedust-to-gas ratio, and one hypothesis is that sufficient enhancements may beproduced in the pile-up of small solid particles inspiralling under aerodynamicdrag from the large mass reservoir in the outer disc. studies of particlepile-up in static gas discs have provided partial support for this hypothesis.here, we study the radial and temporal evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio inturbulent discs, that evolve under the action of viscosity andphotoevaporation. we find that particle pile-ups do not generically occurwithin evolving discs, particularly if the introduction of large grains isrestricted to the inner, dense regions of a disc. instead, radial drift resultsin depletion of solids from the outer disc, while the inner disc maintains adust-to-gas ratio that is within a factor of ~2 of the initial value. weattribute this result to the short time-scales for turbulent diffusion andradial advection (with the mean gas flow) in the inner disc. we show that thequalitative evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio depends only weakly upon theparameters of the disc model (the disc mass, size, viscosity, and value of theschmidt number), and discuss the implications for planetesimal formation viacollective instabilities. our results suggest that in discs where there is asignificant level of midplane turbulence and accretion, planetesimal formationwould need to be possible in the absence of large-scale enhancements. instead,trapping and concentration of particles within local turbulent structures maybe required as a first stage of planetesimal formation.

1208.4224	turbulent linewidths as a diagnostic of self-gravity in protostellar  discs	we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of massive protostellardiscs to investigate the predicted broadening of molecular lines from discs inwhich self-gravity is the dominant source of angular momentum transport. thesimulations include radiative transfer, and span a range of disc-to-star massratios between 0.25 and 1.5. subtracting off the mean azimuthal flow velocity,we compute the distribution of the in-plane and perpendicular peculiar velocitydue to large scale structure and turbulence induced by self-gravity. for thelower mass discs, we show that the characteristic peculiar velocities scalewith the square root of the effective turbulent viscosity parameter, asexpected from local turbulent-disc theory. the derived velocities areanisotropic, with substantially larger in-plane than perpendicular values. asthe disc mass is increased, the validity of the locally determined turbulenceapproximation breaks down, and this is accompanied by anomalously largein-plane broadening. there is also a high variance due to the importance oflow-m spiral modes. for low-mass discs, the magnitude of in-plane broadeningis, to leading order, equal to the predictions from local disc theory andcannot constrain the source of turbulence. however, combining our results withprior evaluations of turbulent broadening expected in discs where themagnetorotational instability (mri) is active, we argue that self-gravity maybe distinguishable from the mri in these systems if it is possible to measurethe anisotropy of the peculiar velocity field with disc inclination.furthermore, for large mass discs, the dominant contribution of large-scalemodes is a distinguishing characteristic of self-gravitating turbulence versusmri driven turbulence.

0711.4078	quasistars: accreting black holes inside massive envelopes	we study the structure and evolution of "quasistars", accreting black holesembedded within massive hydrostatic gaseous envelopes. these configurations maymodel the early growth of supermassive black hole seeds. the accretion rateonto the black hole adjusts so that the luminosity carried by the convectiveenvelope equals the eddington limit for the total mass. this greatly exceedsthe eddington limit for the black hole mass alone, leading to rapid growth ofthe black hole. we use analytic models and numerical stellar structurecalculations to study the structure and evolution of quasistars. we deriveanalytically the scaling of the photospheric temperature with the black holemass and envelope mass, and show that it decreases with time as the black holemass increases. once the photospheric temperature becomes lower than 10,000 k,the photospheric opacity drops precipitously and the photospheric temperaturehits a limiting value, analogous to the hayashi track for red giants andprotostars, below which no hydrostatic solution for the convective envelopeexists. for metal-free (population iii) opacities this limiting temperature isapproximately 4000 k. after a quasistar reaches this limiting temperature, theenvelope is rapidly dispersed by radiation pressure. we find that black holeseeds with masses between 1000 and 10000 solar masses could form via thismechanism in less than a few myr.

1210.4164	turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. i. weak  accretion with no vertical magnetic flux	we use local numerical simulations to investigate the strength and nature ofmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetarydisks, where ambipolar diffusion is the dominant non-ideal mhd effect. thesimulations include vertical stratification and assume zero net verticalmagnetic flux. we employ a super time-stepping technique to ameliorate thecourant restriction on the diffusive time step. we find that in idealizedstratified simulations, with a spatially constant ambipolar elsasser number am,turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (mri) behaves in asimilar manner as in prior unstratified calculations. turbulence dies away foram &lt; 1, and becomes progressively more vigorous as ambipolar diffusion isdecreased. near-ideal mhd behavior is recovered for am &gt; 1000. in theintermediate regime (10 &lt; am &lt; 1000) ambipolar diffusion leads to substantialincreases in both the period of the mri dynamo cycle and the characteristicscales of magnetic field structures. to quantify the impact of ambipolarphysics on disk accretion, we run simulations at 30 au and 100 au that includea vertical am profile based upon far ultraviolet (fuv) ionized disk models.these models develop a vertically layered structure analogous to the ohmic deadzone that is present at smaller radii. we find that, although the levels ofsurface turbulence can be strong (and consistent with constraints on turbulentline widths at these radii), the inferred accretion rates are at least an orderof magnitude smaller than those observed in t tauri stars. this discrepancy isvery likely due to the assumption of zero vertical magnetic field in oursimulations and suggests that vertical magnetic fields are essential formri-driven accretion in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks.

1211.2809	mini-oort clouds: compact isotropic planetesimal clouds from  planet-planet scattering	starting from planetary systems with three giant planets and an outer disk ofplanetesimals, we use dynamical simulations to show how dynamical instabilitiescan transform planetesimal disks into 100-1000 au-scale isotropic clouds. theinstabilities involve a phase of planet-planet scattering that concludes withthe ejection of one or more planets and the inward-scattering of the survivinggas giant(s) to remove them from direct dynamical contact with theplanetesimals. "mini-oort clouds" are thus formed from scattered planetesimalswhose orbits are frozen by the abrupt disappearance of the perturbing giantplanet. although the planetesimal orbits are virtually isotropic, the survivinggiant planets tend to have modest inclinations (typically ~10 degrees) withrespect to the initial orbital plane. the collisional lifetimes of mini-oortclouds are long (10 myr to &gt;10 gyr) and there is a window of ~100 myr or longerduring which they produce spherical clouds of potentially observable dust at 70microns. if the formation channel for hot jupiters commonly involves planetaryclose encounters, we predict a correlation between this subset of extrasolarplanetary systems and mini-oort clouds.

1301.3015	the interplay between x-ray photoevaporation and planet formation	we assess the potential of planet formation instigating the early formationof a photoevaporation driven gap, up to radii larger than typical forphotoevaporation alone. for our investigation we make use of hydrodynamicsmodels of photoevaporating discs with a giant planet embedded. we find that, byreducing the mass accretion flow onto the star, discs that form giant planetswill be dispersed at earlier times than discs without planets by x-rayphotoevaporation. by clearing the portion of the disc inner of the planetorbital radius, planet formation induced photoevaporation (pipe) is able toproduce transition disc that for a given mass accretion rate have larger holeswhen compared to standard x-ray photoevaporation. this constitutes a possibleroute for the formation of the observed class of accreting transition discswith large holes, which are otherwise difficult to explain by planet formationor photoevaporation alone. moreover, assuming that a planet is able to filterdust completely, pipe produces a transition disc with a large hole and mayprovide a mechanism to quickly shut down accretion. this process appears to betoo slow however to explain the observed desert in the population of transitiondisc with large holes and low mass accretion rates.

1306.3222	turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. ii. strong  accretion driven by a vertical magnetic field	we carry out a series of local, vertically stratified shearing boxsimulations of protoplanetary disks that include ambipolar diffusion and a netvertical magnetic field. the ambipolar diffusion profiles we employ correspondto 30au and 100au in a minimum mass solar nebula (mmsn) disk model, whichconsists of a far-uv-ionized surface layer and low-ionization disk interior.these simulations serve as a follow up to simon et al. (2013), in which wefound that without a net vertical field, the turbulent stresses that resultfrom the magnetorotational instability (mri) are too weak to account forobserved accretion rates. the simulations in this work show a very strongdependence of the accretion stresses on the strength of the background verticalfield; as the field strength increases, the stress amplitude increases. for gasto magnetic pressure ratios of 1e4 and 1e5, we find accretion rates between1e-8 and 1e-7 solar masses per year. these accretion rates agree withobservational constraints, suggesting a vertical magnetic field strengthbetween 60 and 200 microgauss at 30au and 10 and 30 microgauss at 100au in ammsn disk. furthermore, the stress has a non-negligible component due to amagnetic wind. for sufficiently strong vertical field strengths, mri turbulenceis quenched, and the flow becomes largely laminar, with accretion proceedingthrough large scale correlations in the radial and toroidal field components aswell as through the magnetic wind. in all simulations, the presence of a lowionization region near the disk mid-plane, which we call the ambipolar dampingzone, results in reduced stresses there.

1306.5241	formation of circumbinary planets in a dead zone	circumbinary planets have been observed at orbital radii where binaryperturbations may have significant effects on the gas disk structure, onplanetesimal velocity dispersion, and on the coupling between turbulence andplanetesimals. here, we note that the impact of all of these effects on planetformation is qualitatively altered if the circumbinary disk structure islayered, with a non-turbulent midplane layer (dead zone) and strongly turbulentsurface layers. for close binaries, we find that the dead zone typicallyextends from a radius close to the inner disk edge up to a radius of around10-20 au from the centre of mass of the binary. the peak in the surface densityoccurs within the dead zone, far from the inner disk edge, close to the snowline, and may act as a trap for aerodynamically coupled solids. we suggest thatcircumbinary planet formation may be easier near this preferential locationthan for disks around single stars. however, dead zones around wide binariesare less likely and hence planet formation may be more difficult there.

1310.6745	two timescale dispersal of magnetized protoplanetary disks	protoplanetary disks are likely to be threaded by a weak net flux of verticalmagnetic field that is a remnant of the much larger fluxes present in molecularcloud cores. if this flux is approximately conserved its dynamical importancewill increase as mass is accreted, initially by stimulating magnetorotationaldisk turbulence and subsequently by enabling wind angular momentum loss. we usefits to numerical simulations of ambipolar dominated disk turbulence toconstruct simplified one dimensional evolution models for weakly magnetizedprotoplanetary disks. we show that the late onset of significant angularmomentum loss in a wind can give rise to "two timescale" disk evolution inwhich a long phase of viscous evolution precedes rapid dispersal as the windbecomes dominant. the wide dispersion in disk lifetimes could therefore be dueto varying initial levels of net flux. magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) wind triggereddispersal differs from photoevaporative dispersal in predicting mass loss fromsmall (less that 1 au) scales, where thermal winds are suppressed. our specificmodels are based on a limited set of simulations that remain uncertain, butqualitatively similar evolution appears likely if mass is lost from disks morequickly than flux, and if mhd winds become important as the plasma betadecreases.

0802.1524	eccentricity of masing disks in active galactic nuclei	observations of keplerian disks of masers in ncg 4258 and other seyfertgalaxies can be used to obtain geometric distance estimates and derive thehubble constant. the ultimate precision of such measurements could be limitedby uncertainties in the disk geometry. using a time-dependent linear theorymodel, we study the evolution of a thin initially eccentric disk underconditions appropriate to sub-pc scales in active galactic nuclei. theevolution is controlled by a combination of differential precession driven bythe disk potential and propagating eccentricity waves that are damped byviscosity. a simple estimate yields a circularization timescale ofapproximately 10 myr at 0.1 pc. numerical solutions for the eccentricityevolution confirm that damping commences on this timescale, but show that thesubsequent decay rate of the eccentricity depends upon the uncertain strengthof viscous damping of eccentricity. if eccentricity waves are important furtherdecay of the eccentricity can be slow, with full circularization requiring upto 50 myr for disks at radii of 0.1 pc to 0.2 pc. observationally, this impliesthat it is plausible that enough time has elapsed for the eccentricity ofmasing disks to have been substantially damped, but that it may not bejustified to assume vanishing eccentricity. we predict that during the dampingphase the pericenter of the eccentric orbits describes a moderately tightlywound spiral with radius.

1401.5475	a mechanism for hysteresis in black hole binary state transitions	we suggest that the hysteretic cycle of black hole state transitions arisesfrom two established properties of accretion disks: the increase in turbulentstress in disks threaded by a net magnetic field and the ability of thick (butnot thin) disks to advect such a field radially. during quiescence, magneticfield loops are generated by the magnetorotational instability at the interfacebetween the inner hot flow and outer thin disk. vertical flux is advected intoand accumulates stochastically within the inner flow, where it stimulates theturbulence so that $\alpha \sim 1$. the transition to a geometrically thininner disk occurs when $l \sim \alpha^2 l_{\rm edd} \sim l_{\rm edd}$, and thefirst "thin" disk to form is itself moderately thick, strongly magnetized, andable to advect field inward. these properties favor episodic jet production. asthe accretion rate declines magnetic flux escapes, $\alpha$ decreases to$\alpha \sim 0.01 - 0.1$, and a hot inner flow is not re-established until $l\ll l_{\rm edd}$. we discuss possible observational consequences of ourscenario.

1402.1489	efficiency of particle trapping in the outer regions of protoplanetary  disks	we investigate the strength of axisymmetric local pressure maxima (zonalflows) in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks, where ambipolar diffusionreduces turbulent stresses driven by the magnetorotational instability. usinglocal numerical simulations we show that in the absence of net verticalmagnetic fields, the strength of turbulence in the ambipolar dominated regionof the disk is low and any zonal flows that are present are weak. for netfields strong enough to yield observed protostellar accretion rates, however,zonal flows with a density amplitude of 10-20% are formed. these strengths arecomparable to those seen in simulations of ideal mhd disk turbulence. weinvestigate whether these zonal flows are able to reverse the inward radialdrift of solids, leading to prolonged and enhanced concentration as a preludeto planetesimal formation. for commonly assumed mean surface density profiles(surface density proportional to radius to the -1/2 power or steeper) we findthat the predicted perturbations to the background disk profile do notcorrespond to local pressure maxima. this is a consequence of radial width ofthe simulated zonal flows, which is larger than was assumed in prior analyticmodels of particle trapping. these larger scale flows would only trap particlesfor higher amplitude fluctuations than observed. we conclude that zonal flowsare likely to be present in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks and arepotentially large enough to be observable, but are unlikely to lead to strongparticle trapping.

1407.5676	giant outbursts in be/x-ray binaries	be/x-ray binary systems exhibit both periodic (type i) x-ray outbursts andgiant (type ii) outbursts, whose origin has remained elusive. we suggest thattype ii x-ray outbursts occur when a highly misaligned decretion disk aroundthe be star becomes eccentric, allowing the compact object companion to capturea large amount of material at periastron. using 3d smoothed particlehydrodynamics simulations we model the long term evolution of a representativebe/x-ray binary system. we find that periodic (type i) x-ray outbursts occurwhen the neutron star is close to periastron for all disk inclinations. type iioutbursts occur for large misalignment angles and are associated witheccentricity growth that occurs on a timescale of about 10 orbital periods.mass capture from the eccentric decretion disk results in an accretion diskaround the neutron star whose estimated viscous time is long enough to explainthe extended duration of type ii outbursts. previous studies suggested that theoutbursts are caused by a warped disk but our results suggest that this is notsufficient, the disk must be both highly misaligned and eccentric to initiate atype ii accretion event.

1409.4245	importance of thermal diffusion in the gravo-magnetic limit cycle	we consider the role of thermal diffusion due to turbulence and radiation onaccretion bursts that occur in protoplanetary discs which contain dead zones.using 1d viscous disc models we show that diffusive radial transport of heat isimportant during the gravo-magnetic limit cycle, and can strongly modify theduration and frequency of accretion outbursts. when the prandtl number is large- such that turbulent diffusion of heat is unimportant - radial radiativediffusion reduces the burst duration compared to models with no diffusivetransport of heat. when the prandtl number is small ($\lesssim 25$) we findthat turbulent diffusion dominates the radial transport of heat, reducing theburst duration to $\lesssim 10^3$ years as well as increasing the burstfrequency. furthermore, inclusion of radial transport of heat extends the rangeof infall rates under which the disc undergoes accretion bursts from $10^{-8}$to $10^{-6}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with no diffusion, to $10^{-8}$ to$\gtrsim10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with radiative and strong turbulentdiffusion. the relative roles of radiative and turbulent thermal diffusion arelikely to vary during an accretion burst, but simple estimates suggest that theexpected prandtl numbers are of the order of 10 in protoplanetary discs, andhence that turbulent diffusion is likely to be an important process duringaccretion outbursts due to the gravo-magnetic limit cycle.

1501.02808	signatures of mri-driven turbulence in protoplanetary disks: predictions  for alma observations	spatially resolved observations of molecular line emission have the potentialto yield unique constraints on the nature of turbulence within protoplanetarydisks. using a combination of local non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulationsand radiative transfer calculations, tailored to properties of the disk aroundhd 163296, we assess the ability of alma to detect turbulence driven by themagnetorotational instability (mri). our local simulations show that the mriproduces small-scale turbulent velocity fluctuations that increase in strengthwith height above the mid-plane. for a set of simulations at different diskradii, we fit a maxell-boltzmann distribution to the turbulent velocity andconstruct a turbulent broadening parameter as a function of radius and height.we input this broadening into radiative transfer calculations to quantifyobservational signatures of mri-driven disk turbulence. we find that the ratioof the peak line flux to the flux at line center is a robust diagnostic ofturbulence that is only mildly degenerate with systematic uncertainties in disktemperature. for the co(3-2) line, which we expect to probe the mostmagnetically active slice of the disk column, variations in the predictedpeak-to-trough ratio between our most and least turbulent models span a rangeof approximately 15%. additional independent constraints can be derived fromthe morphology of spatially resolved line profiles, and we estimate theresolution required to detect turbulence on different spatial scales. wediscuss the role of lower optical depth molecular tracers, which trace regionscloser to the disk mid-plane where velocities in mri-driven models aresystematically lower.

0804.3596	stellar dynamical evidence against a cold disc origin for stars in the  galactic centre	observations of massive stars within the central parsec of the galaxy showthat, while most stars orbit within a well-defined disc, a significant fractionhave large eccentricities and / or inclinations with respect to the disc plane.here, we investigate whether this dynamically hot component could have arisenvia scattering from an initially cold disc -- the expected initial condition ifthe stars formed from the fragmentation of an accretion disc. using n-bodymethods, we evolve a variety of flat, cold, stellar systems, and study theeffects of initial disc eccentricity, primordial binaries, very massive starsand intermediate mass black holes. we find, consistent with previous results,that a circular disc does not become eccentric enough unless there is asignificant population of undetected 100--1000 msun objects. however, sincefragmentation of an eccentric disc can readily yield eccentric stellar orbits,the strongest constraints come from inclinations. we show that_none_ of ourinitial conditions yield the observed large inclinations, regardless of theinitial disc eccentricity or the presence of massive objects. these resultsimply that the orbits of the young massive stars in the galactic centre arelargely primordial, and that the stars are unlikely to have formed as adynamically cold disc.

1507.03996	accretion disk dynamo as the trigger for x-ray binary state transitions	magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations suggest that much of theenergy liberated by the magnetorotational instability (mri) can be channeledinto large-scale toroidal magnetic fields through dynamo action. under certainconditions, this field can dominate over gas and radiation pressure inproviding vertical support against gravity, even close to the midplane. using asimple model for the creation of this field, its buoyant rise, and its couplingto the gas, we show how disks could be driven into this magnetically dominatedstate and deduce the resulting vertical pressure and density profiles. applyingan established criterion for mri to operate in the presence of a toroidalfield, we show that magnetically supported disks can have two distinctmri-active regions, separated by a "dead zone" where local mri is suppressed,but where magnetic energy continues to flow upward from the dynamo regionbelow. we suggest that the relative strengths of the mri zones, and the localpoloidal flux, determine the spectral states of x-ray binaries. specifically,"intermediate" and "hard" accretion states occur when mri is triggered in thehot, upper zone of the corona, while disks in "soft" states do not develop theupper mri zone. we discuss the conditions under which various transitionsshould take place and speculate on the relationship of dynamo activity to thevarious types of quasi-periodic oscillations that sometimes appear in the hardspectral components. the model also explains why luminous accretion disks inthe "soft" state show no signs of the thermal/viscous instability predicted bystandard alpha models.

1508.00904	magnetically driven accretion in protoplanetary discs	we characterize magnetically driven accretion at radii between 1 au and 100au in protoplanetary discs, using a series of local non-idealmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations. the simulations assume a minimum masssolar nebula (mmsn) disc that is threaded by a net vertical magnetic field ofspecified strength. confirming previous results, we find that the hall effecthas only a modest impact on accretion at 30 au, and essentially none at 100 au.at 1-10 au the hall effect introduces a pronounced bi-modality in the accretionprocess, with vertical magnetic fields aligned to the disc rotation supportinga strong laminar maxwell stress that is absent if the field is anti-aligned. inthe anti-aligned case, we instead find evidence for bursts of turbulent stressat 5-10 au, which we tentatively identify with the non-axisymmetric hall-shearinstability. the presence or absence of these bursts depends upon the detailsof the adopted chemical model, which suggests that appreciable regions ofactual protoplanetary discs might lie close to the borderline between laminarand turbulent behaviour. given the number of important control parameters thathave already been identified in mhd models, quantitative predictions for discstructure in terms of only radius and accretion rate appear to be difficult.instead, we identify robust qualitative tests of magnetically driven accretion.these include the presence of turbulence in the outer disc, independent of theorientation of the vertical magnetic fields, and a hall-mediated bi-modality inturbulent properties extending from the region of thermal ionization to 10 au.

0806.2660	interaction of the magnetorotational instability with hydrodynamic  turbulence in accretion disks	accretion disks in which angular momentum transport is dominated by themagnetorotational instability (mri) can also possess additional, purelyhydrodynamic, drivers of turbulence. even when the hydrodynamic processes, ontheir own, generate negligible levels of transport, they may still affect theevolution of the disk via their influence on the mri. here, we study theinteraction between the mri and hydrodynamic turbulence using local mrisimulations that include hydrodynamic forcing. as expected, we find thathydrodynamic forcing is generally negligible if it yields a saturated kineticenergy density that is small compared to the value generated by the mri. forstronger hydrodynamic forcing levels, we find that hydrodynamic turbulencemodifies transport, with the effect varying depending upon the spatial scale ofhydrodynamic driving. large scale forcing boosts transport by an amount that isapproximately linear in the forcing strength, and leaves the character of themri (for example the ratio between maxwell and reynolds stresses) unchanged, upto the point at which the forced turbulence is an order of magnitude strongerthan that generated by the mri. low amplitude small scale forcing may modestlysuppress the mri. we conclude that the impact of hydrodynamic turbulence on themri is generically ignorable in cases, such as convection, where the additionalturbulence arises due to the accretion energy liberated by the mri itself.hydrodynamic turbulence may affect (and either enhance or suppress) the mri ifit is both strong, and driven by independent mechanisms such as self-gravity,supernovae, or solid-gas interactions in multiphase protoplanetary disks.

0807.3547	microphysical dissipation, turbulence and magnetic fields in  hyper-accreting discs	hyper-accreting discs occur in compact-object mergers and collapsars, and maypower gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we calculate the microscopic viscosity andresistivity of plasma in these discs, and discuss the implications for theirglobal structure and evolution. in the neutrino-cooled innermost regions, theviscosity is provided mainly by mildly degenerate electrons, while theresistivity is modified from the spitzer value due to the effects of bothrelativity and degeneracy. the plasma behaves as an almost ideal mhd fluid.among the non-ideal mhd effects the hall term is relatively the most important,while the magnetic prandtl number, pr (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity),is typically larger than unity: 10 &lt; pr &lt; 6000. the outer radiativelyinefficient regions also display high pr. numerical simulations of themagneto-rotational instability indicate that the saturation level and angularmomentum transport efficiency may be greatly enhanced at high pr. if thisbehaviour persists in the presence of a strong hall effect we would expect thathyper-accreting discs should be strongly magnetised and highly variable. theexpulsion of magnetic field that cannot be dissipated at small scales may alsofavour a magnetic outflow. we note the similaries between the prandtl number inhyper-accreting discs and x-ray binary discs, which suggests that a comparisonbetween late-time activity in grbs and x-ray binary accretion states may befruitful. our results imply that the behavior of high prandtl number mhd flowsneeds to be considered in studies of hyper-accreting discs.

0807.4186	extrasolar planet eccentricities from scattering in the presence of  residual gas disks	gravitational scattering between massive planets has been invoked to explainthe eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets. for scattering to occur,the planets must either form in -- or migrate into -- an unstableconfiguration. in either case, it is likely that a residual gas disk, with amass comparable to that of the planets, will be present when scattering occurs.using explicit hydrodynamic simulations, we study the impact of gas disks onthe outcome of two-planet scattering. we assume a specific model in which theplanets are driven toward instability by gravitational torques from an outerlow mass disk. we find that the accretion of mass and angular momentum thatoccurs when a scattered planet impacts the disk can strongly influence thesubsequent dynamics by reducing the number of close encounters. theeccentricity of the innermost surviving planet at the epoch when the systembecomes hill stable is not substantially altered from the gas-free case, butthe outer planet is circularized by its interaction with the disk. thesignature of scattering initiated by gas disk migration is thus a high fractionof low eccentricity planets at larger radii accompanying known eccentricplanets. subsequent secular evolution of the two planets in the presence ofdamping can further damp both eccentricities, and tends to push systems awayfrom apsidal alignment and toward anti-alignment. we note that the late burstof accretion when the outer planet impacts the disk is in principle observable,probably via detection of a strong near-ir excess in systems with otherwiseweak disk and stellar accretion signatures.

astro-ph;0101253	episodic accretion in magnetically layered protoplanetary discs	we study protoplanetary disc evolution assuming that angular momentumtransport is driven by gravitational instability at large radii, andmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence in the hot inner regions. at radii of theorder of 1 au such discs develop a magnetically layered structure, withaccretion occurring in an ionized surface layer overlying quiescent gas that istoo cool to sustain mhd turbulence. we show that layered discs are subject to alimit cycle instability, in which accretion onto the protostar occurs in burstswith an accretion rate of 10^{-5} solar masses / yr, separated by quiescentintervals where the accretion rate is 10^{-8} solar masses / yr. such burstscould lead to repeated episodes of strong mass outflow in young stellarobjects. the transition to this episodic mode of accretion occurs at an earlyepoch (t &lt; 1 myr), and the model therefore predicts that many youngpre-main-sequence stars should have low rates of accretion through the innerdisc. at ages of a few myr, the discs are up to an order of magnitude moremassive than the minimum mass solar nebula, with most of the mass locked up inthe quiescent layer of the disc at around 1 au. the predicted rate of low massplanetary migration is reduced at the outer edge of the layered disc, whichcould lead to an enhanced probability of giant planet formation at radii of 1-3au.

astro-ph;0110028	a variable efficiency for thin disk black hole accretion	we explore the presence of torques at the inner edges of geometrically-thinblack hole accretion disks using 3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (mhd)simulations in a pseudo-newtonian potential. by varying the saturation level ofthe magnetorotational instability that leads to angular momentum transport, weshow that the dynamics of gas inside the radius of marginal stability variesdepending upon the magnetic field strength just outside that radius. weakfields are unable to causally connect material within the plunging region tothe rest of the disk, and zero torque is an approximately correct boundarycondition at the radius of marginal stability. stronger fields, which we obtainartificially but which may occur physically within more complete disk models,are able to couple at least some parts of the plunging region to the rest ofthe disk. in this case, angular momentum (and implicitly energy) is extractedfrom the material in the plunging region. furthermore, the magnetic coupling tothe plunging region can be highly time dependent with large fluctuations in thetorque at the radius of marginal stability. this implies varying accretionefficiencies, both across systems and within a given system at different times.the results suggest a possible link between changes in x-ray and outflowactivity, with both being driven by transitions between weak and strong fieldstates.

astro-ph;0201318	accretion during the merger of supermassive black holes	we study the evolution of disk accretion during the merger of supermassiveblack hole binaries in galactic nuclei. in hierarchical galaxy formationmodels, the most common binaries are likely to arise from minor galacticmergers, and have unequal mass black holes. once such a binary becomes embeddedin an accretion disk at a separation of the order of 0.1 pc, the mergerproceeds in two distinct phases. during the first phase, the loss of orbitalangular momentum to the gaseous disk shrinks the binary on a timescale of ~10myr. the accretion rate onto the primary black hole is not increased, and canbe substantially reduced, during this disk-driven migration. at smallerseparations, gravitational radiation becomes the dominant angular momentum lossprocess, and any gas trapped inside the orbit of the secondary is driveninwards by the inspiralling black hole. the implied accretion rate just priorto coalescence exceeds the eddington limit, so the final merger is likely tooccur within a common envelope formed from the disrupted inner disk, and beaccompanied by high velocity (~10,000 km/s) outflows.

astro-ph;0302271	the variability of accretion onto schwarzschild black holes from  turbulent magnetized discs	we use global magnetohydrodynamic simulations, in a pseudo-newtonianpotential, to investigate the temporal variability of accretion discs aroundschwarzschild black holes. we use the vertically-averaged magnetic stress inthe simulated disc as a proxy for the rest-frame dissipation, and compute theobserved emission by folding this through the transfer function describing therelativistic beaming, light bending and time delays near a non-rotating blackhole. the temporal power spectrum of the predicted emission from individualannuli in the disc is described by a broken power law, with indices of -3.5 athigh frequency and 0 to -1 at low frequency. integrated over the disc, thepower spectrum is approximated by a single power law with an index of -2.increasing inclination boosts the relative power at frequencies of around 0.3times the orbital frequency at the marginally stable orbit, but no evidence isfound for sharp quasi-periodic oscillations in the lightcurve. assuming thatfluorescent iron line emission locally tracks the continuum flux, we computesimulated broad iron line profiles. we find that relativistic beaming of thenon-axisymmetric emission profile, induced by turbulence, produceshigh-amplitude variability in the iron line profile. we show that thissubstructure within the broad iron line profile can survive averaging over anumber of orbital periods, and discuss the origin of the anomalous x-rayspectral features, recently reported by turner et al.

astro-ph;0507492	planetary migration	gravitational torques between a planet and gas in the protoplanetary diskresult in orbital migration of the planet, and are likely to play an importantrole in the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. for massescomparable to those of observed giant extrasolar planets, the interaction withthe disk is strong enough to form a gap, leading to coupled evolution of theplanet and disk on a viscous time scale (type ii migration). both the existenceof hot jupiters, and the statistical distribution of observed orbital radii,are consistent with an important role for type ii migration in the history ofcurrently observed systems. we discuss the possibility of improving constraintson migration by including information on the host stars' metallicity, and notethat migration could also form a population of massive planets at large orbitalradii that may be indirectly detected via their influence on debris disks. forlower mass planets with masses of the order of that of the earth, surfacedensity perturbations created by the planet are small, and migration in alaminar disk is driven by an intrinsic and apparently robust asymmetry betweeninterior and exterior torques. analytic and numerical calculations of this typei migration are in reasonable accord, and predict rapid orbital decay duringthe final stages of the formation of giant planet cores. the difficulty ofreconciling type i migration with giant planet formation may signal basicerrors in our understanding of protoplanetary disks, core accretion, or both.we discuss physical effects that might alter type i behavior, in particular thepossibility that for sufficiently low masses turbulent fluctuations in the gassurface density dominate the torque, leading to random walk migration of verylow mass bodies.

astro-ph;0604077	predictions for the correlation between giant and terrestrial extrasolar  planets in dynamically evolved systems	the large eccentricities of many giant extrasolar planets may represent theendpoint of gravitational scattering in initially more crowded systems. if so,the early evolution of the giant planets is likely to be more restrictive ofterrestrial planet formation than would be inferred from the current,dynamically quiescent, configurations. here, we study statistically the extentof the anti-correlation between giant planets and terrestrial planets expectedin a scattering model. we use marginally stable systems of three giant planets,with a realistic range of planetary masses, as a simple model for the initialconditions prior to scattering, and show that after scattering the survivingplanets reproduce well the known extrasolar planet eccentricities beyond a &gt;0.5 au. by tracking the minimum periastron values of all planets during theevolution, we derive the distribution of orbital radii across which strongperturbations (from crossing orbits) are likely to affect low mass planetformation. we find that scattering affects inner planet formation at orbitalseparations less than 50% of the final periastron distance of the innermostmassive planet in approximately 30% of the realizations, and can occasionallyinfluence planet formation at orbital separations less than 20% of the finalperiastron distance of the innermost massive planet. the domain of influence ofthe scattering massive planets increases as the mass differential between themassive planets decreases. observational study of the correlation betweenmassive and terrestrial extrasolar planets in the same system has the potentialto constrain the origin of planetary eccentricity.

0809.3449	mean motion resonances from planet-planet scattering	planet-planet scattering is the leading mechanism to explain the largeeccentricities of the observed exoplanet population. however, scattering hasnot been considered important to the production of pairs of planets in meanmotion resonances (mmrs). we present results from a large number of numericalsimulations of dynamical instabilities in 3-planet systems. we show that mmrsarise naturally in about five percent of cases. the most common resonances wepopulate are the 2:1 and 3:1 mmrs, although a wide variety of mmrs can occur,including high-order mmrs (up to eleventh order). mmrs are generatedpreferentially in systems with uneven mass distributions: the smallest planetis typically ejected after a series of close encounters, leaving the remaining,more massive planets in resonance. the distribution of resonant planets isconsistent with the phase-space density of resonant orbits, meaning thatplanets are randomly thrown into mmrs rather than being slowly pulled intothem. it may be possible to distinguish between mmrs created by scattering vs.convergent migration in a gaseous disk by considering planetary mass ratios:resonant pairs of planets beyond ~1 au with more massive outer planets arelikely to have formed by scattering. in addition, scattering may be responsiblefor pairs of planets in high-order mmrs (3:1 and higher) that are not easilypopulated by migration. the frequency of mmrs from scattering is comparable tothe expected survival rate of mmrs in turbulent disks. thus, planet-planetscattering is likely to be a major contributor to the population of resonantplanets.

astro-ph;9812001	warped discs and the directional stability of jets in active galactic  nuclei	warped accretion discs in active galactic nuclei (agn) exert a torque on theblack hole that tends to align the rotation axis with the angular momentum ofthe outer disc. we compute the magnitude of this torque by solving numericallyfor the steady state shape of the warped disc, and verify that the analyticsolution of scheuer and feiler (1996) provides an excellent approximation. wegeneralise these results for discs with strong warps and arbitrary surfacedensity profiles, and calculate the timescale on which the black hole becomesaligned with the angular momentum in the outer disc. for massive holes andaccretion rates of the order of the eddington limit the alignment timescale isalways short (less than a myr), so that jets accelerated from the inner discregion provide a prompt tracer of the angular momentum of gas at large radii inthe disc. longer timescales are predicted for low luminosity systems, dependingon the degree of anisotropy in the disc's hydrodynamic response to shear andwarp, and for the final decay of modest warps at large radii in the disc thatare potentially observable via vlbi. we discuss the implications of this forthe inferred accretion history of those active galactic nuclei whose jetdirections appear to be stable over long timescales. the large energydeposition rate at modest disc radii during rapid realignment episodes shouldmake such objects transiently bright at optical and infrared wavelengths.

astro-ph;9902274	lense-thirring precession of accretion disks around compact objects	misaligned accretion disks surrounding rotating compact objects experience atorque due to the lense-thirring effect, which leads to precession of the innerdisk. it has been suggested that this effect could be responsible for some lowfrequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the x-ray lightcurves ofneutron star and galactic black hole systems. we investigate this possibilityvia time-dependent calculations of the response of the inner disk to impulsiveperturbations for both newtonian point mass and paczynski-wiita potentials, andcompare the results to the predictions of the linearized twisted accretion diskequations. for most of a wide range of disk models that we have considered, thecombination of differential precession and viscosity causes the warps to decayextremely rapidly. moreover, at least for relatively slowly rotating objects,linear calculations in a newtonian point mass potential provide a good measureof the damping rate, provided only that the timescale for precession is muchshorter than the viscous time in the inner disk. the typically rapid decayrates suggest that coherent precession of a fluid disk would not be observable,though it remains possible that the damping rate of warp in the disk could below enough to permit weakly coherent signals from lense-thirring precession.

astro-ph;9906028	black hole formation via hypercritical accretion during common envelope  evolution	neutron stars inspiralling into a stellar envelope can accrete at ratesvastly exceeding the eddington limit if the flow develops pressures high enoughto allow neutrinos to radiate the released gravitational energy. it has beensuggested that this hypercritical mode of accretion leads inevitably to theformation of stellar mass black holes during common envelope evolution. westudy the hydrodynamics of this flow at large radii (r &gt;&gt; r_ns), and show thatfor low mach number flows, in two dimensions, modest density gradients in thestellar envelope suffice to produce a hot, advection dominated accretion diskaround the accreting object. the formation of outflows from such a disk ishighly probable, and we discuss the impact of the resultant mass loss andfeedback of energy into the envelope for the survival of the neutron star.unless outflows are weaker than those inferred for well observed accretingsystems, we argue that in most cases insufficient accretion occurs to forcecollapse to a black hole before the envelope has been ejected. this conclusionsis of interest for black hole formation in general, for some models of gammaray bursts, and for predictions of the event rate in future ligo observations.
