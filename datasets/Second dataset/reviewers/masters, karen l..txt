0910.4113	galaxy zoo: passive red spirals	we study the spectroscopic properties and environments of red spiral galaxiesfound by the galaxy zoo project. by carefully selecting face-on, disk dominatedspirals we construct a sample of truly passive disks (not dust reddened, nordominated by old stellar populations in a bulge). as such, our red spiralsrepresent an interesting set of possible transition objects between normal bluespirals and red early types. we use sdss data to investigate the physicalprocesses which could have turned these objects red without disturbing theirmorphology. red spirals prefer intermediate density regimes, however there areno obvious correlations between red spiral properties and environment -environment alone is not sufficient to determine if a spiral will become red.red spirals are a small fraction of spirals at low masses, but are asignificant fraction at large stellar masses - massive galaxies are redindependent of morphology. we confirm that red spirals have older stellar popnsand less recent star formation than the main spiral population. while thepresence of spiral arms suggests that major star formation cannot have ceasedlong ago, we show that these are not recent post-starbursts, so star formationmust have ceased gradually. intriguingly, red spirals are ~4 times more likelythan normal spirals to host optically identified seyfert or liner, with most ofthe difference coming from liners. we find a curiously large bar fraction inthe red spirals suggesting that the cessation of star formation and barinstabilities are strongly correlated. we conclude by discussing the possibleorigins. we suggest they may represent the very oldest spiral galaxies whichhave already used up their reserves of gas - probably aided by strangulation,and perhaps bar instabilities moving material around in the disk.

1001.1744	galaxy zoo: dust in spirals	we investigate the effect of dust on spiral galaxies by measuring theinclination-dependence of optical colours for 24,276 well-resolved sdssgalaxies visually classified in galaxy zoo. we find clear trends of reddeningwith inclination which imply a total extinction from face-on to edge-on of 0.7,0.6, 0.5 and 0.4 magnitudes for the ugri passbands. we split the sample into"bulgy" (early-type) and "disky" (late-type) spirals using the sdss fracdev (orf_dev) parameter and show that the average face-on colour of "bulgy" spirals isredder than the average edge-on colour of "disky" spirals. this shows that theobserved optical colour of a spiral galaxy is determined almost equally by thespiral type (via the bulge-disk ratio and stellar populations), and reddeningdue to dust. we find that both luminosity and spiral type affect the totalamount of extinction, with "disky" spirals at m_r ~ -21.5 mags having the mostreddening. this decrease of reddening for the most luminous spirals has notbeen observed before and may be related to their lower levels of recent starformation. we compare our results with the latest dust attenuation models oftuffs et al. we find that the model reproduces the observed trends reasonablywell but overpredicts the amount of u-band attenuation in edge-on galaxies. weend by discussing the effects of dust on large galaxy surveys and emphasizethat these effects will become important as we push to higher precisionmeasurements of galaxy properties and their clustering.

1001.3141	galaxy zoo: the fundamentally different co-evolution of supermassive  black holes and their early- and late-type host galaxies	we use data from the sloan digital sky survey and visual classifications ofmorphology from the galaxy zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearbyuniverse (z &lt; 0.05) and to break down the agn host galaxy population by color,stellar mass and morphology. we find that black hole growth at luminositiesl_oiii &gt;1e40 erg/s in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different.agn host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses(1e10-1e11 msun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram andtheir central black holes have median masses around 1e6.5 msun. however, bycomparing early- and late-type agn host galaxies to their non-activecounterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it ispreferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that aregrowing, while late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive}blackholes that are growing. the duty cycle of agn in early-type galaxies isstrongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1e10 msun) of thered sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloudprogenitors. the duty cycle of agn in late-type galaxies on the other handpeaks in massive (1e11 msun) green and red late-types which generally do nothave a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. at high eddingtonratios (l/l_edd &gt; 0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of agnare the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. finally, the milky waylikely resides in the "sweet spot" on the color-mass diagram where the agn dutycycle of late-type galaxies is highest. we discuss the implications of theseresults for our understanding of the role of agn in the evolution of galaxies

1003.0449	galaxy zoo: bars in disk galaxies	we present first results from galaxy zoo 2, the second phase of the highlysuccessful galaxy zoo project (www.galaxyzoo.org). using a volume-limitedsample of 13665 disk galaxies (0.01&lt; z &lt; 0.06 and m_r&lt;-19.38), we study thefraction of galaxies with bars as a function of global galaxy properties likecolour, luminosity and bulge prominence. overall, 29.4+/-0.5% of galaxies inour sample have a bar, in excellent agreement with previous visually classifiedsamples of galaxies (although this overall fraction is lower than measured byautomated bar-finding methods). we see a clear increase in the bar fractionwith redder (g-r) colours, decreased luminosity and in galaxies with moreprominent bulges, to the extent that over half of the red, bulge-dominated,disk galaxies in our sample possess a bar. we see evidence for a colourbi-modality for our sample of disk galaxies, with a "red sequence" that is bothbulge and bar-dominated, and a "blue cloud" which has little, or no, evidencefor a (classical) bulge or bar. these results are consistent with similartrends for barred galaxies seen recently both locally and at higher redshift,and with early studies using the rc3. we discuss these results in the contextof internal (secular) galaxy evolution scenarios and the possible links to theformation of bars and bulges in disk galaxies.

1003.3450	the acs fornax cluster survey vii. half-light radii of globular clusters  in early-type galaxies	we measure the half-light radii of globular clusters (gcs) in 43 galaxiesfrom the acs fornax cluster survey (acsfcs). we use these data to extendprevious work in which the environmental dependencies of the half-light radiiof gcs in early type galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey (acsvcs) werestudied, and a corrected mean half-light radius (corrected for the observedenvironmental trends) was suggested as a reliable distance indicator. this workboth increases the sample size for the study of the environmental dependencies,and adds leverage to the study of the corrected half-light radius as a possibledistance indicator (since fornax lies at a larger distance than the virgocluster). we study the environmental dependencies of the size of gcs using botha principal component analysis as well as 2d scaling relations. we largelyconfirm the environmental dependencies shown in jordan et al. (2005), but findevidence that there is a residual correlation in the mean half-light radius ofgc systems with galaxy magnitude, and subtle differences in the othercorrelations - so there may not be a universal correction for the half-lightradii of lower luminosity galaxy gc systems. the main factor determining thesize of a gc in an early type galaxy is the gc color. red gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; =2.8+/-0.3 pc, while blue gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; = 3.4+/-0.3 pc. we show that for brightearly-type galaxies (m_b &lt; -19 mag), the uncorrected mean half-light radius ofthe gc system is by itself an excellent distance indicator (with error ~11%),having the potential to reach cosmologically interesting distances in the eraof high angular resolution adaptive optics on large optical telescopes.

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

1107.5306	galaxy zoo: dust and molecular gas in early-type galaxies with prominent  dust lanes	we study dust and associated molecular gas in 352 nearby early-type galaxies(etgs) with prominent dust lanes. 65% of these `dusty etgs' (d-etgs) aremorphologically disturbed, suggesting a merger origin. this is consistent withthe d-etgs residing in lower density environments compared to the controlsdrawn from the general etg population. 80% of d-etgs inhabit the field(compared to 60% of the controls) and &lt;2% inhabit clusters (compared to 10% ofthe controls). compared to the controls, d-etgs exhibit bluer uv-opticalcolours (indicating enhanced star formation) and an agn fraction that is morethan an order of magnitude greater (indicating higher incidence of nuclearactivity). the clumpy dust mass residing in large-scale features is estimated,using the sdss r-band images, to be 10^{4.5}-10^{6.5} msun. a comparison to thetotal (clumpy + diffuse) dust masses- calculated using the far-ir fluxes of 15%of the d-etgs that are detected by the iras- indicates that only ~20% of thedust resides in these large-scale features. the dust masses are several timeslarger than the maximum value expected from stellar mass loss, ruling out aninternal origin. the dust content shows no correlation with the blueluminosity, indicating that it is not related to a galactic scale cooling flow.no correlation is found with the age of the recent starburst, suggesting thatthe dust is accreted directly in the merger rather than being produced in situby the triggered star formation. using molecular gas-to-dust ratios of etgs inthe literature we estimate that the median current and initial molecular gasfraction are ~1.3% and ~4%, respectively. recent work suggests that the mergeractivity in nearby etgs largely involves minor mergers (mass ratios between1:10 and 1:4). if the iras-detected d-etgs form via this channel, then theoriginal gas fractions of the accreted satellites are 20%-44%.

1108.0669	the 2mass redshift survey - description and data release	we present the results of the 2mass redshift survey (2mrs), a ten-yearproject to map the full three-dimensional distribution of galaxies in thenearby universe. the 2 micron all-sky survey (2mass) was completed in 2003 andits final data products, including an extended source catalog (xsc), areavailable on-line. the 2mass xsc contains nearly a million galaxies with ks &lt;=13.5 mag and is essentially complete and mostly unaffected by interstellarextinction and stellar confusion down to a galactic latitude of |b|=5 deg forbright galaxies. near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellarpopulations that dominate galaxy masses, making 2mass an excellent startingpoint to study the distribution of matter in the nearby universe.  we selected a sample of 44,599 2mass galaxies with ks &lt;= 11.75 mag and |b|&gt;=5deg (&gt;= 8 deg towards the galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey.we obtained spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and usedpreviously-obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate aredshift catalog that is 97.6% complete to well-defined limits and covers 91%of the sky. this provides an unprecedented census of galaxy (baryonic mass)concentrations within 300 mpc.  earlier versions of our survey have been used in a number of publicationsthat have studied the bulk motion of the local group, mapped the density andpeculiar velocity fields out to 50 mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimatedthe values of several cosmological parameters.  additionally, we present morphological types for a nearly-complete sub-sampleof 20,860 galaxies with ks &lt; 11.25 mag and |b|&gt;= 10 deg.

1111.0969	galaxy zoo: the environmental dependence of bars and bulges in disc  galaxies	we present an analysis of the environmental dependence of bars and bulges indisc galaxies, using a volume-limited catalogue of 15810 galaxies at z&lt;0.06from the sloan digital sky survey with visual morphologies from the galaxy zoo2 project. we find that the likelihood of having a bar, or bulge, in discgalaxies increases when the galaxies have redder (optical) colours and largerstellar masses, and observe a transition in the bar and bulge likelihoods, suchthat massive disc galaxies are more likely to host bars and bulges. we usegalaxy clustering methods to demonstrate statistically significantenvironmental correlations of barred, and bulge-dominated, galaxies, fromprojected separations of 150 kpc/h to 3 mpc/h. these environmental correlationsappear to be independent of each other: i.e., bulge-dominated disc galaxiesexhibit a significant bar-environment correlation, and barred disc galaxiesshow a bulge-environment correlation. we demonstrate that approximately half(50 +/- 10%) of the bar-environment correlation can be explained by the factthat more massive dark matter haloes host redder disc galaxies, which are thenmore likely to have bars. likewise, we show that the environmental dependenceof stellar mass can only explain a small fraction (25 +/- 10%) of thebar-environment correlation. therefore, a significant fraction of our observedenvironmental dependence of barred galaxies is not due to colour or stellarmass dependences, and hence could be due to another galaxy property. finally,by analyzing the projected clustering of barred and unbarred disc galaxies withhalo occupation models, we argue that barred galaxies are in slightlyhigher-mass haloes than unbarred ones, and some of them (approximately 25%) aresatellite galaxies in groups. we also discuss implications about the effects ofminor mergers and interactions on bar formation.

1202.6241	the progenitors of present-day massive red galaxies up to z ~ 0.7 -  finding passive galaxies using sdss-i/ii and sdss-iii	we present a comprehensive study of 250,000 galaxies targeted by the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) up to z ~ 0.7 with the specific goal ofidentifying and characterising a population of galaxies that has evolvedwithout significant merging. we compute a likelihood that each boss galaxy is aprogenitor of the luminous red galaxies (lrgs) sample, targeted by sdss-i/ii upz ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of lrgs and their inferred star-formationhistories, metallicity histories and dust content. we determine merger rates,luminosity growth rates and the evolution of the large-scale clustering betweenthe two surveys, and we investigate the effect of using different stellarpopulation synthesis models in our conclusions. we demonstrate that our sampleis slowly evolving (of the order of 2 +/- 1.5% per gyr by merging). ourconclusions refer to the bright and massive end of the galaxy population, withmi0.55 &lt; -22, and m* &gt; 1e11.2 msolar, corresponding roughly to 95% and 40% ofthe lrgs and boss galaxy populations, respectively. our analysis further showsthat any possible excess of flux in boss galaxies, when compared to lrgs, frompotentially unresolved targets at z ~ 0.55 must be less than 1% in ther0.55-band (approximately equivalent to the g-band in the rest-frame ofgalaxies at z=0.55). when weighting the boss galaxies based on the predictedproperties of the lrgs, and restricting the analysis to the reddest bossgalaxies, we find an evolution of the large-scale clustering that is consistentwith dynamical passive evolution, assuming a standard cosmology. we concludethat our likelihoods give a weighted sample that is as clean and as close topassive evolution (in dynamical terms, i.e. no or negligible merging) aspossible, and that is optimal for cosmological studies.

1205.5271	galaxy zoo and alfalfa: atomic gas and the regulation of star formation  in barred disc galaxies	we study the observed correlation between atomic gas content and thelikelihood of hosting a large scale bar in a sample of 2090 disc galaxies. sucha test has never been done before on this scale. we use data on morphologiesfrom the galaxy zoo project and information on the galaxies' hi content fromthe alfalfa blind hi survey. our main result is that the bar fraction issignificantly lower among gas rich disc galaxies than gas poor ones. this isnot explained by known trends for more massive (stellar) and redder discgalaxies to host more bars and have lower gas fractions: we still see at fixedstellar mass a residual correlation between gas content and bar fraction. wediscuss three possible causal explanations: (1) bars in disc galaxies causeatomic gas to be used up more quickly, (2) increasing the atomic gas content ina disc galaxy inhibits bar formation, and (3) bar fraction and gas content areboth driven by correlation with environmental effects (e.g. tidal triggering ofbars, combined with strangulation removing gas). all three explanations areconsistent with the observed correlations. in addition our observations suggestbars may reduce or halt star formation in the outer parts of discs by holdingback the infall of external gas beyond bar co-rotation, reddening the globalcolours of barred disc galaxies. this suggests that secular evolution driven bythe exchange of angular momentum between stars in the bar, and gas in the disc,acts as a feedback mechanism to regulate star formation in intermediate massdisc galaxies.

1206.5020	galaxy zoo: quantifying morphological indicators of galaxy interaction	we use galaxy zoo 2 visual classifications to study the morphologicalsignatures of interaction between similar-mass galaxy pairs in the sloandigital sky survey. we find that many observable features correlate withprojected pair separation; not only obvious indicators of merging, disturbanceand tidal tails, but also more regular features, such as spiral arms and bars.these trends are robustly quantified, using a control sample to account forobservational biases, producing measurements of the strength and separationscale of various morphological responses to pair interaction. for example, wefind that the presence of spiral features is enhanced at scales &lt; 70 h^-1 kpc,probably due to both increased star formation and the formation of tidal tails.on the other hand, the likelihood of identifying a bar decreases significantlyin pairs with separations &lt; 30 h^-1 kpc, suggesting that bars are suppressed byclose interactions between galaxies of similar mass. we go on to show howmorphological indicators of physical interactions provide a way ofsignificantly refining standard estimates for the frequency of close pairinteractions, based on velocity offset and projected separation. the presenceof loosely wound spiral arms is found to be a particularly reliable signal ofan interaction, for projected pair separations up to ~100 h^-1 kpc. we use thisindicator to demonstrate our method, constraining the fraction of low-redshiftgalaxies in truly interacting pairs, with m_* &gt; 10^9.5 m_sun and mass ratio &lt;4, to be between 0.4 - 2.7 per cent.

1207.6114	stellar masses of sdss-iii boss galaxies at z~0.5 and constraints to  galaxy formation models	we calculate stellar masses for massive luminous galaxies at redshift 0.2-0.7using the first two years of data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energydistributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies areused to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. accurateboss spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. we find that thedistribution of stellar masses in boss is narrow (delta log m~0.5 dex) andpeaks at about logm ~ 11.3 (for a kroupa initial stellar mass function), andthat the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, inagreement with the intended boss target selection. the galaxy masses probed byboss extend over ~10^{12} m, providing unprecedented measurements of thehigh-mass end of the galaxy mass function. we find that the galaxy numberdensity above ~ 2.5 10^{11} m agrees with previous determinations. we perform acomparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the bosstarget selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. the abundanceof massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the boss data, butthe models lack galaxies at the massive end. moreover, no evolution withredshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance ofmassive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. additionally, bossdata display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in thelocal universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. on the otherhand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span anarrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. we argue that thelack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly dueto metallicity, which is too low in the models.

1211.6723	galaxy zoo: a catalog of overlapping galaxy pairs for dust studies	analysis of galaxies with overlapping images offers a direct way to probe thedistribution of dust extinction and its effects on the background light. wepresent a catalog of 1990 such galaxy pairs selected from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) by volunteers of the galaxy zoo project. we highlight subsampleswhich are particularly useful for retrieving such properties of the dustdistribution as uv extinction, the extent perpendicular to the disk plane, andextinction in the inner parts of disks. the sample spans wide ranges ofmorphology and surface brightness, opening up the possibility of using thistechnique to address systematic changes in dust extinction or distribution withgalaxy type. this sample will form the basis for forthcoming work on the rangesof dust distributions in local disk galaxies, both for their astrophysicalimplications and as the low-redshift part of a study of the evolution of dustproperties. separate lists and figures show deep overlaps, where the innerregions of the foreground galaxy are backlit, and the relatively small numberof previously-known overlapping pairs outside the sdss dr7 sky coverage.

1301.3164	synmag photometry: a fast tool for catalog-level matched colors of  extended sources	obtaining reliable, matched photometry for galaxies imaged by differentobservatories represents a key challenge in the era of wide-field surveysspanning more than several hundred square degrees. methods such as fluxfitting, profile fitting, and psf homogenization followed by matched-aperturephotometry are all computationally expensive. we present an alternativesolution called "synthetic aperture photometry" that exploits galaxy profilefits in one band to efficiently model the observed, psf-convolved light profilein other bands and predict the flux in arbitrarily sized apertures. becauseaperture magnitudes are the most widely tabulated flux measurements in surveycatalogs, producing synthetic aperture magnitudes (synmags) enables very fastmatched photometry at the catalog level, without reprocessing imaging data. wemake our code public and apply it to obtain matched photometry between sdssugriz and ukidss yjhk imaging, recovering red-sequence colors and photometricredshifts with a scatter and accuracy as good as if not better thanfwhm-homogenized photometry from the gama survey. finally, we list somespecific measurements that upcoming surveys could make available to facilitateand ease the use of synmags.

1303.3551	the different star-formation histories of blue and red spiral and  elliptical galaxies	[abridged] we study the spectral properties of intermediate mass galaxies asa function of colour and morphology. we use galaxy zoo to define threemorphological classes of galaxies, namely early-types (ellipticals), late-type(disk-dominated) face-on spirals and early-type (bulge-dominated) face-onspirals. we classify these galaxies as blue or red according to their sdss g-rcolour and use the spectral fitting code vespa to calculate time-resolvedstar-formation histories, metallicity and total starlight dust extinction fromtheir sdss fibre spectra. we find that red late-type spirals show lessstar-formation in the last 500 myr than blue late-type spirals by up to afactor of three, but share similar star-formation histories at earlier times.this decline in recent star-formation explains their redder colour: theirchemical and dust content are the same. we postulate that red late-type spiralsare recent descendants of blue late-type spirals, with their star-formationcurtailed in the last 500 myrs. the red late-type spirals are however stillforming stars approximately 17 times faster than red ellipticals over the sameperiod. red early-type spirals lie between red late-type spirals and redellipticals in terms of recent-to-intermediate star-formation and dust content.therefore, it is plausible that these galaxies represent an evolutionary linkbetween these two populations. they are more likely to evolve directly into redellipticals than red late-type spirals. blue ellipticals show similarstar-formation histories as blue spirals (regardless of type), except they haveformed less stars in the last 100 myrs. however, blue ellipticals havedifferent dust content, which peaks at lower extinction values than all spiralgalaxies.

1303.7118	a zoo of galaxies	we live in a universe filled with galaxies with an amazing variety of sizesand shapes. one of the biggest challenges for astronomers working in this fieldis to understand how all these types relate to each other in the background ofan expanding universe. modern astronomical surveys (like the sloan digital skysurvey) have revolutionised this field of astronomy, by providing vast numbersof galaxies to study. the sheer size of the these databases made traditionalvisual classification of the types galaxies impossible and in 2007 inspired thegalaxy zoo project (www.galaxyzoo.org); starting the largest ever scientificcollaboration by asking members of the public to help classify galaxies by typeand shape. galaxy zoo has since shown itself, in a series of now more than 30scientific papers, to be a fantastic database for the study of galaxyevolution. in this invited discourse i spoke a little about the historicalbackground of our understanding of what galaxies are, of galaxy classification,about our modern view of galaxies in the era of large surveys. i finish withshowcasing some of the contributions galaxy classifications from the galaxy zooproject are making to our understanding of galaxy evolution.  this publication has been made possible by the participation of more than200,000 volunteers in the galaxy zoo project. their contributions areindividually acknowledged at http://www.galaxyzoo.org/volunteers. klmacknowledges funding from the peter and patricia gruber foundation as the 2008peter and patricia gruber foundation iau fellow, and from a 2010 leverhulmetrust early career fellowship, as well as support from the royal astronomicalsociety to attend the 28th ga of the iau.

1310.2941	galaxy zoo: observing secular evolution through bars	in this paper, we use the galaxy zoo 2 dataset to study the behavior of barsin disk galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate (ssfr), andbulge prominence. our sample consists of 13,295 disk galaxies, with an overall(strong) bar fraction of $23.6\pm 0.4\%$, of which 1,154 barred galaxies alsohave bar length measurements. these samples are the largest ever used to studythe role of bars in galaxy evolution. we find that the likelihood of a galaxyhosting a bar is anti-correlated with ssfr, regardless of stellar mass or bulgeprominence. we find that the trends of bar likelihood and bar length with bulgeprominence are bimodal with ssfr. we interpret these observations usingstate-of-the-art simulations of bar evolution which include live halos and theeffects of gas and star formation. we suggest our observed trends of barlikelihood with ssfr are driven by the gas fraction of the disks; a factordemonstrated to significantly retard both bar formation and evolution inmodels. we interpret the bimodal relationship between bulge prominence and barproperties as due to the complicated effects of classical bulges and centralmass concentrations on bar evolution, and also to the growth of diskypseudobulges by bar evolution. these results represent empirical evidence forsecular evolution driven by bars in disk galaxies. this work suggests that barsare not stagnant structures within disk galaxies, but are a criticalevolutionary driver of their host galaxies in the local universe ($z&lt;1$).

1402.4814	the green valley is a red herring: galaxy zoo reveals two evolutionary  pathways towards quenching of star formation in early- and late-type galaxies	we use sdss+\textit{galex}+galaxy zoo data to study the quenching of starformation in low-redshift galaxies. we show that the green valley between theblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxiesin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through whichmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. rather, an analysis that takesmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blueearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologiesare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.in contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation ratesdecline very slowly. we summarize a range of observations that lead to theseconclusions, including uv-optical colours and halo masses, which both show astriking dependence on morphological type. we interpret these results in termsof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. we conclude thatlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply ofgas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustionof the remaining gas over several gyr, driven by secular and/or environmentalprocesses. in contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gassupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapidquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.this gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, andmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly agnfeedback.

1405.1431	redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of massive galaxies from  sdss-iii/boss	we study the redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of ~180,000massive galaxies from sdss-iii/boss combined with a local early-type galaxysample from sdss-ii in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt; 0.6. the typical stellar massof this sample is mstar~2x10^{11} msun. we analyze the evolution of the galaxyparameters effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion, and the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift. as the effective radii of boss galaxies atthese redshifts are not well resolved in the sdss imaging we calibrate the sdsssize measurements with hst/cosmos photometry for a sub-sample of galaxies. wefurther apply a correction for progenitor bias to build a sample which consistsof a coeval, passively evolving population. systematic errors due to sizecorrection and the calculation of dynamical mass, are assessed through montecarlo simulations. at fixed stellar or dynamical mass, we find moderateevolution in galaxy size and stellar velocity dispersion, in agreement withprevious studies. we show that this results in a decrease of the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift at &gt;2sigma significance. by combining oursample with high-redshift literature data we find that this evolution of thedynamical to stellar mass ratio continues beyond z~0.7 up to z&gt;2 as mdyn/mstar~(1+z)^{-0.30+/- 0.12} further strengthening the evidence for an increase ofmdyn/mstar with cosmic time. this result is in line with recent predictionsfrom galaxy formation simulations based on minor merger driven mass growth, inwhich the dark matter fraction within the half-light radius increases withcosmic time.

1502.01033	galaxy zoo: the effect of bar-driven fueling on the presence of an  active galactic nucleus in disc galaxies	we study the influence of the presence of a strong bar in disc galaxies whichhost an active galactic nucleus (agn). using data from the sloan digital skysurvey and morphological classifications from the galaxy zoo 2 project, wecreate a volume-limited sample of 19,756 disc galaxies at $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.05$ whichhave been visually examined for the presence of a bar. within this sample, agnhost galaxies have a higher overall percentage of bars (51.8%) than inactivegalaxies exhibiting central star formation (37.1%). this difference isprimarily due to known effects; that the presence of both agn and galactic barsis strongly correlated with both the stellar mass and integrated colour of thehost galaxy. we control for this effect by examining the difference in agnfraction between barred and unbarred galaxies in fixed bins of mass and colour.once this effect is accounted for, there remains a small but statisticallysignificant increase that represents 16% of the average barred agn fraction.using the $l_{\rm{[o iii]}}/m_{bh} $ratio as a measure of agn strength, we showthat barred agn do not exhibit stronger accretion than unbarred agn at a fixedmass and colour. the data are consistent with a model in which bar-drivenfueling does contribute to the probability of an actively growing black hole,but in which other dynamical mechanisms must contribute to the direct agnfueling via smaller, non-axisymmetric perturbations.

1502.03444	galaxy zoo: the dependence of the star formation-stellar mass relation  on spiral disk morphology	we measure the stellar mass-star formation rate relation in star-forming diskgalaxies at z&lt;0.085, using galaxy~zoo morphologies to examine differentpopulations of spirals as classified by their kiloparsec-scale structure. weexamine the number of spiral arms, their relative pitch angle, and the presenceof a galactic bar in the disk, and show that both the slope and dispersion ofthe m-sfr relation is constant when varying all the above parameters. we alsoshow that mergers (both major and minor), which represent the strongestconditions for increases in star formation at a constant mass, only boost thesfr above the main relation by ~0.3 dex; this is significantly smaller than theincrease seen in merging systems at z&gt;1. of the galaxies lying significantlyabove the m-sfr relation in the local universe, more than 50% are mergers. weinterpret this as evidence that the spiral arms, which are imperfectreflections of the galaxy's current gravitational potential, are either fullyindependent of the various quenching mechanisms or are completely overwhelmedby the combination of outflows and feedback. the arrangement of the starformation can be changed, but the system as a whole regulates itself even inthe presence of strong dynamical forcing.

astro-ph;0001477	the elliptical galaxy formerly known as the local group: merging the  globular cluster systems	prompted by a new catalogue of m31 globular clusters, we have collectedtogether individual metallicity values for globular clusters in the localgroup. although we briefly describe the globular cluster systems of theindividual local group galaxies, the main thrust of our paper is to examine thecollective properties. in this way we are simulating the dissipationless mergerof the local group, into presumably an elliptical galaxy. such a merger isdominated by the milky way and m31, which appear to be fairly typical examplesof globular cluster systems of spiral galaxies.  the local group `elliptical' has about 700 +/- 125 globular clusters, with aluminosity function resembling the `universal' one. the metallicitydistribution has peaks at [fe/h] ~ -1.55 and -0.64 with a metal-poor tometal-rich ratio of 2.5:1. the specific frequency of the local group ellipticalis initially about 1 but rises to about 3, when the young stellar populationsfade and the galaxy resembles an old elliptical. the metallicity distributionand stellar population corrected specific frequency are similar to that of someknown early type galaxies. based on our results, we briefly speculate on theorigin of globular cluster systems in galaxies.

astro-ph;0304398	internal extinction in spiral galaxies in the near infrared	in order to study the effects of internal extinction in spiral galaxies wesearch for correlations of near infrared (nir) photometric parameters withinclination. we use data from the 2 micron all-sky survey (2mass) extendedsource catalog (xsc) on 15,224 spiral galaxies for which we also haveredshifts. for 3035 of the galaxies, i-band photometry is available which isincluded in the analysis. from the simple dependence of reddening oninclination we derive a lower limit to the difference in magnitude between theface-on and edge-on aspect of 0.9, 0.3 and 0.1 magnitudes in i (0.81 um), j(1.25 um) and h (1.65 um) bands. we find that the faintest isophotal radiusreported in the xsc (at the 21st mag/arc sq level) is closer to the centers ofthe galaxies than other common isophotal measures (e.g. the 23.5 mag/arc sqradius in i-band), and argue that it should not be assumed to represent anouter isophote at which galaxies are transparent at all viewing angles. asimple linear extinction law (i.e. delta m = gamma log(a/b)) is not adequatefor the full range of disk inclinations and we adopt both a bi-linear and aquadratic law. a simple photometric model is used to explain the observedbehavior. internal extinction depends on galaxy luminosity. we show that forgalaxies with a k total magnitude dimmer than -20, -20.7 and -20.9 the dataindicates zero extinction in j, h and k respectively, while disk opacityincreases monotonically with increasing disk luminosity.

astro-ph;0404455	the impact of distance uncertainties on local luminosity and mass  functions	in order to investigate discrepancies between recent published estimates ofthe the hi mass function (himf), we explore the impact of distanceuncertainties on the derivation of the faint end slope of mass and luminosityfunctions of galaxies in the local volume by deriving himfs from mock hisurveys. we consider various survey geometries and depths and compare the himfsmeasured when using ``real'' distances, distances derived by assuming purehubble flow and distances assigned from parametric models of the local velocityfield. the effect is variable and dependent on the exact survey geometry, butcan easily lead to incorrect estimates of the himf, particularly at the lowmass end. we show that at least part of the discrepancies among recentderivations of the himf can be accounted for by the use of different methods toassign distances. we conclude that a better understanding of the local velocityfield will be necessary for accurate determinations of the local galaxyluminosity and mass functions.

astro-ph;0503271	cosmology in the very local universe - why flow models matter	while much of the focus of observational cosmology is on the high redshiftuniverse it is important not to neglect the very local universe as a source ofcosmological information. the inner profiles and number counts of low masshalos have provided the biggest stumbling blocks so far for lcdm. these smallstructures can only be seen nearby where the component of a galaxy's redshiftwhich is due to motions under gravity can be comparable to (or even largerthan) its cosmological redshift. we report on a new sample of tully-fisherdistances (the sfi++) which is being used in combination with publiclyavailable primary distances to model galaxy flows in and around the localsupercluster. this sample has ~10 times as many tracers as were used for thecurrent best model. initially a parametric model including infall onto multipleattractors will be used. such models are not realistic representations of thetrue velocity field, but provide useful first order corrections. we explore thetypical errors in distances from such a flow model and how they vary indifferent regions of the local supercluster by fitting the same parametricmodel to mock catalogs derived from a constrained simulation of the volume.

astro-ph;0508300	the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey: ii. results of precursor  observations	in preparation for the full arecibo legacy fast alfa extragalactic hi survey,precursor observations were carried out in aug--sep 2004 with the 7-beamarecibo l-band feed array (alfa) receiver system and the wapp spectralprocessors. while these observations were geared mainly at testing anddebugging survey strategy, hardware and software, approximately 36 hours oftelescope time yielded science--quality data. from those observations, aninitial list of 730 tentative detections of varying degree of reliability wasextracted. ninety--eight high signal-to-noise candidates were deemed to be bonafide hi line detections. to test our ability to discriminate cosmic signalsfrom rfi and noise, 165 candidates ranging in reliability likelihood werere--observed with the single beam l--band wide system at arecibo in jan--feb2005. of those, 41% were confirmed as real. we present the results of both thealfa and single beam observations for the sample of 166 confirmed hi sources,as well as our assessment of their optical counterparts. of the 166 sources, 62coincide with previously known hi sources, while optical redshifts wereavailable for an additional 18 galaxies; thus, 52% of the redshifts reportedhere were previously unknown. of the 166 hi detections, 115 are identified withpreviously cataloged galaxies, of either known or unknown redshift, leaving 51objects identified for the first time. because of the higher sensitivity of thearecibo system, fewer than 10% of the 166 hi sources would have been detectedby a hipass--like survey of the same region. three of the objects have himasses less than 10^7 solar masses. the full alfalfa survey which commenced infebruary 2005 should detect more than 100 times as many objects of similarlylow hi mass over the next 5 years.

astro-ph;0510363	multi-wavelength study of galaxy rotation curves and its application to  cosmology	rotation information for spiral galaxies can be obtained through theobservation of different spectral lines. while the halpha(6563 a) line is oftenused for galaxies with low to moderate redshifts, it is redshifted into thenear-infrared at z&gt;0.4. this is why most high redshift surveys rely on the[oii](3727 a) line. using a sample of 32 spiral galaxies at 0.155 &lt; z &lt; 0.25observed simultaneously in both halpha and [oii] with the hale 200 inchtelescope, the relation between velocity widths extracted from these twospectral lines is investigated, and we conclude that halpha derived velocitiescan be reliably compared to high z [oii] measurements. the sample of galaxiesis then used along with vimos-vlt deep survey observations to perform theangular diameter - redshift test to find constraints on cosmologicalparameters. the test makes it possible to discriminate between variouscosmological models, given the upper limit of disc size evolution at themaximum redshift of the data set, no matter what the evolutionary scenario is.

astro-ph;0609249	sfi++ i: a new i-band tully-fisher template, the cluster peculiar  velocity dispersion and h0	the sfi++ consists of ~5000 spiral galaxies which have measurements suitablefor the application of the i-band tully-fisher (tf) relation. this samplebuilds on the sci and sfi samples published in the 1990s but includessignificant amounts of new data as well as improved methods for parameterdetermination. we derive a new i-band tf relation from a subset of this samplewhich consists of 807 galaxies in the fields of 31 nearby clusters and groups.this sample constitutes the largest ever available for the calibration of thetf template and extends the range of line-widths over which the template isreliably measured. careful accounting is made of observational and samplebiases such as incompleteness, finite cluster size, galaxy morphology andenvironment. we find evidence for a type-dependent tf slope which is shallowerfor early type than for late type spirals. the line-of-sight cluster peculiarvelocity dispersion is measured for the sample of 31 clusters. this value isdirectly related to the spectrum of initial density fluctuations and thusprovides an independent verification of the best fit wmap cosmology and anestimate of omega^0.6 sigma_8 = 0.52+/-0.06. we also provide an independentmeasure of the tf zeropoint using 17 galaxies in the sfi++ sample for whichcepheid distances are available. in combination with the ``basket of clusters''template relation these calibrator galaxies provide a measure of h0 = 74+/-2(random) +/-6 (systematic) km/s/mpc.

astro-ph;0610732	groups of galaxies in the two micron all-sky redshift survey	we present the results of applying a percolation algorithm to the initialrelease of the two micron all-sky survey extended source catalog, usingsubsequently measured redshifts for almost all of the galaxies with k &lt; 11.25mag. this group catalog is based on the first near-ir all-sky flux-limitedsurvey that is complete to |b| = 5 deg. we explore the dependence of theclustering on the length and velocity scales involved. the paper describes agroup catalog, complete to a limiting redshift of 10,000 km/s, created bymaximizing the number of groups containing 3 or more members. a second catalogis also presented, created by requiring a minimum density contrast of 80 toidentify groups. we identify known nearby clusters in the catalogs and contrastthe groups identified in the two catalogs. we examine and compare theproperties of the determined groups and verify that the results are consistentwith the uzc-ssrs2 and northern cfa redshift survey group catalogs. the all-skynature of the catalog will allow the development of a flow-field model based onthe density field inferred from the estimated cluster masses.
