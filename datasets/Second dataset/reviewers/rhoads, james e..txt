0906.4554	a plethora of agn among lyman alpha galaxies at low redshift	we investigate the fraction of z ~ 0.3 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes)which host active galactic nucleus activity, which is typically from 1 - 5% at2 &lt; z &lt; 6. using optical spectroscopy of 23 laes at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.45 selectedwith galex uv data, we probe for agn with a variety of methods, including linewidths, diagnostic line ratios, high-ionization emission, infrared activity andx-ray luminosity. we found that our sample of low-redshift laes has an agnfraction of 43 ^{+18}{-26}%, significantly higher than at high redshift. whileprevious results have shown that low-redshift laes have a lower space densitythan their high-redshift analogs, these results show that star-forming laes atlow-redshift are rarer still. accounting for differences in available agnclassification methods, we conclude that rest-frame optical spectroscopy isnecessary to identify low-luminosity agns in laes at high redshift, and thatlimits on the x-ray flux are necessary to determine the extent to which the agncontaminates the lyman alpha fluxes.

0906.5159	a physical model of lyman alpha emitters	we present a simple physical model for populating dark matter halos withlyman alpha emiiters(laes) and predict the physical properties of laes atz~3-7. the central tenet of this model is that the ly-alpha luminosity isproportional to the star formation rate (sfr) which is directly related to thehalo mass accretion rate. the only free parameter in our model is then thestar-formation efficiency (sfe). an efficiency of 2.5% provides the best-fit tothe ly-alpha luminosity function (lf) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this sfe toconstruct ly-alpha lfs at other redshifts. our model reproduce the ly-alphalfs, stellar ages, sfr ~1-10; msun/yr, stellar masses ~ 10^7-10^8 msun and theclustering properties of laes at z~3-7. we find the spatial correlation lengthsro ~ 3-6 mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. finally, we estimate thefield-to-field variation ~ 30% for current volume and flux limited surveys,again consistent with observations. our results suggest that the starformation, and hence ly-alpha emission in laes is powered by the accretion ofnew material, and that the physical properties of laes do not evolvesignificantly over a wide range of redshifts. relating the accreted mass,rather than the total mass of halos, to the ly-alpha luminosity of laesnaturally gives rise to the duty cycle of laes.

1002.0635	the diversity of massive star outbursts i: observations of sn 2009ip,  ugc 2773 ot2009-1, and their progenitors	despite both being outbursts of luminous blue variables (lbvs), sn 2009ip andugc 2773 ot2009-1 have very different progenitors, spectra, circumstellarenvironments, and possibly physical mechanisms that generated the outbursts.  from pre-eruption hst images, we determine that sn 2009ip and ugc 2773ot2009-1 have initial masses of &gt;60 and &gt;25 m_sun, respectively. opticalspectroscopy shows that at peak sn 2009ip had a 10,000 k photosphere and itsspectrum was dominated by narrow h balmer emission, similar to classical lbvgiant outbursts, also known as "supernova impostors." the spectra of ugc 2773ot2009-1, which also have narrow h alpha emission, are dominated by a forest ofabsorption lines, similar to an f-type supergiant. blueshifted absorption linescorresponding to ejecta at a velocity of 2000 - 7000 km/s are present in laterspectra of sn 2009ip -- an unprecedented observation for lbv outbursts,indicating that the event was the result of a supersonic explosion, rather thana subsonic outburst. the velocity of the absorption lines increases between twoepochs, suggesting that there were two explosions in rapid succession. a rapidfading and rebrightening event concurrent with the onset of the high-velocityabsorption lines is consistent with the double-explosion model. a near-infraredexcess is present in the spectra and photometry of ugc 2773 ot2009-1 that isconsistent with ~2100 k dust emission. we compare the properties of these twoevents and place them in the context of other known massive star outbursts suchas eta car, ngc 300 ot2008-1, and sn 2008s. this qualitative analysis suggeststhat massive star outbursts have many physical differences which can manifestas the different observables seen in these two interesting objects.

0707.4182	a luminosity function of lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift 4.5	we present a catalog of 59 z=4.5 lyman alpha emitting galaxiesspectroscopically confirmed in a campaign of keck/deimos follow-up observationsto candidates selected in the large area lyman alpha (lala) narrow-band imagingsurvey. we targeted 97 candidates for spectroscopic follow-up; by accountingfor the variety of conditions under which we performed spectroscopy, weestimate a selection reliability of about 76%. together with our previoussample of keck/lris confirmations, the 59 sources confirmed herein bring thetotal catalog to 73 spectroscopically confirmed z=4.5 lyman alpha emittinggalaxies in the 0.7 square degrees covered by the lala imaging. as with thekeck/lris sample, we find that a non-negligible fraction of the confirmed lymanalpha lines have rest-frame equivalent widths (w_{rest}) which exceed themaximum predicted for normal stellar populations: 17% -- 31% (93% confidence)of the detected galaxies show w_{rest} &gt; 190 aa, and 12% -- 27% (90%confidence) show w_{rest} &gt; 240 aa. we construct a luminosity function of z=4.5lyman alpha emission lines for comparison to lyman alpha luminosity functionsspanning 3.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.6. we find no significant evidence for lyman alphaluminosity function evolution from z ~ 3 to z ~ 6. this result supports theconclusion that the intergalactic medium remains largely reionized from thelocal universe out to z=6.5. it is somewhat at odds with the pronounced drop inthe cosmic star formation rate density recently measured between z~3 and z~6 incontinuum-selected lyman-break galaxies, and therefore potentially sheds lighton the relationship between the two populations.

1006.1895	first spectroscopic measurements of [oiii] emission from lyman-alpha  selected field galaxies at z ~ 3.1	we present the first spectroscopic measurements of the [oiii] 5007 a line intwo z ~ 3.1 lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (laes) using the new near-infraredinstrument lucifer1 on the 8.4m large binocular telescope (lbt). we alsodescribe the optical imaging and spectroscopic observations used to identifythese lya emitting galaxies. using the [oiii] line we have measured accuratesystemic redshifts for these two galaxies, and discovered a velocity offsetbetween the [oiii] and ly-alpha lines in both, with the lya line peaking 342and 125 km/s redward of the systemic velocity. these velocity offsets implythat there are powerful outflows in high-redshift laes. they also ease thetransmission of lya photons through the interstellar medium and intergalacticmedium around the galaxies. by measuring these offsets directly, we can refineboth lya-based tests for reionization, and lya luminosity function measurementswhere the lya forest affects the blue wing of the line. our work also providesthe first direct constraints on the strength of the [oiii] line inhigh-redshift laes. we find [oiii] fluxes of 7 and 36 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2in two z ~ 3.1 laes. these lines are strong enough to dominate broad-band fluxmeasurements that include the line (in thiscase, k_s band photometry). spectralenergy distribution fits that do not account for the lines would thereforeoverestimate the 4000 a (and/or balmer) break strength in such galaxies, andhence also the ages and stellar masses of such high-z galaxies.

1006.3071	the luminosity function of lyman alpha emitters at redshift z=7.7	lyman alpha (lya) emission lines should be attenuated in a neutralintergalactic medium (igm). therefore the visibility of lya emitters at highredshifts can serve as a valuable probe of reionization at about the 50% level.we present an imaging search for z=7.7 lya emitting galaxies using anultra-narrowband filter (filter width= 9a) on the newfirm imager at the kittpeak national observatory. we found four candidate lya emitters in a surveyvolume of 1.4 x 10^4 mpc^3, with a line flux brighter than 6x10^-18 erg/cm^2/s(5 sigma in 2" aperture). we also performed a detailed monte-carlo simulationincorporating the instrumental effects to estimate the expected number of lyaemitters in our survey, and found that we should expect to detect one lyaemitter, assuming a non-evolving lya luminosity function (lf) between z=6.5 andz=7.7. even if one of the present candidates is spectroscopically confirmed asa z~8 lya emitter, it would indicate that there is no significant evolution ofthe lya lf from z=3.1 to z~8. while firm conclusions would need bothspectroscopic confirmations and larger surveys to boost the number counts ofgalaxies, we successfully demonstrate the feasibility of sensitivenear-infrared (1.06 um) narrow-band searches using custom filters designed toavoid the oh emission lines that make up most of the sky background.

1008.0634	hubble space telescope imaging of lyman alpha emission at z=4.4	we present the highest redshift detections of resolved lyman alpha emission,using hubble space telescope/acs f658n narrowband-imaging data taken inparallel with the wide field camera 3 early release science program in thegoods cdf-s. we detect lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 4.4 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes), more than doubling thesample of laes with resolved lyman alpha emission. comparing the lightdistribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowbandimages, we investigate the escape of lyman alpha photons at high redshift.while our data do not support a positional offset between the lyman alpha andrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two outof the three galaxies are significantly larger in lyman alpha than in therest-frame uv continuum. this result is confirmed when comparing object sizesin a stack of all objects in both bands. additionally, the narrowband fluxdetected with hst is significantly less than observed in similar filters fromthe ground. these results together imply that the lyman alpha emission is notstrictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. rather, the lymanalpha emission is more extended, with the missing hst flux likely existing in adiffuse outer halo. this suggests that the radiative transfer of lyman alphaphotons in high-redshift laes is complicated, with the interstellar-mediumgeometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at theseredshifts.

0708.2909	testing the topology of reionization	the central overlap phase of cosmological hydrogen reionization isfundamentally a change in the topology of ionized regions. before overlap,ionized bubbles grew in isolation. during overlap, they merge into apercolating ionized medium, which fills an ever-increasing volume andeventually replaces neutral gas throughout the intergalactic medium. overlapcan therefore be well studied using topological statistics, and in particularthe genus number of the neutral-ionized interface. the most promisingobservational tools for applying such tests are (a) lyman alpha galaxies, and(b) 21 cm tomography. lyman alpha galaxies will be detected whenever theyinhabit bubbles larger than 1 physical mpc, and their presence can therefore beused to map such bubbles. such large bubbles are expected during the overlapphase, and moreover, each one should contain a few detectably bright lymanalpha galaxies. the 21cm line in principle affords better spatial resolution,but the required sensitivity and foreground subtraction may be an issue.upcoming lyman alpha surveys in the near-infrared could thus provide our firstlook at the topology of reionization.

0708.4226	effects of dust geometry in lyman alpha galaxies at z = 4.4	equivalent widths (ews) observed in high-redshift lyman alpha galaxies couldbe stronger than the ew intrinsic to the stellar population if dust is presentresiding in clumps in the inter-stellar medium (ism). in this scenario,continuum photons could be extinguished while the lyman alpha photons would beresonantly scattered by the clumps, eventually escaping the galaxy. weinvestigate this radiative transfer scenario with a new sample of six lymanalpha galaxy candidates in the goods cdf-s, selected at z = 4.4 withground-based narrow-band imaging obtained at ctio. grism spectra from the hstpears survey confirm that three objects are at z = 4.4, and that another objectcontains an active galactic nuclei (agn). if we assume the other five (non-agn)objects are at z = 4.4, they have rest-frame ews from 47 -- 190 a. we presentresults of stellar population studies of these objects, constraining theirrest-frame uv with hst and their rest-frame optical with spitzer. out of thefour objects which we analyzed, three objects were best-fit to contain stellarpopulations with ages on the order of 1 myr and stellar masses from 3 - 10 x10^8 solar masses, with dust in the amount of a_1200 = 0.9 - 1.8 residing in aquasi-homogeneous distribution. however, one object (with a rest ew ~ 150 a)was best fit by an 800 myr, 6.6 x 10^9 solar mass stellar population with asmaller amount of dust (a_1200 = 0.4) attenuating the continuum only. in thisobject, the ew was enhanced ~ 50% due to this dust. this suggests that large ewlyman alpha galaxies are a diverse population. preferential extinction of thecontinuum in a clumpy ism deserves further investigation as a possible cause ofthe overabundance of large-ew objects that have been seen in narrow-bandsurveys in recent years.

1012.4010	dust extinction and metallicities of star-forming lyman alpha emitting  galaxies at low redshift	we present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of 12galex-discovered star-forming lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 0.3.we measure the emission line fluxes from these galaxies by fitting theirobserved spectra to stellar population models in order to correct forunderlying stellar absorption. we revisit earlier stellar population modelfitting results, finding that excluding now-known agns lowers the typicalstellar population age and stellar mass of this sample to ~ 300 myr and ~ 4 x10^9 msol, respectively. we calculate their dust extinction using the balmerdecrement, and find a typical visual attenuation of av ~ 0.3 mag, similar tothat seen in many high-redshift laes. comparing the ratio of lyalpha/halpha andthe lyman alpha equivalent widths to the measured dust extinction, we find thatthe isms in these objects appear to be neither enhancing nor seriouslyattenuating the lyman alpha equivalent widths, as would be the case in aquasi-clumpy ism. lastly, we perform a detailed analysis of the gas-phasemetallicities of these galaxies, and we find that most galaxies in our samplehave z &lt; 0.4 zsol. we find that at a fixed stellar mass, these low-redshift laeanalogs are offset by ~ 0.6 dex lower in metallicity from the general galaxypopulation at similar redshifts based on the local mass-metallicityrelationship. this implies that galaxies with lyman alpha in emission may besystematically more metal poor than star-forming galaxies at the same stellarmass and redshift, similar to preliminary results at z ~ 2.

1106.2811	x-ray constraints on the lyman-alpha escape fraction	we have coadded x-ray flux of all known lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the 4msec chandra deep field south (cdf-s) region, to place sensitive upper limitson the average unobscured star-formation rate (sfr_x) in these galaxies. a verysmall fraction of lyman-alpha galaxies in the field are individually detectedin the x-rays, implying a low fraction of agn activity. after excluding the fewx-ray detected laes, we stack the undetected laes located in the 4 ms cdf-sdata and 250 ks extended cdf-s (ecdfs) data, and compute a 1-\sigma upper limiton sfr_x &lt; 14, 28, 28, 140, 440, 880 m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ for laes located at z= 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.5, 5.7 and 6.5, respectively. the upper limit of sfr_x inlaes can be then be compared to sfr$_{ly\alpha}$ derived from lyman-alpha lineand thus can constrain on the lyman-alpha escape fraction($f^{esc}_{ly\alpha}$). we derive a lower limit on f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 14%(84 % confidence level, 1-\sigma lower limit) for laes at redshift z ~ 2.1 andz ~ 3.1-3.2. at z &gt; 4, the current lae samples are not of sufficient size toconstrain sfr_x well. by averaging all the laes at z&gt; 2, the x-raynon-detection constrains f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 17% (84 % confidence level,1-\sigma lower limit), and rejects f(lyman-alpha escape) &lt; 5.7% at the 99.87%confidence level from 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.5.

1106.2816	sizing up lyman-alpha and lyman break galaxies	we show that populations of high redshift galaxies grow more luminous as theygrow in linear size. this is because the brightness per unit area has adistinct upper limit due to the self-regulating nature of star-formation. as acorollary, we show that the observed increase in characteristic luminosity oflyman break galaxies (l*) with time can be explained by their increase in size,which scales as 1/h(z). in contrast, lyman-alpha selected galaxies have acharacteristic, constant, small size between redshift z=2.25 and 6.5. coupledwith a characteristic surface brightness, this can explain their non-evolvingultraviolet continuum luminosity function. this compact physical size seems tobe a critical determining factor in whether a galaxy will show lyman-alphaemission. we base these conclusions on new size measurements for a sample ofabout 170 lyman-alpha selected galaxies with hubble space telescope broad-bandimaging, over the redshift range 2.25 &lt; z &lt; 6. we combine these with a similarnumber of lyman-alpha selected galaxies with half-light radii from theliterature, and derive surface brightnesses for the entire combined sample.

1107.2648	predicting the merger fraction of lyman alpha emitters from redshift z~3  to z~7	rapid mass assembly, likely from mergers or smooth accretion, has beenpredicted to play a vital role in star-formation in high-redshift lyman-alpha(lya) emitters. here we predict the major merger, minor merger, and smoothaccreting lya emitter fraction from z~3 to z~7 using a large dark mattersimulation, and a simple physical model that is successful in reproducing manyobservations over this large redshift range. the central tenet of this model,different from many of the earlier models, is that the star-formation in lyaemitters is proportional to the mass accretion rate rather than the total halomass. we find that at z~3, nearly 35% of the lya emitters accrete their massthrough major (3:1) mergers, and this fraction increases to about 50% at z~7.this imply that the star-formation in a large fraction of high-redshift lyaemitters is driven by mergers. while there is discrepancy between the modelpredictions and observed merger fractions, some of this difference (~15%) canbe attributed to the mass-ratio used to define a merger in the simulation. wepredict that future, deeper observations which use a 3:1 definition of majormergers will find &gt;30% major merger fraction of lya emitters at redshifts &gt;3.

1301.3140	the dynamical masses, densities, and star formation scaling relations of  lyman alpha galaxies	we present the first dynamical mass measurements for lyman alpha galaxies athigh redshift, based on velocity dispersion measurements from rest-frameoptical emission lines and size measurements from hst imaging, for a sample ofnine galaxies drawn from four surveys. these measurements enable us to studythe nature of lyman alpha galaxies in the context of galaxy scaling relations.the resulting dynamical masses range from 1e9 to 1e10 solar masses. we also fitstellar population models to our sample, and use them to plot the lyman alphasample on a stellar mass vs. line width relation. overall, the lyman alphagalaxies follow well the scaling relation established by observing star forminggalaxies at lower redshift (and without regard for lyman alpha emission),though in 1/3 of the lyman alpha galaxies, lower-mass fits are also acceptable.in all cases, the dynamical masses agree with established stellarmass-linewidthrelation. using the dynamical masses as an upper limit on gas mass, we showthat lyman alpha galaxies resemble starbursts (rather than "normal" galaxies)in the relation between gas mass surface density and star formation activity,in spite of relatively modest star formation rates. finally, we examine themass densities of these galaxies, and show that their future evolution likelyrequires dissipational ("wet") merging. in short, we find that lyman alphagalaxies are low mass cousins of larger starbursts.

1310.4835	ly{\alpha} equivalent width distribution of ly{\alpha} emitting galaxies  at redshift z $\sim$ 4.5	ly{\alpha} line ews provide important clues to the physical nature of highredshift laes. however, measuring the ly{\alpha} ew distribution of high-znarrowband selected laes can be hard because many sources do not have broadbandphotometry. we investigate the possible biases in measuring the intrinsicly{\alpha} ew distribution for a lae sample at z $\sim$ 4.5 in the extendedcdfs. only weak malmquist-type bias in both the intrinsic ly{\alpha} luminosityfunction and the ly{\alpha} ew distribution were found. however, the observedew distribution is severely biased if one only considers laes with detectionsin the continuum. taking the broadband non-detections into account requiresfitting the distribution of the broadband-to-narrowband ratio, which then givesa larger ew distribution scale length. assuming an exponential form of theintrinsic ly{\alpha} ew distribution dn/dew = n exp(-ew/w$_0$), we obtain w$_0$= 167+/-44{\aa} (uncorrected for igm absorption of ly{\alpha}). we discuss thelikely range of igm absorption effects in light of recent measurements ofly{\alpha} line profiles and velocity offsets. our data are consistent withly{\alpha} ew being independent of uv luminosity (i.e., we do not see evidencefor the "ando" effect). our simulations also imply that broad-band imagesshould be 0.5-1 magnitude deeper than narrowband images for an effective andreasonably complete lae survey. comparing with consistent measurements at otherredshifts, we see a strong evolution in ly{\alpha} ew distribution withredshift which goes as a power-law form of w$_0$ $\prop$(1+z)$^${\xi}, with{\xi} = 1.1$\pm$0.1 (0.6$\pm$0.1) if no igm corrections are applied to thely{\alpha} line; or {\xi} = 1.7$\pm$0.1 (1.2$\pm$0.1) after applying a maximaligm-absorption correction to ly{\alpha} line) for an exponential (a gaussian)ew distribution from z = 0.3 to 6.5.

1401.7785	a z ~ 5.7 ly{\alpha} emission line with an ultra broad red wing	using ly{\alpha} emission line as a tracer of high redshift star forminggalaxies, hundreds of ly{\alpha} emission line galaxies (laes) at z &gt; 5 havebeen detected. these laes are considered to be low mass young galaxies,critical to the reionization of the universe and the metal enrichment ofcircumgalactic medium (cgm) and intergalactic medium (igm). it is assumed thatoutflows in laes can help ionizing photons and ly{\alpha} photons escape out ofgalaxies. however we still know little about the outflows in high redshiftslaes due to observational difficulties, especially at redshift &gt; 5. models ofly{\alpha} radiative transfer predict asymmetric ly{\alpha} line profiles withbroad red wing in laes with outflows. here we report a z ~ 5.7 ly{\alpha}emission line with a broad red wing extending to &gt; 1000 km/s relative to thepeak of ly{\alpha} line, which has been detected in only a couple of z &gt; 5 laestill now. if the broad red wing is ascribed to gas outflow instead of agnactivity, the outflow velocity could be larger than the escape velocity (~ 500km/s) of typical halo mass of z ~ 5.7 laes, being consistent with the picturethat outflows in laes disperse metals to cgm and igm.

astro-ph;0003465	first results from the large area lyman alpha survey	we report on a new survey for z=4.5 lyman alpha sources, the large area lymanalpha (lala) survey. our survey achieves an unprecedented combination of volumeand sensitivity by using narrow-band filters on the new 8192x8192 pixel ccdmosaic camera at the 4 meter mayall telescope of kitt peak nationalobservatory.  well-detected sources with flux and equivalent width matching known highredshift lyman alpha galaxies (i.e., observed equivalent width above 80angstroms and line+continuum flux between 2.6e-17 and 5.2e-17 erg/cm^2/sec inan 80 angstrom filter) have an observed surface density corresponding to 11000+- 700 per square degree per unit redshift at z=4.5. spatial variation in thissurface density is apparent on comparison between counts in 6561 and 6730angstrom filters.  early spectroscopic followup results from the keck telescope included threesources meeting our criteria for good lyman alpha candidates. of these, one isconfirmed as a z=4.52 source, while another remains consistent with eitherz=4.55 or z=0.81. we infer that 30 to 50% of our good candidates are bona fidelyman alpha emitters, implying a net density of about 4000 lyman alpha galaxiesper square degree per unit redshift.

astro-ph;0004057	the near infrared and multiwavelength afterglow of grb 000301c	we present near-infrared observations of the counterpart of grb 000301c. thek' filter (2.1 micron) light curve shows a well-sampled break in the decayslope at t=3.5 days post-burst. the early time slope is very shallow (~ -0.1),while the late time slope is steep (-2.2). comparison with the optical (r band)light curve shows marginally significant differences, especially in the earlytime decay slope (which is steeper in the optical) and the break time (whichoccurs later in the optical). this is contrary to the general expectation thatlight curve breaks should either be achromatic (e.g., for breaks due tocollimation effects) or should occur later at longer wavelengths (for mostother breaks). the observed color variations might be intrinsic to theafterglow, or might indicate systematic errors of &gt; 0.08 magnitude in allfluxes. even if the break is achromatic, we argue that its sharpness posesdifficulties for explanations that depend on collimated ejecta. the r lightcurve shows further signs of fairly rapid variability (a bump, steep drop, andplateau) that are not apparent in the k' light curve. in addition, by combiningthe ir-optical-uv data with millimeter and radio fluxes, we are able toconstrain the locations of the self-absorption break and cooling break and toinfer the location of the spectral peak at t=3 days: f_nu = 3.4 mjy at nu=1e12hz. using the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution, we are able toconstrain the blast wave energy, which was e &gt; 3e53 erg if the explosion wasisotropic. this implies a maximum gamma ray production efficiency of ~ 0.15 forgrb 000301c.

astro-ph;0008461	snapshot identification of gamma ray burst optical afterglows	gamma ray burst afterglows can be identified in single epoch observationsusing three or more optical filters. this method relies on color measurementsto distinguish the power law spectrum of an afterglow from the curved spectraof stars. observations in a fourth filter will further distinguish betweenafterglows and most galaxies up to redshifts z ~ 1. many afterglows can also beidentified with fewer filters using ultraviolet excess, infrared excess, orlyman break techniques. by allowing faster identification of gamma ray burstafterglows, these color methods will increase the fraction of bursts for whichoptical spectroscopy and other narrow-field observations can be obtained.because quasar colors can match those of afterglows, the maximum error box sizewhere an unambiguous identification can be expected is set by the flux limit ofthe afterglow search and the quasar number-flux relation. for currently typicalerror boxes (10 -- 100 square arcminutes), little contamination is expected atmagnitudes r &lt; 21.5 +- 0.5. archival data demonstrates that the afterglow ofgrb 000301c could have been identified using this method. in addition tofinding gamma ray burst counterparts, this method will have applications in``orphan afterglow'' searches used to constrain gamma ray burst collimation.

astro-ph;0104294	the large area lyman alpha survey	the lyman-$\alpha$ line is expected to be strong in the presence of activestar formation and the absence of dust, making it a good tool for findingchemically primitive galaxies in the early universe. we report on a new surveyfor high redshift lyman-$\alpha$ sources, the large area lyman alpha (lala)survey. our survey achieves an unprecedented combination of volume andsensitivity by using narrow-band filters on the new $8192^2$ pixel ccd mosaiccamera at the 4 meter mayall telescope of kitt peak national observatory.  well-detected sources with flux and equivalent width matching known highredshift lyman-$\alpha$ galaxies have an observed surface density correspondingto $11000 \pm 700$ per square degree per unit redshift at $z=4.5$. earlyspectroscopic followup from the keck telescope suggests that $\sim 1/3$ ofthese are actually at $z\approx 4.5$, and has confirmed five $z &gt; 4$lyman-$\alpha$ emitters so far. combining our photometric survey withspectroscopic results, we estimate a net density of $\sim 4000 $ lyman-$\alpha$emitters per square degree per unit redshift at $z\approx 4.5$. the starformation rate density (estimated both from uv continuum and from lineemission) is comparable to that of the lyman break galaxy population withinpresent uncertainties. the most extreme lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in our samplehave rest frame equivalent widths $&gt; 100\aa$, consistent with the expectationsfor the first burst of star formation in a primitive, dust-free galaxy.

astro-ph;0106343	x-ray destruction of dust along the line of sight to gamma-ray bursts	we show that if all gamma-ray bursts emit x-rays in a way similar to thoseobserved by bepposax, much of the extinction along the line of sight in thehost galaxy of the burst can be destroyed. two mechanisms are principallyresponsible for dust destruction: grain heating and grain charging. the latter,which can lead to electrostatic stresses greater than the tensile strength ofthe grains, is often the more important. grains may regularly be destroyed atdistances as large as 100 parsecs. this dust destruction can permit us to seethe uv/optical afterglow even when the burst is embedded deep within ahighly-obscured region. because the destruction rate depends on graincomposition and size, it may be possible to observe the amount andwavelength-dependence of extinction change during the course of the burst andfirst few minutes of the afterglow. it may also be possible to detectinterstellar absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum that would not existbut for the return of heavy elements to the gas phase.

astro-ph;0110280	lyman alpha emitters at redshift z=5.7	lyman alpha galaxies at high redshifts offer a powerful probe of both theformation of galaxies and the reionization of the intergalactic medium. lymanalpha line emission is an efficient tool for identifying young galaxies at highredshift, because it is strong in systems with young stars and little or nodust-- properties expected in galaxies undergoing their first burst ofstar-formation. lyman alpha galaxies also provide a robust test of thereionization epoch that is independent of gunn-peterson trough observations inquasar spectra and is better able to distinguish line center optical depthstau=5 from tau=10^5. this is because neutral gas scatters lyman alpha photons,dramatically ``blurring'' images of lyman alpha galaxies embedded in a neutralintergalactic medium and rendering them undetectable.  we present a photometrically selected sample of z=5.7 lyman alpha emittersderived from the large area lyman alpha survey. the presence of theselow-luminosity lyman alpha sources at z=5.7 immediately implies that thereionization redshift was &gt; 5.7. comparing these objects to our earlier z=4.5sample, we find that the number of z=5.7 emitters at fixed line luminositymarginally exceeds the no-evolution expectation, but falls well short ofpublished model predictions. the equivalent width distribution is similar atthe two redshifts. the large equivalent widths of the lyman alpha line indicateyoung galaxies undergoing their first star formation.

astro-ph;0111030	gamma ray bursts as probes of the first stars	the redshift where the first stars formed is an important and unknownmilestone in cosmological structure formation. the evidence linking gamma raybursts (grbs) with star formation activity implies that the first grbs occurredshortly after the first stars formed. gamma ray bursts and their afterglows maythus offer a unique probe of this epoch, because they are bright from gamma rayto radio wavelengths and should be observable to very high redshift. indeed,our ongoing near-ir followup programs already have the potential to detectbursts at redshift z ~ 10. in these proceedings, we discuss two distinct waysof using grbs to probe the earliest star formation. first, direct grb countsmay be used as a proxy for star formation rate measurements. second, highenergy cutoffs in the gev spectra of gamma ray bursts due to pair productionwith high redshift optical and ultraviolet background photons containinformation on early star formation history. the second method isobservationally more demanding, but also more rewarding, because each observedpair creation cutoff in a high redshift grb spectrum will tell us about theintegrated star formation history prior to the grb redshift.

astro-ph;0209544	spectroscopic confirmation of three redshift 5.7 lyman-alpha emitters  from the large area lyman alpha survey	narrow-band searches for lyman alpha emission are an efficient way ofidentifying star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. we present keck telescopespectra confirming redshifts z = 5.7 for three objects discovered in the largearea lyman alpha (lala) survey at kitt peak national observatory.  all three spectra show strong, narrow emission lines with the asymmetricprofile that is characteristically produced in high redshift lyman alphaemitters by preferential hi absorption in the blue wing of the line. theseobjects are undetected in deep bw, v, r, and 6600a narrow-band images from thenoao deep wide-field survey and from lala, as expected from lyman break andlyman alpha forest absorption at redshift z = 5.7. all three objects show largeequivalent widths (&gt;= 150a in the rest-frame), suggesting at least one of thefollowing: a top-heavy initial mass function, very low stellar metallicity, orthe presence of an active nucleus. we consider the case for an active nucleusto be weak in all three objects due to the limited width of the lyman alphaemission line (&lt; 500 km/s) and the absence of any other indicator of quasaractivity.  the three confirmed high redshift objects were among four spectroscopicallyobserved targets drawn from the sample of 18 candidates presented by rhoads andmalhotra (2001). thus, these spectra support the lyman alpha emitter populationstatistics from our earlier photometric study, which imply little evolution innumber density from z=5.7 to z=4.5 and provide strong evidence that thereionization redshift is greater than 5.7.

astro-ph;0301011	dirty fireballs and orphan afterglows: a tale of two transients	orphan afterglows are transient events that are produced by cosmologicalfireballs and resemble gamma ray burst (grb) afterglows, yet are notaccompanied by gamma rays. such transients may be produced by jetlike grbsobserved off-axis, and therefore hold great promise as a test of gamma rayburst collimation. however, orphans may also be produced by "dirty fireballs,"i.e., cosmological fireballs whose ejecta carry too many baryons to produce agrb.  a well designed orphan afterglow search can distinguish between on-axis dirtyfireballs and off-axis orphans in at least two ways. first, by combiningreal-time triggers from a wide area, multicolor search with deeper followupobservations, the light curve can be tracked for a time exceeding 2*t_1, wheret_1 is the age of the event at first observation. such a light curve allowssimultaneous fits to t_1 and the time decay slope alpha with sufficientaccuracy to distinguish on- and off-axis orphans. second, radio followup oforphan afterglows will show whether the radio flux is falling in time (asexpected for an off-axis orphan) or not (as expected for on-axis events).additional tests involving multi-band monitoring of the cooling,self-absorption, and f_nu peak frequencies are also possible, although muchmore observationally demanding.  a further complication in orphan searches is that dirty fireballs are likelyto also be collimated, and that collimated dirty fireballs viewed off-axis willindividually be practically indistinguishable from off-axis grb afterglows. torecognize their presence, orphan afterglow surveys must be sufficientlyextensive to catch at least some dirty fireballs on-axis.

astro-ph;9610162	a robust determination of the time delay in 0957+561a,b and a  measurement of the global value of hubble's constant	photometric monitoring of the gravitational lens system 0957+561a,b in the gand r bands with the apache point observatory (apo) 3.5 m telescope during 1996shows a sharp g band event in the trailing (b) image light curve at the precisetime predicted from the observation of an event during 1995 in the leading (a)image with a delay of 415 days. this success confirms the "short delay," andthe lack of any feature at a delay near 540 days rejects the "long delay" forthis system, resolving a long-standing controversy. a series of statisticalanalyses of our light curve data yield a best fit delay of 417 +/- 3 days (95%confidence interval). recent improvements in the modeling of the lens system(consisting of a galaxy and cluster) allow us to derive a value of the global(at z = 0.36) value of hubble's constant h_0 using refsdal's method, a simpleand direct distance determination based on securely understood physics andgeometry. the result is h_0 = 63 +/- 12 km/s/mpc (for omega = 1) where this 95%confidence interval is dominated by remaining lens model uncertainties.

astro-ph;9610233	through a lens darkly: evidence for dusty gravitational lenses	foreground galaxies that amplify the light from background quasars may alsodim that light if the galaxies contain enough dust. extinction by dust inlenses could hide the large number of lensed systems predicted for a flatuniverse with a large value of the cosmological constant $\lambda$. we look forone signature of dust, namely reddening, by examining optical-infrared colorsof gravitationally lensed images of quasars. we find that the lensed systemsidentified in radio and infrared searches have redder optical-ir colors thanoptically selected ones. this could be due to a bias against selecting reddened(hence extincted) quasars in the optical surveys, or due to the differences inthe intrinsic colors of optical and radio quasars. comparison of theradio-selected lensed and unlensed quasars shows that the lensed ones haveredder colors. we therefore conclude that at least part of the color differencebetween the two lens samples is due to dust.  from the color difference between lensed and unlensed radio quasars (andassuming galactic extinction law) we can reconcile a large cosmologicalconstant ($\lambda=0.9$) with the number of lensed systems observed in fluxlimited optical surveys. these results substantially weaken the strongestconstraint on cosmological scenarios that invoke a non-zero cosmologicalconstant to explain age discrepancy problems, satisfy predictions ofinflationary models of the early universe and play a role in large scalestructure formation models. they also raise the prospect of using gravitationallenses to study the interstellar medium in high redshift galaxies.

astro-ph;9702030	dynamics of ``small galaxies'' in the hubble deep field	we have previously found in the hubble deep field a significant angularcorrelation of faint, high color-redshift objects on scales below onearcsecond, or several kiloparsecs in metric size. we examine the correlationand nearest neighbor statistics to conclude that 38% of these objects in thehdf have a companion within one arcsecond, three times the number expected in arandom distribution with the same number of objects. we examine three dynamicalscenarios for these object multiplets: 1) the objects are star-forming regionswithin normal galaxies, whose disks have been relatively dimmed by k-correctionand surface brightness dimming; 2) they are fragments merging into largegalaxies; 3) they are satellites accreting onto normal l_* galaxies. we findthat hypothesis 1 is most tenable. first, large galaxies in the process of amerger formation would have accumulated too much mass in their centers (5e12m_sun inside 2 kpc) to correspond to present day objects. second, accretion bydynamical friction occurs with a predictable density vs. radius slope, not seenamong the faint hdf objects. since the dynamical friction time is roughly (1gyr), a steady-state should have been reached by redshift z &lt; 5. star-formingregions within galaxies clearly present no dynamical problems. since largespirals would still appear as such in the hdf, we favor a scenario in which thefaint compact sources in the hdf are giant starforming regions within smallnormal galaxies, such as magellanic irregulars. finally we checked thatreduction in mass-to-light from induced star-formation cannot alone explain theluminosity overdensity.

astro-ph;9705163	how to tell a jet from a balloon: a proposed test for beaming in gamma  ray bursts	if gamma ray bursts are highly collimated, the energy requirements of eachevent may be reduced by several (~ 4-6) orders of magnitude, and the event rateincreased correspondingly. extreme conditions in gamma ray bursters lead tohighly relativistic motions (bulk lorentz factors gamma &gt; 100). this results instrong forward beaming of the emitted radiation in the observer's rest frame.thus, all information on gamma ray bursts comes from those ejecta emitted in anarrow cone (opening angle 1/gamma) pointing towards the observer. we are atpresent ignorant of whether there are ejecta outside that cone or not.  the recent detection of longer wavelength transients following gamma raybursts allows an empirical test of whether gamma ray bursts are collimated jetsor spherical fireballs. the bulk lorentz factor of the burst ejecta willdecrease with time after the event, as the ejecta sweep up the surroundingmedium. thus, radiation from the ejecta is beamed into an ever increasing solidangle as the burst remnant evolves. it follows that if gamma ray bursts arehighly collimated, many more optical and radio transients should be observedwithout associated gamma rays than with them. published supernova searches maycontain enough data to test the most extreme models of gamma ray beaming. weclose with a brief discussion of other possible consequences of beaming,including its effect on the evolution of burst remnants.

astro-ph;9710189	young red supergiants and the near infrared light appearance of disk  galaxies	disk galaxies often show prominent nonaxisymmetric features at near-infraredwavelengths. such features may indicate variations in the surface density ofstellar mass, contributions from young red supergiants in star forming regions,or substantial dust obscuration. to distinguish among these possibilities, wehave searched for spatial variations in the 2.3 micron photometric co indexwithin the disks of three nearby galaxies (ngc 278, ngc 2649, &amp; ngc 5713). thisindex measures the strength of the absorption bands of molecular co in stellaratmospheres, and is strong in cool, low surface-gravity stars, reaching thelargest values for red supergiants. we observe significant spatial co indexvariations in two galaxies (ngc 278 &amp; ngc 5713), indicating that the dominantstellar population in the near-infrared is not everywhere the same. central coindex peaks are present in two galaxies; these could be due to eithermetallicity gradients or recent star formation activity. in addition,significant azimuthal co index variations are seen in ngc 278. because strongazimuthal metallicity gradients are physically implausible in disk galaxies,these features are most naturally explained by the presence of a young stellarpopulation. the fraction of 2 micron light due to young stellar populations instar forming regions can be calculated from our data. overall, young stellarpopulations can contribute ~3% of a (normal) galaxy's near infrared flux.locally, this fraction may rise to ~33%. thus, young stars do not dominate thetotal near infrared flux, but can be locally dominant in star forming regions,and can bias estimates of spiral arm amplitude or other nonaxisymmetricstructures in galaxies' mass distributions.

astro-ph;9712042	afterglows as diagnostics of gamma ray burst beaming	if gamma ray bursts are highly collimated, radiating into only a smallfraction of the sky, the energy requirements of each event may be reduced byseveral (up to 4 - 6) orders of magnitude, and the event rate increasedcorrespondingly. the large lorentz factors (gamma &gt; 100) inferred from grbspectra imply relativistic beaming of the gamma rays into an angle 1/gamma. weare at present ignorant of whether there are ejecta outside this narrow cone.  afterglows allow empirical tests of whether grbs are well-collimated jets orspherical fireballs. the bulk lorentz factor decreases and radiation is beamedinto an ever increasing solid angle as the burst remnant expands. it followsthat if gamma ray bursts are highly collimated, many more optical and radiotransients should be observed without associated gamma rays than with them.  in addition, a burst whose ejecta are beamed into angle zeta undergoes aqualitative change in evolution when gamma &lt; 1/zeta: before this, gamma ~r^{-3/2}, while afterwards, gamma decays exponentially with r. this changeresults in a potentially observable break in the afterglow light curve.  successful application of either test would eliminate the largest remaininguncertainty in the energy requirements and space density of gamma ray bursters.

astro-ph;9903399	the dynamics and light curves of beamed gamma ray burst afterglows	the energy requirements of gamma ray bursts have in past been poorlyconstrained because of three major uncertainties: the distances to bursts, thedegree of burst beaming, and the efficiency of gamma ray production. the firstof these has been resolved, with both indirect evidence (the distribution ofbursts in flux and position) and direct evidence (redshifted absorptionfeatures in the afterglow spectrum of grb 970508) pointing to cosmologicaldistances. we now wish to address the second uncertainty. afterglows allow astatistical test of beaming, described in an earlier paper. in this paper, wemodify a standard fireball afterglow model to explore the effects of beaming onburst remnant dynamics and afterglow emission. if the burst ejecta are beamedinto angle zeta, the burst remnant's evolution changes qualitatively once itsbulk lorentz factor gamma &lt; 1/zeta: before this, gamma declines as a power lawof radius, while afterwards, it declines exponentially. this change results ina broken power law light curve whose late-time decay is faster than expectedfor a purely spherical geometry. these predictions disagree with afterglowobservations of grb 970508. we explored several variations on our model, butnone seems able to change this result. we therefore suggest that this burst isunlikely to have been highly beamed, and that its energy requirements were nearthose of isotropic models. more recent afterglows may offer the first practicalapplications for our beamed models.

0706.0893	clustering of lyman alpha emitters at z ~ 4.5	we present the clustering properties of 151 lyman alpha emitting galaxies atz ~ 4.5 selected from the large area lyman alpha (lala) survey. our catalogcovers an area of 36' x 36' observed with five narrowband filters. we assumethat the angular correlation function w(theta) is well represented by a powerlaw a_w = theta^(-beta) with slope beta = 0.8, and we find a_w = 6.73 +/- 1.80.we then calculate the correlation length r_0 of the real-space two-pointcorrelation function xi(r) = (r/r_0)^(-1.8) from a_w through the limbertransformation, assuming a flat, lambda-dominated universe. neglectingcontamination, we find r_0 = 3.20 +/- 0.42 mpc/h. taking into account apossible 28% contamination by randomly distributed sources, we find r_0 = 4.61+/- 0.6 mpc/h. we compare these results with the expectations for theclustering of dark matter halos at this redshift in a cold dark matter model,and find that the measured clustering strength can be reproduced if theseobjects reside in halos with a minimum mass of 1-2 times 10^11 solar masses/h.our estimated correlation length implies a bias of b ~ 3.7, similar to that oflyman-break galaxies (lbg) at z ~ 3.8-4.9. however, lyman alpha emitters are afactor of ~ 2-16 rarer than lbgs with a similar bias value and implied hosthalo mass. therefore, one plausible scenario seems to be that lyman alphaemitters occupy host halos of roughly the same mass as lbgs, but shine with arelatively low duty cycle of 6-50%.

0812.0592	evolution of lyman alpha galaxies: stellar populations at z ~ 0.3	we present the results of a stellar population analysis of 30 lyman alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 0.3, previously discovered with the galaxyevolution explorer (galex). with a few exceptions, we can accurately fit modelspectral energy distributions to these objects, representing the first timethis has been done for a large sample of laes at z &lt; 3, a gap of ~ 8 gyr in thehistory of the universe. from the 26/30 laes which we can fit, we find an ageand stellar mass range of 200 myr - 10 gyr and 10^9 - 10^11 msol, respectively.these objects thus appear to be significantly older and more massive than laesat high-redshift. we also find that these laes show a mild trend towards highermetallicity than those at high redshift, as well as a tighter range of dustattenuation and interstellar medium geometry. these results suggest thatlow-redshift laes have evolved significantly from those at high redshift.
