0907.3994	modelling the galactic magnetic field on the plane in 2d	we present a method for parametric modelling of the physical components ofthe galaxy's magnetised interstellar medium, simulating the observables, andmapping out the likelihood space using a markov chain monte-carlo analysis. wethen demonstrate it using total and polarised synchrotron emission data as wellas rotation measures of extragalactic sources. with these three datasets, wedefine and study three components of the magnetic field: the large-scalecoherent field, the small-scale isotropic random field, and the ordered field.in this first paper, we use only data along the galactic plane and test asimple 2d logarithmic spiral model for the magnetic field that includes acompression and a shearing of the random component giving rise to an orderedcomponent. we demonstrate with simulations that the method can indeed constrainmultiple parameters yielding measures of, for example, the ratios of themagnetic field components. though subject to uncertainties in thermal andcosmic ray electron densities and depending on our particular modelparametrisation, our preliminary analysis shows that the coherent component isa small fraction of the total magnetic field and that an ordered componentcomparable in strength to the isotropic random component is required to explainthe polarisation fraction of synchrotron emission. we outline further work toextend this type of analysis to study the magnetic spiral arm structure, thedetails of the turbulence as well as the 3d structure of the magnetic field.

1001.2657	planck pre-launch status: the planck-lfi programme	this paper provides an overview of the low frequency instrument (lfi)programme within the esa planck mission. the lfi instrument has been developedto produce high precision maps of the microwave sky at frequencies in the range27-77 ghz, below the peak of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiationspectrum. the scientific goals are described, ranging from fundamentalcosmology to galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. the instrument design anddevelopment are outlined, together with the model philosophy and testingstrategy. the instrument is presented in the context of the planck mission. thelfi approach to ground and inflight calibration is described. we also describethe lfi ground segment. we present the results of a number of testsdemonstrating the capability of the lfi data processing centre (dpc) toproperly reduce and analyse lfi flight data, from telemetry information tocalibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (intemperature and polarization), component emission maps (cmb and diffuseforegrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the early releasecompact source catalogue and the final compact source catalogue). theorganization of the lfi consortium is briefly presented as well as the role ofthe core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. all tests carriedout on the lfi flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of theinstrument and its various subunits. the data analysis pipeline has been testedand its main steps verified. in the first three months after launch, thecommissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will becompleted, after which planck will begin its operational life, in which lfiwill have an integral part.

1001.3321	planck pre-launch status: design and description of the low frequency  instrument	in this paper we present the low frequency instrument (lfi), designed anddeveloped as part of the planck space mission, the esa program dedicated toprecision imaging of the cosmic microwave background (cmb). planck-lfi willobserve the full sky in intensity and polarisation in three frequency bandscentred at 30, 44 and 70 ghz, while higher frequencies (100-850 ghz) will becovered by the hfi instrument. the lfi is an array of microwave radiometersbased on state-of-the-art indium phosphide cryogenic hemt amplifiersimplemented in a differential system using blackbody loads as referencesignals. the front-end is cooled to 20k for optimal sensitivity and thereference loads are cooled to 4k to minimise low frequency noise. we provide anoverview of the lfi, discuss the leading scientific requirements and describethe design solutions adopted for the various hardware subsystems. the maindrivers of the radiometric, optical and thermal design are discussed, includingthe stringent requirements on sensitivity, stability, and rejection ofsystematic effects. further details on the key instrument units and the resultsof ground calibration are provided in a set of companion papers.

1101.2041	planck early results. vii. the early release compact source catalog	(abridged) a brief description of the methodology of construction, contentsand usage of the planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc),including the early cold cores (ecc) and the early sunyaev-zeldovich (esz)cluster catalogue is provided. the catalogue is based on data that consist ofmapping the entire sky once and 60% of the sky a second time by planck, therebycomprising the first high sensitivity radio/submillimetre observations of theentire sky. a monte-carlo algorithm based on the injection and extraction ofartificial sources into the planck maps was implemented to select reliablesources among all extracted candidates such that the cumulative reliability ofthe catalogue is &gt;=90%. the 10sigma photometric flux density limit of thecatalogue at |b|&gt;30 deg is 0.49, 1.0, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33, 0.28, 0.25, 0.47 and0.82 jy at each of the nine frequencies between 30 and 857 ghz. sources whichare up to a factor of ~2 fainter than this limit, and which are present in"clean" regions of the galaxy where the sky background due to emission from theinterstellar medium is low, are included in the ercsc if they meet the highreliability criterion. the planck ercsc sources have known associations tostars with dust shells, stellar cores, radio galaxies, blazars, infraredluminous galaxies and galactic interstellar medium features. a significantfraction of unclassified sources are also present in the catalogs. in addition,two early release catalogs that contain 915 cold molecular cloud corecandidates and 189 sz cluster candidates that have been generated usingmulti-frequency algorithms are presented. the entire source list, with morethan 15000 unique sources, is ripe for follow-up characterisation withherschel, atca, vla, sofia, alma and other ground-based observing facilities.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1105.5885	connecting synchrotron, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields in the plane of  the galaxy	we extend previous work modeling the galactic magnetic field in the planeusing synchrotron emission in total and polarised intensity. in this work, weinclude a more realistic treatment of the cosmic-ray electrons using thegalprop propagation code optimized to match the existing high-energy data. thisaddition reduces the degeneracies in our previous analysis and when combinedwith an additional observed synchrotron frequency allows us to study thelow-energy end of the cosmic-ray electron spectrum in a way that has notpreviously been done. for a pure diffusion propagation, we find a low-energyinjection spectrum slightly harder than generally assumed; for j(e) \proptoe^{\alpha}, we find {\alpha} = -1.34 \pm 0.12, implying a very sharp break withthe spectrum above a few gev. this then predicts a synchrotron brightnesstemperature spectral index, {\beta}, on the galactic plane that is -2.8 &lt;{\beta} &lt; -2.74 below a few ghz and -2.98 &lt; {\beta} &lt; -2.91 up to 23 ghz. wefind that models including cosmic-ray re-acceleration processes appear to beincompatible with the synchrotron data.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5063	planck 2013 results. ii. low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the data processing pipeline of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi) data processing centre (dpc) to create and characterizefull-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44 and 70ghz. in particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,starting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. data are continuouslycalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. skysignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based onsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. noise propertiesare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. a destriping code(madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information intosky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. noise covariancematrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on lfi and planckproducts, are also produced. main beams are estimated down to the -20 db levelusing jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration ofthe focal plane.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1312.5618	probing the accelerating universe with radio weak lensing in the jvla  sky survey	we outline the prospects for performing pioneering radio weak gravitationallensing analyses using observations from a potential forthcoming jvla skysurvey program. a large-scale survey with the jvla can offer interesting andunique opportunities for performing weak lensing studies in the radio band, afield which has until now been the preserve of optical telescopes. inparticular, the jvla has the capacity for large, deep radio surveys withrelatively high angular resolution, which are the key characteristics requiredfor a successful weak lensing study. we highlight the potential advantages andunique aspects of performing weak lensing in the radio band. in particular, theinclusion of continuum polarisation information can greatly reduce noise inweak lensing reconstructions and can also remove the effects of intrinsicgalaxy alignments, the key astrophysical systematic effect that limits weaklensing at all wavelengths. we identify a vlass "deep fields" program (totalarea ~10-20 square degs), to be conducted at l-band and with high-resolution(a-array configuration), as the optimal survey strategy from the point of viewof weak lensing science. such a survey will build on the unique strengths ofthe jvla and will remain unsurpassed in terms of its combination of resolutionand sensitivity until the advent of the square kilometre array. we identify thebest fields on the jvla-accessible sky from the point of view of overlappingwith existing deep optical and near infra-red data which will provide crucialredshift information and facilitate a host of additional compellingmulti-wavelength science.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1410.4438	polarised radio filaments outside the galactic plane	we used data from the \wmap satellite at 23, 33 and 41 ghz to study thediffuse polarised emission over the entire sky. the emission originates mostlyfrom filamentary structures with well-ordered magnetic fields. some of thesestructures have been known for decades in radio continuum maps. their origin isnot clear and there are many filaments that are visible for the first time. wehave identified and studied 11 filaments. the polarisation fraction of some ofthem can be as high as 40\%, which is a signature of a well ordered magneticfield. the polarisation spectral indices, averaged over 18 regions in the skyis $\beta = -3.06 \pm 0.02$, consistent with synchrotron radiation. there aresignificant variations in $\beta$ over the sky ($\delta\beta\approx0.2$).  we explore the link between the large-scale filaments and the local ism,using the model of an expanding shell in the solar vicinity. we comparedobserved polarisation angles with the predictions from the model and found goodagreement. this strongly suggests that many large scale filaments and loops arenearby structures. this is important in the context of the galactic magneticfield as these structures are normally included in global models, neglectingthe fact that they might be local. we also studied the level of contaminationadded by the diffuse filaments to the cmb polarisation power spectra. weconclude that, even though these filaments present low radio brightness, acareful removal will be necessary for future all-sky cmb polarisation analysis.

1411.7616	monopole and dipole estimation for multi-frequency sky maps by linear  regression	we describe a simple but efficient method for deriving a consistent set ofmonopole and dipole corrections for multi-frequency sky map data sets, allowingrobust parametric component separation with the same data set. thecomputational core of this method is linear regression between pairs offrequency maps, often called "t-t plots". individual contributions frommonopole and dipole terms are determined by performing the regression locallyin patches on the sky, while the degeneracy between different frequencies islifted when ever the dominant foreground component exhibits a significantspatial spectral index variation. based on this method, we present twodifferent, but each internally consistent, sets of monopole and dipolecoefficients for the 9-year wmap, planck 2013, sfd 100 um, haslam 408 mhz andreich &amp; reich 1420 mhz maps. the two sets have been derived with differentanalysis assumptions and data selection, and provides an estimate of residualsystematic uncertainties. in general, our values are in good agreement withpreviously published results. among the most notable results are a relativedipole between the wmap and planck experiments of 10-15 uk (depending onfrequency), an estimate of the 408 mhz map monopole of 8.9 +- 1.3 k, and anon-zero dipole in the 1420 mhz map of $0.15 +- 0.03 k pointing towardsgalactic coordinates (l,b) = (308,-36) +- 14 degrees. these values representthe sum of any instrumental and data processing offsets, as well as anygalactic or extra-galactic component that is spectrally uniform over the fullsky.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1508.03889	faraday tomography of the north polar spur: constraints on the distance  to the spur and on the magnetic field of the galaxy	we present radio continuum and polarization images of the north polar spur(nps) from the global magneto-ionic medium survey (gmims) conducted with thedominion radio astrophysical observatory 26-m telescope. we fit polarizationangle versus wavelength squared over 2048 frequency channels from 1280 to 1750mhz to obtain a faraday rotation measure (rm) map of the nps. combining this rmmap with a published faraday depth map of the entire galaxy in this direction,we derive the faraday depth introduced by the nps and the galactic interstellarmedium (ism) in front of and behind the nps. the faraday depth contributed bythe nps is close to zero, indicating that the nps is an emitting only feature.the faraday depth caused by the ism in front of the nps is consistent with zeroat b&gt;50 degree, implying that this part of the nps is local at a distance ofapproximately several hundred parsecs. the faraday depth contributed by the ismbehind the nps gradually increases with galactic latitude up to b=44 degree,and decreases at higher galactic latitudes. this implies that either the partof the nps at b&lt;44 degree is distant or the nps is local but there is a signchange of the large-scale magnetic field. if the nps is local, there is then noevidence for a large-scale anti-symmetry pattern in the faraday depth of themilky way. the faraday depth introduced by the ism behind the nps at latitudesb&gt;50 degree can be explained by including a coherent vertical magnetic field.

astro-ph;0111607	probing the pc- and kpc-scale environment of the powerful radio galaxy  hercules a	we present the kpc-scale behaviour of the powerful extragalactic radio sourcehercules a and the behaviour of the intracluster gas in which the radio sourceis situated. we have found that hercules a exhibits a strong laing-garringtoneffect. the x-ray observations have revealed an extended x-ray emissionelongated along the radio galaxy axis. the estimated temperature of the clusteris kt = 2.45 kev and the central electron density is no~7.8 x 10^(-3) cm^(-3)which reveals a hot, dense environment in which hercules a is situated. fromthe combined study of the radio and x-ray data we have estimated a centralvalue of 3&lt;bo (mug)&lt;9. we also present the most recent results from theanalysis of the radio data on the pc-scale structure of the radio galaxy,observed at 18 cm by the evn-merlin array. a faint but compact radio source,coincident with the optical centre of hercules a was detected by the evn at 18mas resolution. the total flux density of the evn core is 14.6 mjy. its angularsize is 18 x 7 mas with a position angle of ~139 degrees. there is alsoevidence for extended emission in the nw-se direction, most probably from theeastern pc-scale jet. if this is true then there is a misalignment between thedirection of the pc-eastern and the aligned kpc-scale jets of ~35 degrees.

astro-ph;0205381	first results from the very small array -- ii. observations of the cmb	we have observed the cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations ineight fields covering three separated areas of sky with the very small array at34 ghz. a total area of 101 square degrees has been imaged, with sensitivity onangular scales 3.6 - 0.4 degrees (equivalent to angular multipoles l=150-900).we describe the field selection and observing strategy for these observations.in the full-resolution images (with synthesised beam of fwhm ~ 17 arcmin) thethermal noise is typically 45 microk and the cmb signal typically 55 microk.the noise levels in each field agree well with the expected thermal noise levelof the telescope, and there is no evidence of any residual systematic features.the same cmb features are detected in separate, overlapping observations.discrete radio sources have been detected using a separate 15 ghz survey andtheir effects removed using pointed follow-up observations at 34 ghz. weestimate that the residual confusion noise due to unsubtracted radio sources isless than 14 mjy/beam (15 microk in the full-resolution images), which added inquadrature to the thermal noise increases the noise level by 6 %. we estimatethat the rms contribution to the images from diffuse galactic emission is lessthan 6 microk. we also present images which are convolved to maximise thesignal-to-noise of the cmb features and are co-added in overlapping areas, inwhich the signal-to-noise of some individual cmb features exceeds 8.

astro-ph;0210228	observations of the neutral gas and dust in the radio galaxy 3c305	we present merlin and hubble space telescope (hst) observations of thecentral region of the nearby radio galaxy 3c305 and use them to study the gasand dust in this object. the merlin observations are of neutral hydrogen (hi)absorption against the strong non-thermal 20cm continuum seen towards thecentral 4kpc of 3c305. our 0.2-arcsec (160 pc) resolution observations showthat the hi absorption is highly localised against the south-westernradio-emission with column densities 1.9x10^21/cm2. the absorption is broad andred-shifted by 130 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. the hst images in430nm, 702nm, [oiii] 500.7nm, [feii] 1.64um and k-band polarization arepresented. evidence is seen for coincidence of the [feii] emission with theknot at the end of the radio jet, suggesting the presence of shocks. we comparethe optical and radio images in order to investigate the relationship betweenthe dust and neutral gas. an unresolved (0.07-arcsec) nucleus is detected in hand k and its properties are consistent with a quasar reddened by a(v)&gt;4. wepropose that the absorption arises in a region of neutral gas and dust whosestructure is complex but is broadly consistent with an inclined discencircling, but not covering, the active galactic nucleus. a comparison of theneutral gas observations and previous emission-line observations suggests thatboth the neutral and ionised gas are undergoing galactic rotation towards theobserver in the north-east and away from the observer in the south-west. wepropose that the outflow giving rise to the radio emission has a componenttowards the observer in the north-east and away from the observer in thesouth-west.

astro-ph;0212497	cosmological parameter estimation and bayesian model comparison using  vsa data	we constrain the basic comological parameters using the first observations bythe very small array (vsa) in its extended configuration, together withexisting cosmic microwave background data and other cosmological observations.we estimate cosmological parameters for four different models of increasingcomplexity. in each case, careful consideration is given to implied priors andthe bayesian evidence is calculated in order to perform model selection. wefind that the data are most convincingly explained by a simple flat lambda-cdmcosmology without tensor modes. in this case, combining just the vsa and cobedata sets yields the 68 per cent confidence intervals omega_b h^2=0.034(+0.007, -0.007), omega_dm h^2 = 0.18 (+0.06, -0.04), h=0.72 (+0.15,-0.13),n_s=1.07 (+0.06,-0.06) and sigma_8=1.17 (+0.25, -0.20). the most general modelconsidered includes spatial curvature, tensor modes, massive neutrinos and aparameterised equation of state for the dark energy. in this case, by combiningall recent cosmological data, we find, in particular, 95 percent limit on thetensor-to-scalar ratio r &lt; 0.63 and on the fraction of massive neutrinos f_nu &lt;0.11; we also obtain the 68 per cent confidence interval w=-1.06 (+0.20, -0.25)on the equation of state of dark energy.

astro-ph;0305600	a multiband study of hercules a. ii. multifrequency vla imaging	we have mapped the powerful radio galaxy hercules a at six frequenciesspanning 1295 to 8440 mhz using the vla in all four configurations. here wediscuss the structure revealed in total intensity, spectral index,polarization, and projected magnetic field. our observations clearly reveal therelation between the bright jets, radio source. the jets and rings form acoherent structure with a dramatically flatter spectrum than the surroundinglobes and bridge, strongly suggesting that they represent a recently renewedoutburst from the active nucleus. the spectrum of the lobes is also steeperthan in typical radio sources, and steepens further towards the centre. thecompact core is optically thin and also has a remarkably steep spectrum (alpha\~ -1.2). there is some evidence that the old lobe material has been swept upand compressed ahead of the new outburst. we interpret the dramatic asymmetryin the bright structure, and more subtle differences between diffuse lobestructures, in terms of relativistic beaming combined with front-to-backlight-travel delays which mean that we view the two lobes at different stagesof the outburst. after correcting for faraday rotation the projected magneticfield closely follows the edge of the lobes, the jets, and the rings; the fieldpattern in the two lobes is broadly similar. we confirm a strong asymmetry indepolarization and faraday rotation, with the jet side the less depolarized andthe flatter spectrum, consistent with general correlations between theseasymmetries. the spectral index asymmetry is clearly present in the `old' lobematerial and so, at least in this case, is not due to beaming; but it can beunderstood in terms of the light-travel delay.

astro-ph;0308201	chandra discovery of an x-ray jet and lobes in 3c 15	we report the chandra detection of an x-ray jet in 3c 15. the peak of thex-ray emission in the jet is 4.1'' (a projected distance of 5.1 kpc) from thenucleus, and coincident with a component previously identified in the radio andoptical jets. we examine four models for the x-ray jet emission: (i) weaksynchrotron cooling in equip., (ii) moderate synchrotron cooling in equip.,(iii) weak synchrotron plus ssc cooling, and (iv) moderate synchrotron plus ssccooling. we argue that case (ii) can most reasonably explain the overallemission from knot c. case (iii) is also possible, but requires a largedeparture from equipartition and for the jet power to be comparable to that ofthe brightest quasars. diffuse x-ray emission has also been detected,distributed widely over the full extent (63kpc x 25kpc) of the radio lobes. wecompare the total energy contained in the lobes with the jet power estimatedfrom knot c, and discuss the energetic link between the jet and the lobes. weargue that the fueling time (t_fuel) and the source age (t_src) are comparablefor case (ii), whereas t_fuel &lt;&lt; t_src is likely for case (iii). the latter mayimply that the jet has a very small filling factor, ~10^{-3}. we consider thepressure balance between the thermal galaxy halo and non-thermal relativisticelectrons in the radio lobes. finally, we show that the x-ray emission from thenucleus is not adequately fitted by a simple absorbed power-law model, butneeds an additional power-law with heavy absorption intrinsic to the source.such a high column density is consistent with the presence of a dense, dustytorus which obscures the quasar nucleus.

astro-ph;0308266	searching for non-gaussianity in the vsa data	we have tested very small array (vsa) observations of three regions of skyfor the presence of non-gaussianity, using high-order cumulants, minkowskifunctionals, a wavelet-based test and a bayesian joint powerspectrum/non-gaussianity analysis. we find the data from two regions to beconsistent with gaussianity. in the third region, we obtain a 96.7% detectionof non-gaussianity using the wavelet test. we perform simulations tocharacterise the tests, and conclude that this is consistent with expectedresidual point source contamination. there is therefore no evidence that thisdetection is of cosmological origin. our simulations show that the tests wouldbe sensitive to any residual point sources above the data's source subtractionlevel of 20 mjy. the tests are also sensitive to cosmic string networks at anrms fluctuation level of $105 \mu k$ (i.e. equivalent to the best-fit observedvalue). they are not sensitive to string-induced fluctuations if an equal rmsof gaussian cdm fluctuations is added, thereby reducing the fluctuations due tothe strings network to $74 \mu k$ rms . we especially highlight the usefulnessof non-gaussianity testing in eliminating systematic effects from our data.

astro-ph;0402072	a multiband study of hercules a. i. rosat observations of the  intracluster medium	we have made rosat pspc and hri x-ray observations to study the intraclustergas surrounding the powerful radio source hercules a. the cluster is luminousin x-rays (l_bol = 4.8x10^37 w), and the host of the radio source is thecentral dominating galaxy of the cluster. the x-ray surface brightness profileis well fitted by a modified king beta model, but the cluster is elongatedparallel to the radio source, especially on the scale of the radio lobes. fitsto individual quadrants give a core radius 50 per cent larger along the radioaxis. part of this elongation appears to be associated with enhanced x-rayemission superimposed on the outer radio lobes. there are no obviousdepressions in the x-ray emission coincident with the radio lobes, as expectedif the relativistic plasma displaces the icm. however, we show that thesedepressions may be quite weak. from the surface brightness profile for the pspcdata the x-ray emission extends out to ~ 2.2 mpc radius. in the absence of thepowerful jets, we would expect a cooling flow at the centre of the cluster, butcurrently it must be substantially disturbed by the expansion of the radiolobes. the pspc spectrum reveals a cool component of the icm with 0.5 &lt; kt &lt; 1kev. the central cooling time could be as low as 2 gyr if the cool component iscentrally concentrated, otherwise it is around 6 gyr. the modelled centralelectron density is typical for modest cooling flows. finally, we have detectedfaint x-ray emission from a compact central source.

astro-ph;0402466	cosmological parameter estimation using very small array data out to  l=1500	we estimate cosmological parameters using data obtained by the very smallarray (vsa) in its extended configuration, in conjunction with a variety ofother cmb data and external priors. within the flat $\lambda$cdm model, we findthat the inclusion of high resolution data from the vsa modifies the limits onthe cosmological parameters as compared to those suggested by wmap alone, whilestill remaining compatible with their estimates. we find that $\omega_{\rmb}h^2=0.0234^{+0.0012}_{-0.0014}$, $\omega_{\rmdm}h^2=0.111^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, $h=0.73^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$, $n_{\rms}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.03}$, $10^{10}a_{\rm s}=23^{+7}_{-3}$ and$\tau=0.14^{+0.14}_{-0.07}$ for wmap and vsa when no external prior isincluded.on extending the model to include a running spectral index of densityfluctuations, we find that the inclusion of vsa data leads to a negativerunning at a level of more than 95% confidence ($n_{\rm run}=-0.069\pm 0.032$),something which is not significantly changed by the inclusion of a stringentprior on the hubble constant. inclusion of prior information from the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey reduces the significance of the result by constrainingthe value of $\omega_{\rm m}$. we discuss the veracity of this result in thecontext of various systematic effects and also a broken spectral index model.we also constrain the fraction of neutrinos and find that $f_{\nu}&lt; 0.087$ at95% confidence which corresponds to $m_\nu&lt;0.32{\rm ev}$ when all neutrinomasses are the equal. finally, we consider the global best fit within a generalcosmological model with 12 parameters and find consistency with other analysesavailable in the literature. the evidence for $n_{\rm run}&lt;0$ is only marginalwithin this model.

astro-ph;0402498	high sensitivity measurements of the cmb power spectrum with the  extended very small array	we present deep ka-band ($\nu \approx 33$ ghz) observations of the cmb madewith the extended very small array (vsa). this configuration produces anaturally weighted synthesized fwhm beamwidth of $\sim 11$ arcmin which coversan $\ell$-range of 300 to 1500. on these scales, foreground extragalacticsources can be a major source of contamination to the cmb anisotropy. thisproblem has been alleviated by identifying sources at 15 ghz with the ryletelescope and then monitoring these sources at 33 ghz using a single baselineinterferometer co-located with the vsa. sources with flux densities $\gtsim 20$mjy at 33 ghz are subtracted from the data. in addition, we calculate astatistical correction for the small residual contribution from weaker sourcesthat are below the detection limit of the survey.  the cmb power spectrum corrected for galactic foregrounds and extragalacticpoint sources is presented. a total $\ell$-range of 150-1500 is achieved bycombining the complete extended array data with earlier vsa data in a compactconfiguration. our resolution of $\delta \ell \approx 60$ allows the first 3acoustic peaks to be clearly delineated. the is achieved by using mosaicedobservations in 7 regions covering a total area of 82 sq. degrees. there isgood agreement with wmap data up to $\ell=700$ where wmap data run out ofresolution. for higher $\ell$-values out to $\ell = 1500$, the agreement inpower spectrum amplitudes with other experiments is also very good despitedifferences in frequency and observing technique.

astro-ph;0604070	non-gaussianity in the very small array cmb maps with  smooth-goodness-of-fit tests	(abridged) we have used the rayner &amp; best (1989) smooth tests ofgoodness-of-fit to study the gaussianity of the very small array (vsa) data.out of the 41 published vsa individual pointings dedicated to cosmologicalobservations, 37 are found to be consistent with gaussianity, whereas fourpointings show deviations from gaussianity. in two of them, these deviationscan be explained as residual systematic effects of a few visibility pointswhich, when corrected, have a negligible impact on the angular power spectrum.the non-gaussianity found in the other two (adjacent) pointings seems to beassociated to a local deviation of the power spectrum of these fields withrespect to the common power spectrum of the complete data set, at angularscales of the third acoustic peak (l = 700-900). no evidence of residualsystematics is found in this case, and unsubstracted point sources are not aplausible explanation either. if those visibilities are removed, a cosmologicalanalysis based on this new vsa power spectrum alone shows no differences in theparameter constraints with respect to our published results, except for thephysical baryon density, which decreases by 10 percent. finally, the method hasbeen also used to analyse the vsa observations in the corona borealissupercluster region (genova-santos et al. 2005), which show a strong decrementwhich cannot be explained as primordial cmb. our method finds a clear deviation(99.82%) with respect to gaussianity in the second-order moment of thedistribution, and which can not be explained as systematic effects. a detailedstudy shows that the non-gaussianity is produced in scales of l~500, and thatthis deviation is intrinsic to the data (in the sense that can not be explainedin terms of a gaussian field with a different power spectrum).

astro-ph;9706279	asymmetry of jets, lobe length and spectral index in quasars	the less depolarized lobe of a radio source is generally the lobe containingthe jet (laing-garrington correlation) but the less depolarized lobe is alsogenerally that with the flatter radio spectrum (liu-pooley correlation). botheffects are strong; taken together they would imply a correlation between jetside and lobe spectral index, i.e. between an orientation-dependent feature andone which is intrinsic. we test this prediction using detailed spectral imagingof a sample of quasars with well-defined jets and investigate whether theresult can be reconciled with the standard interpretation of one-sided jets interms of relativistic aberration. our central finding is that the spectrum ofhigh surface brightness regions is indeed flatter on the jet side, but that thespectrum of low surface brightness regions is flatter on the side with thelonger lobe. we discuss possible causes for these correlations and favourexplanations in terms of relativistic bulk motion in the high surfacebrightness regions and differential synchrotron ageing in the extended lobematerial.
