physics;0703153	reduction of time-resolved space-based ccd photometry developed for most  fabry imaging data	the most (microvariability &amp; oscillations of stars) satellite obtainsultraprecise photometry from space with high sampling rates and duty cycles.astronomical photometry or imaging missions in low earth orbits, like most, areespecially sensitive to scattered light from earthshine, and all these missionshave a common need to extract target information from voluminous data cubes.they consist of upwards of hundreds of thousands of two-dimensional ccd frames(or sub-rasters) containing from hundreds to millions of pixels each, where thetarget information, superposed on background and instrumental effects, iscontained only in a subset of pixels (fabry images, defocussed images,mini-spectra). we describe a novel reduction technique for such data cubes:resolving linear correlations of target and background pixel intensities. thisstepwise multiple linear regression removes only those target variations whichare also detected in the background. the advantage of regression analysisversus background subtraction is the appropriate scaling, taking into accountthat the amount of contamination may differ from pixel to pixel. themultivariate solution for all pairs of target/background pixels is minimallyinvasive of the raw photometry while being very effective in reducingcontamination due to, e.g., stray light. the technique is tested anddemonstrated with both simulated oscillation signals and real most photometry.

0905.3340	looking for pulsations in hgmn stars through corot lightcurves	hgmn chemically peculiar stars are among the quietest stars of themain-sequence. however, according to theoretical predictions, these stars couldhave pulsations related to the very strong overabundances of iron peakelements, which are produced by atomic diffusion in upper layers. suchpulsations have never been detected from ground based observations.  our aim is to search for signatures of pulsations in hgmn stars using thehigh quality lightcurves provided by the corot satellite.  we identified three faint stars (v&gt;12), from vlt-giraffe multiobjectspectrograph survey in a field which was planned for observation by corot. theypresent the typical characteristics of hgmn stars. they were observed by thecorot satellite during the long run (131 days) which started from the 24th ofoctober 2007, with the exoplanets ccd's (additional programme). in the presentwork, we present the analysis of the ground based spectra of these three starsand the analysis of the corresponding corot lightcurves.  two of these three hgmn candidates show low amplitude (less than 1.6 mmag)periodic variations (4.3 and 2.53 days respectively, with harmonics) which arecompatible with periods predicted by theoretical models.

0906.5002	characteristics of solar-like oscillations in red giants observed in the  corot exoplanet field	observations during the first long run (~150 days) in the exo-planet field ofcorot increase the number of g-k giant stars for which solar-like oscillationsare observed by a factor of 100. this opens the possibility to study thecharacteristics of their oscillations in a statistical sense. we aim tounderstand the statistical distribution of the frequencies of maximumoscillation power (nu_max) in red giants and to search for a possiblecorrelation between nu_max and the large separation (delta_nu). the nu_maxdistribution shows a pronounced peak between 20 - 40 microhz. for about half ofthe stars we obtain delta_nu with at least two methods. the correlation betweennu_max and delta_nu follows the same scaling relation as inferred forsolar-like stars. the shape of the nu_max distribution can partly be explainedby granulation at low frequencies and by white noise at high frequencies, butthe population density of the observed stars turns out to be also an importantfactor. from the fact that the correlation between delta_nu and nu_max for redgiants follows the same scaling relation as obtained for sun-like stars, weconclude that the sound travel time over the pressure scale height of theatmosphere scales with the sound travel time through the whole starirrespective of evolution.

0907.1423	discovery of a weak magnetic field in the photosphere of the single  giant pollux	aims: we observe the nearby, weakly-active single giant, pollux, in order todirectly study and infer the nature of its magnetic field. methods: we used thenew generation spectropolarimeters espadons and narval to observe and detectcircular polarization within the photospheric absorption lines of pollux. ourobservations span 18 months from 2007-2009. we treated the spectropolarimetricdata using the least-squares deconvolution method to create highsignal-to-noise ratio mean stokes v profiles. we also measured the classicalactivity indicator s-index for the ca h&amp;k lines, and the stellar radialvelocity (rv). results: we have unambiguously detected a weak stokes v signalin the spectral lines of pollux, and measured the related surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field bl. the longitudinal field averaged over the spanof the observations is below one gauss. our data suggest variations of thelongitudinal magnetic field, but no significant variation of the s-index. weobserve variations of rv which are qualitatively consistent with the publishedephemeris for a proposed exoplanet orbiting pollux. the observed variations ofbl appear to mimic those of rv, but additional data for this relationship to beestablished. using evolutionary models including the effects of rotation, wederive the mass of pollux and we discuss its evolutionary status and the originof its magnetic field. conclusions: this work presents the first directdetection of the magnetic field of pollux, and demonstrates that espadons andnarval are capable of obtaining sub-g measurements of the surface-averagedlongitudinal magnetic field of giant stars, and of directly studying therelationships between magnetic activity, stellar evolution and planet hostingof these stars.

0907.1929	a search for p-modes and other variability in the binary system 85  pegasi using most photometry	context: asteroseismology has great potential for the study of metal-poorstars due to its sensitivity to determine stellar ages. aims: our goal was todetect p-mode oscillations in the metal-poor sub-dwarf 85 peg a and to searchfor other variability on longer timescales. methods: we have obtainedcontinuous high-precision photometry of the binary system 85 pegasi with themost space telescope in two seasons (2005 &amp; 2007). furthermore, we redeterminedvsini for 85 peg a using high resolution spectra obtained through the esoarchive, and used photometric spot modeling to interpret long periodicvariations. results: our frequency analysis yields no convincing evidence forp-modes significantly above a noise level of 4 ppm. using simulated p-modepatterns we provide upper rms amplitude limits for 85 peg a. the light curveshows evidence for variability with a period of about 11 d and this periodicityis also seen in the follow up run in 2007; however, as different methods toremove instrumental trends in the 2005 run yield vastly different results, theexact shape and periodicity of the 2005 variability remain uncertain. ourre-determined vsini value for 85 peg a is comparable to previous studies and weprovide realistic uncertainties for this parameter. using these values incombination with simple photometric spot models we are able to reconstruct theobserved variations. conclusions: the null-detection of p-modes in 85 peg a isconsistent with theoretical values for pulsation amplitudes in this star. thedetected long-periodic variation must await confirmation by furtherobservations with similar or better precision and long-term stability. if the11 d periodicity is real, rotational modulation of surface features on one ofthe components is the most likely explanation.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

0710.2963	cinderella - comparison of independent relative least-squares amplitudes	the identification of increasingly smaller signal from objects observed witha non-perfect instrument in a noisy environment poses a challenge for astatistically clean data analysis. we want to compute the probability offrequencies determined in various data sets to be related or not, which cannotbe answered with a simple comparison of amplitudes. our method provides astatistical estimator for a given signal with different strengths in a set ofobservations to be of instrumental origin or to be intrinsic. based on thespectral significance as an unbiased statistical quantity in frequencyanalysis, discrete fourier transforms (dfts) of target and background lightcurves are comparatively examined. the individual false-alarm probabilities areused to deduce conditional probabilities for a peak in a target spectrum to bereal in spite of a corresponding peak in the spectrum of a background or ofcomparison stars. alternatively, we can compute joint probabilities offrequencies to occur in the dft spectra of several data sets simultaneously butwith different amplitude, which leads to composed spectral significances. theseare useful to investigate a star observed in different filters or duringseveral observing runs. the composed spectral significance is a measure for theprobability that none of coinciding peaks in the dft spectra underconsideration are due to noise. cinderella is a mathematical approach to ageneral statistical problem. its potential reaches beyond photometry fromground or space: to all cases where a quantitative statistical comparison ofperiodicities in different data sets is desired. examples for the composed andthe conditional cinderella mode for different observation setups are presented.

1308.3598	periodicity search as a tool for disentangling the contaminated colour  light curve of corot 102781750	the star corot102781750 reveals a puzzle, showing a very complex and alteringvariation in different `corot colours'. we established without doubt that morethan a single star was situated within the corot mask. using a search forperiodicity as a tool, our aim is to disentangle the composite light curve andidentify the type of sources behind the variability. both flux and magnitudelight curves were used. conversion was applied after a jump- andtrend-filtering algorithm. we applied different types of period-findingtechniques including mufran and period04. the amplitude and phase peculiaritiesobtained from the independent analysis of corot r, g, and b colours andground-based follow-up photometric observations ruled out the possibility ofeither a background monoperiodic or a blazhko type rr lyrae star being in themask. the main target, an active star, shows at least two spotted areas thatreveal a $p_rot = 8.8$ hours $(f_0 = 2.735$ c d$^{-1})$ mean rotation period.the evolution of the active regions helped to derive a period change of $dp/dt= 1.6\cdot 10^{-6}$ (18 s over the run) and a differential rotation of $\alpha= \delta\omega/\omega = 0.0074$. the $0\fm 015$ linear decrease and a local$0\fm 005$ increase in the dominant period's amplitude are interpreted as adecay of the old spotted region and an appearance of a new one, respectively. astar that is detected only in the corot b domain shows a $f_1 = 7.172$ cd$^{-1}$ pulsation connected to a $14\fd 83$ periodicity via an equidistanttriplet structure. the best explanation for our observation is a $\beta$ cepstar with a corotating dust disk.

1406.3936	investigating the possible connection between lambda bootis stars and  intermediate population ii type stars	the lambda bootis (lb) stars are located at the upper main sequence of theh-r diagram and exhibit a peculiar abundance pattern. the light elements (c, n,o, and s) present solar abundances whereas all other elements are moderately tostrongly underabundant. it has not yet been determined whether that abundancepattern is intrinsic, or is restricted to the stellar surface. if we follow thehypothesis that the lb stars are intrinsically metal-weak, then there should bea connection with the intermediate population ii and f-weak objects. such apossible affinity has not been previously investigated. we present detailedelemental abundances, including those of the light elements carbon and oxygen,for 38 bright intermediate population ii and f-weak objects. in addition, weinvestigate the kinematic characteristics of the groups. from photometric,spectroscopic, and kinematic data, there is no distinction between theintermediate population ii and f-weak type stars. we therefore conclude thatthe two groups are identical. however, it is possible to distinguish the lbstars from the intermediate population ii stars on the basis of elementalabundances, though not in terms of their kinematics. the lb stars seem to bedistinct from the intermediate population ii group. further asteroseismologicinvestigations and analyses of spectroscopic binary systems are needed tostrengthen this conclusion.

0803.1721	most photometry of the roap star 10 aql	context: we present 31.2 days of nearly continuous most photometry of theroap star 10aql. aims:the goal was to provide an unambiguous frequencyidentification for this little studied star, as well as to discuss the detectedfrequencies in the context of magnetic models and analyze the influence of themagnetic field on the pulsation. methods: using traditional fourier analysistechniques on three independent data reductions, intrinsic frequencies for thestar are identified. theoretical non-adiabatic axisymmetric modes influenced bya magnetic field having polar field strengths bp = 0-5kg were computed tocompare the observations to theory. results: the high-precision data allow usto identify three definite intrinsic pulsation frequencies and two othercandidate frequencies with low s/n. considering the observed spacings, only one(50.95microhz) is consistent with the main sequence nature of roap stars. thecomparison with theoretical models yields a best fit for a 1.95msun modelhaving solar metallicity, suppressed envelope convection, and homogenous heliumabundance. furthermore, our analysis confirms the suspected slow rotation ofthe star and sets new lower limits to the rotation period (prot&gt;1 month) andinclination (i&gt;30\pm10deg.). conclusions:the observed frequency spectrum is notrich enough to unambiguously identify a model. on the other hand, the modelshardly represent roap stars in detail due to the approximations needed todescribe the interactions of the magnetic field with stellar structure andpulsation. consequently, errors in the model frequencies needed for the fittingprocedure can only be estimated. nevertheless, it is encouraging that modelswhich suppress convection and include solar metallicity, in agreement withcurrent concepts of roap stars, fit the observations best.

astro-ph;0511360	the rapidly oscillating ap star hd 99563 and its distorted dipole  pulsation mode	we undertook a time-series photometric multi-site campaign for the rapidlyoscillating ap star hd 99563 and also acquired mean light observations over twoseasons. the pulsations of the star, that show flatter light maxima thanminima, can be described with a frequency quintuplet centred on 1557.653microhertz and some first harmonics of these. the amplitude of the pulsation ismodulated with the rotation period of the star that we determine with 2.91179+/- 0.00007 d from the analysis of the stellar pulsation spectrum and of themean light data. we break the distorted oscillation mode up into its purespherical harmonic components and find it is dominated by the l=1 pulsation,and also has a notable l=3 contribution, with weak l=0 and 2 components. thegeometrical configuration of the star allows one to see both pulsation polesfor about the same amount of time; hd 99563 is only the fourth roap star forwhich both pulsation poles are seen and only the third where the distortion ofthe pulsation modes was modelled. we point out that hd 99563 is very similar tothe well-studied roap star hr 3831. finally, we note that the visual companionof hd 99563 is located in the delta scuti instability strip and may thus showpulsation. we show that if the companion was physical, the roap star would be a2.03 solar mass object, seen at a rotational inclination of 44 degrees, whichthen predicts a magnetic obliquity of 86.4 degrees.

astro-ph;0612761	line profile variations in rapidly oscillating ap stars: resolution of  the enigma	we have carried out the first survey of the pulsational line profilevariability in rapidly oscillating ap (roap) stars. we analysed highsignal-to-noise time-series observations of ten sharp-lined roap stars obtainedwith the high-resolution spectrographs attached to the vlt and cfht telescopes.we investigated in detail the variations of pr iii, nd ii, nd iii and tb iiilines and discovered a prominent change of the profile variability pattern withheight in the atmospheres of all studied roap stars. in every investigated starprofile variability of at least one rare-earth ion is characterized by unusualblue-to-red moving features - a behaviour inexplicable in the framework of thestandard oblique pulsator model of slowly rotating roap stars. using analysisof the line profile moments and spectrum synthesis calculations, we demonstratethat unusual oscillations in spectral lines of roap stars arise from thepulsational modulation of line widths. this variation occurs approximately inquadrature with the radial velocity changes, and its amplitude rapidlyincreases with height in stellar atmosphere. we propose that the line widthmodulation is a consequence of the periodic expansion and compression ofturbulent layers in the upper atmospheres of roap stars. thus, the line profilechanges observed in slowly rotating magnetic pulsators should be interpreted asa superposition of two types of variability: the usual time-dependent velocityfield due to an oblique low-order pulsation mode and an additional line widthmodulation, synchronized with the changes of stellar radius. our explanation ofthe line profile variations of roap stars solves the long-standingobservational puzzle and opens new possibilities for constraining geometric andphysical properties of the stellar magnetoacoustic pulsations.
