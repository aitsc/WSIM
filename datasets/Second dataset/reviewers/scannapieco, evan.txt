0901.4576	power spectrum for the small-scale universe	the first objects to arise in a cold dark matter universe present a dauntingchallenge for models of structure formation. in the ultra small-scale limit,cdm structures form nearly simultaneously across a wide range of scales.hierarchical clustering no longer provides a guiding principle for theoreticalanalyses and the computation time required to carry out credible simulationsbecomes prohibitively high. to gain insight into this problem, we performhigh-resolution (n=720^3 - 1584^3) simulations of an einstein-de sittercosmology where the initial power spectrum is p(k) propto k^n, with -2.5 &lt; n &lt;-1. self-similar scaling is established for n=-1 and n=-2 more convincinglythan in previous, lower-resolution simulations and for the first time,self-similar scaling is established for an n=-2.25 simulation. however, finitebox-size effects induce departures from self-similar scaling in our n=-2.5simulation. we compare our results with the predictions for the power spectrumfrom (one-loop) perturbation theory and demonstrate that the renormalizationgroup approach suggested by mcdonald improves perturbation theory's ability topredict the power spectrum in the quasilinear regime. in the nonlinear regime,our power spectra differ significantly from the widely used fitting formulae ofpeacock &amp; dodds and smith et al. and a new fitting formula is presented.implications of our results for the stable clustering hypothesis vs. halo modeldebate are discussed. our power spectra are inconsistent with predictions ofthe stable clustering hypothesis in the high-k limit and lend credence to thehalo model. nevertheless, the fitting formula advocated in this paper is purelyempirical and not derived from a specific formulation of the halo model.

0902.4242	evolution of x-ray cavities	a wide range of recent observations have shown that agn-driven cavities mayprovide the energy source that balances the cooling observed in the centres ofcool-core galaxy clusters. one tool for better understanding the physics ofthese cavities is their observed morphological evolution, which is dependent onsuch poorly-understood properties as the turbulent density field and the impactof magnetic fields. here we combine numerical simulations that include subgridturbulence and software that produces synthetic x-ray observations to examinethe evolution of x-ray cavities in the absence of magnetic fields. our resultsreveal an anisotropic size evolution of that is dramatically different fromsimplified, analytical predictions. these differences highlight some of the keyissues that must be accurately quantified when studying agn-driven cavities,and help to explain why the inferred pv energy in these regions appears to becorrelated with their distance from the cluster center. interpreting x- rayobservations will require detailed modeling of effects includingmass-entrainment, distortion by drag forces, and pro jection. currentlimitations do not allow a discrimination between purely hydrodynamic andmagnetically-dominated models for x-ray cavities.

0902.4602	first light sources at the end of the dark ages: direct observations of  population iii stars, proto-galaxies, and supernovae during the reionization  epoch	the cosmic dark ages are the mysterious epoch during which the pristine gasbegan to condense and ultimately form the first stars. although thesebeginnings have long been a topic of theoretical interest, technology has onlyrecently allowed the beginnings of observational insight into this epoch. manyquestions surround the formation of stars in metal-free gas and the history ofthe build-up of metals in the intergalactic medium: (1) what were theproperties of the first stellar and galactic sources to form in pristine(metal-free) gas? (2) when did the epoch of population iii (metal-free) starformation take place and how long did it last? (3) was the stellar initial massfunction dramatically different for the first stars and galaxies? thesequestions are all active areas of theoretical research. however, newobservational constraints via the direct detection of population iii starformation are vital to making progress in answering the broader questionssurrounding how galaxies formed and how the cosmological properties of theuniverse have affected the objects it contains.

0906.5159	a physical model of lyman alpha emitters	we present a simple physical model for populating dark matter halos withlyman alpha emiiters(laes) and predict the physical properties of laes atz~3-7. the central tenet of this model is that the ly-alpha luminosity isproportional to the star formation rate (sfr) which is directly related to thehalo mass accretion rate. the only free parameter in our model is then thestar-formation efficiency (sfe). an efficiency of 2.5% provides the best-fit tothe ly-alpha luminosity function (lf) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this sfe toconstruct ly-alpha lfs at other redshifts. our model reproduce the ly-alphalfs, stellar ages, sfr ~1-10; msun/yr, stellar masses ~ 10^7-10^8 msun and theclustering properties of laes at z~3-7. we find the spatial correlation lengthsro ~ 3-6 mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. finally, we estimate thefield-to-field variation ~ 30% for current volume and flux limited surveys,again consistent with observations. our results suggest that the starformation, and hence ly-alpha emission in laes is powered by the accretion ofnew material, and that the physical properties of laes do not evolvesignificantly over a wide range of redshifts. relating the accreted mass,rather than the total mass of halos, to the ly-alpha luminosity of laesnaturally gives rise to the duty cycle of laes.

1002.2258	thermonuclear .ia supernovae from helium shell detonations: explosion  models and observables	during the early evolution of an am cvn system, helium is accreted onto thesurface of a white dwarf under conditions suitable for unstable thermonuclearignition. the turbulent motions induced by the convective burning phase in thehe envelope become strong enough to influence the propagation of burning frontsand may result in the onset of a detonation. such an outcome would yieldradioactive isotopes and a faint rapidly rising thermonuclear ".ia" supernova.in this paper, we present hydrodynamic explosion models and observable outcomesof these he shell detonations for a range of initial core and envelope masses.the peak uvoir bolometric luminosities range by a factor of 10 (from 5e41 -5e42 erg/s), and the r-band peak varies from m_r,peak = -15 to -18. the risetimes in all bands are very rapid (&lt;10 d), but the decline rate is slower inthe red than the blue due to a secondary near-ir brightening. thenucleosynthesis primarily yields heavy alpha-chain elements (40ca through 56ni)and unburnt he. thus, the spectra around peak light lack signs of intermediatemass elements and are dominated by caii and tiii features, with the caveat thatour radiative transfer code does not include the non-thermal effects necessaryto produce he features.

1003.3234	simulating supersonic turbulence in galaxy outflows	we present three-dimensional, adaptive mesh simulations of dwarf galaxy out-flows driven by supersonic turbulence. here we develop a subgrid model to tracknot only the thermal and bulk velocities of the gas, but also its turbulentvelocities and length scales. this allows us to deposit energy from supernovaedirectly into supersonic turbulence, which acts on scales much larger than aparticle mean free path, but much smaller than resolved large-scale flows.unlike previous approaches, we are able to simulate a starbursting galaxymodeled after ngc 1569, with realistic radiative cooling throughout thesimulation. pockets of hot, diffuse gas around individual ob associations sweepup thick shells of material that persist for long times due to the coolinginstability. the overlapping of high-pressure, rarefied regions leads to acollective central outflow that escapes the galaxy by eating away at theexterior gas through turbulent mixing, rather than gathering it into a thin,unstable shell. supersonic, turbulent gas naturally avoids dense regions whereturbulence decays quickly and cooling times are short, and this furtherenhances density contrasts throughout the galaxy- leading to a complex, chaoticdistribution of bubbles, loops and filaments as observed in ngc 1569 and otheroutflowing starbursts.

1007.2457	transverse sizes of civ absorption systems measured from multiple qso  sightlines	we present tomography of the circum-galactic metal distribution at redshift1.7 to 4.5 derived from echellete spectroscopy of binary quasars. we find civsystems at similar redshifts in paired sightlines more often than expected forsightline-independent redshifts. as the separation of the sightlines increasesfrom 36 kpc to 907 kpc, the amplitude of this clustering decreases. at thelargest separations, the civ systems cluster similar to lyman-break galaxies(adelberger et al. 2005a). the civ systems are significantly less correlatedthan these galaxies, however, at separations less than r_1 ~ 0.42 +/- 0.15 h-1comoving mpc. measured in real space, i.e., transverse to the sightlines, thislength scale is significantly smaller than the break scale estimated from theline-of-sight correlation function in redshift space (scannapieco et al.2006a). using a simple model, we interpret the new real-space measurement as anindication of the typical physical size of enriched regions. we adopt this sizefor enriched regions and fit the redshift-space distortion in the line-of-sightcorrelation function. the fitted velocity kick is consistent with the peculiarvelocity of galaxies as determined by the underlying mass distribution andplaces an upper limit on the outflow (or inflow) speed of metals. the impliedtime scale for dispersing metals is larger than the typical stellar ages oflyman-break galaxies (shapley et al. 2001), and we argue that enrichment bygalaxies at z &gt; 4.3 played a greater role in dispersing metals. to furtherconstrain the growth of enriched regions, we discuss empirical constraints onthe evolution of the civ correlation function with cosmic time. this studydemonstrates the potential of tomography for measuring the metal enrichmenthistory of the circum-galactic medium.

1008.0665	mixing in supersonic turbulence	in many astrophysical environments, mixing of heavy elements occurs in thepresence of a supersonic turbulent velocity field. here we carry out the firstsystematic numerical study of such passive scalar mixing in isothermalsupersonic turbulence. our simulations show that the ratio of the scalar mixingtimescale, $\tau_{\rm c}$, to the flow dynamical time, $\tau_{\rm dyn}$(defined as the flow driving scale divided by the rms velocity), increases withthe mach number, $m$, for $m \lsim3$, and becomes essentially constant for $m\gsim3.$ this trend suggests that compressible modes are less efficient inenhancing mixing than solenoidal modes. however, since the majority of kineticenergy is contained in solenoidal modes at all mach numbers, the overall changein $\tau_{\rm c}/\tau_{\rm dyn}$ is less than 20\% over the range $1 \lsim m\lsim 6$. at all mach numbers, if pollutants are injected at around the flowdriving scale, $\tau_{\rm c}$ is close to $\tau_{\rm dyn}.$ this suggests thatscalar mixing is driven by a cascade process similar to that of the velocityfield. the dependence of $\tau_{\rm c}$ on the length scale at which pollutantsare injected into flow is also consistent with this cascade picture. similarbehavior is found for the variance decay timescales for scalars withoutcontinuing sources. extension of the scalar cascade picture to the supersonicregime predicts a relation between the scaling exponents of the velocity andthe scalar structure functions, with the scalar structure function becomingflatter as the velocity scaling steepens with mach number. our measurements ofthe volume-weighted velocity and scalar structure functions confirm thisrelation for $m\lsim 2,$ but show discrepancies at $m \gsim 3$.

1009.2507	56ni production in double degenerate white dwarf collisions	we present a comprehensive study of white dwarf collisions as an avenue forcreating type ia supernovae. using a smooth particle hydrodynamics code with a13-isotope, {\alpha}-chain nuclear network, we examine the resulting 56ni yieldas a function of total mass, mass ratio, and impact parameter. we show thatseveral combinations of white dwarf masses and impact parameters are able toproduce sufficient quantities of 56ni to be observable at cosmologicaldistances. we find the 56ni production in double-degenerate white dwarfcollisions ranges from sub-luminous to the super-luminous, depending on theparameters of the collision. for all mass pairs, collisions with small impactparameters have the highest likelihood of detonating, but 56ni production isinsensitive to this parameter in high-mass combinations, which significantlyincreases their likelihood of detection. we also find that the 56ni dependenceon total mass and mass ratio is not linear, with larger mass primariesproducing disproportionately more 56ni than their lower mass secondarycounterparts, and symmetric pairs of masses producing more 56ni than asymmetricpairs.

1103.4369	formation of compact stellar clusters by high-redshift galaxy outflows  ii: effect of turbulence and metal-line cooling	in the primordial universe, low mass structures with virial temperatures lessthan 10$^{4}$ k were unable to cool by atomic line transitions, leading to astrong suppression of star formation. on the other hand, these "minihalos" werehighly prone to triggered star formation by interactions from nearby galaxyoutflows. in gray &amp; scannapieco (2010), we explored the impact ofnonequilibrium chemistry on these interactions. here we turn our attention tothe role of metals, carrying out a series of high-resolution three-dimensionaladaptive mesh refinement simulations that include both metal cooling and asubgrid turbulent mixing model. despite the presence of an additional coolant,we again we find that outflow-minihalo interactions produce a distribution ofdense, massive stellar clusters. we also find that these clusters are evenlyenriched with metals to a final abundance of z $\approx$ 10$^{-2}$ z$_{\odot}$.as in our previous simulations, all of these properties suggest that theseinteractions may have given rise to present-day halo globular clusters.

1107.2648	predicting the merger fraction of lyman alpha emitters from redshift z~3  to z~7	rapid mass assembly, likely from mergers or smooth accretion, has beenpredicted to play a vital role in star-formation in high-redshift lyman-alpha(lya) emitters. here we predict the major merger, minor merger, and smoothaccreting lya emitter fraction from z~3 to z~7 using a large dark mattersimulation, and a simple physical model that is successful in reproducing manyobservations over this large redshift range. the central tenet of this model,different from many of the earlier models, is that the star-formation in lyaemitters is proportional to the mass accretion rate rather than the total halomass. we find that at z~3, nearly 35% of the lya emitters accrete their massthrough major (3:1) mergers, and this fraction increases to about 50% at z~7.this imply that the star-formation in a large fraction of high-redshift lyaemitters is driven by mergers. while there is discrepancy between the modelpredictions and observed merger fractions, some of this difference (~15%) canbe attributed to the mass-ratio used to define a merger in the simulation. wepredict that future, deeper observations which use a 3:1 definition of majormergers will find &gt;30% major merger fraction of lya emitters at redshifts &gt;3.

1109.1568	formation of compact stellar clusters by high-redshift galaxy outflows  iii: observability and connection to halo globular clusters	the early universe hosted a large population of low-mass virialized"minihalos," that were not massive enough to form stars on their own. whilemost minihalos were photoevaporated by ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies, these galaxies also drove large outflows, which in some cases wouldhave reached the minihalos in advance of ionization fronts. in the previouspapers in this series, we carried out high-resolution, three-dimensionaladaptive mesh refinement simulations of outflow-minihalo interactions thatincluded non-equilibrium chemistry, radiative cooling, and turbulent mixing. wefound that, for a fiducial set of parameters, minihalos were transformed intodense, chemically homogenous stellar clusters. here we conduct a suite ofsimulations that follow these interactions over a wide range of parametersincluding minihalo mass, minihalo formation redshift, outflow energy, outflowredshift, distance, concentration, and spin. in almost all cases, the shockedminihalos form molecules through nonequillibrium reactions and then coolrapidly to become compact, chemically-homogenous stellar clusters. furthermore,we show that the unique properties of these clusters make them a prime targetfor direct study with the next generation of telescopes, and that there aremany reasons to suspect that their low-redshift counterparts are the observedpopulation of halo globular clusters.

1110.0571	the pollution of pristine material in compressible turbulence	the first generation of stars had very different properties than laterstellar generations, as they formed from a "pristine" gas that was free ofheavy elements. normal star formation took place only after the first starspolluted the surrounding turbulent interstellar gas, increasing its local heavyelement concentration, z, beyond a critical value, z_c (10^-8 &lt; z_c &lt;10^-5).motivated by this astrophysical problem, we investigate the fundamental physicsof the pollution of pristine fluid elements in isotropic compressibleturbulence. turbulence stretches the pollutants, produces concentrationstructures at small scales, and brings the pollutants and the unpolluted flowin closer contact. our theoretical approach employs the probabilitydistribution function (pdf) method for turbulent mixing. we adopt three pdfclosure models and derive evolution equations for the pristine fraction fromthe models. to test and constrain the theoretical models, we conduct numericalsimulations for decaying passive scalars in isothermal turbulent flows withmach numbers of 0.9 and 6.2, and compute the mass fraction, p(z_c, t), of theflow with z &lt; z_c. in the mach 0.9 flow, the evolution of p(z_c, t)$ is welldescribed by a continuous convolution model and dp(z_c, t)/dt = p(z_c, t)ln[p(z_c, t)]/tau_con, if the mass fraction of the polluted flow is larger than~ 0.1. if the initial pollutant fraction is smaller than ~ 0.1, an early phaseexists during which the pristine fraction follows an equation from a nonlinearintegral model: dp(z_c, t)/dt = p(z_c, t) [p(z_c, t)-1]/tau_int. the timescalestau_con and tau_int are measured from our simulations. when normalized to theflow dynamical time, the decay of p(z_ c, t) in the mach 6.2 flow is slowerthan at mach 0.9, and we show that p(z_c, t) in the mach 6.2 flow can be wellfit using a formula from a generalized version of the self-convolution model.

1112.0317	identification of a fundamental transition in a turbulently-supported  interstellar medium	the interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies is a multiphase gas in whichturbulent support is at least as important as thermal pressure. sustaining thisconfiguration requires continuous radiative cooling, such that the overallaverage cooling rate matches the decay rate of turbulent energy into themedium. here we carry out a set of numerical simulations of a stratified,turbulently stirred, radiatively cooled medium, which uncover a fundamentaltransition at a critical one-dimensional turbulent velocity of ~ 35 km/s. atturbulent velocities below ~35 km/s, corresponding to temperatures below300,000 k, the medium is stable, as the time for gas to cool is roughlyconstant as a function of temperature. on the other hand, at turbulentvelocities above the critical value, the gas is shocked into an unstable regimein which the cooling time increases strongly with temperature, meaning that asubstantial fraction of the interstellar medium is unable to cool on aturbulent dissipation timescale. this naturally leads to runaway heating andejection of gas from any stratified medium with a one-dimensional turbulentvelocity above ~35 km/s, a result that has implications for galaxy evolution atall redshifts.

1206.6516	mixing of clumpy supernova ejecta into molecular clouds	several lines of evidence, from isotopic analyses of meteorites to studies ofthe sun's elemental and isotopic composition, indicate that the solar systemwas contaminated early in its evolution by ejecta from a nearby supernova (sn).previous models have invoked sn material being injected into an extantprotoplanetary disk, or isotropically expanding ejecta sweeping over a distant(&gt;10 pc) cloud core, simultaneously enriching it and triggering its collapse.here we consider a new astrophysical setting: the injection of clumpy snejecta, as observed in the cas a sn remnant, into the molecular gas at theperiphery of an hii region created by the sn's progenitor star. to track theseinteractions we have conducted a suite of high-resolution (1500^3 effective) 3dsimulations that follow the evolution of individual clumps as they move intomolecular gas. even at these high resolutions, our simulations do not quiteachieve numerical convergence, due to the challenge of properly resolving thesmall-scale mixing of ejecta and molecular gas, although they do allow somerobust conclusions to be drawn. isotropically exploding ejecta do not penetrateinto the molecular cloud, but, if cooling is properly accounted for, clumpyejecta penetrate to distances ~10^18 cm and mix effectively with star-formingmolecular gas. the ~2 m_\odot high-metallicity ejecta from a core-collapse snis likely to mix with ~2 \times 10^4 m_\odot of molecular gas. thus all starsforming late (~5 myr) in the evolution of an hii region may be contaminated bysn ejecta at a level ~10^-4. this level of contamination is consistent with theabundances of short-lived radionuclides and possibly some stable isotopicshifts in the early solar system, and is potentially consistent with theobserved variability in stellar elemental abundances. sn contamination offorming planetary systems may be a common, universal process.

1302.3626	understanding galaxy outflows as the product of unstable turbulent  support	the interstellar medium is a multiphase gas in which turbulent support is asimportant as thermal pressure. sustaining this configuration requires bothcontinuous turbulent stirring and continuous radiative cooling to match thedecay of turbulent energy. while this equilibrium can persist for smallturbulent velocities, if the one-dimensional velocity dispersion is larger thanapproximately 35 km/s, the gas moves into an unstable regime that leads torapid heating. i study the implications of this turbulent runaway, showing thatit causes a hot gas outflow to form in all galaxies with a gas surface densityabove approximately 50 solar masses/pc^2 corresponding to a star formation rateper unit area of 0.1$ solar masses/yr/kpc^2. for galaxies with escapevelocities above 200 km/s, the sonic point of this hot outflow should lieinterior to the region containing cold gas and stars, while for galaxies withsmaller escape velocities, the sonic point should lie outside this region. thisleads to efficient cold cloud acceleration in higher mass galaxies, while inlower mass galaxies, clouds may be ejected by random turbulent motions ratherthan accelerated by the wind. finally, i show that energy balance cannot beachieved at all for turbulent media above a surface density of approximately10^5 solar masses/pc^2.

1305.3276	hybrid cosmological simulations with stream velocities	in the early universe, substantial relative "stream" velocities between thegas and dark matter arise due to radiation pressure and persist afterrecombination. to asses the impact of these velocities on high-redshiftstructure formation, we carry out a suite of high-resolution adaptive meshrefinement (amr) cosmological simulations, which use smoothed particlehydrodynamic datasets as initial conditions, converted using a new tooldeveloped for this work. these simulations resolve structures with masses assmall as a few 100 m$_\odot$, and we focus on the $10^6$ m$_\odot$ "mini-halos"in which the first stars formed. at $z \approx 17,$ the presence of streamvelocities has only a minor effect on the number density of halos below $10^6$m$_\odot$, but it greatly suppresses gas accretion onto all halos and the darkmatter structures around them. stream velocities lead to significantly lowerhalo gas fractions, especially for $\approx 10^5$ m$_\odot$ objects, an effectthat is likely to depend on the orientation of a halo's accretion lanes. thisreduction in gas density leads to colder, more compact radial profiles, and itsubstantially delays the redshift of collapse of the largest halos, leading todelayed star formation and possibly delayed reionization. these manydifferences suggest that future simulations of early cosmological structureformation should include stream velocities to properly predict gas evolution,star-formation, and the epoch of reionization.

1507.07538	"observing and analyzing" images from a simulated high redshift universe	we investigate the high-redshift evolution of the restframe uv-luminosityfunction (lf) of galaxies via hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, coupledwith an emulated observational astronomy pipeline that provides a directcomparison with observations. we do this by creating mock images and syntheticgalaxy catalogs of approximately 100 square arcminute fields from the numericalmodel at redshifts ~ 4.5 to 10.4. we include the effects of dust extinction andthe point spread function (psf) for the hubble wfc3 camera for comparison withspace observations. we also include the expected zodiacal background to predictits effect on space observations, including future missions such as the jameswebb space telescope (jwst). when our model catalogs are fitted to schechterfunction parameters, we predict that the faint-end slope alpha of the lfevolves as alpha = -1.16 - 0.12 z over the redshift range z ~ 4.5 to 7.7, inexcellent agreement with observations from e.g., hathi et al. (2010). however,for redshifts z ~ 6 to 10.4, alpha(z) appears to display a shallower evolution,alpha = -1.79 - 0.03 z. augmenting the simulations with more detailed physics -specifically stellar winds and supernovae (sn) - produces similar results. themodel shows an overproduction of galaxies, especially at faint magnitudes,compared with the observations, although the discrepancy is reduced when dustextinction is taken into account.

1511.05158	atomic chemistry in turbulent astrophysical media ii: effect of the  redshift zero metagalactic background	we carry out direct numerical simulations of turbulent astrophysical mediaexposed to the redshift zero metagalactic background. the simulations assumesolar composition and explicitly track ionizations, recombinations, andion-by-ion radiative cooling for hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,neon, sodium, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, calcium, and iron. each run reaches aglobal steady state that not only depends on the ionization parameter, $u,$ andmass-weighted average temperature, $t_{\rm mw},$ but also on the theone-dimensional turbulent velocity dispersion, \soned. we carry out runs thatspan a grid of models with $u$ ranging from 0 to 10$^{-1}$ and \soned\ rangingfrom 3.5 to 58 km s$^{-1}$, and we vary the product of the mean density and thedriving scale of the turbulence, $nl,$ which determines the average temperatureof the medium, from $nl =10^{16}$ to $nl =10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. the turbulentmach numbers of our simulations vary from $m \approx 0.5$ for the lowestvelocity dispersions cases to $m \approx 20$ for the largest velocitydispersion cases. when $m \lesssim1,$ turbulent effects are minimal, and thespecies abundances are reasonably described as those of a uniform photoionizedmedium at a fixed temperature. on the other hand, when $m \gtrsim 1,$ dynamicalsimulations such as the ones carried out here are required to accuratelypredict the species abundances. we gather our results into a set of tables, toallow future redshift zero studies of the intergalactic medium to account forturbulent effects.

0806.3268	subgrid modeling of agn-driven turbulence in galaxy clusters	hot, underdense bubbles powered by active galactic nuclei (agn) are likely toplay a key role in halting catastrophic cooling in the centers of cool-coregalaxy clusters. we present three-dimensional simulations that capture theevolution of such bubbles, using an adaptive-mesh hydrodynamic code, flash3, towhich we have added a subgrid model of turbulence and mixing. while pure-hydrosimulations indicate that agn bubbles are disrupted into resolution-dependentpockets of underdense gas, proper modeling of subgrid turbulence indicates thatthis a poor approximation to a turbulent cascade that continues far beyond theresolution limit. instead, rayleigh-taylor instabilities act to effectively mixthe heated region with its surroundings, while at the same time preserving itas a coherent structure, consistent with observations. thus bubbles aretransformed into hot clouds of mixed material as they move outwards in thehydrostatic intracluster medium (icm), much as large airbursts lead to adistinctive ``mushroom cloud'' structure as they rise in the hydrostaticatmosphere of earth. properly capturing the evolution of such clouds hasimportant implications for many icm properties. in particular, it significantlychanges the impact of agn on the distribution of entropy and metals incool-core clusters such as perseus.

astro-ph;0002164	is there a detectable vishniac effect?	the dominant linear contribution to cosmic microwave background (cmb)fluctuations at small angular scales (less than one arcsec) is a second-ordercontribution known as the vishniac or ostriker-vishniac effect. this effect iscaused by the scattering of cmb photons off free electrons after the universehas been reionized, and is dominated by linear perturbations near the r_v =2mpc/(h gamma/0.2) scale in the cold dark matter cosmogony. as the reionizationof the universe requires that nonlinear objects exist on some scale, however,one can compare the scale responsible for reionization to r_v and ask if alinear treatment is even feasible in different scenarios of reionization. foran omega_0 = 1 cosmology normalized to cluster abundances, only about 65% ofthe linear integral is valid if reionization is due to quasars in halos of mass10^9 solar, while 75% of the integral is valid if reionization was caused bystars in 10^6 solar mass halos. in lambda or open cosmologies, both theredshift of reionization and z_v are pushed further back, but still only 75% to85% of the linear integral is valid, independent of the ionization scenario. wepoint out that all odd higher-order moments from vishniac fluctuations are zerowhile even moments are non-zero, regardless of the gaussianity of the densityperturbations. this provides a defining characteristic of the vishniac effectthat differentiates it from other secondary perturbations and may be helpful inseparating them.

astro-ph;0004289	the influence of galactic outflows on the formation of nearby dwarf  galaxies	we show that the gas in growing density perturbations is vulnerable to theinfluence of winds outflowing from nearby collapsed galaxies that have alreadyformed stars. this suggests that the formation of nearby galaxies with massesless than 10^9 solar masses is likely to be suppressed, irrespective of thedetails of galaxy formation. an impinging wind may shock heat the gas of anearby perturbation to above the virial temperature, thereby mechanicallyevaporating the gas, or the baryons may be stripped from the perturbationentirely if they are accelerated to above the escape velocity. we show thatbaryonic stripping is the most effective of these two processes, becauseshock-heated clouds that are too large to be stripped are able to radiativelycool within a sound-crossing time, limiting evaporation. the intergalacticmedium temperatures and star-formation rates required for outflows to have asignificant influence on the formation of low-mass galaxies are consistent withcurrent observations, but may soon be examined directly via associateddistortions in the cosmic microwave background, and with near-infraredobservations from the next generation space telescope, which may detect thesupernovae from early-forming stars.

astro-ph;0011258	high-redshift galaxy outflows and the formation of dwarf galaxies	we examine the effects of galaxy outflows on the formation of dwarf galaxiesin numerical simulations of the high-redshift universe. using a smoothedparticle hydrodynamic code, we conduct two detailed simulations of a (5.2mpc/h)^3 comoving volume of the universe. in both simulations we implementsimple, well-motivated models of galaxy identification and star formation,while our second simulation also includes a simple ``blow-out'' model of galaxyoutflows in which supernova driven winds from newly formed disk galaxiespunch-out and shock the intergalactic medium while leaving the host galaxiesintact. a direct comparison between these simulations suggests that there aretwo major mechanisms by which outflows affect dwarf formation. firstly, theformation of an outflow slows down the further accretion of gas onto a galaxy,causing an overall decrease of approximately 50% in the total gas mass accretedby the objects in our simulations. additionally, our simulations uncover asignificant population of approximately 10^9 solar mass objects whose formationis suppressed by the mechanism of ``baryonic stripping,'' in which outflowsfrom early galaxies strip the gas out of nearby overdense regions that wouldhave otherwise later formed into dwarf galaxies. this mechanism may beimportant in explaining the observed discrepancy between the number of dwarfgalaxies predicted and observed in the local group and provide a naturalexplanation for the formation of empty halos which may be required by theexistence of the extremely gas-poor extra-galactic high-velocity clouds.

astro-ph;0012152	linking the metallicity distribution of galactic halo stars to the  enrichment history of the universe	we compare the metallicity distribution of galactic halo stars with 3drealizations of hierarchical galaxy formation. outflows from dwarf galaxiesenrich the intergalactic medium inhomogeneously, at a rate depending on thelocal galaxy density. consequently, the first stars created in smallearly-forming galaxies are less metal-rich that the first stars formed in moremassive galaxies which typically form later. as most halo stars are likely tooriginate in accreted dwarfs, while disk stars formed out of outflow-enrichedgas, this scenario naturally generates a ``metallicity floor'' for old diskstars, which we find to be roughly coincident with the higher end of ourpredicted metallicity distribution of halo stars, in agreement withobservations. the broad and centrally peaked distribution of halo starmetallicities is well reproduced in our models, with a natural dispersiondepending on the exact accretion history. our modeling includes the important``baryonic stripping'' effect of early outflows, which brush away the tenuouslyheld gas in neighboring pre-virialized density perturbations. this strippingprocess does not significantly modify the predicted shape of the halo starmetal distribution but inhibits star-formation and hence the number of accretedstars, helping to reproduce the observed total galactic halo luminosity andalso the lack of low-luminosity local dwarf galaxies relative to n-bodypredictions.

astro-ph;0201094	how is the reionization epoch defined?	we study the effect of a prolonged epoch of reionization on the angular powerspectrum of the cosmic microwave background. typically reionization studiesassume a sudden phase transition, with the intergalactic gas moving from afully neutral to a fully ionized state at a fixed redshift. such models are atodds, however, with detailed investigations of reionization, which favor a moreextended transition. we have modified the code cmbfast to allow the treatmentof more realistic reionization histories and applied it to data obtained fromnumerical simulations of reionization. we show that the prompt reionizationassumed by cmbfast in its original form heavily contaminates any constraintderived on the reionization redshift. we find, however, that promptreionization models give a reasonable estimate of the epoch at which the meancosmic ionization fraction was ~50%, and provide a very good measure of theoverall thomson optical depth. the overall differences in the temperature(polarization) angular power spectra between prompt and extended models withequal optical depths are less than 1% (10%).

astro-ph;0201463	early enrichment of the intergalactic medium and its feedback on galaxy  formation	supernova-driven outflows from early galaxies may have had a large impact onthe kinetic and chemical structure of the intergalactic medium (igm). we usethree-dimensional monte carlo cosmological realizations of a simple linearpeaks model to track the time evolution of such metal-enriched outflows andtheir feedback on galaxy formation. we find that at most 30% of the igm byvolume is enriched to values above 10^-3 solar in models that only includeobjects that cool by atomic transitions. the majority of enrichment occursrelatively early (5 &lt; z &lt; 12) and resulting in a mass-averaged cosmologicalmetallicity between 10^-3 and 10^-1.5 solar. the inclusion of population iiiobjects that cool through h2 line emission has only a minor impact on theseresults: increasing the mean metallicity and filling factor by at most a factorof 1.4, and moving the dawn of the enrichment epoch to a redshift ofapproximately 14 at the earliest. thus enrichment by outflowing galaxies islikely to have been incomplete and inhomogeneous, biased to the areas near thestarbursting galaxies themselves. models with a 10% star formation efficiencycan satisfactorily reproduce the nearly constant (2 &lt; z &lt; 5, z approximately3.5 x 10^-4 solar) metallicity of the low column density ly-alpha forestderived by songaila (2001), an effect of the decreasing efficiency of metalloss from larger galaxies. finally, we show that igm enrichment is intimatelytied to the ram-pressure stripping of baryons from neighboring perturbations.this results in the suppression of at least 20% of the dwarf galaxies in themass range 10^8.5 to 10^9.5 solar, in all models with filling factors greaterthan 2%, and an overall suppression of approximately 50% of dwarf galaxies inthe most observationally-favored model.

astro-ph;0205276	an analytical approach to inhomogeneous structure formation	we develop an analytical formalism that is suitable for studyinginhomogeneous structure formation, by studying the joint statistics of darkmatter halos forming at two points. extending the bond et al. (1991) derivationof the mass function of virialized halos, based on excursion sets, we derive anapproximate analytical expression for the ``bivariate'' mass function of halosforming at two redshifts and separated by a fixed comoving lagrangian distance.our approach also leads to a self-consistent expression for the nonlinearbiasing and correlation function of halos, generalizing a number of previousresults including those by kaiser (1984) and mo &amp; white (1996). we compare ourapproximate solutions to exact numerical results within the excursion-setframework and find them to be consistent to within 2% over a wide range ofparameters. our formalism can be used to study various feedback effects duringgalaxy formation analytically, as well as to simply construct observablequantities dependent on the spatial distribution of objects. a code thatimplements our method is publicly available athttp://www.arcetri.astro.it/~evan/gemini

astro-ph;0207535	feedback processes in early-type galaxies	we present a phenomenological model of feedback in early-type galaxies thattracks the evolution of the interstellar medium gas mass, metallicity, andtemperature. modeling the star formation rate as a schmidt law with atemperature-dependent efficiency, we find that intermittent episodes of starformation are common in moderate-size ellipticals. our model is applicable inthe case in which the thermalization time from sn is sufficiently long thatspatial variations are relatively unimportant, an appropriate assumption forthe empirical parameters adopted here. the departure from a standard scenarioof passive evolution implies significantly younger luminosity-weighted ages forthe stellar populations of low-mass galaxies at moderate redshifts, even thoughthe more physically meaningful mass-weighted ages are changed only slightly.secondary bursts of star formation also lead to a natural explanation of thelarge scatter in the nuv-optical relation observed in clusters at moderateredshift and account for the population of e+a galaxies that display aspheroidal morphology. as the late-time formation of stars in our model is dueto the gradual cooling of the interstellar medium, which is heated totemperatures ~1 kev by the initial burst of supernovae, our conclusions do notrely on any environmental effects or external mechanisms. furthermore, a simpleestimate of the x-ray emission from this supernova heated gas leads to an l_xvs l_b correlation that is in good agreement with observed values. thusfeedback processes may be essential to understanding the observed properties ofearly-type galaxies from the optical to the x-ray.

astro-ph;0209216	nonlinear clustering during the cosmic dark ages and its effect on the  21-cm background from minihalos	hydrogen atoms inside virialized minihalos generate a radiation backgroundfrom redshifted 21-cm line emission whose angular fluctuations reflectclustering during before and during reionization. we have shown elsewhere thatthis emission may be detectable with the planned low frequency array (lofar)and square kilometer array (ska) in a flat lambdacdm. this is a direct probe ofstructure during the ``dark ages'' at redshifts z&gt;6 and down to smaller scalesthan have previously been constrained. in our original calculation, we used astandard approximation known as the ``linear bias'' [e.g. mo &amp; white (1996)].here we improve upon that treatment by considering the effect of nonlinearclustering. to accomplish this, we develop a new analytical method forcalculating the nonlinear eulerian bias of halos, which should be useful forother applications as well. predictions of this method are compared with theresults of lambdacdm n-body simulations, showing significantly better agreementthan the standard linear bias approximation. when applied to the 21-cmbackground from minihalos, our formalism predicts fluctuations that differ fromour original predictions by up to 30% at low frequencies and small scales.however, within the range of frequencies and angular scales at which the signalcould be observable by lofar and ska as currently planned, the differences aresmall and our original predictions prove robust. our results indicate thatwhile a smaller frequency bandwidth of observation leads to a higher signalthat is more sensitive to nonlinear effects, this effect is counteracted by thelowered sensitivity of the radio arrays. we calculate the best frequencybandwidth for these observations to be delta nu~2 mhz.(abbreviated)

astro-ph;0301628	the detectability of the first stars and their cluster enrichment  signatures	we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the detectability of the firststars and their enrichment signatures in galaxy clusters. we show that the meanmetallicity of outflows from objects containing these population iii (popiii)stars is well above the critical transition metallicity (z_cr \sim 10^-4) thatmarks the formation of normal stars. thus the fraction of popiii objects formedas a function of redshift is heavily dependent on the distribution of metalsand fairly independent of the precise value of z_cr. using an analytical modelof inhomogenous structure formation, we study the evolution of popiii objectsas a function of the star formation efficiency, imf, and efficiency of outflowgeneration. for all models, popiii objects tend to be in the 10^6.5-10^7.0solar mass range, just large enough to cool within a hubble time, but smallenough that they are not clustered near areas of previous star formation.although the mean metallicity exceeds z_cr at a redshift of 15 in all models,the peak of popiii star formation occurs at z \sim 10, and such stars continueto form well into the observable range. we discuss the observational propertiesof these objects, some of which may have already been detected in ongoingsurveys of high-redshift lyman-alpha emitters. finally, we combine our popiiidistributions with the yield models of heger and woosley (2002) to study theirimpact on the intracluster medium (icm) in galaxy clusters. we find that popiiistars can contribute no more than 20% of the iron observed in the icm, althoughtheir peculiar elemental yields help to reconcile theoretical models with theobserved fe and si/fe abundances. however, these stars tend to overproduce s/feand their associated sn heating falls far short of the observed level of 1 kevper icm gas particle.

astro-ph;0302335	on the detectability of the cosmic dark ages: 21-cm lines from minihalos	in the standard cold dark matter (cdm) theory of structure formation,virialized minihalos (with t_vir = 10,000 k or less) form in abundance at highredshift (z &gt; 6), during the cosmic "dark ages." the hydrogen in theseminihalos, the first nonlinear baryonic structures to form in the universe, ismostly neutral and sufficiently hot and dense to emit strongly at the 21-cmline. we calculate the emission from individual minihalos and the radiationbackground contributed by their combined effect. minihalos create a "21-cmforest" of emission lines. we predict that the angular fluctuations in this21-cm background should be detectable with the planned lofar and ska radioarrays, thus providing a direct probe of structure formation during the "darkages." such a detection will serve to confirm the basic cdm paradigm whileconstraining the background cosmology parameters, the shape of thepower-spectrum of primordial density fluctuations, the onset and duration ofthe reionization epoch, and the conditions which led to the first stars andquasars. we present results here for the currently-favored, flat lcdm model,for different tilts of the primordial power spectrum. these minihalos will alsocause a "21-cm forest" of absorption lines, as well, in the spectrum of radiocontinuum sources at high redshift, if the latter came into existence beforethe end of reionization.

astro-ph;0401087	quasar feedback: the missing link in structure formation	we consider the impact of quasar outflows on structure formation. suchoutflows are potentially more important than galactic winds, which appearinsufficient to produce the level of preheating inferred from x-rayobservations of galaxy clusters. using a simple analytical model for thedistribution of quasars with redshift, coupled with a one-dimensionalsedov-taylor model for outflows, we are able to make robust statements abouttheir impact of on structure formation. as large regions of the igm are heatedabove a critical entropy of approximately 100 kev cm^2, cooling becomeimpossible within them, regardless of changes in density. on quasar scales,this has the effect of inhibiting further formation, resulting in the observedfall-off in their number densities below z = 2. on galaxy scales, quasarfeedback fixes the turn-over scale in the galaxy luminosity function (l_*) asthe nonlinear scale at the redshift of strong feedback. the galaxy luminosityfunction then remains largely fixed after this epoch, consistent with recentobservations and in contrast to the strong evolution predicted in more standardgalaxy-formation models. finally, strong quasar feedback explains why theintracluster medium is observed to have been pre-heated to entropy levels justabove s_crit, the minimum excess that would not have been erased by cooling.the presence of such outflows is completely consistent with the observedproperties of the lyman-alpha forest at z ~ 2, but is expected to have asubstantial and detectable impact on compton distortions observed in themicrowave background and the multiphase properties of the "warm-hot" (z=0)circumgalactic medium.

astro-ph;0408340	triggering the formation of halo globular clusters with galaxy outflows	we investigate the interactions of high-redshift galaxy outflows withlow-mass virialized (tvir &lt; 10,000k) clouds of primordial composition. whileatomic cooling allows star formation in larger primordial objects, such"minihalos" are generally unable to form stars by themselves. however, thelarge population of high-redshift starburst galaxies may have inducedwidespread star formation in these objects, via shocks that caused intensecooling both through nonequilibrium h2 formation and metal-line emission. usinga simple analytic model, we show that the resulting star clusters naturallyreproduce three key features of the observed population of halo globularclusters (gcs). first, the 10,000 k maximum virial temperature corresponds tothe ~ 10^6 solar mass upper limit on the stellar mass of gcs. secondly, themomentum imparted in such interactions is sufficient to strip the gas from itsassociated dark matter halo, explaining why gcs do not reside in dark matterpotential wells. finally, the mixing of ejected metals into the primordial gasis able to explain the ~ 0.1 dex homogeneity of stellar metallicities within agiven gc, while at the same time allowing for a large spread in metallicitybetween different clusters. to study this possibility in detail, we use asimple 1d numerical model of turbulence transport to simulate mixing incloud-outflow interactions. we find that as the shock shears across the side ofthe cloud, kelvin-helmholtz instabilities arise, which cause mixing of enrichedmaterial into &gt; 20% of the cloud. such estimates ignore the likely presence oflarge-scale vortices, however, which would further enhance turbulencegeneration. thus quantitative mixing predictions must await more detailednumerical studies.

(1998) does wellfor all parameters except for objects with different masses at smallseparations. we find that the standard mapping between lagrangian and eulerianbias performs well for rare objects at all separations, but fails if theobjects are highly-nonlinear (low-sigma) peaks. in the lagrangian case in whichthe formation redshifts differ, the sb02 model does well for all separationsand combinations of masses, apart from a discrepancy at small separations insituations in which the smaller object is formed earlier and the differencebetween redshifts or masses is large. as this same limitation arises in thestandard approach to the single-point progenitor distribution developed bylacey &amp; cole (1993), we conclude that a more complete understanding of theprogenitor distribution is the most important outstanding issue in the analyticmodeling of lagrangian bias.

astro-ph;0411035	the impact of small-scale structure on cosmological ionization fronts  and reionization	the propagation of cosmological ionization fronts during the reionization ofthe universe is strongly influenced by small-scale gas inhomogeneities due tostructure formation. these inhomogeneities include both collapsed minihalos,which are generally self-shielding, and lower-density structures, which arenot. the minihalos are dense and sufficiently optically-thick to trapintergalactic ionization fronts, blocking their path and robbing them ofionizing photons until the minihalo gas is expelled as an evaporative wind. thelower-density structures do not trap these fronts, but they can slow them downby increasing the overall recombination rate in the intergalactic medium. inthis paper we study the effects of both types of inhomogeneities, includingnonlinear clustering effects, and we find that both igm clumping and collapsedminihalos have significant yet qualitatively different impacts on reionization.while the number density of minihalos on average increases strongly with time,the density of minihalos inside h ii regions around ionizing sources is largelyconstant. thus the impact of minihalos is essentially to decrease the number ofionizing photons available to the igm at all epochs, which is equivalent to areduction in the luminosity of each source. on the other hand, the effect ofigm clumping increases strongly with time, slowing down reionization andextending it. thus while the impact of minihalos is largely degenerate with theunknown source efficiency, igm clumping can help significantly in reconcilingthe recent observations of cosmic microwave background polarization with quasarabsorption spectra at z~6, which together point to an early but extendedreionization epoch.

astro-ph;0411187	suppression of dwarf galaxy formation by cosmic shocks	we carry out a numerical study of the effects of supernova-driven shocks ongalaxy formation at z=9. these "cosmic explosions" can have a significantimpact on galaxies forming nearby. we study such interactions in two key cases.in the first case in which the forming galaxy has already virialized, theimpinging shock has only a small effect (&lt; 1% of the gas is removed) and starformation continues relatively unimpeded. however, in the second case in whichthe nearby forming galaxy is at the more diffuse turn-around stage, a largefraction (~70%) of the gas is stripped away from the host dark-matter halo andejected into the intergalactic medium. as the time spent near turn-around ismuch longer than the interval from virialization to galaxy formation due tostrong radiative losses, we expect the second case to be more representative ofthe majority of outflow-galaxy interactions. thus sn-driven pregalacticoutflows may be an efficient mechanism for inhibiting the formation ofneighbouring galaxies at high redshift. we briefly outline the possiblecosmological consequences of this effect.

astro-ph;0504081	what can the distribution of intergalactic metals tell us about the  history of cosmological enrichment?	i study the relationship between the spatial distribution of intergalacticmetals and the masses and ejection energies of the sources that produced them.over a wide range of models, metal enrichment is dominated by the smallestefficient sources, as the enriched volume scales roughly as e^{3/5} ~ m^{3/5}while the number density of sources goes as 1/m. in all cases, the earliestsources have the biggest impact, because fixed comoving distances correspond tosmaller physical distances at higher redshifts. this means that most of theenriched volume is found around rare peaks, and intergalactic metals arenaturally highly clustered. furthermore, this clustering is so strong as tolead to a large overlap between individual bubbles. thus the typical radius ofenriched z ~ 3 regions should be interpreted as a constraint on groupings ofsources rather than the ejection radius of a typical source. similarly, theclustering of enriched regions should be taken as a measurement of source biasrather than mass.

astro-ph;0505135	ionization fronts and their interaction with density fluctuations:  implications for reionization	the propagation of cosmological ionization fronts (i-fronts) duringreionization is strongly influenced by small-scale structure. here we summarizeour recent attemps to understand the effect of this small-scale structure. wepresent high resolution cosmological n-body simulations at high-z (z&gt;6) whichresolve a wide range of halo mass, from minihalos to clusters of large, rarehalos. we also study how minihalos affect i-fronts, through simulations ofminihalo photoevaporation. furthermore, we modify the i-front propagationequations to account for evolving small-scale structure, and incorporate theseresults into a semi-analytical reionization model. when intergalactic mediumclumping and minihalo clustering around sources are included, small-scalestructure affects reionization by slowing it down and extending it in time.this helps to explain observations by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe,which imply an early and extended reionization epoch. we also study how sourceclustering affects the evolution and size of h ii regions, finding, inagreement with simulations, that h ii regions usually expand, rarely shrinking.hence, "relic h ii regions'' are an exception, rather than the rule. when thesuppression of small-mass sources in already-ionized regions by jeans-massfiltering is accounted for, h ii regions are smaller, delaying overlap. we alsopresent a new numerical method for radiative transfer which is fast, efficient,and easily coupled to hydrodynamics and n-body codes, along with sample testsand applications.

astro-ph;0507182	the detectability of pair-production supernovae at z &lt; 6	nonrotating, zero metallicity stars with initial masses 140 &lt; m &lt; 260 solarmasses are expected to end their lives as pair-production supernovae (ppsne),in which an electron-positron pair-production instability triggers explosivenuclear burning. interest in such stars has been rekindled by recenttheoretical studies that suggest primordial molecular clouds preferentiallyform stars with these masses. since metal enrichment is a local process, theresulting ppsne could occur over a broad range of redshifts, in pockets ofmetal-free gas. using the implicit hydrodynamics code kepler, we havecalculated a set of ppsn light curves that addresses the theoreticaluncertainties and allows us to assess observational strategies for findingthese objects at intermediate redshifts. the peak luminosities of typical ppsneare only slightly greater than those of type ia, but they remain bright muchlonger (~ 1 year) and have hydrogen lines. ongoing supernova searches may soonbe able to limit the contribution of these very massive stars to &lt; 1% of thetotal star formation rate density out to z=2 which already provides usefulconstraints for theoretical models. the planned joint dark energy missionsatellite will be able to extend these limits out to z=6.

astro-ph;0507677	relativistic ionization fronts	we derive the equations for the propagation of relativistic ionization frontsin both static and moving gases. we focus on the supersonic r-type phase thatoccurs right after a source turns on, and we compare the nonrelativistic andrelativistic solutions for several important cases. relativistic correctionscan be significant up until the light-crossing time of the equilibriumstromgren sphere. for a static medium, we obtain exact analytical solutions andapply them to the illustrative problems of an o star in a molecular cloud and astarburst in a high-redshift cosmological halo. relativistic corrections can beimportant at early times when the h ii regions are small, as well as at latertimes, if a density gradient causes the i-front to accelerate. for thecosmologically-expanding igm, we derive an analytical solution in the case of asteady source and a constant clumping factor. here relativistic corrections aresignificant for short-lived, highly-luminous sources like qsos at the end ofreionization, but negligible for weaker or higher-redshift sources. finally, wenumerically calculate the evolution of relativistic i-fronts in the presence ofsmall-scale structure and infall, for a large galaxy undergoing a starburst anda luminous, high-redshift qso. for such strong and short-lived sources, therelativistic corrections are quite significant, and small-scale structure candecrease the size of the h ii region by up to an additional ~25%.

astro-ph;0508336	detecting primordial stars	we study the detectability of primordial metal-free stars. cosmologicalenrichment is a local process that takes place over an extended redshift range.while the duration of this transition depends on several unknown factors, inall cases late-forming metal-free stars are found in ~ 10^8 solar mass objects,which are just large enough to cool, but small enough to not be clustered nearareas of previous star formation. we discuss the observational properties ofthese objects, some of which may have already been detected in ongoinglyman-alpha surveys. if metal-free stars have masses between 140 and 260 solarmasses, they are expected to end their lives as pair-production supernovae(ppsne). using the kepler code, we calculate a set of light curves for theseobjects. the peak luminosities of typical ppsne are only slightly greater thanthose of type ia supernovae, but they remain bright much longer (~ 1 year) andhave hydrogen lines. ongoing supernova searches are able to place stringentlimits on the fraction of very massive stars out to redshift 2. the plannedjoint dark energy mission satellite will be able to extend these constraintsout to redshift 6

astro-ph;0606214	quasars: what turns them off?	(abridged) we explore the idea that the anti-hierarchical turn-off observedin the quasar population arises from self-regulating feedback, via an outflowmechanism. using a detailed hydrodynamic simulation we calculate the luminosityfunction of quasars down to a redshift of z=1 in a large, cosmologicallyrepresentative volume. outflows are included explicitly by tracking halomergers and driving shocks into the surrounding intergalactic medium. ourresults are in excellent agreement with measurements of the spatialdistribution of quasars, and we detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasarpairs at very short separations. we also reproduce the anti-hierarchicalturnoff in the quasar luminosity function, however, the magnitude of theturn-off falls short of that observed as well as that predicted by analogoussemi-analytic models. the difference can be traced to the treatment of gasheating within galaxies. the simulated galaxy cluster l_x-t relationship isclose to that observed for z~1 clusters, but the simulated galaxy groups at z=1are significantly perturbed by quasar outflows, suggesting that measurements ofx-ray emission in high-redshift groups could well be a "smoking gun" for theagn heating hypothesis.

astro-ph;0609208	pair-production supernovae: theory and observation	i review the physical properties of pair-production supernovae (ppsne) aswell as the prospects for them to be constrained observationally. in verymassive (140-260 solar mass) stars, much of the pressure support comes from theradiation field, meaning that they are loosely bound, with an adiabaticcoefficient that is close to the minimum stable value. near the end of c/oburning, the central temperature increases to the point that photons begin tobe converted into electron-positron pairs, softening gamma below this criticalvalue. the result is a runaway collapse, followed by explosive burning thatcompletely obliterates the star. while these explosions can be up to 100 timesmore energetic that core collapse and type ia supernovae, their peakluminosities are only slightly greater. however, due both to copious ni-56production and hydrogen recombination, they are brighter much longer, andremain observable for ~ 1 year. since metal enrichment is a local process,ppsne should occur in pockets of metal-free gas over a broad range ofredshifts, greatly enhancing their detectability, and distributing theirnucleosyntehtic products about the milky way. this means that measurements ofthe abundances of metal-free stars should be thought of as directlyconstraining these objects. it also means that ongoing supernova searches,already provide weak constraints for ppsn models. a survey with the nircaminstrument on jwst, on the other hand, would be able to extend these limits toz ~ 10. observing a 0.3 deg^2 patch of sky for one week per year for threeconsecutive years, such a program would either detect or rule out the existenceof these remarkable objects.

astro-ph;0612163	the spatial distribution of the galactic first stars i: high-resolution  n-body approach	we study the spatial distribution of galactic metal-free stars by combiningan extremely high-resolution (7.8 x 10^5 solar masses per particle) cold darkmatter n-body simulation of the milky-way with a semi-analytic model of metalenrichment. this approach allows us to resolve halos with virial temperaturesdown to the 10^4k atomic cooling limit, and it is sufficiently flexible to makea number of robust conclusions, despite the extremely uncertain properties ofthe first stars. galactic metal-free stars are formed over a large redshiftrange, which peaks at z~10, but continues down to z~5, contributing stars atwide range of galactocentric radii. stars containing only metals generated byprimordial stars are similarly widespread. neither changing the efficiency ofmetal dispersal by two orders of magnitude, nor drastically changing theapproximations in our semi-analytical model can affect these result. thus, ifthey have sufficiently long lifetimes, a significant number of stars formed ininitially primordial star clusters should be found in the nearby galactic haloregardless of the specifics of metal-free star formation. observations of metalabundances in galactic halo stars should be taken as directly constraining theproperties of primordial stars, and the lack of metal-free halo stars todayshould be taken as strongly suggesting a 0.8 solar mass lower limit on theprimordial initial mass function.

astro-ph;0612259	the spatial distribution of the galactic first stars ii: sph approach	we use cosmological, chemo-dynamical, smoothed particle hydrodynamicalsimulations of milky-way-analogue galaxies to find the expected present-daydistributions of both metal-free stars that formed from primordial gas and theoldest star populations. we find that metal-free stars continue to form untilz~4 in halos that are chemically isolated and located far away from the biggestprogenitor of the final system. as a result, if the population iii initial massfunction allows stars with low enough mass to survive until z=0 (&lt; 0.8 msol),they would be distributed throughout the galactic halo. on the other hand, theoldest stars form in halos that collapsed close to the highest density peak ofthe final system, and at z=0 they are located preferentially in the centralregion of the galaxy, i.e., in the bulge. according to our models, these trendsare not sensitive to the merger histories of the disk galaxies or theimplementation of supernova feedback. furthermore, these full hydrodynamicsresults are consistent with our n-body results in paper i, and lend furtherweight to the conclusion that surveys of low-metallicity stars in the galactichalo can be used to directly constrain the properties of primordial stars. inparticular, they suggest that the current lack of detections of metal-freestars implies that their lifetimes were shorter than a hubble time, placingconstraints on the metal-free initial mass function.

astro-ph;9807206	how the universe got its spots	the universe displays a three-dimensional pattern of hot and cold spots inthe radiation remnant from the big bang. the global geometry of the universecan be revealed in the spatial distribution of these spots. in a topologicallycompact universe, distinctive patterns are especially prominent in spatialcorrelations of the radiation temperature. whereas these patterns are usuallywashed out in statistical averages, we propose a scheme which uses theuniverse's spots to observe global geometry in a manner analogous to the use ofmultiple images of a gravitationally lensed quasar to study the geometry of thelens. to demonstrate how the geometry of space forms patterns in observationsof the microwave sky, we develop a simple real-space approximation to estimatetemperature correlations for any set of cosmological parameters and any globalgeometry. we present correlated spheres which clearly show geometric patternformation for compact flat universes as well as for the compact negativelycurved space introduced by weeks and another discovered by best. these examplesillustrate how future satellite-based observations of the microwave backgroundcan determine the full geometry of the universe.

0811.2014	predictions of quasar clustering: redshift, luminosity and selection  dependence	we show that current clustering observations of quasars and luminous agn canbe explained by a merger model augmented by feedback from outflows. usingnumerical simulations large enough to study clustering out to 25 comovingh^{-1} mpc, we calculate correlation functions, biases, and correlation lengthsas a function of agn redshift and optical and x-ray luminosity. at opticalwavelengths, our results match a wide range of current observations andgenerate predictions for future data sets. we reproduce the weak luminositydependence of clustering over the currently well-measured range, and predict amuch stronger dependence at higher luminosities. the increase in the amplitudeof binary quasar clustering observed in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) isalso reproduced and is predicted to occur at higher redshift, an effect that isdue to the one halo term in the correlation function. on the other hand, ourresults do not match the rapid evolution of the correlation length observed inthe sdss at z\simeq 3, a discrepancy that is at least partially due todifferences in the scales probed by our simulation versus this survey. in fact,we show that changing the distances sampled from our simulations can producechanges as large as 40% in the fitted correlation lengths. finally, in thex-ray, our simulations produce correlation lengths similar to that observed inthe chandra deep field (cdf) north, but not the significantly largercorrelation length observed in the cdf south.
