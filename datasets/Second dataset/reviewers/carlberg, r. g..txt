0905.0910	a near-infrared excess in the continuum of high-redshift galaxies: a  tracer of star formation and circumstellar disks?	a broad continuum excess in the near-infrared, peaking in the rest-frame at2-5 micron, is detected in a spectroscopic sample of 88 galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0taken from the gemini deep deep survey. line emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs) at 3.3 micron alone cannot explain the excess, which can befit by a spectral component consisting of a template of pah emission linessuperposed on a modified blackbody of temperature t~850 k. the luminosity ofthis near-infrared excess emission at 3 micron is found to be correlated withthe star formation rate of the galaxy. the origin of the near-infrared excessis explored by examining similar excesses observed locally in massive starforming regions, reflection and planetary nebulae, post-asymptotic giant branchstars and in the galactic cirrus. we also consider the potential contributionfrom dust heated around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. we conclude thatthe most likely explanation for the 2-5 micron excess is the contribution fromcircumstellar disks around massive young stellar objects seen in the integratedlight of high-redshift galaxies. assuming circumstellar disks extend down tolower masses, as they do in our own galaxy, the excess emission presents uswith an exciting opportunity to measure the formation rate of planetary systemsat cosmic epochs before our own solar system formed.

0907.1928	type iin supernovae at z ~ 2 from archival data	supernovae have been confirmed to redshift z ~ 1.7 for type ia (thermonucleardetonation of a white dwarf) and to z ~ 0.7 for type ii (collapse of the coreof the star). the subclass type iin supernovae are luminous core-collapseexplosions of massive stars and, unlike other types, are very bright in theultraviolet, which should enable them to be found optically at redshifts z ~ 2and higher. in addition, the interaction of the ejecta with circumstellarmaterial creates strong, long-lived emission lines that allow spectroscopicconfirmation of many events of this type at z ~ 2 for 3 - 5 years afterexplosion. here we report three spectroscopically confirmed type iinsupernovae, at redshifts z = 0.808, 2.013 and 2.357, detected in archival datausing a method designed to exploit these properties at z ~ 2. type iinsupernovae directly probe the formation of massive stars at high redshift. thenumber found to date is consistent with the expectations of a locally measuredstellar initial mass function, but not with an evolving initial mass functionproposed to explain independent observations at low and high redshift.

0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0908.4345	star stream folding by dark galactic sub-halos	star streams in galactic halos are long, thin, unbound structures that willbe disturbed by the thousands dark matter sub-halos that are predicted to beorbiting within the main halo. a sub-halo generally induces a localized wave inthe stream which often evolves into a "z-fold" as an initially trailinginnermost part rotates faster than an initially leading outermost part. thefolding, which becomes increasingly complex with time, leads to an apparentvelocity dispersion increase and thickening of the stream. we measure theequivalent velocity dispersion around the local mean in the simulations,finding that it rises to about 10 km/s after 5 gyr and 20 km/s after 13 gyr.the currently available measurements of the velocity dispersion of halo starstreams range from as small as 2 km/s to slightly over 20 km/s. the streamswith velocity dispersions of 15-20 km/s are compatible with what sub-haloheating would produce. a dynamical understanding of the low velocity dispersionstreams depends on the time since the progenitor's tidal disruption into a thinstream. if the streams are nearly as old as their stars then sub-halos cannotbe present with the predicted numbers and masses. however, the dynamical age ofthe streams can be significantly less than the stars. if the three lowestvelocity streams are assigned ages of 3 gyr, they are in conflict with thesub-halo heating. the main conclusion is that star stream heating is a powerfuland simple test for sub-halo structure.

1002.1249	gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (snls)	the observed brightness of type ia supernovae is affected by gravitationallensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, whichintroduces an additional dispersion into the hubble diagram. we look forevidence of lensing in the supernova legacy survey 3-year data set. weinvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the hubble diagram andthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution offoreground galaxies. a deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, andwell established mass luminosity relations are used. we find evidence of alensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. the current result is limited bythe number of sne, their redshift distribution, and the other sources ofscatter in the hubble diagram. separating the galaxy population into a red anda blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signaldetection. on the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, theprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the massluminosity relations have little effect. we show that for the full supernovalegacy survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type ia sne and ~200photometrically identified type ia sne), there is an 80% probability ofdetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1102.3501	density variations in the nw star stream of m31	the pan andromeda archeological survey (pandas) cfht megaprime survey of them31-m33 system has found a star stream which extends about 120 kpc nw from thecenter of m31. the great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it doesnot significantly intersect the disk of m31, means that it is unusually wellsuited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a testfor the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. the main result of thispaper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about threetimes the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. the probability thatthe variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.as a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the samelocation in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [fe/h]=[0, -0.5] andfind no variations above the expected shot noise. the lumpiness of the streamis not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,nor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible m31satellite galaxies. the stream's density variations appear to be consistentwith the effects of a large population of steep mass function dark mattersub-halos, such as found in lcdm simulations, acting on an approximately 10gyrold star stream. the effects of a single set of halo substructure realizationsare shown for illustration, reserving a statistical comparison for anotherstudy.

(2010) andconley et al. (2011). we use the 472 sne ia in this sample, accounting forrecently discovered correlations between sn ia luminosity and host galaxyproperties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertaintiesdirectly in the cosmological fits. combining the snls3 data with the full wmap7power spectrum, the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy powerspectrum, and a prior on the hubble constant h0 from shoes, in a flat universewe find omega_m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5% measure of thedark energy equation-of-state parameter w. the statistical and systematicuncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertaintiesdominated by the photometric calibration of the sn ia fluxes -- without thesecalibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. whenrelaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega_m=0.271+/-0.015,omega_k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. parameterizing the timeevolution of w as w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), gives w_0=-0.905+/-0.196,w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. all of our results are consistentwith a flat, w=-1 universe. the size of the snls3 sample allows various teststo be performed with the sne segregated according to their light curve and hostgalaxy properties. we find that the cosmological constraints derived from thesedifferent sub-samples are consistent. there is evidence that the coefficient,beta, relating sn ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at&gt;4sigma significance (in addition to the known sn luminosity--host relation);however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and iscurrently a sub-dominant systematic.

1106.4008	constraining type ia supernovae progenitors from three years of snls  data	while it is generally accepted that type ia supernovae are the result of theexplosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting mass in a binary system, thedetails of their genesis still elude us, and the nature of the binary companionis uncertain. kasen (2010) points out that the presence of a non-degeneratecompanion in the progenitor system could leave an observable trace: a fluxexcess in the early rise portion of the lightcurve caused by the ejecta impactwith the companion itself. this excess would be observable only under favorableviewing angles, and its intensity depends on the nature of the companion. wesearched for the signature of a non-degenerate companion in three years ofsupernova legacy survey data by generating synthetic lightcurves accounting forthe effects of shocking and comparing true and synthetic time series withkolmogorov-smirnov tests. our most constraining result comes from noting thatthe shocking effect is more prominent in rest-frame b than v band: we rule outa contribution from white dwarf-red giant binary systems to type ia supernovaexplosions greater than 10% at 2 sigma, and than 20% at 3 sigma level.

0705.0367	is there evidence for a hubble bubble? the nature of type ia supernova  colors and dust in external galaxies	we examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of type iasupernovae (sne ia) for the $\sim 3 \sigma$ detection of a ``hubble bubble'' --a departure of the local value of the hubble constant from its globallyaveraged value \citep{jha:07}. by comparing the mlcs2k2 fits used in that studyto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, wedemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of sn color excesses(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of acolor gradient across the local sample. if the slope of the linear relation($\beta$) between sn color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then thebubble disappears. if, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely frommilky way-like dust, then sn data clearly favors a hubble bubble. wedemonstrate that sn data give $\beta \simeq 2$, instead of the $\beta \simeq 4$one would expect from purely milky-way-like dust. this suggests that either snintrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a singlelight-curve shape parameter, or that dust around sn is unusual. disentanglingthese possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey snia cosmology.

1307.1929	the dynamics of star stream gaps	when a massive object crosses a star stream velocity changes are induced bothalong and transverse to the stream which can lead to the development of avisible gap. for a stream narrow relative to its orbital radius the time ofstream crossing is sufficiently short that the impact approximation can be usedto derive the changes in angular momenta and radial actions along the starstream. the epicyclic approximation is used to calculate the evolution of thedensity of the stream as it orbits around in a galactic potential. analyticexpressions are available for a point mass, however, the general expressionsare easily numerically evaluated for perturbing objects with arbitrary densityprofiles. with a simple allowance for the velocity dispersion of the stream,moderately warm streams can be modeled. the predicted evolution agrees wellwith the outcome of simulations of stellar streams for streams with widths upto 1% of the orbital radius of the stream. the angular momentum distributionwithin the stream shears out gaps with time, further reducing their visibility,although the size of the shear effect requires more detailed simulations. anillustrative model indicates that shear will limit the persistent gaps to aminimum length of a few times the stream width. in general the equations areuseful for dynamical insight into the development of stream gaps and theirmeasurement.

0803.3441	sifto: an empirical method for fitting sne ia light curves	we present sifto, a new empirical method for modeling type ia supernovae (sneia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. we make use ofhigh-redshift sn observations when training the model, allowing us to extend itbluer than rest frame u. this increases the utility of our high-redshift snobservations by allowing us to use more of the available data. we find thatwhen the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription,applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description.sifto therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies differentstretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter andthe stretch in the rest-frame b band. we compare sifto to other publishedlight-curve models by applying them to the same set of sn photometry, anddemonstrate that sifto and salt2 perform better than the alternatives whenjudged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. wefurther demonstrate that when sifto and salt2 are trained on the same data setthe cosmological results agree.

0805.3983	clustering of supernova ia host galaxies	for the first time the cross-correlation between type ia supernova hostgalaxies and surrounding field galaxies is measured using the supernova legacysurvey sample. over the z=0.2 to 0.9 redshift range we find that supernovahosts are correlated an average of 60% more strongly than similarly selectedfield galaxies over the 3-100 arcsec range and about a factor of 3 morestrongly below 10 arcsec. the correlation errors are empirically establishedwith a jackknife analysis of the four snls fields. the hosts are morecorrelated than the field at a significance of 99% in the fitted amplitude andslope, with the point-by-point difference of the two correlation functionshaving a reduced $\chi^2$ for 8 degrees of freedom of 4.3, which has aprobability of random occurrence of less than 3x10^{-5}. the correlation angleis 1.5+/-0.5 arcsec, which deprojects to a fixed co-moving correlation lengthof approximately 6.5+/- 2/h mpc. weighting the field galaxies with the mass andstar formation rate supernova frequencies of the simple a+b model produces goodagreement with the observed clustering. we conclude that these supernovaclustering differences are primarily the expected outcome of the dependence ofsupernova rates on galaxy masses and stellar populations with their clusteringenvironment.

astro-ph;0001364	new techniques for relating dynamically close galaxy pairs to merger and  accretion rates : application to the ssrs2 redshift survey	we introduce two new pair statistics, which relate close galaxy pairs to themerger and accretion rates. we demonstrate the importance of correcting these(and other) pair statistics for selection effects related to sample depth andcompleteness. in particular, we highlight the severe bias that can result fromthe use of a flux-limited survey. the first statistic, denoted n_c, gives thenumber of companions per galaxy, within a specified range in absolutemagnitude. n_c is directly related to the galaxy merger rate. the secondstatistic, called l_c, gives the total luminosity in companions, per galaxy.this quantity can be used to investigate the mass accretion rate. both n_c andl_c are related to the galaxy correlation function and luminosity function in astraightforward manner. we outline techniques which account for variousselection effects, and demonstrate the success of this approach using montecarlo simulations. if one assumes that clustering is independent of luminosity(which is appropriate for reasonable ranges in luminosity), then thesestatistics may be applied to flux-limited surveys.  these techniques are applied to a sample of 5426 galaxies in the ssrs2redshift survey. using close dynamical pairs, we find n_c(-21&lt;m_b&lt;-18) =0.0226+/-0.0052 and l_c(-21&lt;m_b&lt;-18) = 0.0216+/-0.0055 10^{10} h^2 l_sun atz=0.015. these are the first secure estimates of low-z close pair statistics.if n_c remains fixed with redshift, simple assumptions imply that ~ 6.6% ofpresent day galaxies with -21&lt;m_b&lt;-18 have undergone mergers since z=1. whenapplied to redshift surveys of more distant galaxies, these techniques willyield the first robust estimates of evolution in the galaxy merger andaccretion rates.

astro-ph;0002036	the merger rate to redshift one from kinematic pairs: caltech faint  galaxy redshift survey xi	the rate of mass accumulation due to galaxy merging depends on the mass,density, and velocity distribution of galaxies in the near neighborhood of ahost galaxy. the fractional luminosity in kinematic pairs combines all of theseeffects in a single estimator which is relatively insensitive to populationevolution. here we use a k-corrected and evolution compensated volume-limitedsample drawing about 300 redshifts from cfgrs and 3000 from cnoc2 to measurethe rate and redshift evolution of merging. we identify kinematic pairs withprojected separations less than either 50 or 100 \hkpc and rest-frame velocitydifferences of less than 1000\kms. the fractional luminosity in pairs ismodeled as f_l(delta v,r_p,m_r^{ke})(1+z)^{m_l} where [f_l,m_l] are[0.14+/-0.07,0+/-1.4] and [0.37+/-0.7,0.1+/-0.5] for r_p&lt;= 50 and 100\hkpc,respectively (omega_m=0.2, omega_lambda=0.8). the value of m_l is about 0.6larger if lambda=0. to convert these redshift space statistics to a merger ratewe use the data to derive a conversion factor to physical space pair density, amerger probability and a mean in-spiral time. the resulting mass accretion rateper galaxy (m_1,m_2&gt;= 0.2 m*) is 0.02+/-0.01(1+z)^{0.1+/-0.5} m*~gyr^{-1}.present day high-luminosity galaxies therefore have accreted approximately0.15m* of their mass over the approximately 7 gyr to redshift one.

astro-ph;0008201	galaxy groups at intermediate redshift	galaxy groups likely to be virialized are identified within the cnoc2intermediate redshift galaxy survey using an iterative method. thenumber-velocity dispersion relation is in agreement with the low-massextrapolation of the cluster normalized press-schechter function. the two-pointgroup-group correlation function has r_0=6.8+/- 0.3 mpc, which is larger thanthe correlations of individual galaxies at the level predicted from n-bodycalibrated halo clustering.  the groups are stacked in velocity and position to create a sample largeenough for measurement of a density and velocity dispersion profile. thestacked mean galaxy density profile falls nearly as a power law with r^{-2.5}and has no well-defined core. the projected velocity dispersion is examined fora variety of samples with different methods and found to be either flat orslowly rising outwards. the combination of a steeper-than-isothermal densityprofile and the outward rising velocity dispersion implies that themass-to-light ratio of groups rises with radius. the m/l can be kept nearlyconstant if the galaxy orbits are nearly circular, although such strongtangential anisotropy is not supported by other evidence. the segregation ofmass and light is not dependent on galaxy luminosity but is far more prominentin the red galaxies than the blue. the m/l gradient could arise from orbital``sloshing'' of the galaxies in the group halos, dynamical friction acting onthe galaxies in a background of ``classical'' collisionless dark matter, or,more speculatively, the dark matter may have a true core.

astro-ph;0012169	weak lensing study of low mass galaxy groups: implications for omega_m	we report on the first measurement of the average mass and mass-to-lightratio of galaxy groups by analysing the weak lensing signal induced by thesesystems. the groups, which have velocity dispersions of 50-400 km/s, have beenselected from the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxyredshift survey (cnoc2). this survey allows the identification of a largenumber of groups with redshifts ranging from z=0.12-0.55, ideal for a weaklensing analysis of their mass distribution. for our analysis we use a sampleof 50 groups which are selected on the basis of a careful dynamical analysis ofgroup candidates. we detect a signal at the 99% confidence limit. the best fitsingular isothermal sphere model yields an einstein radius of 0.72+-0.29". thiscorresponds to a velocity dispersion of 274^{+48}_{-59} km/s (using photometricredshift distributions for the source galaxies), which is in good agreementwith the dynamical estimate. under the assumption that the light traces themass, we find an average mass-to-light ratio of 191+-83 h msun/lsun in therestframe b band. unlike dynamical estimates, this result is insensitive toproblems associated with determining group membership. after correction of theobserved mass-to-light ratio for luminosity evolution to z=0, we find 254+-110h msun/lsun, lower than what is found for rich clusters. we use the observedmass-to-light ratio to estimate the matter density of the universe, for whichwe find omega_m=0.19+-0.10 (omega_lambda=0), in good agreement with otherrecent estimates. for a closed universe, we obtain omega_m=0.13+-0.07.

astro-ph;0106506	environment and galaxy evolution at intermediate redshift in the cnoc2  survey	(abridged) the systematic variation of galaxy colors and types withclustering environment could either be the result of local conditions atformation or subsequent environmental effects as larger scale structures drawtogether galaxies whose stellar mass is largely in place. at z~0.4 theco-moving galaxy correlation length, r_0, measured in the cnoc2 sample isstrongly color dependent, rising from 2/h mpc to nearly 10/h mpc as thevolume-limited subsamples range from blue to red. the luminosity dependence ofr_0 at z~0.4 is weak below l_ast although there is an upturn at high luminositywhere its interpretation depends on separating it from the r_0-color relation.the dominant effect of the group environment on star formation is seen in theradial gradient of the mean galaxy colors which on the average become redderthan the field toward the group centers. the redder-than-field trend applies togroups with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion, sigma_1&gt;150 kms. there is anindication, somewhat statistically insecure, that the high luminosity galaxiesin groups with sigma_1&lt;125 kms become bluer toward the group center. weconclude that the higher velocity dispersion groups largely act to suppressstar formation relative to the less clustered field, leading to ``embalmed''galaxies. the tidal fields within the groups appear to be a strong candidatefor the physical source of the reduction of star formation in group galaxiesrelative to field. tides operate effectively at all velocity dispersions toremove gas rich companions and low density gas in galactic halos. given thatmuch of the field population is in groups we suggest that this suppression maybe the dominant galaxy evolution force at low redshift.

astro-ph;0203055	globular clusters at high redshift	globular clusters will be present at high redshifts, near the very beginningof the galaxy formation process. stellar evolution ensures that they will bemuch more luminous than today. we show that the redshift distribution atnano-jansky levels should be very broad, extending up to the redshift offormation. a bracketing range of choices for the redshift of formation,spectral energy evolution models and population density evolution, leads to theconclusion that the sky densities should be around 10^7 per square degree at1njy (m_ab=31.4 mag) in bands around 4 microns. such high sky densities beginto present a confusion problem at these wavelengths to diffraction limited 6mclass telescopes. these star-like, low metallicity, clusters will be asignificant foreground population for ``first light'' object searches. on theother hand they are an exceptionally interesting ``second light'' population intheir own right. depending on the details of galaxy assembly, the clusters willhave a noticeable cross-correlation with galaxies on scales of about 20 arcsec,or less, depending on the details of the buildup of galaxy assembly afterglobular cluster formation. high redshift globular clusters will be anaccessible, direct, probe of the earliest stages of the formation of galaxiesand the buildup of metals in the universe.

astro-ph;0402436	the gemini deep deep survey: i. introduction to the survey, catalogs and  composite spectra	the gemini deep deep survey (gdds) is an ultra-deep (k&lt;20.6 mag, i&lt;24.5 mag)redshift survey targeting galaxies in the "redshift desert" between 1&lt;z&lt;2. theprimary goal of the survey is to constrain the space density at high redshiftof evolved high-mass galaxies. we obtained 309 spectra in four widely-separated30 arcmin^2 fields using the gemini north telescope and the gemini multi-objectspectrograph (gmos). the spectra define a one-in-two sparse sample of thereddest and most luminous galaxies near the i-k vs. i color-magnitude trackmapped out by passively evolving galaxies in the redshift interval 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.8.this sample is augmented by a one-in-seven sparse sample of the remaininghigh-redshift galaxy population. typical exposures times were 20-30 hours perfield (in nod &amp; shuffle mode), and the resulting spectra are the deepest everobtained. in this paper we present our sample of 309 spectra, along withredshifts, identifications of spectral features, and photometry. the infraredselection underlying the survey means that the gdds is observing not onlystar-forming galaxies, as in most high-redshift galaxy surveys, but alsoquiescent evolved galaxies. the median redshift of the whole gdds sample isz=1.1. together with the data and catalogs, we present a summary of thecriteria for selecting the gdds fields, the rationale behind our mask designs,an analysis of the completeness of the survey, and a description of the datareduction procedures used. all data from the gdds are publicly available.(abridged)

astro-ph;9906470	differential galaxy evolution in cluster and field galaxies at z=0.3	(abridged) we measure spectral indices for 1823 galaxies in the cnoc1 sampleof fifteen x-ray luminous clusters at 0.18&lt;z&lt;0.55, to investigate themechanisms responsible for differential evolution between the galaxy clusterand field environments. the radial trends of d4000, hdelta and [oii] are allconsistent with an age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of starformation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center.throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older meanstellar populations than field galaxies. from the subsample of galaxies moreluminous than m_r=-18.8 + 5log h, we identify a sample of k+a galaxies, whichmay result from recently terminated star formation. corrected for a systematiceffect which results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral indexmeasurements, we estimate that k+a galaxies make up only 1.5 +/- 0.8 % of thecluster sample, and 1.2 +/- 0.8 % of the field. we compare our data withspectrophotometric models and conclude that up to 1.9 +/- 0.8 % of the clusterpopulation may have had its star formation recently truncated without astarburst. however, this is still not significantly greater than the fractionof such galaxies in the field, 3.1 +/- 1.0 %. furthermore, we do not detect anexcess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone a starburst withinthe last 1 gyr. our results imply that these cluster environments are notresponsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxyfraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster--specific phenomenon. wesuggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be agradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disk overfairly long timescales.

astro-ph;9909074	population gradients in galaxy clusters at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6	we present a principal component analysis of galaxy spectra from the cnocsample of rich x-ray luminous clusters at 0.18 &lt; z &lt; 0.55. composite radialdistributions of different stellar populations show strong gradients as afunction of cluster-centric redshift. the composite population is dominated byevolved populations in the core, and gradually changes to one which is similarto coeval field galaxies at radii greater than the virial radius. we do not seeevidence in the clusters for an excess of star formation over that seen in thecoeval field. within this redshift range, significant evolution in the gradientshape is seen, with higher redshift clusters showing steeper gradients. thisresults in larger numbers of younger galaxies seen towards the inner regions ofthe clusters-- in effect, a restatement of the butcher-oemler effect.luminosity density profiles are consistent with a scenario where thisphenomenon is due to a decline over time in the infall rate of field galaxiesinto clusters. depending on how long galaxies reside in clusters before theirstar formation rates are diminished, this suggests an epoch for maximal infallinto clusters at z &gt; 0.7. we also discuss alternative scenarios for theevolution of cluster populations.

astro-ph;9910250	galaxy clustering evolution in the cnoc2 high-luminosity sample	the redshift evolution of the galaxy two-point correlation function is afundamental cosmological statistic. to identify similar galaxy populations atdifferent redshifts, we select a strict volume-limited sample culled from the6100 cataloged cnoc2 galaxies. our high-luminosity subsample selects galaxieshaving k-corrected and evolution-compensated r luminosities, m_r^{k,e}, above-20 mag (h_0=100 km/s/mpc) where m_ast^{k,e}(r)simeq -20.3 mag. this subsamplecontains about 2300 galaxies distributed between redshifts 0.1 and 0.65 spreadover a total of 1.55 square degrees of sky. a similarly defined low-redshiftsample is drawn from the las campanas redshift survey. we find that theco-moving two-point correlation function can be described as xi(r|z) =(r_00/r)^gamma (1+z)^{-(3+epsilon-gamma)} with r_{00}=5.03+/-0.08/h mpc,epsilon=-0.17+/- 0.18 and gamma=1.87+/-0.07 over the z=0.03 to 0.65 redshiftrange, for omega_m=0.2, lambda=0. the measured clustering amplitude and itsevolution are dependent on the adopted cosmology. the measured evolution ratesfor omega_m=1 and flat omega_m=0.2 background cosmologies areepsilon=0.80+/-0.22 and epsilon=-0.81+/-0.19, respectively, with r_{00} of5.30+/-0.1/h mpc and 4.85+/-0.1/h mpc, respectively. the sensitivity of thederived correlations to the evolution corrections and details of themeasurements is presented. the analytic prediction of biased clusteringevolution for only the low density, lambdacdm cosmology is readily consistentwith the observations, with biased clustering in an open cosmology somewhatmarginally excluded and a biased omega_m=1 model predicting clusteringevolution that is more than 6 standard deviations from the measured value.

astro-ph;9910494	the velocity and mass distribution of clusters of galaxies from the  cnoc1 cluster redshift survey	in the context of the cnoc1 cluster survey, redshifts were obtained forgalaxies in 16 clusters. the resulting sample is ideally suited for an analysisof the internal velocity and mass distribution of clusters. previous analysesof this dataset used the jeans equation to model the projected velocitydispersion profile. however, the results of such an analysis always yield astrong degeneracy between the mass density profile and the velocity dispersionanisotropy profile. here we analyze the full (r,v) dataset of galaxy positionsand velocities in an attempt to break this degeneracy. we build an `ensemblecluster' from the individual clusters under the assumption that they form ahomologous sequence. to interpret the data we study a one-parameter family ofspherical models with different constant velocity dispersion anisotropy. thebest-fit model is sought using a variety of statistics, including the overalllikelihood of the dataset. although the results of our analysis depend slightlyon which statistic is used to judge the models, all statistics agree that thebest-fit model is close to isotropic. this result derives primarily from thefact that the observed grand-total velocity histogram is close to gaussian,which is not expected to be the case for a strongly anisotropic model. thebest-fitting models have a mass-to-number-density ratio that is approximatelyindependent of radius over the range constrained by the data. they also have amass-density profile that is consistent with the dark matter halo profileadvocated by navarro, frenk &amp; white, in terms of both the profile shape and thecharacteristic scale length. this adds important new weight to the evidencethat clusters do indeed follow this proposed universal mass density profile.[abridged]

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.

0812.3020	dwarf galaxy clustering and missing satellites	at redshifts around 0.1 the cfht legacy survey deep fields contain some6x10^4 galaxies spanning the mass range from 10^5 to 10^12 msun. we measure thestellar mass dependence of the two point correlation using angular measurementsto largely bypass the errors, approximately 0.02 in the median, of thephotometric redshifts. inverting the power-law fits with limber's equation wefind that the auto-correlation length increases from a very low 0.4hmpc at10^5.5 msun to the conventional 4.5hmpc at 10^10.5 msun. the power law fit tothe correlation function has a slope which increases from gamma approximately1.6 at high mass to gamma approximately 2.3 at low mass. the spatialcross-correlation of dwarf galaxies with more massive galaxies shows fairlysimilar trends, with a steeper radial dependence at low mass than predicted innumerical simulations of sub-halos within galaxy halos. to examine the issue ofmissing satellites we combine the cross-correlation measurements with ourestimates of the low mass galaxy number density. we find on the average thereare 60+/-20 dwarfs in sub-halos with m(total) &gt; 10^7 msun for a typical localgroup m(total)/m(stars)=30, corresponding to m/l_v approximately 100 for agalaxy with no recent star formation. the number of dwarfs per galaxy is abouta factor of two larger than currently found for the milky way. nevertheless,the average dwarf counts are about a factor of 30 below lcdm simulationresults. the divergence from lcdm predictions is one of slope of the relation,approximately dn/dlnm approximately -0.5 rather than the predicted -0.9, notsudden onset at some characteristic scale. the dwarf galaxy star formationrates span the range from passive to bursting, which suggests that there arefew completely dark halos.
