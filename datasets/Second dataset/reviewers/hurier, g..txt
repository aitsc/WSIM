1007.1149	milca, a modified internal linear combination algorithm to extract  astrophysical emissions from multi-frequency sky maps	the analysis of current cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments isbased on the interpretation of multi-frequency sky maps in terms of differentastrophysical components and it requires specifically tailored componentseparation algorithms. in this context, internal linear combination (ilc)methods have been extensively used to extract the cmb emission from the wmapmulti-frequency data. we present here a modified internal linear componentalgorithm (milca) that generalizes the ilc approach to the case of multipleastrophysical components for which the electromagnetic spectrum is known. inaddition milca corrects for the intrinsic noise bias in the standard ilcapproach and extends it to an hybrid space-frequency representation of thedata. it also allows us to use external templates to minimize the contributionof extra components but still using only a linear combination of the inputdata. we apply milca to simulations of the planck satellite data at the hfifrequency bands. we explore the possibility of reconstructing the galacticmolecular co emission on the planck maps as well as the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich effect. we conclude that milca is able to accurately estimatethose emissions and it has been successfully used for this purpose within theplanck collaboration.

1101.2024	planck early results viii: the all-sky early sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  sample	we present the first all-sky sample of galaxy clusters detected blindly bythe planck satellite through the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect from its sixhighest frequencies. this early sz (esz) sample is comprised of 189 candidates,which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. its highreliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validationprocess based on planck internal quality assessments and by externalcross-identification and follow-up observations. planck provides the firstmeasured sz signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known esz clusters.planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meetthe esz signal-to-noise selection criterion. at the submission date, twelve ofthe 20 esz candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmedusing xmm-newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbedmorphologies and low luminosities. the esz clusters are mostly at moderateredshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to therarest and most massive clusters with masses above 10^15 msol.

1106.1376	planck early results xxvi: detection with planck and confirmation by  xmm-newton of plck g266.6-27.3, an exceptionally x-ray luminous and massive  galaxy cluster at z~1	we present first results on plck g266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the planck all sky survey. anxmm-newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. with these x-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be m_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. plck g266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of l_x(0.5-2.0 kev)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z &gt; 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, plck g266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. this observationconfirms planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

1112.5595	planck intermediate results. i. further validation of new planck  clusters with xmm-newton	we present further results from the ongoing xmm-newton validation follow-upof planck cluster candidates, detailing x-ray observations of eleven candidatesdetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.5&lt;s/n&lt;5.3 in the same 10-month surveymaps used in the construction of the early sz sample. the sample was selectedin order to test internal sz quality flags, and the pertinence of these flagsis discussed in light of the validation results. ten of the candidates arefound to be bona fide clusters lying below the rass flux limit. redshiftestimates are available for all confirmed systems via x-ray fe-linespectroscopy. they lie in the redshift range 0.19&lt;z&lt;0.94, demonstratingplanck's capability to detect clusters up to high z. the x-ray properties ofthe new clusters appear to be similar to previous new detections by planck atlower z and higher sz flux: the majority are x-ray underluminous for theirmass, estimated using y_x as mass proxy, and many have a disturbed morphology.we find tentative indication for malmquist bias in the y_sz-y_x relation, witha turnover at y_sz \sim 4 e-4 arcmin^2. we present additional new opticalredshift determinations with eno and eso telescopes of candidates previouslyconfirmed with xmm-newton. the x-ray and optical redshifts for a total of 20clusters are found to be in excellent agreement. we also show that useful lowerlimits can be put on cluster redshifts using x-ray data only via the use of they_x vs. y_sz and x-ray flux f_x vs. y_sz relations.

1204.1318	planck intermediate results ii: comparison of sunyaev-zeldovich  measurements from planck and from the arcminute microkelvin imager for 11  galaxy clusters	a comparison is presented of sunyaev-zeldovich measurements for 11 galaxyclusters as obtained by planck and by the ground-based interferometer, thearcminute microkelvin imager. assuming a universal spherically-symmetricgeneralised navarro, frenk &amp; white (gnfw) model for the cluster gas pressureprofile, we jointly constrain the integrated compton-y parameter (y_500) andthe scale radius (theta_500) of each cluster. our resulting constraints in they_500-theta_500 2d parameter space derived from the two instruments overlapsignificantly for eight of the clusters, although, overall, there is a tendencyfor ami to find the sunyaev-zeldovich signal to be smaller in angular size andfainter than planck. significant discrepancies exist for the three remainingclusters in the sample, namely a1413, a1914, and the newly-discovered planckcluster plckesz g139.59+24.18. the robustness of the analysis of both theplanck and ami data is demonstrated through the use of detailed simulations,which also discount confusion from residual point (radio) sources and fromdiffuse astrophysical foregrounds as possible explanations for thediscrepancies found. for a subset of our cluster sample, we have investigatedthe dependence of our results on the assumed pressure profile by repeating theanalysis adopting the best-fitting gnfw profile shape which best matches x-rayobservations. adopting the best-fitting profile shape from the x-ray data doesnot, in general, resolve the discrepancies found in this subset of fiveclusters. though based on a small sample, our results suggest that the adoptedgnfw model may not be sufficiently flexible to describe clusters universally.

1204.2743	planck intermediate results. iii. the relation between galaxy cluster  mass and sunyaev-zeldovich signal	we examine the relation between the galaxy cluster mass m andsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect signal d_a^2 y for a sample of 19 objects forwhich weak lensing (wl) mass measurements obtained from subaru telescope dataare available in the literature. hydrostatic x-ray masses are derived fromxmm-newton archive data and the sz effect signal is measured from planckall-sky survey data. we find an m_wl-d_a^2 y relation that is consistent inslope and normalisation with previous determinations using weak lensing masses;however, there is a normalisation offset with respect to previous measuresbased on hydrostatic x-ray mass-proxy relations. we verify that our sz effectmeasurements are in excellent agreement with previous determinations fromplanck data. for the present sample, the hydrostatic x-ray masses at r_500 areon average ~ 20 per cent larger than the corresponding weak lensing masses, atodds with expectations. we show that the mass discrepancy is driven by adifference in mass concentration as measured by the two methods, and, for thepresent sample, the mass discrepancy and difference in mass concentration isespecially large for disturbed systems. the mass discrepancy is also linked tothe offset in centres used by the x-ray and weak lensing analyses, which againis most important in disturbed systems. we outline several approaches that areneeded to help achieve convergence in cluster mass measurement with x-ray andweak lensing observations.

1207.4009	planck intermediate results. vi: the dynamical structure of  plckg214.6+37.0, a planck discovered triple system of galaxy clusters	the survey of galaxy clusters performed by planck through thesunyaev-zeldovich effect has already discovered many interesting objects,thanks to the whole coverage of the sky. one of the sz candidates detected inthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,plckg214.6+37.0, was later revealed by xmm-newton to be a triple system ofgalaxy clusters. we have further investigated this puzzling system with amulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deepxmm-newton re-observation. the characterisation of the physical properties ofthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract thetotal sz signal of this system with planck data. we partly reconciled thediscrepancy between the expected sz signal from x-rays and the observed one,which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. we measured the redshift ofthe three components with the iron lines in the x-ray spectrum, and confirmedthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. theanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absenceof detectable excess x-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing theformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5089	planck 2013 results. xxix. planck catalogue of sunyaev-zeldovich sources	we describe the all-sky planck catalogue of clusters and cluster candidatesderived from sunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect detections using the first 15.5months of planck satellite observations. the catalogue contains 1227 entries,making it over six times the size of the planck early sz (esz) sample and thelargest sz-selected catalogue to date. it contains 861 confirmed clusters, ofwhich 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-upobservations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. the remaining366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into threeclasses according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be trueclusters. the planck sz catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue,with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from(0.1 to 1.6) 10^{15}msun. confirmation of cluster candidates through comparisonwith existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is thestatistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness andstatistical reliability. the outputs of the validation process are provided asadditional information. this gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 clusterredshifts, and for all these planck clusters we also include a mass estimatedfrom a newly-proposed sz-mass proxy. a refined measure of the sz comptonparameter for the clusters with x-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an x-rayflux for all the planck clusters not previously detected in x-ray surveys.

1303.5090	planck intermediate results. xiii. constraints on peculiar velocities	using \planck\ data combined with the meta catalogue of x-ray detectedclusters of galaxies (mcxc), we address the study of peculiar motions bysearching for evidence of the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz). byimplementing various filters designed to extract the ksz generated at thepositions of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radialpeculiar velocity average, root mean square (rms), and local bulk flowamplitude at different depths. for the whole cluster sample of average redshift0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the ksz monopole,amounts to $72 \pm 60$ km s$^{-1}$. this constitutes less than 1% of therelative hubble velocity of the cluster sample with respect to our local cmbframe. while the linear $\lambda$cdm prediction for the typical cluster radialvelocity rms at $z=0.15$ is close to 230km s$^{-1}$, the upper limit imposed by\planck\ data on the cluster subsample corresponds to 800 km s$^{-1}$ at 95%confidence level, i.e., about three times higher. \planck\ data also set strongconstraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on the local group. thereis no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending tothe maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. a blind search for bulkflows in this sample has an upper limit of 254 km s$^{-1}$ (95% confidencelevel) dominated by cmb confusion and instrumental noise, indicating that theuniverse is largely homogeneous on gpc scales. in this context, in conjunctionwith supernova observations, \planck\ is able to rule out a large class ofinhomogeneous void models as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity.the \planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities and bulk flows are thusconsistent with the $\lambda$cdm scenario.

1405.5013	comparison of sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements from planck and from the  arcminute microkelvin imager for 99 galaxy clusters	we present observations and analysis of a sample of 123 galaxy clusters fromthe 2013 planck catalogue of sunyaev-zel'dovich sources with the arcminutemicrokelvin imager (ami), a ground-based radio interferometer. ami provides anindependent measurement with higher angular resolution, 3 arcmin compared tothe planck beams of 5-10 arcmin. the ami observations thus provide validationof the cluster detections, improved positional estimates, and a consistencycheck on the fitted 'size' ($\theta_{s}$) and 'flux' ($y_{\rm tot}$) parametersin the generalised navarro, frenk and white (gnfw) model. we detect 99 of theclusters. we use the ami positional estimates to check the positional estimatesand error-bars produced by the planck algorithms powellsnakes and mmf3. we findthat $y_{\rm tot}$ values as measured by ami are biased downwards with respectto the planck constraints, especially for high planck-snr clusters. we performsimulations to show that this can be explained by deviation from the'universal' pressure profile shape used to model the clusters. we show that amidata can constrain the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters describing the shape ofthe profile in the gnfw model for individual clusters provided carefulattention is paid to the degeneracies between parameters, but one requiresinformation on a wider range of angular scales than are present in ami dataalone to correctly constrain all parameters simultaneously.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6543	the good, the bad and the ugly: statistical quality assessment of sz  detections	we examine three approaches to the problem of source classification incatalogues. our goal is to determine the confidence with which the elements inthese catalogues can be distinguished in populations on the basis of theirspectral energy distribution (sed). our analysis is based on the projection ofthe measurements onto a comprehensive sed model of the main signals in theconsidered range of frequencies. we first first consider likelihood analysis,which half way between supervised and unsupervised methods. next, weinvestigate an unsupervised clustering technique. finally, we consider asupervised classifier based on artificial neural networks. we illustrate theapproach and results using catalogues from various surveys. i.e., x-rays(mcxc), optical (sdss) and millimetric (planck sunyaev-zeldovich (sz)). we showthat the results from the statistical classifications of the three methods arein very good agreement with each others, although the supervised neuralnetwork-based classification shows better performances allowing the bestseparation into populations of reliable and unreliable sources in catalogues.the latest method was applied to the sz sources detected by the plancksatellite. it led to a classification assessing and thereby agreeing with thereliability assessment published in the planck sz catalogue. our method couldeasily be applied to catalogues from future large survey such as srg/erositaand euclid.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

1504.03339	planck intermediate results. xxxvii. evidence of unbound gas from the  kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect	by looking at the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz) in planck nominalmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating inlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (cgs) at redshift $z\approx0.1$. we estimate the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations atthe positions of the cgc (central galaxy catalogue) samples extracted fromsloan digital sky survey (dr7) data. for the foreground-cleaned maps, we find$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the ksz signal, which are consistent with theksz evidence found in individual planck raw frequency maps, although lower thanfound in the wmap-9yr w band ($3.3\sigma$). we further reconstruct the peculiarvelocity field from the cg density field, and compute for the first time thecross-correlation function between ksz temperature fluctuations and estimatesof cg radial peculiar velocities. this correlation function yields a$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on mpcscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ mpc. both thepairwise momentum estimates and ksz temperature-velocity field correlation findevidence for ksz signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,corresponding to a physical radius of $&gt; 1$ mpc, more than twice the meanvirial radius of halos. this is consistent with the predictions from hydrosimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. we fit asimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation isproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon n-bodysimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective"optical depth to thomson scattering. we find $\tau_t=(1.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of thegas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to x-ray or thermalsz observations.

1505.02779	planck intermediate results. xxxviii. e- and b-modes of dust  polarization from the magnetized filamentary structure of the interstellar  medium	the quest for a b-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) requires thecharacterization of foreground polarization from galactic dust. we present astatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 ghz planck stokesmaps at high galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as apolarized foreground to the cmb. we filter the intensity and polarization mapsto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetrybetween e-modes and b-modes is observed. using the smoothed hessian major axisfilament finder, we identify 259 filaments at high galactic latitude, withlengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for atypical distance of 100 pc). these filaments show a preferred orientationparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derivedfrom their polarization angles. we present mean maps of the filaments in stokesi, q, u, e, and b, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align theorientations of the filaments. combining the stacked images and the histogramof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of thefilaments to be 11 %. furthermore, we show that the correlation between thefilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the e and basymmetry and the $c_{\ell}^{te}/c_{\ell}^{ee}$ ratio, reported in the powerspectra analysis of the planck 353 ghz polarization maps. future models of thedust foreground for cmb polarization studies will need to take into account theobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure ofinterstellar matter.

1505.08022	planck 2015 results. v. lfi calibration	we present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the planck lowfrequency instrument (lfi) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for theplanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. asin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronousmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use theorbital component, rather than adopting the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) solar dipole. this allows our 2015 lfi analysis to provide anindependent solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that ofhfi and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the wmap value. this 0.3% shiftin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from wmap and a global overhaul of theiterative calibration code increases the overall level of the lfi maps by 0.45%(30 ghz), 0.64% (44 ghz), and 0.82% (70 ghz) in temperature with respect to the2013 planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrummeasured by wmap. we estimate that the lfi calibration uncertainty is now atthe level of 0.20% for the 70 ghz map, 0.26% for the 44 ghz map, and 0.35% forthe 30 ghz map. we provide a detailed description of the impact of all thechanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

1511.05156	planck intermediate results. xl. the sunyaev-zeldovich signal from the  virgo cluster	the virgo cluster is the largest sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) source in the sky,both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. planck's wide angularscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow adetailed study of this large object through the sz effect. virgo is wellresolved by planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well withthe morphology observed from x-rays, but extends beyond the observed x-raysignal. we find a good agreement between the sz signal (or compton paranmeter,y_c) observed by planck and the expected signal inferred from x-rayobservations and simple analytical models. due to its proximity to us, the gasbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity byintegrating the sz signal over tens of square degrees. we study the signal inthe outskirts of virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrainedsimulation of the environment of virgo. planck data suggest that significantamounts of low-density plasma surround virgo out to twice the virial radius. wefind the sz signal in the outskirts of virgo to be consistent with a simplemodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assumingthat the temperature stays in the kev range beyond the virial radius. theobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallowpressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. this reservoir of gas atlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hotintergalactic medium. taking the lack of symmetry of virgo into account, wefind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of sz and x-ray data,in agreement with predictions.

1512.00852	prospects for high-z cluster detections with planck, based on a  follow-up of 28 candidates using megacam@cfht	the planck catalogue of sz sources limits itself to a significance thresholdof 4.5 to ensure a low contamination rate by false cluster candidates. thismeans that only the most massive clusters at redshift z&gt;0.5, and in particularz&gt;0.7, are expected to enter into the catalogue, with a large number of systemsin that redshift regime being expected around and just below that threshold. inthis paper, we follow-up a sample of sz sources from the planck sz cataloguesfrom 2013 and 2015. in the latter maps, we consider detections around and atlower significance than the threshold adopted by the planck collaboration. tokeep the contamination rate low, our 28 candidates are chosen to havesignificant wise detections, in combination with non-detections in sdss/dss,which effectively selects galaxy cluster candidates at redshifts $z\gtrsim0.5$.by taking r- and z-band imaging with megacam@cfht, we bridge the 4000arest-frame break over a significant redshift range, thus allowing accurateredshift estimates of red-sequence cluster galaxies up to z~0.8. afterdiscussing the possibility that an overdensity of galaxies coincides -bychance- with a planck sz detection, we confirm that 16 of the candidates havelikely optical counterparts to their sz signals, 13 (6) of which have anestimated redshift z&gt;0.5 (z&gt;0.7). the richnesses of these systems are generallylower than expected given the halo masses estimated from the planck maps.however, when we follow a simplistic model to correct for eddington bias in thesz halo mass proxy, the richnesses are consistent with a referencemass-richness relation established for clusters detected at highersignificance. this illustrates the benefit of an optical follow-up, not only toobtain redshift estimates, but also to provide an independent mass proxy thatis not based on the same data the clusters are detected with, and thus notsubject to eddington bias.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.
