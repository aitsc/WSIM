0901.1789	on the evolution of the molecular line profiles induced by the  propagation of c-shock waves	we present the first results of the expected variations of the molecular lineemission arising from material recently affected by c-shocks (shockprecursors). our parametric model of the structure of c-shocks has been coupledwith a radiative transfer code to calculate the molecular excitation and lineprofiles of shock tracers such as sio, and of ion and neutral molecules such ash13co+ and hn13c, as the shock propagates through the unperturbed medium. ourresults show that the sio emission arising from the early stage of the magneticprecursor typically has very narrow line profiles slightly shifted in velocitywith respect to the ambient cloud. this narrow emission is generated in theregion where the bulk of the ion fluid has already slipped to larger velocitiesin the precursor as observed toward the young l1448-mm outflow. this stronglysuggests that the detection of narrow sio emission and of an ion enhancement inyoung shocks, is produced by the magnetic precursor of c-shocks. in addition,our model shows that the different velocity components observed toward thisoutflow can be explained by the coexistence of different shocks at differentevolutionary stages, within the same beam of the single-dish observations.

0906.2870	knots in the helix nebula found in h2	we present a deep and wide field-of-view (4'x 7') image of the planetarynebula (pn) ngc 7293 (the helix nebula) in the 2.12 micron h2 v=1-0 s(1) line.the excellent seeing (0.4'') at the subaru telescope, allows the details ofcometary knots to be examined. the knots are found at distances of 2.2'-6.4'from the central star (cs). at the inner edge and in the inner ring (up to 4.5'fromthe cs), the knot often show a `tadpole' shape, an elliptical head with abright crescent inside and a long tail opposite to the cs. in detail, there arevariations in the tadpole shapes, such as narrowing tails, widening tails,meandering tails, or multi-peaks within a tail. in the outer ring (4.5'-6.4'from the cs), the shapes are more fractured, and the tails do not collimateinto a single direction. the transition in knot morphology from the inner edgeto the outer ring is clearly seen. the number density of knots governs the h2surface brightness in the inner ring: h2 exists only within the knots. possiblemechanisms which contribute to the shaping of the knots are discussed,including photo-ionization and streaming motions. a plausible interpretation ofour images is that inner knots are being overrun by a faster wind, but thatthis has not (yet) reached the outer knots. based on h2 formation anddestruction rates, h2 gas can survive in knots from formation during the lateasymptotic giant branch (agb) phase throughout the pn phase. these observationsprovide new constraints on the formation and evolution of knots, and on thephysics of molecular gas embedded within ionized gas.

0911.1648	the clumpiness of molecular clouds: hco+ (3--2) survey near herbig-haro  objects	some well-studied herbig haro objects have associated with them one or morecold, dense, and quiescent clumps of gas. we propose that such clumps near anhh object can be used as a general measure of clumpiness in the molecular cloudthat contains that hh object. our aim is to make a survey of clumps around asample of hh objects, and to use the results to make an estimate of theclumpiness in molecular clouds. all known cold, dense, and quiescent clumpsnear hh objects are anomalously strong hco+ emitters. our method is, therefore,to search for strong hco+ emission as an indicator of a clump near to an hhobject. the searches were made using jcmt and sest in the hco+ 3-2 and alsoh13co+ 1-0 lines, with some additional searches for methanol and sulphurmonoxide lines. the sources selected were a sample of 22 hh objects in which noprevious hco+ emission had been detected. we find that half of the hh objectshave clumps detected in the hco+ 3-2 line and that all searches in h13co$+ 1-0lines show evidence of clumpiness. all condensations have narrow linewidths andare evidently unaffected dynamically by the hh jet shock. we conclude that themolecular clouds in which these hh objects are found must be highlyheterogeneous on scales of less than 0.1 pc. an approximate calculation basedon these results suggests that the area filling factor of clumps affected by hhobjects is on the order of 10%. these clumps have gas number densities largerthan 3e4 cm-2.

0911.2673	photodissociation chemistry footprints in the starburst galaxy ngc 253	we report the first detection of pdr molecular tracers, namely hoc+, and co+,and confirm the detection of the also pdr tracer hco towards the starburstgalaxy ngc 253, claimed to be mainly dominated by shock heating and in anearlier stage of evolution than m 82, the prototypical extragalactic pdr. ourco+ detection suffers from significant blending to a group of transitions of13ch3oh, tentatively detected for the first time in the extragalacticinterstellar medium. these species are efficiently formed in the highly uvirradiated outer layers of molecular clouds, as observed in the late stagenuclear starburst in m 82. the molecular abundance ratios we derive for thesemolecules are very similar to those found in m 82. this strongly supports theidea that these molecules are tracing the pdr component associated with thestarburst in the nuclear region of ngc 253. a comparison with the predictionsof chemical models for pdrs shows that the observed molecular ratios aretracing the outer layers of uv illuminated clouds up to two magnitudes ofvisual extinction. chemical models, which include grain formation andphotodissociation of hnco, support the scenario of a photo-dominated chemistryas an explanation to the abundances of the observed species. from thiscomparison we conclude that the molecular clouds in ngc 253 are more massiveand with larger column densities than those in m 82, as expected from theevolutionary stage of the starbursts in both galaxies.

1002.2020	the jcmt legacy survey of the gould belt: a first look at taurus with  harp	as part of a jcmt legacy survey of star formation in the gould belt, wepresent early science results for taurus. co j=3-2 maps have been secured alongthe north-west ridge and bowl, collectively known as l 1495, along with deep13co and c18o j=3-2 maps in two sub-regions. with these data we search formolecular outflows, and use the distribution of flows, hh objects and shockedh2 line emission features, together with the population of young stars,protostellar cores and starless condensations to map star formation across thisextensive region. in total 21 outflows are identified. it is clear that thebowl is more evolved than the ridge, harbouring a greater population of t tauristars and a more diffuse, more turbulent ambient medium. by comparison, theridge contains a much younger, less widely distributed population of protostarswhich, in turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. weestimate the ratio of the numbers of prestellar to protostellar cores in l 1495to be ~ 1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores to(gravitationally bound) prestellar cores to be ~ 1. if we take previousestimates of the protostellar lifetime of ~ 5 x 10^5 yrs, this indicates aprestellar lifetime of 9(+/-3) x 10^5 yrs. from the number of outflows we alsocrudely estimate the star formation efficiency in l 1495, finding it to becompatible with a canonical value of 10-15 %. we note that molecularoutflow-driving sources have redder near-ir colours than their hh jet-drivingcounterparts. we also find that the smaller, denser cores are associated withthe more massive outflows, as one might expect if mass build-up in the flowincreases with the collapse and contraction of the protostellar envelope.

1002.2111	chemical and radiative transfer modeling of the iso-lws fabry-perot  spectra of orion-kl water lines	we present chemical and radiative transfer models for the many far-ir ortho-and para-h2o lines that were observed from the orion-kl region in highresolution fabry-perot (fp) mode by the long wavelength spectrometer (lws) onboard the infrared space observatory (iso). the chemistry of the region wasfirst studied by simulating the conditions in the different known components oforion-kl: chemical models for a hot core, a plateau and a ridge were coupledwith an accelerated lambda$-iteration (ali) radiative transfer model to predicth2o line fluxes and profiles. our models include the first 45 energy levels ofortho- and para-h2o. we find that lines arising from energy levels below 560 kwere best reproduced by a gas of density 3x10^5 cm^-3 at a temperature of 70-90k, expanding at a velocity of 30 km s^-1 and with a h2o/h2 abundance ratio ofthe order of 2 - 3 x 10^-5, similar to the abundance derived by cernicharo etal. (2006). however, the model that best reproduces the fluxes and profiles ofh2o lines arising from energy levels above 560 k has a significantly higherh2o/h2 abundance, 1 - 5 x 10^-4, originating from gas of similar density, inthe plateau region, that has been heated to 300 k, relaxing to 90-100 k. weconclude that the observed water lines do not originate from high temperatureshocks.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

0708.3374	desorption from interstellar ices	the desorption of molecular species from ice mantles back into the gas phasein molecular clouds results from a variety of very poorly understood processes.we have investigated three mechanisms; desorption resulting from h_2 formationon grains, direct cosmic ray heating and cosmic ray induced photodesorption.whilst qualitative differences exist between these processes (essentiallyderiving from the assumptions concerning the species-selectivity of thedesorption and the assumed threshold adsorption energies, e_t) all threeprocesses are found to be potentially very significant in dark cloudconditions. it is therefore important that all three mechanisms should beconsidered in studies of molecular clouds in which freeze-out and desorptionare believed to be important.  employing a chemical model of a typical static molecular core and usinglikely estimates for the quantum yields of the three processes we find thatdesorption by h_2 formation probably dominates over the other two mechanisms.however, the physics of the desorption processes and the nature of the dustgrains and ice mantles are very poorly constrained. we therefore conclude thatthe best approach is to set empirical constraints on the desorption, based onobserved molecular depletions - rather than try to establish the desorptionefficiencies from purely theoretical considerations. applying this method toone such object (l1689b) yields upper limits to the desorption efficienciesthat are consistent with our understanding of these mechanisms.

1012.1969	a line confusion limited millimeter survey of orion kl. ii:  silicon-bearing species	we present a study of the silicon-bearing species detected in a lineconfusion limited survey towards orion kl performed with the iram 30-mtelescope, which ranges from 80 to 280 ghz. our aim is to derive physical andchemical conditions for each family taking into account all observed lines fromall isotopologues of each species. we have modeled the lines of the detectedmolecules using a radiative transfer code, which permit us to choose betweenlvg and lte approximations depending on the physical conditions of the gas. wehave used appropriate collisional rates for the lvg calculations. for the v=1state of sio we have detected the j=2-1 line and, for the first time in thissource, emission in the j=4-3 transition, both of them showing strong maseringeffect. for sio v=0, we have detected 28sio, 29sio, and 30sio; in addition, wehave mapped the j = 5-4 sio line. for sis, we have detected the main species,29sis, and sis v=1. unlikely other species detected in orion kl (irc2), theemission peak of sis appears at a velocity of ~15.5 km s-1; a study of the 5-4sio line around irc2 shows this feature as an extended component that probablyarises from the interaction of the outflow with the ambient cloud. we derive asio/sis column density ratio of ~13 in the plateau component. besides, weprovide upper limits to the column density of several non-detectedsilicon-bearing species. the results of our chemical models show that while itis possible to reproduce sio in the gas phase (as well as on the grains), sisis a product of surface reactions, most likely involving direct reactions of swith si.

1102.2996	chemistry in cosmic-ray dominated regions (crdrs)	molecular line observations may serve as diagnostics of the degree to whichthe number density of cosmic ray protons, having energies of 10s to 100s ofmevs each, is enhanced in starburst galaxies and galaxies with active nuclei.results, obtained with the ucl\_pdr code, for the fractional abundances ofmolecules as functions of the cosmic-ray induced ionisation rate, $\zeta$, arepresented. the aim is not to model any particular external galaxies. rather, itis to identify characteristics of the dependencies of molecular abundances on$\zeta$, in part to enable the development of suitable observational programmesfor cosmic ray dominated regions (crdrs) which will then stimulate detailedmodelling. for a number density of hydrogen nuclei of of $10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, andhigh visual extinction, the fractional abundances of some species increase as$\zeta$ increases to $10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, but for much higher values of $\zeta$the fractional abundances of all molecular species are significantly belowtheir peak values. we show in particular that oh, h$_{2}$o, h$_{3}^{+}$,h$_{3}$o$^{+}$ and oh$^{+}$ attain large fractional abundances ($\geqslant10^{-8}$) for $\zeta$ as large as $10^{-12}$ s$^{-1}$. hco$^{+}$ is a poortracer of crdrs when $\zeta &gt; 10^{-13}$ s$^{-1}$. sulphur-bearing species maybe useful tracers of crdrs gas in which $\zeta \sim 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. ammoniahas a large fractional abundance for $\zeta \leqslant 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ andnitrogen appears in cn-bearing species at significant levels as $\zeta$increases, even up to $\sim 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$. in this paper, we also discussour model predictions, comparing them to recent detections in both galactic andextragalactic sources. we show that they agree well, to a first approximation,with the observational constraints.

0709.3065	vlt / infrared integral field spectrometer observations of molecular  hydrogen lines in the knots in the planetary nebula ngc 7293 (the helix  nebula)	knots are commonly found in nearby planetary nebulae (pne) and star formingregions. within pne, knots are often found to be associated with the brightestparts of the nebulae and understanding the physics involved in knots may revealthe processes dominating in pne. as one of the closest pne, the helix nebula(ngc 7293) is an ideal target to study such small-scale (~300 au) structures.we have obtained infrared integral spectroscopy of a comet-shaped knot in thehelix nebula using sinfoni on the very large telescope at high spatialresolution (50-125 mas). with spatially resolved 2 micron spectra, we find thatthe h2 rotational temperature within the cometary knots is uniform. therotational-vibrational temperature of the cometary knot (situated in theinnermost region of the nebula, 2.5 arcmin away from the central star), is 1800k, higher than the temperature seen in the outer regions (5-6 arcmin from thecentral star) of the nebula (900 k), showing that the excitation temperaturevaries across the nebula. the obtained intensities are reasonably well fittedwith 27 km s-1 c-type shock model. this ambient gas velocity is slightly higherthan the observed [heii] wind velocity of 13 km s-1. the gas excitation canalso be reproduced with a pdr (photo dominant region) model, but this requiresan order of magnitude higher uv radiation. both models have limitations,highlighting the need for models that treats both hydrodynamical physics andthe pdr.

0704.2603	molecular line intensities as measures of cloud masses - ii. conversion  factors for specific galaxy types	we present theoretically-established values of the co-to-h2 and c-to-h2conversion factors that may be used to estimate the gas masses of externalgalaxies. we consider four distinct galaxy types, represented by m51, ngc 6946,m82 and smc n27. the physical parameters that best represent the conditionswithin the molecular clouds in each of the galaxy types are estimated using achi^2 analysis of several observed atomic fine structure and co rotationallines. this analysis is explored over a wide range of density, radiation field,extinction, and other relevant parameters. using these estimated physicalconditions in methods that we have previously established, co-to-h2 conversionfactors are then computed for co transitions up to j=9-8. for the conventionalco(1-0) transition, the computed conversion factor varies significantly belowand above the canonical value for the milky way in the four galaxy typesconsidered. since atomic carbon emission is now frequently used as a probe ofexternal galaxies, we also present, for the first time, the c-to-h2 conversionfactor for this emission in the four galaxy types considered.

1110.3948	first detection of hydrogen chloride towards protostellar shocks	we present the first detection of hydrogen chlorine in a protostellar shock,by observing the fundamental transition at 626 ghz with the herschel hifispectrometer. we detected two of the three hyperfine lines, from which wederived a line opacity &lt; 1. using a non-lte lvg code, we constrained the hclcolumn density, temperature and density of the emitting gas. the hypothesisthat the emission originates in the molecular cloud is ruled out, as it wouldimply a too dense gas. conversely, assuming that the emission originates in the10"-15" size shocked gas previously observed at the iram pdb interferometer, weobtain: n(hcl)=0.7-2 x 10(13) cm-2, temperature &gt; 15 k and density &gt; 3 x 10(5)cm-3}. combining with the herschel hifi co(5-4) observations allows to furtherconstrain the gas density and temperature, 10(5)-10(6) cm-3 and 120-250 k, aswell as the hcl column density, 2 x 10(13) cm-2, and, finally, abundance: 3-6 x10(-9). the estimated hcl abundance is consistent with that previously observedin low- and high- mass protostars. this puzzling result in the l1157-b1 shock,where species from volatile and refractory grains components are enhanced,suggests either that hcl is not the main reservoir of chlorine in the gasphase, against previous chemical models predictions, or that the elementalchlorine abundance is low in l1157-b1. astrochemical modelling suggests thathcl is in fact formed in the gas phase, at low temperatures, prior to theoccurance of the shock, and that the latter does not enhance its abundance.

1301.2982	episodic explosions in interstellar ices	we present a model for the formation of large organic molecules in darkclouds. the molecules are produced in the high density gas-phase that existsimmediately after ice mantles are explosively sublimated. the explosions areinitiated by the catastrophic recombination of trapped atomic hydrogen. wepropose that, in molecular clouds, the processes of freeze-out onto icemantles, accumulation of radicals, explosion and then rapid (three-body)gas-phase chemistry occurs in a cyclic fashion. this can lead to a cumulativemolecular enrichment of the interstellar medium. a model of the time-dependentchemistries, based on this hypothesis, shows that significant abundances oflarge molecular species can be formed, although the complexity of the speciesis limited by the short expansion timescale in the gas, immediately followingmantle explosion. we find that this mechanism may be an important source ofsmaller organic species, such as methanol and formaldehyde, as well asprecursors to bio-molecule formation. most significantly, we predict thegas-phase presence of these larger molecular species in quiescent molecularclouds and not just dynamically active regions, such as hot cores. as such themechanism that we propose complements alternative methods of large moleculeformation, such as those that invoke solid-state chemistry within activated icemantles.

1401.0563	the molecular gas reservoir of 6 low-metallicity galaxies from the  herschel dwarf galaxy survey: a ground-based follow-up survey of co(1-0),  co(2-1), and co(3-2)	we aim to quantify the molecular gas reservoir in a subset of 6low-metallicity galaxies from the herschel dwarf galaxy survey with newlyacquired co data, and link this reservoir to the observed star formationactivity. we present co(1-0), co(2-1), and co(3-2) observations obtained at theatnf mopra 22-m, apex, and iram 30-m telescopes, as well as [cii] 157um and[oi] 63um observations obtained with the herschel/pacs spectrometer in the 6galaxies: haro11, mrk1089, mrk930, ngc4861, ngc625, and um311. we derivemolecular gas mass from several methods including the use of the co-to-h2conversion factor xco (both galactic and metallicity-scaled values) and of dustmeasurements. the molecular and atomic gas reservoirs are compared to the starformation activity. we also constrain the physical conditions of the molecularclouds using the non-lte code radex and the spectral synthesis code cloudy. wedetect co in 5 of the 6 galaxies, including first detections in haro11 (z~0.4zsun), mrk930 (0.2 zsun), and um311 (0.5 zsun), but co remains undetected inngc4861 (0.2 zsun). the co luminosities are low while [cii] is bright in thesegalaxies, resulting in [cii]/co(1-0)&gt;10000. our dwarf galaxies are inrelatively good agreement with the schmidt-kennicutt relation for total gas.they show short molecular depletion time scales, even when consideringmetallicity-scaled xco factors. those galaxies are dominated by their hi gas,except haro11 which has high star formation efficiency and is dominated byionized and molecular gas. we determine the mass of each ism phase in haro11using cloudy and estimate an equivalent xco factor which is 10 times higherthan the galactic value. overall, our results confirm the emerging picture thatco suffers from significant selective photodissociation in low-metallicitydwarf galaxies.

1402.2842	extended warm gas in orion kl as probed by methyl cyanide	in order to study the temperature distribution of the extended gas within theorion kleinmann-low nebula, we have mapped the emission by methyl cyanide(ch3cn) in its j=6_k-5_k, j=12_k-11_k, j=13_k-12_k, and j=14_k-13_k transitionsat an average angular resolution of ~10 arcsec (22 arcsec for the 6_k-5_klines), as part of a new 2d line survey of this region using the iram 30mtelescope. these fully sampled maps show extended emission from warm gas to thenortheast of irc2 and the distinct kinematic signatures of the hot core andcompact ridge source components. we have constructed population diagrams forthe four sets of k-ladder emission lines at each position in the maps and havederived rotational excitation temperatures and total beam-averaged columndensities from the fitted slopes. in addition, we have fitted lvg model spectrato the observations to determine best-fit physical parameters at each mapposition, yielding the distribution of kinetic temperatures across the region.the resulting temperature maps reveal a region of hot (t &gt; 350 k) materialsurrounding the northeastern edge of the hot core, whereas the column densitydistribution is more uniform and peaks near the position of irc2. we attributethis region of hot gas to shock heating caused by the impact of outflowingmaterial from active star formation in the region, as indicated by the presenceof broad ch3cn lines. this scenario is consistent with predictions from c-shockchemical models that suggest that gas-phase methyl cyanide survives in thepost-shock gas and can be somewhat enhanced due to sputtering of grain mantlesin the passing shock front.

1403.2355	ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde in hot cores	[abridged] ethylene oxide and its isomer acetaldehyde are important complexorganic molecules because of their potential role in the formation of aminoacids. despite the fact that acetaldehyde is ubiquitous in the interstellarmedium, ethylene oxide has not yet been detected in cold sources. we aim tounderstand the chemistry of the formation and loss of ethylene oxide in hot andcold interstellar objects (i) by including in a revised gas-grain network somerecent experimental results on grain surfaces and (ii) by comparison with thechemical behaviour of its isomer, acetaldehyde. we test the code for the caseof a hot core. the model allows us to predict the gaseous and solid ethyleneoxide abundances during a cooling-down phase prior to star formation and duringthe subsequent warm-up phase. we can therefore predict at what temperaturesethylene oxide forms on grain surfaces and at what temperature it starts todesorb into the gas phase. the model reproduces the observed gaseous abundancesof ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde towards high-mass star-forming regions. inaddition, our results show that ethylene oxide may be present in outer andcooler regions of hot cores where its isomer has already been detected. despitetheir different chemical structures, the chemistry of ethylene oxide is coupledto that of acetaldehyde, suggesting that acetaldehyde may be used as a tracerfor ethylene oxide towards cold cores.

0803.0519	molecular line profiles as diagnostics of protostellar collapse:  modelling the `blue asymmetry' in inside-out infall	the evolution of star-forming core analogues undergoing inside-out collapseis studied with a multi-point chemodynamical model which self-consistentlycomputes the abundance distribution of chemical species in the core. forseveral collapse periods the output chemistry of infall tracer species such ashco+, cs, and n2h+, is then coupled to an accelerated lambda-iterationradiative transfer code, which predicts the emerging molecular line profilesusing two different input gas/dust temperature distributions. we investigatethe sensitivity of the predicted spectral line profiles and line asymmetryratios to the core temperature distribution, the time-dependent modelchemistry, as well as to ad hoc abundance distributions. the line asymmetry isfound to be strongly dependent on the adopted chemical abundance distribution.in general, models with a warm central region show higher values of blueasymmetry in optically thick hco+ and cs lines than models with a starless coretemperature profile. we find that in the formal context of shu-type inside-outinfall, and in the absence of rotation or outflows, the relative blue asymmetryof certain hco+ and cs transitions is a function of time and, subject to theforegoing caveats, can act as a collapse chronometer. the sensitivity ofsimulated hco+ line profiles to linear radial variations, subsonic orsupersonic, of the internal turbulence field is investigated in the separatecase of static cores.

1406.1373	deuteration around the ultracompact hii region mon r2	the massive star-forming region mon r2 hosts the closest ultra-compact hiiregion that can be spatially resolved with current single-dish telescopes. weused the iram-30m telescope to carry out an unbiased spectral survey toward twoimportant positions (namely if and mp2), in order to studying the chemistry ofdeuterated molecules toward mon r2. we found a rich chemistry of deuteratedspecies at both positions, with detections of c2d, dcn, dnc, dco+, d2co, hdco,nh2d, and n2d+ and their corresponding hydrogenated species and isotopologs.our high spectral resolution observations allowed us to resolve three velocitycomponents: the component at 10 km/s is detected at both positions and seemsassociated with the layer most exposed to the uv radiation from irs 1; thecomponent at 12 km/s is found toward the if position and seems related to themolecular gas; finally, a component at 8.5 km/s is only detected toward the mp2position, most likely related to a low-uv irradiated pdr. we derived the columndensity of all the species, and determined the deuterium fractions (dfrac). thevalues of dfrac are around 0.01 for all the observed species, except for hco+and n2h+ which have values 10 times lower. the values found in mon r2 are wellexplained with pseudo-time-dependent gas-phase model in which deuterationoccurs mainly via ion-molecule reactions with h2d+, ch2d+ and c2hd+. finally,the [h13cn]/[hn13c] ratio is very high (~11) for the 10 km/s component, whichalso agree with our model predictions for an age of ~0.01-0.1 myr. thedeuterium chemistry is a good tool for studying star-forming regions. thelow-mass star-forming regions seem well characterized with dfrac(n2h+) ordfrac(hco+), but it is required a complete chemical modeling to date massivestar-forming regions, because the higher gas temperature together with therapid evolution of massive protostars.

1406.2278	modelling the sulphur chemistry evolution in orion kl	we study the sulphur chemistry evolution in the orion kl along the gas andgrain phases of the cloud. we investigate the processes that dominate thesulphur chemistry and to determine how physical and chemical parameters, suchas the final star mass and the initial elemental abundances, influence theevolution of the hot core and of the surrounding outflows and shocked gas (theplateau). we independently modelled the chemistry evolution of both componentsusing the time-dependent gas-grain model ucl_chem and considering two differentphase calculations. phase i starts with the collapsing cloud and the depletionof atoms and molecules onto grain surfaces. phase ii starts when a centralprotostar is formed and the evaporation from grains takes place. we show howthe gas density, the gas depletion efficiency, the initial sulphur abundance,the shocked gas temperature and the different chemical paths on the grainsleading to different reservoirs of sulphur on the mantles affectsulphur-bearing molecules at different evolutionary stages. we also compare thepredicted column densities with those inferred from observations of the speciesso, so2, cs, ocs, h2s and h2cs. the models that reproduce the observations ofthe largest number of sulphur-bearing species are those with an initial sulphurabundance of 0.1 times the sulphur solar abundance and a density of at leastn_h=5x10^6 cm^-3 in the shocked gas region. we conclude that most of thesulphur atoms were ionised during phase i, consistent with an inhomogeneous andclumpy region where the uv interstellar radiation penetrates leading to sulphurionisation. we also conclude that the main sulphur reservoir on the ice mantleswas h2s. in addition, we deduce that a chemical transition currently takesplace in the shocked gas, where so and so2 gas-phase formation reactions changefrom being dominated by o2 to being dominated by oh.

1504.06824	probing highly obscured, self-absorbed galaxy nuclei with vibrationally  excited hcn	we present high resolution (0."4) iram pdbi and alma mm and submmobservations of the (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ((u)lirgs)iras17208-0014, arp220, ic860 and zw049.057 that reveal intense line emissionfrom vibrationally excited ($\nu_2$=1) j=3-2 and 4-3 hcn. the emission isemerging from buried, compact (r&lt;17-70 pc) nuclei that have very high impliedmid-infrared surface brightness $&gt;$$5\times 10^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$.these nuclei are likely powered by accreting supermassive black holes (smbhs)and/or hot (&gt;200 k) extreme starbursts. vibrational, $\nu_2$=1, lines of hcnare excited by intense 14 micron mid-infrared emission and are excellent probesof the dynamics, masses, and physical conditions of (u)lirg nuclei when h$_2$column densities exceed $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. it is clear that these lines openup a new interesting avenue to gain access to the most obscured agns andstarbursts. vibrationally excited hcn acts as a proxy for the absorbedmid-infrared emission from the embedded nuclei, which allows for reconstructionof the intrinsic, hotter dust sed. in contrast, we show strong evidence thatthe ground vibrational state ($\nu$=0), j=3-2 and 4-3 rotational lines of hcnand hco$^+$ fail to probe the highly enshrouded, compact nuclear regions owingto strong self- and continuum absorption. the hcn and hco$^+$ line profiles aredouble-peaked because of the absorption and show evidence of non-circularmotions - possibly in the form of in- or outflows. detections of vibrationallyexcited hcn in external galaxies are so far limited to ulirgs and early-typespiral lirgs, and we discuss possible causes for this. we tentatively suggestthat the peak of vibrationally excited hcn emission is connected to a rapidstage of nuclear growth, before the phase of strong feedback.

astro-ph;0607428	molecular line intensities as measures of cloud masses - i. sensitivity  of co emissions to physical parameter variations	a reliable estimate of the molecular gas content in galaxies plays a crucialrole in determining their dynamical and star-forming properties. however, h2,the dominant molecular species, is difficult to observe directly, particularlyin the regions where most molecular gas is thought to reside. its mass istherefore commonly inferred by assuming a direct proportionality with theintegrated intensity of the co(j=1-0) emission line, using a co-to-h2conversion factor, x. although a canonical value for x is used extensively insuch estimates, there is increasing evidence, both theoretical andobservational, that the conversion factor may vary by over an order ofmagnitude under conditions different to those of the local neighbourhood. in aneffort to understand the influence of changing environmental conditions on theconversion factor, we derive theoretical estimates of x for a wide range ofphysical parameters using a photon-dominated region (pdr) time-dependentchemical model, benchmarking key results against those of an independent pdrcode to ensure reliability. based on these results, the sensitivity of the xfactor to change in each physical parameter is interpreted in terms of thechemistry and physical processes within the cloud. in addition to confirmingprevious observationally derived trends, we find that the time-dependence ofthe chemistry, often neglected in such models, has a considerable influence onthe value of the conversion factor.

astro-ph;0609538	first measurements of the electron density enhancements expected in  c-shocks	magnetic precursors of c-shocks accelerate, compress and heat molecular ions,modifying the kinematics and the physical conditions of the ion fluid withrespect to the neutral one. electron densities are also expected to besignificantly enhanced in shock precursors. in this letter, we presentobservations of strongly polar ion and neutral molecules such as sio, h13co+,hn13c and h13cn, which reveal the electron density enhancements associated withthe precursor of the young l1448-mm outflow. while in the ambient gas theexcitation of the ions and neutrals is explained by collisional excitation byh2 with a single density of 10e5cme-3, h13co+ shows an over excitation in theshock precursor component that requires h2 densities of a factor of &gt;10 largerthan those derived from the neutral species. this over excitation in h13co+ canbe explained if we consider an additional excitation by collisions withelectrons and an electron density enhancement in the precursor stage by afactor of 500, i.e. a fractional ionization of 5x10e-5. these results show thatmultiline observations can be used to study the evolution of the ion andelectron fluids at the first stages of the c-shock interaction.

astro-ph;0611907	the jcmt spectral legacy survey	stars form in the densest, coldest, most quiescent regions of molecularclouds. molecules provide the only probes which can reveal the dynamics,physics, chemistry and evolution of these regions, but our understanding of themolecular inventory of sources and how this is related to their physical stateand evolution is rudimentary and incomplete. the spectral legacy survey (sls)is one of seven surveys recently approved by the jcmt board. starting in 2007,the sls will produce a spectral imaging survey of the content and distributionof all the molecules detected in the 345 ghz atmospheric window (between 332ghz and 373 ghz) towards a sample of 5 sources. our intended targets are: a lowmass core (ngc1333 iras4), 3 high mass cores spanning a range of star formingenvironments and evolutionary states (w49, afgl2591, and iras20126), and a pdr(the orion bar). the sls will use the unique spectral imaging capabilities ofharp-b/acsis to study the molecular inventory and the physical structure ofthese objects, which span different evolutionary stages and physicalenvironments, to probe their evolution during the star formation process. asits name suggests, the sls will provide a lasting data legacy from the jcmtthat is intended to benefit the entire astronomical community. as such, theentire data set (including calibrated spectral datacubes, maps of molecularemission, line identifications, and calculations of the gas temperature andcolumn density) will be publicly available.

astro-ph;0702231	a pdr-code comparison study	we present a comparison between independent computer codes, modeling thephysics and chemistry of interstellar photon dominated regions (pdrs). our goalwas to understand the mutual differences in the pdr codes and their effects onthe physical and chemical structure of the model clouds, and to converge theoutput of different codes to a common solution. a number of benchmark modelshave been created, covering low and high gas densities and far ultravioletintensities. the benchmark models were computed in two ways: one set assumingconstant temperatures, thus testing the consistency of the chemical network andphoto-processes, and a second set determining the temperature selfconsistently.we investigated the impact of pdr geometry and agreed on the comparison ofresults from spherical and plane-parallel pdr models. we identified a number ofkey processes governing the chemical network which have been treateddifferently in the various codes, and defined a proper common treatment. weestablished a comprehensive set of reference models for ongoing and future pdrmodel bench-marking and were able to increase the agreement in modelpredictions for all benchmark models significantly.
