0912.4665	gravitational settling in pulsating subdwarf b stars and their  progenitors	diffusion of atoms can be important during quiescent phases of stellarevolution. particularly in the very thin inert envelopes of subdwarf b stars,diffusive movements will considerably change the envelope structure and thesurface abundances on a short timescale. also, the subdwarfs will inherit theeffects of diffusion in their direct progenitors, namely giants near the tip ofthe red giant branch. this will influence the global evolution and thepulsational properties of subdwarf b stars. we investigate the impact ofgravitational settling, thermal diffusion and concentration diffusion on theevolution and pulsations of subdwarf b stars. our diffusive stellar models arecompared with models evolved without diffusion. we constructed subdwarf bmodels with a mass of 0.465 msun from a 1 and 3 msun zams progenitor. the lowmass star ignited helium in an energetic flash, while the intermediate massstar started helium fusion gently. for each progenitor type we computed serieswith and without atomic diffusion. atomic diffusion in red giants causes thehelium core mass at the onset of helium ignition to be larger. we find anincrease of 0.0015 msun for the 1 msun model and 0.0036 msun for the 3 msunmodel. the effects on the red giant surface abundances are small after thefirst dredge up. the evolutionary tracks of the diffusive subdwarf b models areshifted to lower surface gravities and effective temperatures due to outwarddiffusion of hydrogen. this affects both the frequencies of the excited modesand the overall frequency spectrum. especially the structure and pulsations ofthe post-non-degenerate sdb star are drastically altered, proving that atomicdiffusion cannot be ignored in these stars.

1010.2747	kepler observations of the beaming binary kpd 1946+4340	the kepler mission has acquired 33.5d of continuous one-minute photometry ofkpd 1946+4340, a short-period binary system that consists of an sdb and a whitedwarf. in the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepestoccurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdb (0.4%) andthe more shallow ones (0.1%) when the sdb eclipses the white dwarf. asexpected, the sdb is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf,which produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. spectacularly, avery strong doppler beaming (aka doppler boosting) effect is also clearlyevident at the 0.1% level. this originates from the sdb's orbital velocity,which we measure to be 164.0\pm1.9 km/s from supporting spectroscopy. wepresent light curve models that account for all these effects, as well asgravitational lensing. we derive system parameters and uncertainties from thelight curve using markov chain monte carlo simulations. adopting a theoreticalwhite dwarf mass-radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be0.47\pm0.03 msun and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59\pm0.02 msun. theeffective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900\pm300k. with a spectroscopiceffective temperature of teff = 34 730\pm250k and a surface gravity of log g =5.43\pm0.04, the sdb is in a shell he burning stage. the detection of dopplerbeaming in kepler light curves potentially allows one to measure radialvelocities without the need of spectroscopic data. for the first time, aphotometrically observed doppler beaming amplitude is compared to aspectroscopically established value. the sdb's radial velocity amplitudederived from the photometry 168\pm4 km/s is in perfect agreement with thespectroscopic value. after subtracting our best model for the orbital effects,we searched the residuals for stellar oscillations but did not find anysignificant pulsation frequencies.

1010.4959	plaskett's star: analysis of the corot photometric data	the sra02 of the corot space mission for asteroseismology was partly devotedto stars belonging to the mon ob2 association. an intense monitoring wasperformed on plaskett's star (hd47129) and the unprecedented quality of thelight curve allows us to shed new light on this very massive, non-eclipsingbinary system. we particularly aimed at detecting periodic variability whichmight be associated with pulsations or interactions between both components. wealso searched for variations related to the orbital cycle which could help toconstrain the inclination and the morphology of the binary system. afourier-based prewhitening and a multiperiodic fitting procedure were appliedto analyse the time series and extract the frequencies of variations. wedescribe the noise properties to tentatively define an appropriate significancecriterion, to only point out the peaks at a certain significance level. we alsodetect the variations related to the orbital motion and study them by using thenightfall program. the periodogram exhibits a majority of peaks at lowfrequencies. among these peaks, we highlight a list of about 43 values,including notably two different sets of harmonic frequencies whose fundamentalpeaks are located at about 0.07 and 0.82d-1. the former represents the orbitalfrequency of the binary system whilst the latter could probably be associatedwith non-radial pulsations. the study of the 0.07d-1 variations reveals thepresence of a hot spot most probably situated on the primary star and facingthe secondary. the investigation of this unique dataset constitutes a furtherstep in the understanding of plaskett's star. these results provide a firstbasis for future seismic modelling. the existence of a hot region between bothcomponents renders the determination of the inclination ambiguous.

1101.3162	an asteroseismic study of the o9v star hd 46202 from corot space-based  photometry	the o9v star hd 46202, which is a member of the young open cluster ngc 2244,was observed by the corot satellite in october/november 2008 during a short runof 34 days. from the very high-precision light curve, we clearly detect betacep-like pulsation frequencies with amplitudes of ~0.1 mmag and below. acomparison with stellar models was performed using a chi^2 as a measure for thegoodness-of-fit between the observed and theoretically computed frequencies.the physical parameters of our best-fitting models are compatible with the onesdeduced spectroscopically. a core overshooting parameter alpha_ov = 0.10 +-0.05 pressure scale height is required. none of the observed frequencies aretheoretically excited with the input physics used in our study. moretheoretical work is thus needed to overcome this shortcoming in how weunderstand the excitation mechanism of pulsation modes in such a massive star.a similar excitation problem has also been encountered for certain pulsationmodes in beta cep stars recently modelled asteroseismically.

1101.4150	first kepler results on compact pulsators vi. targets in the final half  of the survey phase	we present results from the final six months of a survey to search forpulsations in white dwarfs and hot subdwarf stars with the kepler spacecraft.spectroscopic observations are used to separate the objects into accurateclasses, and we explore the physical parameters of the subdwarf b (sdb) starsand white dwarfs in the sample. from the kepler photometry and ourspectroscopic data, we find that the sample contains 5 new pulsators of thev1093 her type, one am cvn type cataclysmic variable, and a number of otherbinary systems. this completes the survey for compact pulsators with kepler. nov361 hya type of short-period pulsating sdb stars were found in this half,leaving us with a total of one single multiperiodic v361 hya and 13 v1093 herpulsators for the full survey. except for the sdb pulsators, no other clearlypulsating hot subdwarfs or white dwarfs were found, although a fewlow-amplitude candidates still remain. the most interesting targets discoveredin this survey will be observed throughout the remainder of the kepler mission,providing the most long-term photometric datasets ever made on such compact,evolved stars. asteroseismic investigations of these datasets will beinvaluable in revealing the interior structure of these stars, and will boostour understanding of their evolutionary history.

1102.2319	global stellar variability study in the field-of-view of the kepler  satellite	we present the results of an automated variability analysis of the keplerpublic data measured in the first quarter (q1) of the mission. in total, about150 000 light curves have been analysed to detect stellar variability, and toidentify new members of known variability classes. we also focus on thedetection of variables present in eclipsing binary systems, given the importantconstraints on stellar fundamental parameters they can provide. the methodologywe use here is based on the automated variability classification pipeline whichwas previously developed for and applied successfully to the corot exofielddatabase and to the limited subset of a few thousand kepler asteroseismologylight curves. we use a fourier decomposition of the light curves to describetheir variability behaviour and use the resulting parameters to perform asupervised classification. several improvements have been made, including aseparate extractor method to detect the presence of eclipses when othervariability is present in the light curves. we also included two newvariability classes compared to previous work: variables showing signs ofrotational modulation and of activity. statistics are given on the number ofvariables and the number of good candidates per class. a comparison is madewith results obtained for the corot exoplanet data. we present some specialdiscoveries, including variable stars in eclipsing binary systems. many newcandidate non-radial pulsators are found, mainly delta sct and gamma dor stars.we have studied those samples in more detail by using 2mass colours. the fullclassification results are made available as an online catalogue.

1102.3599	kepler photometry of kic 10661783: a binary star with total eclipses and  delta scuti pulsations	we present kepler satellite photometry of kic 10661783, a short-period binarystar system which shows total eclipses and multi-periodic delta scutipulsations. a frequency analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light curve revealsat least 68 frequencies of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsationmodes. the main limitation on this analysis is the frequency resolution withinthe 27-day short-cadence light curve. most of the variability signal lies inthe frequency range 18 to 31 c/d, with amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag. oneharmonic term (2.f) and a few combination frequencies (f_i+f_j) have beendetected. from a plot of the residuals versus orbital phase we assign thepulsations to the primary star in the system. the pulsations were removed fromthe short-cadence data and the light curve was modelled using thewilson-devinney code. we are unable to get a perfect fit due to the residualeffects of pulsations and also to the treatment of reflection and reprocessingin the light curve model. a model where the secondary star fills its roche lobeis favoured, which means that kic 10661783 can be classified as an oea system.further photometric and spectroscopic observations will allow the masses andradii of the two stars to be measured to high precision and hundreds of deltascuti pulsation frequencies to be resolved. this could lead to uniqueconstraints on theoretical models of delta scuti stars, if the evolutionaryhistory of kic 10661783 can be accounted for.

1109.0705	seismic modelling of the $\beta\,$cep star hd\,180642 (v1449\,aql)	we present modelling of the $\beta\,$cep star hd\,180642 based on itsobservational properties deduced from corot and ground-based photometry as wellas from time-resolved spectroscopy. we investigate whether present-daystate-of-the-art models are able to explain the full seismic behaviour of thisstar, which has extended observational constraints for this type of pulsator.we constructed a dedicated database of stellar models and their oscillationmodes tuned to fit the dominant radial mode frequency of hd\,180642, by meansof varying the hydrogen content, metallicity, mass, age, and core overshootingparameter. we compared the seismic properties of these models with thoseobserved. we find models that are able to explain the numerous observedoscillation properties of the star, for a narrow range in mass of11.4--11.8\,m$_\odot$ and no or very mild overshooting (with up to 0.05 localpressure scale heights), except for an excitation problem of the $\ell=3$,p$_1$ mode. we deduce a rotation period of about 13\,d, which is fullycompatible with recent magnetic field measurements. the seismic models do notsupport the earlier claim of solar-like oscillations in the star. we insteadascribe the power excess at high frequency to non-linear resonant mode couplingbetween the high-amplitude radial fundamental mode and several of the low-orderpressure modes. we report a discrepancy between the seismic and spectroscopicgravity at the $2.5\sigma$ level.

1202.5553	mass ratio from doppler beaming and r{\o}mer delay versus ellipsoidal  modulation in the kepler data of koi-74	we present a light curve analysis and radial velocity study of koi-74, aneclipsing a star + white dwarf binary with a 5.2 day orbit. aside from newspectroscopy covering the orbit of the system, we used 212 days of publiclyavailable kepler observations and present the first complete light curvefitting to these data, modelling the eclipses and transits, ellipsoidalmodulation, reflection, and doppler beaming. markov chain monte carlosimulations are used to determine the system parameters and uncertaintyestimates. our results are in agreement with earlier studies, except that wefind an inclination of 87.0 \pm 0.4\degree, which is significantly lower thanthe previously published value. we find that the mass ratio derived from theradial velocity amplitude (q=0.104 \pm 0.004) disagrees with that derived fromthe ellipsoidal modulation (q=0.052 \pm 0.004} assuming corotation). this wasfound before, but with our smaller inclination, the discrepancy is even largerthan previously reported. accounting for the rapid rotation of the a-star isfound to increase the discrepancy even further by lowering the mass ratio toq=0.047 \pm 0.004. these results indicate that one has to be extremely carefulin using the amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation signal in a close binary todetermine the mass ratio, when a proof of corotation is not firmly established.the radial velocities that can be inferred from the detected doppler beaming inthe light curve are found to be in agreement with our spectroscopic radialvelocity determination. we also report the first measurement of r{\o}mer delayin a light curve of a compact binary. this delay amounts to -56 \pm 17 s and isconsistent with the mass ratio derived from the radial velocity amplitude. thefirm establishment of this mass ratio at q=0.104 \pm 0.004 leaves little doubtthat the companion of koi-74 is a low mass white dwarf.

0711.0703	automated supervised classification of variable stars i. methodology	the fast classification of new variable stars is an important step in makingthem available for further research. selection of science targets from largedatabases is much more efficient if they have been classified first. definingthe classes in terms of physical parameters is also important to get anunbiased statistical view on the variability mechanisms and the borders ofinstability strips. our goal is twofold: provide an overview of the stellarvariability classes that are presently known, in terms of some relevant stellarparameters; use the class descriptions obtained as the basis for an automated`supervised classification' of large databases. such automated classificationwill compare and assign new objects to a set of pre-defined variabilitytraining classes. for every variability class, a literature search wasperformed to find as many well-known member stars as possible, or aconsiderable subset if too many were present. next, we searched on-line andprivate databases for their light curves in the visible band and performedperiod analysis and harmonic fitting. the derived light curve parameters areused to describe the classes and define the training classifiers. we comparedthe performance of different classifiers in terms of percentage of correctidentification, of confusion among classes and of computation time. we describehow well the classes can be separated using the proposed set of parameters andhow future improvements can be made, based on new large databases such as thelight curves to be assembled by the corot and kepler space missions.

1208.4250	multisite spectroscopic seismic study of the beta cep star v2052 oph:  inhibition of mixing by its magnetic field	we used extensive ground-based multisite and archival spectroscopy to deriveobservational constraints for a seismic modelling of the magnetic beta cep starv2052 ophiuchi. the line-profile variability is dominated by a radial mode(f_1=7.14846 d^{-1}) and by rotational modulation (p_rot=3.638833 d). twonon-radial low-amplitude modes (f_2=7.75603 d^{-1} and f_3=6.82308 d^{-1}) arealso detected. the four periodicities that we found are the same as the onesdiscovered from a companion multisite photometric campaign (handler et al.2012) and known in the literature. using the photometric constraints on thedegrees l of the pulsation modes, we show that both f_2 and f_3 are progrademodes with (l,m)=(4,2) or (4,3). these results allowed us to deduce ranges forthe mass (m \in [8.2,9.6] m_o) and central hydrogen abundance (x_c \in[0.25,0.32]) of v2052 oph, to identify the radial orders n_1=1, n_2=-3 andn_3=-2, and to derive an equatorial rotation velocity v_eq \in [71,75] kms^{-1}. the model parameters are in full agreement with the effectivetemperature and surface gravity deduced from spectroscopy. only models with noor mild core overshooting (alpha_ov \in [0,0.15] local pressure scale heights)can account for the observed properties. such a low overshooting is opposite toour previous modelling results for the non-magnetic beta cep star theta ophhaving very similar parameters, except for a slower surface rotation rate. wediscuss whether this result can be explained by the presence of a magneticfield in v2052 oph that inhibits mixing in its interior.

1211.0153	constraining the core-rotation rate in red-giant stars from kepler space  photometry	rotation plays a key role in stellar structure and its evolution. throughtransport processes which induce rotational mixing of chemical species and theredistribution of angular momentum, internal stellar rotation influences theevolutionary tracks in the hertzsprung-russell diagram. in turn, evolutioninfluences the rotational properties. therefore, information on the rotationalproperties of the deep interior would help to better understand the stellarevolution. however, as the internal rotational profile cannot be measureddirectly, it remains a major unknown leaving this important aspect of modelsunconstrained. we can test for nonrigid rotation inside the stars withasteroseismology. through the effect of rotational splitting of non-radialoscillation modes, we investigate the internal rotation profile indirectly. redgiants have very slow rotation rates leading to a rotational splitting on thelevel of a few tenth of a \mu hz. only from more than 1.5 years of consecutivedata from the nasa kepler space telescope, these tiny variations could beresolved. a qualitative comparison to theoretical models allowed constrainingthe core-to-surface rotation rate for some of these evolved stars. in thispaper, we report on the first results of a large sample study of splitting ofindividual dipole modes.

0801.0741	precise radial velocities of giant stars. iv. a correlation between  surface gravity and radial velocity variation and a statistical investigation  of companion properties	since 1999, we have been conducting a radial velocity survey of 179 k giantsusing the cat at uco/lick observatory. at present ~20-100 measurements havebeen collected per star with a precision of 5 to 8 m/s. of the stars monitored,145 (80%) show radial velocity (rv) variations at a level &gt;20 m/s, of which 43exhibit significant periodicities. our aim is to investigate possiblemechanism(s) that cause these observed rv variations. we intend to test whetherthese variations are intrinsic in nature, or possibly induced by companions, orboth. in addition, we aim to characterise the parameters of these companions. arelation between log g and the amplitude of the rv variations is investigatedfor all stars in the sample. furthermore, the hypothesis that all periodic rvvariations are caused by companions is investigated by comparing their inferredorbital statistics with the statistics of companions around main sequencestars. a strong relation is found between the amplitude of the rv variationsand log g in k giant stars, as suggested earlier by hatzes &amp; cochran (1998).however, most of the stars exhibiting periodic variations are located abovethis relation. these rv variations can be split in a periodic component whichis not correlated with log g and a random residual part which does correlatewith log g. compared to main-sequence stars, k giants frequently exhibitperiodic rv variations. interpreting these rv variations as being caused bycompanions, the orbital param eters are different from the companions orbitingdwarfs. intrinsic mechanisms play an important role in producing rv variationsin k giants stars, as suggested by their dependence on log g. however, itappears that periodic rv variations are additional to these intrinsicvariations, consistent with them being caused by companions.

1407.6611	on the use of the fourier transform to determine the projected  rotational velocity of line-profile variable b stars	the fourier transform method is a popular tool to derive the rotationalvelocities of stars from their spectral line profiles. however, its domain ofvalidity does not include line-profile variables with time-dependent profiles.we investigate the performance of the method for such cases, by interpretingthe line-profile variations of spotted b stars, and of pulsating b tars, as iftheir spectral lines were caused by uniform surface rotation along withmacroturbulence. we perform time-series analysis and harmonic least-squaresfitting of various line diagnostics and of the outcome of severalimplementations of the fourier transform method. we find that the projectedrotational velocities derived from the fourier transform vary appreciablyduring the pulsation cycle whenever the pulsational and rotational velocityfields are of similar magnitude. the macroturbulent velocities derived whileignoring the pulsations can vary with tens of km/s during the pulsation cycle.the temporal behaviour of the deduced rotational and macroturbulent velocitiesare in antiphase with each other. the rotational velocity is in phase with thesecond moment of the line profiles. the application of the fourier method tostars with considerable pulsational line broadening may lead to an appreciablespread in the values of the rotation velocity, and, by implication, of thededuced value of the macroturbulence. these two quantities should therefore notbe derived from single snapshot spectra if the aim is to use them as a soliddiagnostic for the evaluation of stellar evolution models of slow to moderaterotators.

0808.3045	a seismic approach to testing different formation channels of subdwarf b  stars	there are many unknowns in the formation of subdwarf b stars. differentformation channels are considered to be possible and to lead to a variety ofhelium-burning subdwarfs. all seismic models to date, however, assume that asubdwarf b star is a post-helium-flash-core surrounded by a thin inert layer ofhydrogen. we examine an alternative formation channel, in which the subdwarf bstar originates from a massive (&gt;~2 msun) red giant with a non-degeneratehelium-core. although these subdwarfs may evolve through the same region of thelog g-teff diagram as the canonical post-flash subdwarfs, their interiorstructure is rather different. we examine how this difference affects theirpulsation modes and whether it can be observed.  using detailed stellar evolution calculations we construct subdwarf b modelsfrom both formation channels. the iron accumulation in the driving region dueto diffusion, which causes the excitation of the modes, is approximated by agaussian function. the pulsation modes and frequencies are calculated with anon-adiabatic pulsation code. a detailed comparison of two subdwarf b modelsfrom different channels, but with the same log g and teff, shows that theirmode excitation is different. the excited frequencies are lower for thepost-flash than for the post-non-degenerate subdwarf b star. this is mainly dueto the differing chemical composition of the stellar envelope. a more generalcomparison between two grids of models shows that the excited frequencies ofmost post-non-degenerate subdwarfs cannot be well-matched with the frequenciesof post-flash subdwarfs. in the rare event that an acceptable seismic match isfound, additional information, such as mode identification and log g and teffdeterminations, allows us to distinguish between the two formation channels.

astro-ph;0605311	orbital elements, masses and distance of lambda scorpii a and b  determined with the sydney university stellar interferometer and high  resolution spectroscopy	the triple system hd158926 (lambda sco) has been observed interferometricallywith the sydney university stellar interferometer and the elements of the wideorbit have been determined. these are significantly more accurate than theprevious elements found spectroscopically. the inclination of the wide orbit isconsistent with the inclination previously found for the orbit of the closecompanion. the wide orbit also has low eccentricity, suggesting that the threestars were formed at the same time.  the brightness ratio between the two b stars was also measured at lambda =442nm and 700nm. the brightness ratio and colour index are consistent with theprevious classification of lambda sco a as b1.5 and lambda sco b as b2.evolutionary models show that the two stars lie on the main sequence. sincethey have have the same age and luminosity class (iv) the mass-luminosityrelation can be used to determine the mass ratio of the two stars: m_b/m_a =0.76+/-0.04.  the spectroscopic data have been reanalyzed using the interferometric valuesfor p, t, e and omega, leading to revised values for a_1sin i and the massfunction. the individual masses can be found from the mass ratio, the massfunction, spectrum synthesis and the requirement that the age of bothcomponents must be the same: m_a = 10.4+/-1.3 msun and m_b = 8.1+/-1.0 msun.  the masses, angular semimajor axis and the period of the system can be usedto determine the dynamical parallax. we find the distance to lambda sco to be112+/-5 pc, which is approximately a factor of two closer than the hipparcosvalue of 216+/-42 pc.

astro-ph;0607264	abundance analysis of prime b-type targets for asteroseismology i.  nitrogen excess in slowly-rotating beta cephei stars	we present the results of a detailed nlte abundance study of nine beta cepheistars, all of them being prime targets for theoretical modelling: gamma peg,delta cet, nu eri, beta cma, xi1 cma, v836 cen, v2052 oph, beta cep and dd (12)lac. the following chemical elements are considered: he, c, n, o, mg, al, si, sand fe. our abundance analysis is based on a large number of time-resolved,high-resolution optical spectra covering in most cases the entire oscillationcycle of the stars. nitrogen is found to be enhanced by up to 0.6 dex in fourstars, three of which have severe constraints on their equatorial rotationalvelocity, \omega r, from seismic or line-profile variation studies: beta cep(\omega r~26 km/s), v2052 oph (\omega r~56 km/s), delta cet (\omega r &lt; 28km/s) and xi1 cma (\omega r sin i &lt; 10 km/s). the existence of core-processedmaterial at the surface of such largely unevolved, slowly-rotating objects isnot predicted by current evolutionary models including rotation. we drawattention to the fact that three stars in this subsample have a detectedmagnetic field and briefly discuss recent theoretical work pointing to theoccurrence of diffusion effects in beta cephei stars possibly capable ofaltering the nitrogen surface abundance. on the other hand, the abundances ofall the other chemical elements considered are, within the errors,indistinguishable from the values found for ob dwarfs in the solarneighbourhood. despite the mild nitrogen excess observed in some objects, wethus find no evidence for a significantly higher photospheric metal content inthe studied beta cephei stars compared to non-pulsating b-type stars of similarcharacteristics.

astro-ph;0608452	pulsations detected in the line profile variations of red giants:  modelling of line moments, line bisector and line shape	contents: so far, red giant oscillations have been studied from radialvelocity and/or light curve variations, which reveal frequencies of theoscillation modes. to characterise radial and non-radial oscillations, lineprofile variations are a valuable diagnostic. here we present for the firsttime a line profile analysis of pulsating red giants, taking into account thesmall line profile variations and the predicted short damping and re-excitationtimes. we do so by modelling the time variations in the cross correlationprofiles in terms of oscillation theory.  aims: the performance of existing diagnostics for mode identification isinvestigated for known oscillating giants which have very small line profilevariations. we modify these diagnostics, perform simulations, and characterisethe radial and non-radial modes detected in the cross correlation profiles.  methods: moments and line bisectors are computed and analysed for fourgiants. the robustness of the discriminant of the moments against smalloscillations with finite lifetimes is investigated. in addition, line profilesare simulated with short damping and re-excitation times and their line shapesare compared with the observations.  results: for three stars, we find evidence for the presence of non-radialpulsation modes, while for $\xi$ hydrae perhaps only radial modes are present.furthermore the line bisectors are not able to distinguish between differentpulsation modes and are an insufficient diagnostic to discriminate small lineprofile variations due to oscillations from exoplanet motion.

astro-ph;0609043	a line profile analysis of the pulsating red giant star epsilon ophiuchi  (g9.5iii)	so far, solar-like oscillations have been studied using radial velocityand/or light curve variations, which reveal frequencies of the oscillationmodes. line-profile variations, however, are also a valuable diagnostic tocharacterise radial and non-radial oscillations, including frequencies,amplitudes, the spherical mode wavenumbers (l,m) and the stellar inclinationangle. here we present a line profile analysis of epsilon ophiuchi, which is apulsating red giant. the main differences compared to previous line profileanalyses done for heat-driven oscillations are the small amplitudes and thepredicted short damping and re-excitation times in red giants.  two line diagnostics have been tested to see whether these are sensitive tothe small line profile variations present in red giants. in addition, lineprofiles have been simulated with short damping and re-excitation times and arecompared with the observations. this comparison reveals that non-radial modesare detected in the observed line profile variations of epsilon ophiuchi. thisis rather surprising, as theoretical predictions favours the occurrence ofradial modes.

astro-ph;0611484	statistical properties of a sample of periodically variable b-type  supergiants - evidence for opacity-driven gravity-mode oscillations	we have studied a sample of 28 periodically variable b-type supergiantsselected from the hipparcos mission and 12 comparison stars covering the wholeb-type spectral range. our goal is to test if their variability is compatiblewith opacity-driven non-radial oscillations.  we have used the nlte atmosphere code fastwind to derive the atmospheric andwind parameters of the complete sample through line profile fitting. we appliedthe method to selected h, he and si line profiles, measured with the highresolution ces spectrograph attached to the eso cat telescope in la silla,chile.  from the location of the stars in the (log teff, log g) diagram, we suggestthat variability of our sample supergiants is indeed due to the gravity modesresulting from the opacity mechanism. we find nine of the comparison stars tobe periodically variable as well, and suggest them to be new alpha cygvariables. we find marginal evidence of a correlation between the amplitude ofthe photometric variability and the wind density. we investigate the windmomentum luminosity relation for the whole range of b spectral typesupergiants, and find that the later types (&gt; b5) perfectly follow the relationfor a supergiants. additionally, we provide a new spectral type - teffcalibration for b supergiants.  our results imply the possibility to probe internal structure models ofmassive stars of spectral type b through seismic tuning of gravity modes.

astro-ph;0701449	estimating stellar parameters from spectra using a hierarchical bayesian  approach	a method is developed for fitting theoretically predicted astronomicalspectra to an observed spectrum. using a hierarchical bayesian principle, themethod takes both systematic and statistical measurement errors into account,which has not been done before in the astronomical literature. the goal is toestimate fundamental stellar parameters and their associated uncertainties. thenon-availability of a convenient deterministic relation between stellarparameters and the observed spectrum, combined with the computationalcomplexities this entails, necessitate the curtailment of the continuousbayesian model to a reduced model based on a grid of synthetic spectra. acriterion for model selection based on the so-called predictive squared errorloss function is proposed, together with a measure for the goodness-of-fitbetween observed and synthetic spectra. the proposed method is applied to theinfrared 2.38--2.60 \mic iso-sws data (infrared space observatory - shortwavelength spectrometer) of the star $\alpha$ bootis, yielding estimates forthe stellar parameters: effective temperature \teff = 4230 $\pm$ 83 k, gravity$\log$ g = 1.50 $\pm$ 0.15 dex, and metallicity [fe/h] = $-0.30 \pm 0.21$ dex.

astro-ph;0701742	the early-type close binary cv velorum revisited	our goal was to improve the fundamental parameters of the massive closedouble-lined eclipsing b2.5v+b2.5v binary cv velorum.we gathered newhigh-resolution echelle spectroscopy on 13 almost consecutive nights coveringessentially two orbits. we computed a simultaneous solution to all theavailable high-quality radial-velocity and light data with the latest versionof the wilson-deviney code. we obtained the following values for the physicalparameters: $m_1 = 6.066(74) m_\odot$, $m_2 = 5.972(70) m_\odot$, $r_1 =4.126(24) r_\odot$, $r_2 = 3.908(27) r_\odot$, $\log l_1 = 3.20(5) l_\odot$,and $\log l_2 = 3.14(5) l_\odot$. the quoted errors contain a realisticestimate of systematic uncertainties mainly stemming from the effectivetemperature estimation. we derived abundances for both components and foundthem to be compatible with those of b stars in the solar neighbourhood. wediscovered low-amplitude periodic line-profile variations with the orbitalfrequency for both components. their interpretation requires new data with alonger time span. the primary rotates subsynchronously while the secondary's$v\sin i$ and radius are compatible with synchronous rotation. finally, weprovide an update of the empirical mass-luminosity relation for main-sequence bstars which can be used for statistical predictions of masses or luminosities.

astro-ph;0702111	on the co-existence of chemically peculiar bp stars, slowly pulsating b  stars and constant b stars in the same part of the h-r diagram	aims. in order to better model massive b-type stars, we need to understandthe physical processes taking place in slowly pulsating b (spb) stars,chemically peculiar bp stars, and non-pulsating normal b stars co-existing inthe same part of the h-r diagram.  methods. we carry out a comparative study between samples of confirmed andwell-studied spb stars and a sample of well-studied bp stars with known periodsand magnetic field strengths. we determine their evolutionary state usingaccurate hipparcos parallaxes and geneva photometry. we discuss the occurrenceand strengths of magnetic fields as well as the occurrence of stellar pulsationamong both groups. further, we make a comparison of geneva photometricvariability for both kinds of stars.  results. the group of bp stars is significantly younger than the group of spbstars. longitudinal magnetic fields in spb stars are weaker than those of bpstars, suggesting that the magnetic field strength is an important factor for btype stars to become chemically peculiar. the strongest magnetic fields appearin young bp stars, indicating a magnetic field decay in stars at advanced ages.rotation periods of bp and pulsation periods of spb stars are of the same orderand the behaviour of geneva photometric variability of some bp stars cannot bedistinguished from the variability of spb stars, illustrating the difficulty tointerpret the observed variability of the order of days for b-type stars. weconsider the possibility that pulsation could be responsible for thevariability among chemically peculiar stars. in particular, we show that anon-linear pulsation model is not excluded by photometry for the bp starhd175362.
