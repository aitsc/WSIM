0901.4523	the planet-hosting subdwarf b star v391 pegasi is a hybrid pulsator	a noticeable fraction of subdwarf b stars shows either short-period (p-mode)or long-period (g-mode) luminosity variations, with two objects so far known toexhibit hybrid behaviour, i.e. showing both types of modes at the same time.the pulsating subdwarf b star v391 pegasi (or hs2201+2610), which is close tothe two known hybrid pulsators in the log g - teff plane, has recently beendiscovered to host a planetary companion. in order to learn more about theplanetary companion and its possible influence on the evolution of its hoststar (subdwarf b star formation is still not well understood), an accuratecharacterisation of the host star is required. as part of an ongoing effort tosignificantly improve the asteroseismic characterisation of the host star, weinvestigate the low-frequency behaviour of hs2201+2610. we obtained rapid highsignal-to-noise photometric ccd (b-filter) and pmt (clear-filter) data at2m-class telescopes and carried out a careful frequency analysis of the lightcurves. in addition to the previously known short-period luminosity variationsin the range 342s-367s, we find a long-period variation with a period of 54minand an amplitude of 0.15 per cent. this can most plausibly be identified with ag-mode pulsation, so that hs2201+2610 is a new addition to the short list ofhybrid sdb pulsators. along with the previously known pulsating subdwarf bstars hs0702+6043 and balloon090100001 showing hybrid behaviour, the new hybridhs2201+2610 is the third member of this class. this important property ofhs2201+2610 can lead to a better characterisation of this planet-hosting star,helping the characterisation of its planetary companion as well. currentpulsation models cannot yet reproduce hybrid sdbv stars particularly well andimproved pulsation models for this object have to include the hybrid behaviour.

0903.2217	on the possibility of detecting extrasolar planets' atmospheres with the  rossiter-mclaughlin-effect	the detection of extrasolar planets' atmospheres requires very demandingobservations. for planets that can not be spatially separated from their hoststars, i.e. the vast majority of planets, the transiting planets are the onlyones allowing to probe their atmospheres. this is possible from transmissionspectroscopy or from measurements taken during secondary eclipse. analternative is the measurement of the rossiter-mclaughlin-effect, which issensitive to the size of the planetary radius. since the radius iswavelength-dependent due to contributions of strong planetary absorption lines,this opens a path to probe planetary atmospheres also with ground-basedhigh-resolution spectroscopy. the major goal of our numerical simulations is toprovide a reliable estimate of the amplitude of the wavelength-dependentrm-effect. our numerical simulations provide phase resolved synthetic spectramodeling the partly eclipsed stellar surface during the transit in detail.using these spectra we can obtain rm-curves for different wavelength regionsand for a wavelength-dependent planetary radius. curves from regions with highand low contributions of absorption lines within the planetary atmosphere canbe compared. from these differential effects observable quantities are derived.we applied our simulations to hd209458. our numerical simulations show that adetailed treatment of the limb darkening for the synthetic spectra is importantfor a precise analysis. compared to a parameterized limb darkening law,systematic errors of 6 m/sec occur. the wavelength dependency of the planetaryatmospheres over the nad-doublet produce a differential effect in the rm-curveof 1.5 m/sec for a star with a rotation velocity of 4.5 km/sec which increasesto 4 m/sec for twice the rotation velocity.

0904.1117	detecting circumstellar disks around gravitational microlenses	we investigate the chance of detecting proto-planetary or debris disks instars that induce microlensing events (lenses). the modification of the lightcurves shapes due to occultation and extinction by the disks as well as theadditional gravitational deflection caused by the additional mass isconsidered. the magnification of gravitational microlensing events iscalculated using the ray shooting method. the occultation is taken into accountby neglecting or weighting the images on the lens plane according to atransmission map of the corresponding disk for a point source point lens (pspl)model. the estimated frequency of events is obtained by taking the possibleinclinations and optical depths of the disk into account. we conclude thatgravitational microlensing can be used, in principle, as a tool for detectingdebris disks beyond 1 kpc, but estimate that each year of the order of 1 debrisdisk is expected for lens stars of f, g, or k spectral type and of the order of10 debris disks might have shown signatures in existing datasets.

0704.1366	investigation of transit-selected exoplanet candidates from the macho  survey	context: planets outside our solar system transiting their host star, i. e.those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest toderive physical properties of extrasolar planets. with the knowledge of thehost star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density canbe derived from doppler-measurements. depending on the brightness of the hoststar, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between thehost star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.  aims: the last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.among other surveys, the macho project provided nine potential transitingplanets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. the photometricsignature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetarynature of the faint companion. the aim of this paper therefore is adetermination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as adynamical mass determination through doppler-measurements.  methods: we have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five starsselected from the macho sample, which are consistent with transits oflow-luminosity objects. radial velocities have been determined by means ofcross-correlation with model spectra. the macho light curves have been comparedto simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from theradial velocities and spectral analyses.  aims: we show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidatesanalysed in this work can be explained by eclipses of stellar objects, hencenone of the five transiting objects is a planet.

0909.0002	detecting planets around very low mass stars with the radial velocity  method	the detection of planets around very low-mass stars with the radial velocitymethod is hampered by the fact that these stars are very faint at opticalwavelengths where the most high-precision spectrometers operate. we investigatethe precision that can be achieved in radial velocity measurements of low massstars in the near infrared (nir) y-, j-, and h-bands, and we compare it to theprecision achievable in the optical. for early-m stars, radial velocitymeasurements in the nir offer no or only marginal advantage in comparison tooptical measurements. although they emit more flux in the nir, the richness ofspectral features in the optical outweighs the flux difference. we find thatnir measurement can be as precise than optical measurements in stars ofspectral type ~m4, and from there the nir gains in precision towards coolerobjects. we studied potential calibration strategies in the nir finding that astable spectrograph with a thar calibration can offer enough wavelengthstability for m/s precision. furthermore, we simulate the wavelength-dependentinfluence of activity (cool spots) on radial velocity measurements from opticalto nir wavelengths. our spot simulations reveal that the radial velocity jitterdoes not decrease as dramatically towards longer wavelengths as often thought.the jitter strongly depends on the details of the spots, i.e., on spottemperature and the spectral appearance of the spot. forthcoming nirspectrographs will allow the search for planets with a particular advantage inmid- and late-m stars. activity will remain an issue, but simultaneousobservations at optical and nir wavelengths can provide strong constraints onspot properties in active stars.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1307.1660	high angular resolution imaging and infrared spectroscopy of corot  candidates	studies of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance forunderstanding the nature of planets outside our solar system because theirmasses, diameters, and bulk densities can be measured. an important part oftransit-search programmes is the removal of false-positives. the criticalquestion is how many of the candidates that passed all previous tests are falsepositives. for our study we selected 25 corot candidates that have already beenscreened against false-positives using detailed analysis of the light curvesand seeing-limited imaging, which has transits that are between 0.7 and 0.05%deep. we observed 20 candidates with the adaptive optics imager naco and 18with the high-resolution infrared spectrograph crires. we found previouslyunknown stars within 2 arcsec of the targets in seven of the candidates. all ofthese are too faint and too close to the targets to have been previouslydetected with seeing-limited telescopes in the optical. our study thus leads tothe surprising results that if we remove all candidates excluded by thesophisticated analysis of the light-curve, as well as carrying out deep imagingwith seeing-limited telescopes, still 28-35% of the remaining candidates arefound to possess companions that are bright enough to be false-positives. giventhat the companion-candidates cluster around the targets and that the j-kcolours are consistent with physical companions, we conclude that thecompanion-candidates are more likely to be physical companions rather thanunrelated field stars.

astro-ph;0102177	the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow of grb 991208 and its host  galaxy	observations of the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow (oa) of grb991208 started 2.1 d after the event. the flux decay constant of the oa in ther-band is -2.30 +/- 0.07 up to 5 d, which is very likely due to the jet effect,and after that it is followed by a much steeper decay with constant -3.2 +/-0.2, the fastest one ever seen in a grb oa. a negative detection in severalall-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previousadditional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the grb (as expected fromthe jet effect). the existence of a second break might indicate a steepening inthe electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. once the afterglowemission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying sn is found, but thelight curve is not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echoexplanation. our determination of z = 0.706 indicates that grb 991208 is at 3.7gpc, implying an isotropic energy release of 1.15 x 10e53 erg which may berelaxed by beaming by a factor &gt; 100. precise astrometry indicates that the grbcoincides within 0.2" with the host galaxy, thus given support to a massivestar origin. the absolute magnitude is m_b = -18.2, well below the knee of thegalaxy luminosity function and we derive a star-forming rate of 11.5 +/- 7.1mo/yr. the quasi-simultaneous broad-band photometric spectral energydistribution of the afterglow is determined 3.5 day after the burst (dec 12.0)implying a cooling frequency below the optical band, i.e. supporting a jetmodel with p = -2.30 as the index of the power-law electron distribution.

[methods.] we report on rapid wide band ccd photometric observations tofollow up on and confirm the serendipitous discovery of multiperiodiclong-period luminosity variations with typical time scales of ~1h inhs0702+6043, in addition to the two previously known pulsations at 363s and383s. in particular, we isolate a relatively low-amplitude (~4 mmag),long-period (3538+-130s) light variation.  [results.] we argue that the most likely origin for this luminosity variationis the presence of an excited g-mode pulsation. if confirmed, hs0702+6043 wouldconstitute a rare addition to the very select class of pulsating stars showingsimultaneously parts of their pressure and gravity mode pulsation spectra. theasteroseismological potential of such stars is immense, and hs0702+6043 thusbecomes a target of choice for future investigations. while our discoveryappears consistent with the location of hs0702+6043 at the common boundarybetween the two families of pulsating sdb stars, it does challenge theory'scurrent description of stability and driving mechanisms in pulsating bsubdwarfs.
