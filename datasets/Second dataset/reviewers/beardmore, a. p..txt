0902.2199	swift x-ray and uv monitoring of the classical nova v458 vul (nova vul  2007)	we describe the highly variable x-ray and uv emission of v458 vul (nova vul2007), observed by swift between 1 and 422 days after outburst. initiallybright only in the uv, v458 vul became a variable hard x-ray source due tooptically thin thermal emission at kt=0.64 kev with an x-ray band unabsorbedluminosity of 2.3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} during days 71-140. the x-ray spectrum atthis time requires a low fe abundance (0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.1} solar), consistentwith a suzaku measurement around the same time. on day 315 we find a new x-rayspectral component which can be described by a blackbody with temperature ofkt=23^{+9}_{-5} ev, while the previous hard x-ray component has declined by afactor of 3.8. the spectrum of this soft x-ray component resembles thosetypically seen in the class of supersoft sources (sss) which suggests that thenova ejecta were starting to clear and/or that the wd photosphere is shrinkingto the point at which its thermal emission reaches into the x-ray band. we finda high degree of variability in the soft component with a flare rising by anorder of magnitude in count rate in 0.2 days. in the following observations ondays 342.4-383.6, the soft component was not seen, only to emerge again on day397. the hard component continued to evolve, and we found an anticorrelationbetween the hard x-ray emission and the uv emission, yielding a spearman rankprobability of 97%. after day 397, the hard component was still present, wasvariable, and continued to fade at an extremely slow rate but could not beanalysed owing to pile up contamination from the bright sss component.

0704.1297	the exceptionally extended flaring activity in the x-ray afterglow of  grb 050730 observed with swift and xmm-newton	we present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of swiftand xmm-newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) grb 050730. thex-ray afterglow of grb 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposedintense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitudein time. seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ksafter the burst were observed. the underlying decay of the afterglow was welldescribed by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 sand t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. the temporal decay slopes before, between andafter these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. the spectrum of the x-rayafterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with anabsorbing column density n_h=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.strong x-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. in themajority of the flares (6/7) the ratio delta_t/t_p between the duration of theevent and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.we showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first threeflares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, asexpected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshedshocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slowmoving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. theevent fully satisfies the e_p-e_iso amati relation while is not consistent withthe e_p-e_jet ghirlanda relation.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0909.1670	x-ray and uv observations of nova v598 puppis between 147 and 255 days  after outburst	aims: the launch of swift has allowed many more novae to be observedregularly over the x-ray band. such x-ray observations of novae can revealejecta shocks and the nuclear burning white dwarf, allowing estimates to bemade of the ejecta velocity. methods: we analyse xmm-newton and swift x-ray anduv observations of the nova v598 pup, which was initially discovered in thexmm-newton slew survey. these data were obtained between 147 and 255 days afterthe nova outburst, and are compared with the earlier, brighter slew detection.results: the x-ray spectrum consists of a super-soft source, with the softemission becoming hotter and much fainter between days ~147 and ~172 after theoutburst, and a more slowly declining optically thin component, formed byshocks with kt ~ 200-800 ev (corresponding to velocities of 400-800 km s^-1).the main super-soft phase had a duration of less than 130 days. the reflectiongrating spectrometer data show evidence of emission lines consistent withoptically thin emission of kt ~100 ev and place a limit on the density of thesurrounding medium of log(n_e/cm^-3) &lt; 10.4 at the 90 % level. the uv emissionis variable over short timescales and fades by at least one magnitude (atlambda ~ 2246-2600 angstrom) between days 169 and 255.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1007.2185	the unusual x-ray emission of the short swift grb 090515: evidence for  the formation of a magnetar?	the majority of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to originate fromthe merger of compact binary systems collapsing directly to form a black hole.however, it has been proposed that both sgrbs and long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)may, on rare occasions, form an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) prior tofinal collapse. grb 090515, detected by the swift satellite was extremelyshort, with a t_90 of 0.036 +/- 0.016 s, and had a very low fluence of 2 x10^-8 erg cm^-2 and faint optical afterglow. despite this, the 0.3 - 10 kevflux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a sgrb by the swift x-raytelescope (xrt). the x-ray light curve showed an unusual plateau and steepdecay, becoming undetectable after ~500 s. this behaviour is similar to thatobserved in some long bursts proposed to have magnetars contributing to theiremission. in this paper, we present the swift observations of grb 090515 andcompare it to other gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the swift sample. additionally,we present optical observations from gemini, which detected an afterglow ofmagnitude 26.4 +/- 0.1 at t+ 1.7 hours after the burst. we discuss potentialcauses of the unusual 0.3 - 10 kev emission and suggest it might be energyinjection from an unstable millisecond pulsar. using the duration and flux ofthe plateau of grb 090515, we place constraints on the millisecond pulsar spinperiod and magnetic field.

1101.6055	swift follow-up observations of maxi discovered galactic transients	we describe the results of the first year of a program to localize newgalactic transient sources discovered by maxi with nasa's swift mission. swiftis ideally suited for follow-up of maxi discovered transients as its x-raytelescope (xrt) field of view (~0.2 degrees radius) is closely matched to thetypical maxi error circle. the xrt is capable of localizing new sources to anaccuracy of up to 1.5 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence), and the swiftoptical/uv telescope also provides optical imaging of any optical counterpartof the x-ray source. if no optical counterpart is found with swift (usually dueto absorption), the xrt position is good enough to allow for ground based irtelescopes to positively identify the optical counterpart. althoughlocalization and identification of maxi transients is the main aim of theprogram, these are often followed up by long term monitoring of the source. wepresent here results from 2 of these monitoring programs: the black-holecandidate maxi j1659-152, and the be/x-ray binary candidate maxi j1409-619.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1106.2824	swift observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova rs  ophiuchi: iii. x-ray spectral modelling	following the swift x-ray observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrentnova rs ophiuchi, we developed hydrodynamical models of mass ejection fromwhich the forward shock velocities were used to estimate the ejecta mass andvelocity. in order to further constrain our model parameters, here we presentsynthetic x-ray spectra from our hydrodynamical calculations which we compareto the swift data. an extensive set of simulations was carried out to find amodel which best fits the spectra up to 100 days after outburst. we find a goodfit at high energies but require additional absorption to match the low energyemission. we estimate the ejecta mass to be in the range (2-5) x 10^{-7} solarmasses and the ejection velocity to be greater than 6000 km/s (and probablycloser to 10,000 km/s). we also find that estimates of shock velocity derivedfrom gas temperatures via standard model fits to the x-ray spectra are muchlower than the true shock velocities.

1108.5049	recovering swift-xrt energy resolution through ccd charge trap mapping	the x-ray telescope on board the swift satellite for gamma-ray burstastronomy has been exposed to the radiation of the space environment sincelaunch in november 2004. radiation causes damage to the detector, with thegeneration of dark current and charge trapping sites that result in thedegradation of the spectral resolution and an increase of the instrumentalbackground. the swift team has a dedicated calibration program with the goal ofrecovering a significant proportion of the lost spectroscopic performance.calibration observations of supernova remnants with strong emission lines areanalysed to map the detector charge traps and to derive position-dependentcorrections to the measured photon energies. we have achieved a substantialrecovery in the xrt resolution by implementing these corrections in an updatedversion of the swift xrt gain file and in corresponding improvements to theswift xrt heasoft software. we provide illustrations of the impact of theenhanced energy resolution, and show that we have recovered most of thespectral resolution lost since launch.

1110.6224	swift x-ray observations of classical novae. ii. the super soft source  sample	the swift grb satellite is an excellent facility for studying novae. itsrapid response time and sensitive x-ray detector provides an unparalleledopportunity to investigate the previously poorly sampled evolution of novae inthe x-ray regime. this paper presents swift observations of 52galactic/magellanic cloud novae. we included the xrt (0.3-10 kev) x-rayinstrument count rates and the uvot (1700-8000 angstroms) filter photometry.also included in the analysis are the publicly available pointed observationsof 10 additional novae the x-ray archives. this is the largest x-ray sample ofgalactic/magellanic cloud novae yet assembled and consists of 26 novae withsuper soft x-ray emission, 19 from swift observations. the data set shows thatthe faster novae have an early hard x-ray phase that is usually missing inslower novae. the super soft x-ray phase occurs earlier and does not last aslong in fast novae compared to slower novae. all the swift novae withsufficient observations show that novae are highly variable with rapidvariability and different periodicities. in the majority of cases, nuclearburning ceases less than 3 years after the outburst begins. previousrelationships, such as the nuclear burning duration vs. t_2 or the expansionvelocity of the eject and nuclear burning duration vs. the orbital period, areshown to be poorly correlated with the full sample indicating that additionalfactors beyond the white dwarf mass and binary separation play important rolesin the evolution of a nova outburst. finally, we confirm two optical phenomenathat are correlated with strong, soft x-ray emission which can be used tofurther increase the efficiency of x-ray campaigns.

1111.0283	panchromatic observations of the textbook grb 110205a: constraining  physical mechanisms of prompt emission and afterglow	we present a comprehensive analysis of a bright, long duration (t90 ~ 257 s)grb 110205a at redshift z= 2.22. the optical prompt emission was detected byswift/uvot, rotse-iiib and bootes telescopes when the grb was still radiatingin the gamma-ray band. nearly 200 s of observations were obtainedsimultaneously from optical, x-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of theexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6orders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. by fitting thetime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, aninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard grbsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. although the promptoptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit x/gamma-rayspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation tothe prompt high energy emission. the synchrotron + ssc scenario is disfavoredby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having twoemission regions can interpret the data well. shortly after prompt emission (~1100 s), a bright (r = 14.0) optical emission hump with very steep rise (alpha~ 5.5) was observed which we interpret as the emission from the reverse shock.it is the first time that the rising phase of a reverse shock component hasbeen closely observed. the full optical and x-ray afterglow lightcurves can beinterpreted within the standard reverse shock (rs) + forward shock (fs) model.in general, the high quality prompt emission and afterglow data allow us toapply the standard fireball shock model to extract valuable information aboutthe grb including the radiation mechanism, radius of prompt emission r, initiallorentz factor of the outflow, the composition of the ejecta, as well as thecollimation angle and the total energy budget.

1112.3965	swift follow-up observations of unclassified asca sources	we present swift follow-up observations of a sample of 35 unclassified faintx-ray sources drawn from the asca galactic centre and plane surveys. our shortpointed xrt observations allow detections down to a limiting 0.3-10 kev flux of~1e-13 erg cm-2 s-1, which translates into a luminosity of ~1e33 erg s-1 for anassumed distance of d=8 kpc. the brightest source in our sample reaches amaximum 0.3-10 kev luminosity of ~2e36 (d/8kpc)^2 erg s-1 during ourobservations. we detect 16 (46%) of the asca sources with the xrt, while 19were not detected during our program. since we are probing the faint end of theasca source populations, we expect a large fraction of the non-detections to bedue to the eddington bias. this is strengthened by the fact that we find theobserved xrt count rates to be predominantly lower than expected based on thereported asca intensities. investigation of the asca properties and long-termx-ray variability leads us to conclude that the non-detections likely includetwo spurious asca detections and three objects that are variable or transientx-ray sources. for the 16 xrt-detected sources we obtain positional accuraciesof ~2-4", which significantly improves upon their asca uncertainties of ~1'. weuse the x-ray spectra and variability to characterise these objects. mostappear to be faint, persistent x-ray emitters that have highly absorbedspectra. based on their x-ray properties we identify three accreting compactobjects: one confirmed (ax j1754.2-2754) and one candidate (ax j1538.3-5541)x-ray binary, and one possible magnetically accreting white dwarf (axj1620.1-5002). furthermore, we use the improved positions of xrt-detectedsources to search for counterparts in simultaneously obtained swift/uvot imagesand possible associations with cataloged sources at various wavelengths. thisreveals three possible main sequence stars amongst our sample.

1207.1444	a search for thermal x-ray signatures in gamma-ray bursts i: swift  bursts with optical supernovae	the x-ray spectra of gamma-ray bursts can generally be described by anabsorbed power law. the landmark discovery of thermal x-ray emission inaddition to the power law in the unusual grb 060218, followed by a similardiscovery in grb 100316d, showed that during the first thousand seconds aftertrigger the soft x-ray spectra can be complex. both the origin and prevalenceof such spectral components still evade understanding, particularly after thediscovery of thermal x-ray emission in the classical grb 090618. possibly mostimportantly, these three objects are all associated with optical supernovae,begging the question of whether the thermal x-ray components could be a resultof the grb-sn connection, possibly in the shock breakout. we thereforeperformed a search for blackbody components in the early swift x-ray spectra of11 grbs that have or may have associated optical supernovae, accuratelyrecovering the thermal components reported in the literature for grbs 060218,090618 and 100316d. we present the discovery of a cooling blackbody in grb101219b/sn2010ma, and in four further grb-sne we find an improvement in the fitwith a blackbody which we deem possible blackbody candidates due tocase-specific caveats. all the possible new blackbody components we report lieat the high end of the luminosity and radius distribution. grb 101219b appearsto bridge the gap between the low-luminosity and the classical grb-sne withthermal emission, and following the blackbody evolution we derive an expansionvelocity for this source of order 0.4c. we discuss potential origins for thethermal x-ray emission in our sample, including a cocoon model which we findcan accommodate the more extreme physical parameters implied by many of ourmodel fits.

0711.3739	when grb afterglows get softer, hard components come into play	we aim to investigate the ability of simple spectral models to describe thegrb early afterglow emission. we performed a time resolved spectral analysis ofa bright grb sample detected by the swift burst alert telescope and promptlyobserved by the swift x-ray telescope,with spectroscopically measured redshiftin the period april 2005 -- january 2007. the sample consists of 22 grbs and atotal of 214 spectra. we restricted our analysis to the softest spectrasub--sample which consists of 13 spectra with photon index &gt; 3. in this samplewe found that four spectra, belonging to grb060502a, grb060729, grb060904b,grb061110a prompt--afterglow transition phase, cannot be modeled neither by asingle power law nor by the band model. instead we find that the data presenthigh energy (&gt; 3 kev, in the observer frame) excesses with respect to thesemodels. we estimated the joint statistical significance of these excesses atthe level of 4.3 sigma. in all four cases, the deviations can be modeled wellby adding either a second power law or a blackbody component to the usualsynchrotron power law spectrum. the additional power law would be explained bythe emerging of the afterglow, while the blackbody could be interpreted as thephotospheric emission from x-ray flares or as the shock breakout emission. inone case these models leave a 2.2 sigma excess which can be fit by a gaussianline at the energy the highly ionized nickel recombination. although the datado not allow an unequivocal interpretation, the importance of this analysisconsists in the fact that we show that a simple power law model or a band modelare insufficient to describe the x-ray spectra of a small homogeneous sample ofgrbs at the end of their prompt phase.

1210.4652	timing accuracy of the swift x-ray telescope in wt mode	the x-ray telescope (xrt) on board swift was mainly designed to providedetailed position, timing and spectroscopic information on gamma-ray burst(grb) afterglows. during the mission lifetime the fraction of observing timeallocated to other types of source has been steadily increased. in this paper,we report on the results of the in-flight calibration of the timingcapabilities of the xrt in windowed timing read-out mode. we use observationsof the crab pulsar to evaluate the accuracy of the pulse period determinationby comparing the values obtained by the xrt timing analysis with the valuesderived from radio monitoring. we also check the absolute time reconstructionmeasuring the phase position of the main peak in the crab profile and comparingit both with the value reported in literature and with the result that weobtain from a simultaneous rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) observation. wefind that the accuracy in period determination for the crab pulsar is of theorder of a few picoseconds for the observation with the largest data time span.the absolute time reconstruction, measured using the position of the crab mainpeak, shows that the main peak anticipates the phase of the position reportedin literature for rxte by ~270 microseconds on average (~150 microseconds whendata are reduced with the attitude file corrected with the uvot data). theanalysis of the simultaneous swift-xrt and rxte proportional counter array(pca) observations confirms that the xrt crab profile leads the pca profile by~200 microseconds. the analysis of xrt photodiode mode data and bat event datashows a main peak position in good agreement with the rxte, suggesting thediscrepancy observed in xrt data in windowed timing mode is likely due to asystematic offset in the time assignment for this xrt read out mode.

1303.0843	calibration of x-ray absorption in our galaxy	prediction of the soft x-ray absorption along lines of sight through ourgalaxy is crucial for understanding the spectra of extragalactic sources, butrequires a good estimate of the foreground column density of photoelectricabsorbing species. assuming uniform elemental abundances this reduces to havinga good estimate of the total hydrogen column density, n(htot)=n(hi)+2n(h2). theatomic component, n(hi), is reliably provided using the mapped 21 cm radioemission but estimating the molecular hydrogen column density, n(h2), expectedfor any particular direction, is difficult. the x-ray afterglows of grbs areideal sources to probe x-ray absorption in our galaxy because they areextragalactic, numerous, bright, have simple spectra and occur randomly acrossthe entire sky. we describe an empirical method, utilizing 493 afterglowsdetected by the swift xrt, to determine n(htot) through the milky way whichprovides an improved estimate of the x-ray absorption in our galaxy and therebyleads to more reliable measurements of the intrinsic x-ray absorption and,potentially, other spectral parameters, for extragalactic x-ray sources. wederive a simple function, dependent on the product of the atomic hydrogencolumn density, n(hi), and dust extinction, e(b-v), which describes thevariation of the molecular hydrogen column density, n(h2), of our galaxy, overthe sky. using the resulting n(htot) we show that the dust-to-hydrogen ratio iscorrelated with the carbon monoxide emission and use this ratio to estimate thefraction of material which forms interstellar dust grains. our resulting reciperepresents a significant revision in galactic absorption compared to previousstandard methods, particularly at low galactic latitudes.

1305.6894	an anti-glitch in a magnetar	magnetars are neutron stars showing dramatic x-ray and soft $\gamma$-rayoutbursting behaviour that is thought to be powered by intense internalmagnetic fields. like conventional young neutron stars in the form of radiopulsars, magnetars exhibit "glitches" during which angular momentum is believedto be transferred between the solid outer crust and the superfluid component ofthe inner crust. hitherto, the several hundred observed glitches in radiopulsars and magnetars have involved a sudden spin-up of the star, duepresumably to the interior superfluid rotating faster than the crust. here wereport on x-ray timing observations of the magnetar 1e 2259+586 which we showexhibited a clear "anti-glitch" -- a sudden spin down. we show that this event,like some previous magnetar spin-up glitches, was accompanied by multiple x-rayradiative changes and a significant spin-down rate change. this event, if oforigin internal to the star, is unpredicted in models of neutron star spin-downand is suggestive of differential rotation in the neutron star, furthersupporting the need for a rethinking of glitch theory for all neutron stars.

1309.4816	the use and calibration of read-out streaks to increase the dynamic  range of the swift ultraviolet/optical telescope	the dynamic range of photon counting micro-channel-plate (mcp) intensifiedcharged-coupled device (ccd) instruments such as the swift ultraviolet/opticaltelescope (uvot) and the xmm-newton optical monitor (xmm-om) is limited at thebright end by coincidence loss, the superposition of multiple photons in theindividual frames recorded by the ccd. photons which arrive during the briefperiod in which the image frame is transferred for read out of the ccd aredisplaced in the transfer direction in the recorded images. for sufficientlybright sources, these displaced counts form read-out streaks. using uvotobservations of tycho-2 stars, we investigate the use of these read-out streaksto obtain photometry for sources which are too bright (and hence have too muchcoincidence loss) for normal aperture photometry to be reliable. forread-out-streak photometry, the bright-source limiting factor is coincidenceloss within the mcps rather than the ccd. we find that photometric measurementscan be obtained for stars up to 2.4 magnitudes brighter than the usualfull-frame coincidence-loss limit by using the read-out streaks. the resultingbright-limit vega magnitudes in the uvot passbands are uvw2=8.80, uvm2=8.27,uvw1=8.86, u=9.76, b=10.53, v=9.31 and white=11.71; these limits areindependent of the windowing mode of the camera. we find that a photometricprecision of 0.1 mag can be achieved through read-out streak measurements. asuitable method for the measurement of read-out streaks is described and allnecessary calibration factors are given.

1403.4079	grb 130925a: an ultra-long gamma ray burst with a dust-echo afterglow,  and implications for the origin of the ultra-long grbs	grb 130925a was an unusual grb, consisting of 3 distinct episodes ofhigh-energy emission spanning $\sim$20 ks, making it a member of the proposedcategory of `ultra-long' bursts. it was also unusual in that its late-timex-ray emission observed by swift was very soft, and showed a stronghard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. this evolution, rarely seen in grbafterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the promptemission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow(i.e. external shock) emission. we consider and reject the possibility that grb130925a was some form of tidal disruption event, and instead show that if thecircumburst density around grb 130925a is low, the long duration of the burstand faint external shock emission are naturally explained. indeed, we suggestthat the ultra-long grbs as a class can be explained as those with lowcircumburst densities, such that the deceleration time (at which point thematerial ejected from the nascent black hole is decelerated by the circumburstmedium) is $\sim$20 ks, as opposed to a few hundred seconds for the normal longgrbs. the increased deceleration radius means that more of the ejected shellscan interact before reaching the external shock, naturally explaining both theincreased duration of grb 130925a, the duration of its prompt pulses, and thefainter-than-normal afterglow.

0805.4698	outliers from the mainstream: how a massive star can produce a gamma-ray  burst	it is now recognized that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are linked tothe collapse of massive stars, based on the association between (low-redshift)grbs and (type ic) core-collapse supernovae (sne). the census of massive starsand grbs reveals, however, that not all massive stars do produce a grb. only~1% of core collapse sne are able to produce a highly relativistic collimatedoutflow, and hence a grb. the extra crucial parameter has long been suspectedto be metallicity and/or rotation. we find observational evidence stronglysupporting that both ingredients are necessary in order to make a grb out of acore-collapsing star. a detailed study of the absorption pattern in the x-rayspectrum of grb060218 reveals evidence of material highly enriched in lowatomic number metals ejected before the sn/grb explosion. we find that, withinthe current scenarios of stellar evolution, only a progenitor starcharacterized by a fast stellar rotation and sub-solar initial metallicitycould produce such a metal enrichment in its close surrounding.

astro-ph;0506453	prompt and afterglow early x-ray phases in the comoving frame. evidence  for universal properties?	we analyze the swift xrt light curves and spectra of the gamma-ray bursts(grbs) for which the redshift has been measured. the sample consists of sevengrbs. the soft x-ray light curves of all these grbs are separated into at leasttwo morphological classes: 1) those starting off with a very steep light curvedecay and 2) those showing a rather mild initial decay. this initial decay isfollowed by a flattening and by a further steepening. during these transitionsthe soft x-ray spectrum of these grbs remains constant within the observationalerrors (except for one case, grb050319). for the first time we are able toexploit the early light curve of grb afterglows in the comoving frame. besidesthe temporal and spectral behavior we find that the energy of the afterglowemitted in the (rest frame) time interval 20-200 s and 1300-12600 s after thetrigger correlates with the mean energy of the prompt emission, hinting at aclose link between the two. averaging over the bursts that have a rather wellsampled light curve and starting immediately after the prompt phase, the energyemitted in the soft x-rays is about 3% of the energy emitted during the promptphase, except for grb050315, where the soft x-ray emission is as high as 14% ofthe prompt emission.

astro-ph;0508332	evidence for a canonical grb afterglow light curve in the swift/xrt data	we present new observations of the early x-ray afterglows of the first 27gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected with the swift x-ray telescope (xrt). theearly x-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadlyconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay(t^{-alpha} with 3&lt;alpha_1&lt;5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay(0.2&lt;alpha_2&lt;0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1&lt;alpha_3&lt;1.5).these power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,300s&lt;t_{break,1}&lt;500s and 10^3s&lt;t_{break,2}&lt;10^4s. on top of this canonicalbehavior of the early x-ray light curve, many events have superimposed x-rayflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lastingsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the grb. wefind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of theprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to ourline of sight. the first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes placewhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallowflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into theexternal shock. when this energy injection stops, a second break is thenobserved in the light curve (t_{break,2}). this energy injection increases theenergy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f&gt;4, and augments thealready severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-rayemission.

astro-ph;0509737	detection of a huge explosion in the early universe	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are bright flashes of high energy photons that canlast from about 10 milliseconds to 10 minutes. their origin and nature havepuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the firstx-ray afterglows of long (&gt; 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the firstoptical and radio counterparts were found. these measurements established thatlong grbs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminousstar-forming host galaxies. they are likely produced in core-collapseexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativisticjets (collapsar model). internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of therelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slowmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. these shocksare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularlyshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinctinternal collision. the expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellarmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible forproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the x-ray, optical andradio bands. here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the mostdistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to adistance of 13 billion light-years from earth, corresponding to a time when theuniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old. the discovery of agamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive starsonly 700 million years after the big bang. the very high redshift burstsrepresent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the universecame out of the dark ages.

astro-ph;0510008	grb 050117: simultaneous gamma-ray and x-ray observations with the swift  satellite	the swift gamma-ray burst explorer performed its first autonomous, x-rayfollow-up to a newly detected grb on 2005 january 17, within 193 seconds of theburst trigger by the swift burst alert telescope. while the burst was still inprogress, the x-ray telescope obtained a position and an image for anun-catalogued x-ray source; simultaneous with the gamma-ray observation. thexrt observed flux during the prompt emission was 1.1 x 10^{-8} ergs cm^{-2}s^{-1} in the 0.5-10 kev energy band. the emission in the x-ray band decreasedby three orders of magnitude within 700 seconds, following the prompt emission.this is found to be consistent with the gamma-ray decay when extrapolated intothe xrt energy band. during the following 6.3 hours, the xrt observed theafterglow in an automated sequence for an additional 947 seconds, until theburst became fully obscured by the earth limb. a faint, extremely slowlydecaying afterglow, alpha=-0.21$, was detected. finally, a break in thelightcurve occurred and the flux decayed with alpha&lt;-1.2$. the x-ray positiontriggered many follow-up observations: no optical afterglow could be confirmed,although a candidate was identified 3 arcsecs from the xrt position.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

astro-ph;0510677	swift observations of the x-ray bright grb 050315	this paper discusses swift observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 050315(z=1.949) from 80 s to 10 days after the onset of the burst. the x-ray lightcurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.however, both the prompt hard x-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the bat)and the first ~ 300 s of x-ray emission (observed by the xrt) can be explainedby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. extrapolating the batlight curve into the xrt band suggests the rapidly decaying, early x-rayemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strongsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray emission may be relatedto the simple temporal and spectral character of this x-ray rich grb. theprompt (bat) spectrum was a steep down to 15 kev, and appeared to continuethrough the xrt bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with theamati relation. following the initial steep decline the x-ray afterglow did notfade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index ofalpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.the apparent `plateau' in the x-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep x-ray lightcurves revealed by swift. if the second afterglow break is identified with ajet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying e_gamma&gt; 10^50 erg.

astro-ph;0512358	grb 050911: a black hole - neutron star merger or a naked grb	grb 050911, discovered by the swift burst alert telescope, was not seen 4.6hr later by the swift x-ray telescope, making it one of the very few x-raynon-detections of a gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow at early times. thegamma-ray light-curve shows at least three peaks, the first two of which (~t_0- 0.8 and t_0 + 0.2 s, where t_0 is the trigger time) were short, each lasting0.5 s. this was followed by later emission 10-20 s post-burst. the upper limiton the unabsorbed x-ray flux was 1.7 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (integrating 46 ksof data taken between 11 and 18 september), indicating that the decay must havebeen rapid. all but one of the long bursts detected by swift were above thislimit at ~4.6 hr, whereas the afterglows of short bursts became undetectablemore rapidly. deep observations with gemini also revealed no optical afterglow12 hr after the burst, down to r=24.0 (5-sigma limit). we speculate that grb050911 may have been formed through a compact object (black hole-neutron star)merger, with the later outbursts due to a longer disc lifetime linked to alarge mass ratio between the merging objects. alternatively, the burst may haveoccured in a low density environment, leading to a weak, or non-existent,forward shock - the so-called 'naked grb' model.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0601173	x-ray flare in xrf 050406: evidence for prolonged engine activity	we present observations of xrf 050406, the first burst detected by swiftshowing a flare in its x-ray light curve. during this flare, which peaks att_peak ~210s after the bat trigger, a flux variation of (delta f)/f~6 in a veryshort time (delta t)/t_peak&lt;&lt;1 was observed. its measured fluence in the 0.2-10kev band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the promptfluence. we present indications of spectral variations during the flare. weargue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies thatthe central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power withrespect to the prompt emission. the x-ray light curve flattens to a veryshallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supportscontinued central engine activity at late times. this burst is classified as anx-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 kevband, e_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significantflux above ~50 kev and a peak energy e_p&lt;15 kev. xrf 050406 is one of the firstexamples of a well-studied x-ray light curve of an xrf. we show that the mainafterglow characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of normal grbs. inparticular, x-ray flares superimposed on a power-law light curve have now beenseen in both xrfs and grbs. this indicates that a similar mechanism may be atwork for both kinds of events.

astro-ph;0602497	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments. indeed, swift-bat triggered on aprecursor ~570s before the main burst peak, and this allowed swift to repointthe narrow field instruments to the burst position ~350s before the main burstoccurred. grb 060124 also triggered konus-wind, which observed the promptemission in a harder gamma-ray band (up to 2mev). thanks to these exceptionalcircumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission canbe studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges. while the x-ray emission(0.2-10kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst, the optical component follows adifferent pattern, likely indicating a different origin, possibly the onset ofexternal shocks. the prompt grb spectrum shows significant spectral evolution,with both the peak energy and the spectral index varying. as observed inseveral long grbs, significant lags are measured between the hard- andlow-energy components, showing that this behaviour extends over 3 decades inenergy. the grb peaks are also much broader at soft energies. this is relatedto the temporal evolution of the spectrum, and can be accounted for by assumingthat the electron spectral index softened with time. the burst energy(e_iso~5x10^{53} erg) and average peak energy (e_p~300kev) make grb 060124consistent with the amati relation. the x-ray afterglow is characterized by adecay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0610570	swift observations of grb050904: the most distant cosmic explosion ever  observed	swift discovered the high redshift (z=6.29) grb050904 with the burst alerttelescope (bat) and began observing with its narrow field instruments 161 safter the burst onset. this gamma-ray burst is the most distant cosmicexplosion ever observed. because of its high redshift, the x-ray telescope(xrt) and bat simultaneous observations provide 4 orders of magnitude ofspectral coverage (0.2-150 kev; 1.4-1090 kev in the source rest frame) at avery early source-frame time (22 s). grb050904 was a long, multi-peaked, brightgrb with strong variability during its entire evolution. the light curveobserved by the xrt is characterized by the presence of a long flaring activitylasting up to 1-2 hours after the burst onset in the burst rest frame, with noevidence of a smooth power-law decay following the prompt emission as seen inother grbs. however, the bat tail extrapolated to the xrt band joins the xrtearly light curve and the overall behavior resembles that of a very long grbprompt. the spectral energy distribution softens with time, with the photonindex decreasing from -1.2 during the bat observation to -1.9 at the end of thexrt observation. the dips of the late x-ray flares may be consistent with anunderlying x-ray emission arising from the forward shock and with theproperties of the optical afterglow reported by tagliaferri et al. (2005b). weinterpret the bat and xrt data as a single continuous observation of the promptemission from a very long grb. the peculiarities observed in grb050904 could bedue to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the universe;very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide anexplanation.
