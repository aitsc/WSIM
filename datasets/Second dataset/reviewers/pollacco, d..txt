0905.4625	high-speed knots in the hourglass shaped planetary nebula hubble 12	we present a detailed kinematical analysis of the young compacthourglass-shaped planetary nebula hb 12. we performed optical imaging andlongslit spectroscopy of hb 12 using the manchester echelle spectrometer withthe 2.1m san pedro martir telescope. we reveal, for the first time, thepresence of end caps (or knots) aligned with the bipolar lobes of the planetarynebula shell in a deep [nii]6584 image of hb 12. we measured from ourspectroscopy radial velocities of 120 km/s for these knots. we have derived theinclination angle of the hourglass shaped nebular shell to be 65 degrees to theline of sight. it has been suggested that hb 12's central star system is aneclipsing binary (hsia et al. 2006) which would imply a binary inclination ofat least 80 degrees. however, if the central binary has been the major shapinginfluence on the nebula then both nebula and binary would be expected to sharea common inclination angle. finally, we report the discovery of high-velocityknots with hubble-type velocities, close to the core of hb 12, observed inhalpha and oriented in the same direction as the end caps. very differentvelocities and kinematical ages were calculated for the outer and inner knotsshowing that they may originate from different outburst events.

0905.4680	a transit timing analysis of nine rise light curves of the exoplanet  system tres-3	we present nine newly observed transits of tres-3, taken as part of a transittiming program using the rise instrument on the liverpool telescope. amarkov-chain monte-carlo analysis was used to determine the planet-star radiusratio and inclination of the system, which were found to berp/rstar=0.1664^{+0.0011}_{-0.0018} and i = 81.73^{+0.13}_{-0.04} respectively,consistent with previous results. the central transit times and uncertaintieswere also calculated, using a residual-permutation algorithm as an independentcheck on the errors. a re-analysis of eight previously published tres-3 lightcurves was conducted to determine the transit times and uncertainties usingconsistent techniques. whilst the transit times were not found to be inagreement with a linear ephemeris, giving chi^2 = 35.07 for 15 degrees offreedom, we interpret this to be the result of systematics in the light curvesrather than a real transit timing variation. this is because the light curvesthat show the largest deviation from a constant period either have relativelylittle out-of-transit coverage, or have clear systematics. a new ephemeris wascalculated using the transit times, and was found to be t_c(0) = 2454632.62610+- 0.00006 hjd and p = 1.3061864 +- 0.0000005 days. the transit times were thenused to place upper mass limits as a function of the period ratio of apotential perturbing planet, showing that our data are sufficiently sensitiveto have probed for sub-earth mass planets in both interior and exterior 2:1resonances, assuming the additional planet is in an initially circular orbit.

0906.3414	a superwasp search for additional transiting planets in 24 known systems	we present results from a search for additional transiting planets in 24systems already known to contain a transiting planet. we model the transits dueto the known planet in each system and subtract these models from lightcurvesobtained with the superwasp survey instruments. these residual lightcurves arethen searched for evidence of additional periodic transit events. although wedo not find any evidence for additional planets in any of the planetary systemsstudied, we are able to characterise our ability to find such planets by meansof monte carlo simulations. artificially generated transit signalscorresponding to planets with a range of sizes and orbital periods wereinjected into the superwasp photometry and the resulting lightcurves searchedfor planets. as a result, the detection efficiency as a function of both theradius and orbital period of any second planet, is calculated. we determinethat there is a good (&gt; 50 per cent) chance of detecting additional,saturn-sized planets in p ~ 10 d orbits around planet-hosting stars that haveseveral seasons of superwasp photometry. additionally, we confirm previousevidence of the rotational stellar variability of wasp-10, and refine theperiod of rotation. we find that the period of the rotation is 11.91 \pm 0.05d, and the false alarm probability for this period is extremely low (~10^{-13}).

0707.0417	efficient identification of exoplanetary transit candidates from  superwasp light curves	transiting extrasolar planets constitute only a small fraction of the rangeof stellar systems found to display periodic, shallow dimmings in wide-fieldsurveys employing small-aperture camera arrays. here we present an efficientselection strategy for follow-up observations, derived from analysis of thelight curves of a sample of 67 superwasp targets that passed the selectiontests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identifiedeither as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. we determine thesystem parameters using markov-chain monte carlo analysis of the superwasplight curves. we use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with abayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the2mass j-h colour. the bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantifyboth the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relationand the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 jupiter radii.when augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequalprimary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that areresolved by superwasp, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, includingthe three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. thissuggests that planet discovery "hit rates" better than one-in-five should beachievable. in addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to haveastrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

0908.0189	the main-sequence rotation-colour relation in the coma berenices open  cluster	we present the results of a photometric survey of rotation rates in the comaberenices (melotte 111) open cluster, using data obtained as part of thesuperwasp exoplanetary transit-search programme. the goal of the coma surveywas to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence f, g and k dwarfs inthis intermediate-age (~600 myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to whichmagnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. we find atight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and j-k colour with aroot-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. the relation is similar to thatseen among f, g and k stars in the hyades. such strong convergence can only beexplained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from areservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. we conclude thatthe coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinningradiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter thanthe cluster age, and that from the age of coma onward, stars rotate effectivelyas solid bodies. the existence of a tight relationship between stellar mass androtation period at a given age supports the use of stellar rotation period asan age indicator in f, g and k stars of hyades age and older. we demonstratethat individual stellar ages can be determined within the coma population withan internal precision of order 9 percent (rms), using a standard magneticbraking law in which rotation period increases with the square root of stellarage. we find that a slight modification to the magnetic-braking power law, pproportional to t^0.56, yields rotational and asteroseismological ages in goodagreement for the sun and other stars of solar age for which p-mode studies andphotometric rotation periods have been published.

0908.1553	wasp-17b: an ultra-low density planet in a probable retrograde orbit	we report the discovery of the transiting giant planet wasp-17b, theleast-dense planet currently known. it is 1.6 saturn masses but 1.5-2 jupiterradii, giving a density of 6-14 per cent that of jupiter. wasp-17b is in a3.7-day orbit around a sub-solar metallicity, v = 11.6, f6 star. preliminarydetection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect suggests that wasp-17b is in aretrograde orbit (lambda ~ -150 deg), indicative of a violent history involvingplanet-planet or star-planet scattering.  wasp-17b's bloated radius could be due to tidal heating resulting from recentor ongoing tidal circularisation of an eccentric orbit, such as the highlyeccentric orbits that typically result from scattering interactions. it willthus be important to determine more precisely the current orbital eccentricityby further high-precision radial velocity measurements or by timing thesecondary eclipse, both to reduce the uncertainty on the planet's radius and totest tidal-heating models. owing to its low surface gravity, wasp-17b'satmosphere has the largest scale height of any known planet, making it a goodtarget for transmission spectroscopy.

0909.4170	a transit timing analysis of seven rise light curves of the exoplanet  system hat-p-3	we present seven light curves of the exoplanet system hat-p-3, taken as partof a transit timing program using the rise instrument on the liverpooltelescope. the light curves are analysed using a markov-chain monte-carloalgorithm to update the parameters of the system. the inclination is found tobe i = 86.75^{+0.22}_{-0.21} deg, the planet-star radius ratio to be r_p/r_star= 0.1098^{+0.0010}_{-0.0012}, and the stellar radius to be r_star =0.834^{+0.018}_{-0.026} r_sun, consistent with previous results but with asignificant improvement in the precision. central transit times anduncertainties for each light curve are also determined, and a residualpermutation algorithm used as an independent check on the errors. the transittimes are found to be consistent with a linear ephemeris, and a new ephemerisis calculated as t_c(0) = 2454856.70118 +- 0.00018 hjd and p = 2.899738 +-0.000007 days. model timing residuals are fitted to the measured timingresiduals to place upper mass limits for a hypothetical perturbing planet as afunction of the period ratio. these show that we have probed for planets withmasses as low as 0.33 m_earth and 1.81 m_earth in the interior and exterior 2:1resonances, respectively, assuming the planets are initially in circularorbits.

0912.3643	the spin-orbit alignment of the transiting exoplanet wasp-3b from  rossiter-mclaughlin observations	we present an observation of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for the planetarysystem wasp-3. radial velocity measurements were made during transit using thesophie spectrograph at the 1.93m telescope at haute-provence observatory. theshape of the effect shows that the sky-projected angle between the stellarrotation axis and planetary orbital axis (lambda) is small and consistent withzero within 2 sigma; lambda = 15 +10/-9 deg. wasp-3b joins the ~two-thirds ofplanets with measured spin-orbit angles that are well aligned and are thoughtto have undergone a dynamically-gentle migration process such as planet-discinteractions. we find a systematic effect which leads to an anomalously highdetermination of the projected stellar rotational velocity (vsini = 19.6+2.2/-2.1 km/s) compared to the value found from spectroscopic line broadening(vsini = 13.4 +/- 1.5 km/s). this is thought to be caused by a discrepancy inthe assumptions made in the extraction and modelling of the data. using a modeldeveloped by hirano et al. (2009) designed to address this issue, we find vsinito be consistent with the value obtained from spectroscopic broadeningmeasurements (vsini = 15.7 +1.4/-1.3 km/s).

1004.4551	line-profile tomography of exoplanet transits -- ii. a gas-giant planet  transiting a rapidly-rotating a5 star	most of our knowledge of extrasolar planets rests on precise radial-velocitymeasurements, either for direct detection or for confirmation of the planetaryorigin of photometric transit signals. this has limited our exploration of theparameter space of exoplanet hosts to solar- and later-type, sharp-lined stars.here we extend the realm of stars with known planetary companions to includehot, fast-rotating stars. planet-like transits have previously been reported inthe lightcurve obtained by the superwasp survey of the a5 star hd15082(wasp-33; v=8.3, v sin i = 86 km/sec). here we report further photometry andtime-series spectroscopy through three separate transits, which we use toconfirm the existence of a gas giant planet with an orbital period of 1.22d inorbit around hd15082. from the photometry and the properties of the planetsignal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit wedirectly derive the size of the planet, the inclination and obliquity of itsorbital plane, and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of thestar. this kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planetsaround a whole new class of young, early-type stars, hence under differentphysical conditions and generally in an earlier stage of formation than insharp-lined late-type stars. the reflex orbital motion of the star caused bythe transiting planet is small, yielding an upper mass limit of 4.1 jupitermasses on the planet. we also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar massin the system, which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet. inhd 15082, the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radialpulsations, clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal. this raises theintriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite oramplify the pulsations in such stars.

1009.3470	independent discovery and refined parameters of the transiting exoplanet  hat-p-14b	we present superwasp observations of hat-p-14b, a hot jupiter discovered bytorres et al. the planet was found independently by the superwasp team andnamed wasp-27b after follow-up observations had secured the discovery, butprior to the publication by torres et al. our analysis of hat-p-14/wasp-27 isin good agreement with the values found by torres et al. and we refine theparameters by combining our datasets. we also provide additional evidenceagainst astronomical false positives. due to the brightness of the host star, v= 10, hat-p-14 is an attractive candidate for further characterisationobservations. the planet has a high impact parameter, b = 0.907 +/- 0.004, andthe primary transit is close to grazing. this could readily reveal smalldeviations in the orbital parameters indicating the presence of a third body inthe system, which may be causing the small but significant orbitaleccentricity, e = 0.095 +/- 0.011. the system geometry suggests that the planetnarrowly fails to undergo a secondary eclipse. however, even a non-detectionwould tightly constrain the system parameters.

1009.4132	on the alignment of debris disks and their host stars' rotation axis  -implications for spin-orbit misalignment in exoplanetary systems	it has been widely thought that measuring the misalignment angle between theorbital plane of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star was agood discriminator between different migration processes for hot-jupiters.specifically, well-aligned hot-jupiter systems (as measured by therossiter-mclaughlin effect) were thought to have formed via migration throughinteraction with a viscous disk, while misaligned systems were thought to haveundergone a more violent dynamical history. these conclusions were based on theassumption that the planet-forming disk was well-aligned with the host star.recent work by a number of authors has challenged this assumption by proposingmechanisms that act to drive the star-disk interaction out of alignment duringthe pre-main sequence phase. we have estimated the stellar rotation axis of asample of stars which host spatially resolved debris disks. comparison of ourderived stellar rotation axis inclination angles with the geometricallymeasured debris-disk inclinations shows no evidence for a misalignment betweenthe two.

1010.3474	the doppler shadow of wasp-3b: a tomographic analysis of  rossiter-mclaughlin observations	hot-jupiter planets must form at large separations from their host starswhere the temperatures are cool enough for their cores to condense. they thenmigrate inwards to their current observed orbital separations. differenttheories of how this migration occurs lead to varying distributions of orbitaleccentricity and the alignment between the rotation axis of the star and theorbital axis of the planet. the spin-orbit alignment of a transiting system isrevealed via the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, which is the anomaly present inthe radial velocity measurements of the rotating star during transit due to theplanet blocking some of the starlight. in this paper we aim to measure thespin-orbit alignment of the wasp-3 system via a new way of analysing therossiter-mclaughlin observations. we apply a new tomographic method foranalysing the time variable asymmetry of stellar line profiles caused by therossiter-mclaughlin effect. this new method eliminates the systematic errorinherent in previous methods used to analyse the effect. we find a value forthe projected stellar spin rate of v sin i = 13.9 \pm 0.03 km/s which is inagreement with previous measurements but has a much higher precision. thesystem is found to be well aligned which favours an evolutionary history forwasp-3b involving migration through tidal interactions with a protoplanetarydisc. using gyrochronology we estimate the age of the star to be ~300 myr withan upper limit of 2 gyr from comparison with isochrones.

1108.2641	wasp-50b: a hot jupiter transiting a moderately active solar-type star	we report the discovery by the wasp transit survey of a giant planet in aclose orbit (0.0295+-0.0009 au) around a moderately bright (v=11.6, k=10) g9dwarf (0.89+-0.08 m_sun, 0.84+-0.03 r_sun) in the southern constellationeridanus. thanks to high-precision follow-up photometry and spectroscopyobtained by the telescopes trappist and euler, the mass and size of thisplanet, wasp-50b, are well constrained to 1.47+-0.09 m_jup and 1.15+-0.05r_jup, respectively. the transit ephemeris is 2455558.6120 (+-0.0002) + n x1.955096 (+-0.000005) hjd_utc. the size of the planet is consistent with basicmodels of irradiated giant planets. the chromospheric activity (log r'_hk =-4.67) and rotational period (p_rot = 16.3+-0.5 days) of the host star suggestan age of 0.8+-0.4 gy that is discrepant with a stellar-evolution estimatebased on the measured stellar parameters (rho_star = 1.48+-0.10 rho_sun, teff =5400+-100 k, [fe/h]= -0.12+-0.08) which favours an age of 7+-3.5 gy. thisdiscrepancy could be explained by the tidal and magnetic influence of theplanet on the star, in good agreement with the observations that stars hostinghot jupiters tend to show faster rotation and magnetic activity (pont 2009;hartman 2010). we measure a stellar inclination of 84 (-31,+6) deg,disfavouring a high stellar obliquity. thanks to its large irradiation and therelatively small size of its host star, wasp-50b is a good target foroccultation spectrophotometry, making it able to constrain the relationshipbetween hot jupiters' atmospheric thermal profiles and the chromosphericactivity of their host stars proposed by knutson et al. (2010).

1111.2860	the morphology and kinematics of the fine ring nebula, planetary nebula  sp 1, and the shaping influence of its binary central star	we present the first detailed spatio-kinematical analysis and modelling ofthe planetary nebula shapley 1 (sp 1), which is known to contain a close-binarycentral star system. close-binary central stars have been identified as alikely source of shaping in planetary nebulae, but with little observationalsupport to date. deep narrowband imaging in the light of [o iii] {\lambda}5007asuggests the presence of a large bow-shock to the west of the nebula,indicating that it is undergoing the first stages of an interaction with theinterstellar medium. further narrowband imaging in the light of h{\alpha}+[nii]{\lambda}6584a combined with longslit observations of the h{\alpha} emissionhave been used to develop a spatio-kinematical model of sp 1. the model clearlyreveals sp 1 to be a bipolar, axisymmetric structure viewed almost pole-on. thesymmetry axis of the model nebula is within a few degrees of perpendicular tothe orbital plane of the central binary system - strong evidence that thecentral close-binary system has played an important role in shaping the nebula.sp 1 is one of very few nebulae to have this link, between nebular symmetryaxis and binary plane, shown observationally.

0711.0126	wasp-3b: a strongly-irradiated transiting gas-giant planet	we report the discovery of wasp-3b, the third transiting exoplanet to bediscovered by the wasp and sophie collaboration. wasp-3b transits its host starusno-b1.0 1256-0285133 every 1.846834+-0.000002 days. our high precisionradial-velocity measurements present a variation with amplitude characteristicof a planetary-mass companion and in-phase with the light-curve. adaptiveoptics imaging shows no evidence for nearby stellar companions, andline-bisector analysis excludes faint, unresolved binarity and stellar activityas the cause of the radial-velocity variations. we make a preliminaryspectroscopic analysis of the host star finding it to have teff = 6400+-100 kand log g = 4.25+-0.05 which suggests it is most likely an unevolved mainsequence star of spectral type f7-8v. our simultaneous modelling of the transitphotometry and reflex motion of the host leads us to derive a mass of 1.76+0.08 -0.14 m_j and radius 1.31 +0.07-0.14 r_j for wasp-3b. the proximity andrelative temperature of the host star suggests that wasp-3b is one of thehottest exoplanets known, and thus has the potential to place stringentconstraints on exoplanet atmospheric models.

1203.4971	rossiter-mclaughlin effect measurements for wasp-16, wasp-25 and wasp-31	we present new measurements of the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect for threewasp planetary systems, wasp-16, wasp-25 and wasp-31, from a combined analysisof their complete sets of photometric and spectroscopic data. we find a lowamplitude rm effect for wasp-16 (teff = 5700 \pm 150k), suggesting that thestar is a slow rotator and thus of an advanced age, and obtain a projectedalignment angle of lambda = -4.2 degrees +11.0 -13.9. for wasp-25 (teff =5750\pm100k) we detect a projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 14.6 degrees\pm6.7. wasp-31 (teff = 6300\pm100k) is found to be well-aligned, with aprojected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 2.8degrees \pm3.1. a circular orbit isconsistent with the data for all three systems, in agreement with theirrespective discovery papers. we consider the results for these systems in thecontext of the ensemble of rm measurements made to date. we find that whilstwasp-16 fits the hypothesis of winn et al. (2010) that 'cool' stars (teff &lt;6250k) are preferentially aligned, wasp-31 has little impact on the proposedtrend. we bring the total distribution of the true spin-orbit alignment angle,psi, up to date, noting that recent results have improved the agreement withthe theory of fabrycky &amp; tremaine (2007) at mid-range angles. we also suggest anew test for judging misalignment using the bayesian information criterion,according to which wasp-25 b's orbit should be considered to be aligned.

1210.2329	wasp-54b, wasp-56b and wasp-57b: three new sub-jupiter mass planets from  superwasp	we present three newly discovered sub-jupiter mass planets from the superwaspsurvey: wasp-54b is a heavily bloated planet of mass 0.636$^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$\mj and radius 1.653$^{+0.090}_{-0.083}$ \rj. it orbits a f9 star, evolving offthe main sequence, every 3.69 days. our mcmc fit of the system yields aslightly eccentric orbit ($e=0.067^{+0.033}_{-0.025}$) for wasp-54b. weinvestigated further the veracity of our detection of the eccentric orbit forwasp-54b, and we find that it could be real. however, given the brightness ofwasp-54 v=10.42 magnitudes, we encourage observations of a secondary eclipse todraw robust conclusions on both the orbital eccentricity and the thermalstructure of the planet. wasp-56b and wasp-57b have masses of0.571$^{+0.034}_{-0.035}$ \mj and $0.672^{+0.049}_{-0.046}$ \mj, respectively;and radii of $1.092^{+0.035}_{-0.033}$ \rj for wasp-56b and$0.916^{+0.017}_{-0.014}$ \rj for wasp-57b. they orbit main sequence stars ofspectral type g6 every 4.67 and 2.84 days, respectively. wasp-56b and wasp-57bshow no radius anomaly and a high density possibly implying a large core ofheavy elements; possibly as high as $\sim$50 m$_{\oplus}$ in the case ofwasp-57b. however, the composition of the deep interior of exoplanets remainstill undetermined. thus, more exoplanet discoveries such as the ones presentedin this paper, are needed to understand and constrain giant planets' physicalproperties.

1210.5931	accurate spectroscopic parameters of wasp planet host stars	we have made a detailed spectral analysis of eleven wide angle search forplanets (wasp) planet host stars using high signal-to-noise (s/n) harpsspectra. our line list was carefully selected from the spectra of the sun andprocyon, and we made a critical evaluation of the atomic data. the spectrallines were measured using equivalent widths. the procedures were tested on thesun and procyon prior to be being used on the wasp stars. the effectivetemperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity weredetermined for all the stars. we show that abundances derived from high s/nspectra are likely to be higher than those obtained from low s/n spectra, asnoise can cause the equivalent width to be underestimated. we also show thatthere is a limit to the accuracy of stellar parameters that can be achieved,despite using high s/n spectra, and the average uncertainty in effectivetemperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity is 83 k,0.11 dex, 0.11 km/s and 0.10 dex respectively.

1211.0810	wasp-52b, wasp-58b, wasp-59b, and wasp-60b: four new transiting close-in  giant planets	we present the discovery of four new transiting hot jupiters, detected mainlyfrom superwasp-north and sophie observations. these new planets, wasp-52b,wasp-58b, wasp-59b, and wasp-60b, have orbital periods ranging from 1.7 to 7.9days, masses between 0.46 and 0.94 m_jup, and radii between 0.73 and 1.49r_jup. their g1 to k5 dwarf host stars have v magnitudes in the range11.7-13.0. the depths of the transits are between 0.6 and 2.7%, depending onthe target. with their large radii, wasp-52b and 58b are new cases oflow-density, inflated planets, whereas wasp-59b is likely to have a large,dense core. wasp-60 shows shallow transits. in the case of wasp-52 we alsodetected the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly via time-resolved spectroscopy of atransit. we measured the sky-projected obliquity lambda = 24 (+17/-9) degrees,indicating that wasp-52b orbits in the same direction as its host star isrotating and that this prograde orbit is slightly misaligned with the stellarequator. these four new planetary systems increase our statistics on hotjupiters, and provide new targets for follow-up studies.

1211.3045	wasp-71b: a bloated hot jupiter in a 2.9-day, prograde orbit around an  evolved f8 star	we report the discovery by the wasp transit survey of a highly-irradiated,massive (2.242 +/- 0.080 mjup) planet which transits a bright (v = 10.6),evolved f8 star every 2.9 days. the planet, wasp-71b, is larger than jupiter(1.46 +/- 0.13 rjup), but less dense (0.71 +/- 0.16 {\rho}jup). we also reportspectroscopic observations made during transit with the coralie spectrograph,which allow us to make a highly-significant detection of therossiter-mclaughlin effect. we determine the sky-projected angle between thestellar-spin and planetary-orbit axes to be {\lambda} = 20.1 +/- 9.7 degrees,i.e. the system is 'aligned', according to the widely-used alignment criteriathat systems are regarded as misaligned only when {\lambda} is measured to begreater than 10 degrees with 3-{\sigma} confidence. wasp-71, with an effectivetemperature of 6059 +/- 98 k, therefore fits the previously observed patternthat only stars hotter than 6250 k are host to planets in misaligned orbits. weemphasise, however, that {\lambda} is merely the sky-projected obliquity angle;we are unable to determine whether the stellar-spin and planetary-orbit axesare misaligned along the line-of-sight. with a mass of 1.56 +/- 0.07 msun,wasp-71 was previously hotter than 6250 k, and therefore might have beensignificantly misaligned in the past. if so, the planetary orbit has beenrealigned, presumably through tidal interactions with the cooling star'sgrowing convective zone.

1301.3760	transit timing variations in wasp-10b induced by stellar activity?	the hot-jupiter wasp-10b was reported by maciejewski et al. (2011a,b) to showtransit timing variations (ttv) with an amplitude of ~ 3.5 minutes. theseauthors proposed that the observed ttvs were caused by a 0.1 mjup perturbingcompanion with an orbital period of ~ 5.23 d, and hence, close to the outer 5:3mean motion resonance with wasp-10b. to test this scenario, we present eightnew transit light curves of wasp-10b obtained with the faulkes telescope northand the liverpool telescope. the new light curves, together with 22 previouslypublished ones, were modelled with a markov-chain monte-carlo transit fittingcode. (...)  our homogeneously derived transit times do not support the previous claimedttv signal, which was strongly dependent on 2 previously published transitsthat have been incorrectly normalised. nevertheless, a linear ephemeris is nota statistically good fit to the transit times of wasp-10b. we show that theobserved transit time variations are due to spot occultation features orsystematics. we discuss and exemplify the effects of occultation spot featuresin the measured transit times and show that despite spot occultation duringegress and ingress being difficult to distinguish in the transit light curves,they have a significant effect in the measured transit times. we conclude thatif we account for spot features, the transit times of wasp-10 are consistentwith a linear ephemeris with the exception of one transit (epoch 143) which isa partial transit. therefore, there is currently no evidence for the existenceof a companion to wasp-10b. our results support the lack of ttvs ofhot-jupiters reported for the kepler sample.

(2010), wasp-26bis predicted to host a thermal inversion. the brightness temperatures deducedfrom the eclipse depths are consistent with an isothermal atmosphere, althoughit is within the uncertainties that the planet may host a weak thermalinversion. the data are equally well fit by atmospheric models with or withouta thermal inversion. we find that variation in activity of solar-like starsdoes not change enough over the time-scales of months or years to change theinterpretation of the knutson et al.

1309.4307	two rings but no fellowship: lotr 1 and its relation to planetary  nebulae possessing barium central stars	lotr 1 is a planetary nebula thought to contain an intermediate-period binarycentral star system (that is, a system with an orbital period, p, between 100and, say, 1500 days). the system shows the signature of a k-type, rapidlyrotating giant, and most likely constitutes an accretion-induced post-masstransfer system similar to other pne such as lotr 5, webo 1 and a70. suchsystems represent rare opportunities to further the investigation into theformation of barium stars and intermediate period post-agb systems -- aformation process still far from being understood. here, we present the firstdetailed analyses of both the central star system and the surrounding nebula oflotr 1 using a combination of spectra obtained with vlt-fors2, aat-ucles andntt-emmi, as well as superwasp photometry. we confirm the binary nature of thecentral star of lotr 1 that consists of a k1 iii giant and a hot white dwarf.the cool giant does not present any sign of s-process enhancement but is shownto have a rotation period of 6.4 days, which is a possible sign of massaccretion. lotr 1 also presents broad double-peaked h-alpha emission lines,whose origin is still unclear. the nebula of lotr 1 consists in two slightlyelongated shells, with ages of 17,000 and 35,000 years, respectively, and withdifferent orientations. as such, lotr 1 present a very different nebularmorphology than a70 and webo 1, which may be an indication of difference in themass transfer episodes

1310.0696	the plato 2.0 mission	plato 2.0 has recently been selected for esa's m3 launch opportunity(2022/24). providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density andage) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: how doplanetary systems form and evolve? are there other systems with planets likeours, including potentially habitable planets? the plato 2.0 instrumentconsists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 sec readout cadence and 2with 2.5 sec candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg2) and a largephotometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). it focusses on bright (4-11 mag) starsin wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to earth-size byphotometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-basedradial-velocity follow-up measurements. asteroseismology will be performed forthese bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, includingmasses and ages. the combination of bright targets and asteroseismology resultsin high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2%, 4-10% and 10% for planetradii, masses and ages, respectively. the planned baseline observing strategyincludes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planetsreaching into the habitable zone (hz) of solar-like stars and an additionalstep-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50% of the sky. plato 2.0 willobserve up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of smallplanets, and thousands of planets in the neptune to gas giant regime out to thehz. it will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulkcharacterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages.this catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbitaldistances, where surface temperatures are moderate. coverage of this parameterrange with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to plato2.0.

1404.5617	on the abundance of circumbinary planets	we present here the first observationally based determination of the rate ofoccurrence of circumbinary planets. this is derived from the publicly availablekepler data, using an automated search algorithm and debiasing process toproduce occurrence rates implied by the seven systems already known. theserates depend critically on the planetary inclination distribution: ifcircumbinary planets are preferentially coplanar with their host binaries, ashas been suggested, then the rate of occurrence of planets with $r_p&gt;6r_\oplus$orbiting with $p_p&lt;300$\ d is $10.0 ^{+18}_{-6.5}$\% (95\% confidence limits),higher than but consistent with single star rates. if on the other hand theunderlying planetary inclination distribution is isotropic, then thisoccurrence rate rises dramatically, to give a lower limit of 47\%. this impliesthat formation and subsequent dynamical evolution in circumbinary disks musteither lead to largely coplanar planets, or proceed with significantly greaterease than in circumstellar disks. as a result of this investigation we alsoshow that giant planets (${&gt;}10r_\oplus$) are significantly less common incircumbinary orbits than their smaller siblings, and confirm that the proposedshortfall of circumbinary planets orbiting the shorter period binaries in thekepler sample is a real effect.

1407.1044	planets and stellar activity: hide and seek in the corot-7 system	since the discovery of the transiting super-earth corot-7b, severalinvestigations have yielded different results for the number and masses ofplanets present in the system, mainly owing to the star's high level ofactivity. we re-observed corot-7 in january 2012 with both harps and corot, sothat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometricdata. this allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's lightcurve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression ofconvective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. to account foractivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have aphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in theradial-velocity model, which we treat as a gaussian process with the samecovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the lightcurve. our model was incorporated into a monte carlo markov chain in order tomake a precise determination of the orbits of corot-7b and corot-7c. we measurethe masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 mearth and 13.56 +/- 1.08mearth, respectively. the density of corot-7b is (6.61 +/- 1.72)(rp/1.58rearth)^(-3) g.cm^(-3), which is compatible with a rocky composition. we searchfor evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with aperiod close to 9 days. we are not able to confirm the existence of a planetwith this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellarrotation at around 7.9 days. using bayesian model selection we find that amodel with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.

(2014) and is composed of a hot super-neptune, kepler-101b, and anearth-sized planet, kepler-101c. these two planets orbit the slightly evolvedand metal-rich g-type star in 3.49 and 6.03 days, respectively. with mass$m_{\rm p}=51.1_{-4.7}^{+5.1}~m_{\oplus}$, radius $r_{\rmp}=5.77_{-0.79}^{+0.85}~r_{\oplus}$, and density $\rho_{\rmp}=1.45_{-0.48}^{+0.83} \rm g\;cm^{-3}$, kepler-101b is the firstfully-characterized super-neptune, and its density suggests that heavy elementsmake up a significant fraction of its interior; more than $60\%$ of its totalmass. kepler-101c has a radius of $1.25_{-0.17}^{+0.19}~r_{\oplus}$, whichimplies the absence of any h/he envelope, but its mass could not be determineddue to the relative faintness of the parent star for highly preciseradial-velocity measurements ($k_{\rm p}=13.8$) and the limited number ofradial velocities. the $1~\sigma$ upper limit, $m_{\rm p} &lt; 3.8~m_{\oplus}$,excludes a pure iron composition with a $68.3\%$ probability. the architectureof the kepler-101 planetary system - containing a close-in giant planet and anouter earth-sized planet with a period ratio slightly larger than the 3:2resonance - is certainly of interest for planet formation and evolutionscenarios. this system does not follow the trend, seen by ciardi et al.

1507.08532	the harps-n rocky planet search i. hd219134b: a transiting rocky planet  in a multi-planet system at 6.5 pc from the sun	we present here the detection of a system of four low-mass planets around thebright (v=5.5) and close-by (6.5 pc) star hd219134. this is the first result ofthe rocky planet search program with harps-n on the tng in la palma. the innerplanet orbits the star in 3.0937 +/-0.0004 days, on a quasi-circular orbit witha semi-major axis of 0.0382 +/- 0.0003 au. spitzer observations allowed us todetect the transit of the planet in front of the star making hd219134b thenearest known transiting planet to date. from the amplitude of theradial-velocity variation (2.33 +/- 0.24 m/s) and observed depth of the transit(359 +/- 38 ppm), the planet mass and radius are estimated to be 4.46 +/- 0.47m_{\oplus} and 1.606 +/- 0.086 r_{\oplus} leading to a mean density of 5.89 +/-1.17 g/cc, suggesting a rocky composition. one additional planet with minimummass of 2.67 +/- 0.59 m_{\oplus} moves on a close-in, quasi-circular orbit witha period of 6.765 +/- 0.005 days. the third planet in the system has a periodof 46.78 +/- 0.16 days and a minimum mass of 8.7 +/- 1.1 m{\oplus}, at 0.234+/- 0.002 au from the star. its eccentricity is 0.32 +/- 0.14. the period ofthis planet is close to the rotational period of the star estimated fromvariations of activity indicators (42.3 +/- 0.1 days). the planetary origin ofthe signal is, however, the preferred solution as no indication of variation atthe corresponding frequency is observed for activity-sensitive parameters.finally, a fourth additional longer-period planet of mass of 62 +/- 6m_{\oplus} orbits the star in 1190 days, on an eccentric orbit (e=0.27 +/-0.11) at a distance of 2.14 +/- 0.27 au.

1508.03188	the araucaria project. precise physical parameters of the eclipsing  binary io aqr	our aim is to precisely measure the physical parameters of the eclipsingbinary io aqr and derive a distance to this system by applying a surfacebrightness - colour relation. our motivation is to combine these parameterswith future precise distance determinations from the gaia space mission toderive precise surface brightness - colour relations for stars. we extensivelyused photometry from the super-wasp and asas projects and precise radialvelocities obtained from harps and coralie high-resolution spectra. we analysedlight curves with the code jktebop and radial velocity curves with thewilson-devinney program. we found that io aqr is a hierarchical triple systemconsisting of a double-lined short-period (p=2.37 d) spectroscopic binary and alow-luminosity and low-mass companion star orbiting the binary with a period of~25000 d (~70 yr) on a very eccentric orbit. we derive high-precision (betterthan 1%) physical parameters of the inner binary, which is composed of twoslightly evolved main-sequence stars (f5 v-iv + f6 v-iv) with masses ofm1=1.569+/-0.004 and m2=1.655+/-0.004 m_sun and radii r1=2.19+/-0.02 andr2=2.49+/-0.02 r_sun. the companion is most probably a late k-type dwarf withmass ~0.6 m_sun. the distance to the system resulting from applying a (v-k)surface brightness - colour relation is 255+/-6(stat.)+/-6(sys.) pc, whichagrees well with the hipparcos value of 270+/-73 pc, but is more precise by afactor of eight.

1510.01047	photo-dynamical mass determination of the multi-planetary system k2-19	k2-19 is the second multi-planetary system discovered with k2 observations.the system is composed of two neptune size planets close to the 3:2 mean-motionresonance. to better characterise the system we obtained two additional transitobservations of k2-19b and five additional radial velocity observations. thesewere combined with k2 data and fitted simultaneously with the system dynamics(photo-dynamical model) which increases the precision of the transit timemeasurements. the higher transit time precision allows us to detect thechopping signal of the dynamic interaction of the planets that in turn permitsto uniquely characterise the system. although the reflex motion of the star wasnot detected, dynamic modelling of the system allowed us to derive planetarymasses of $m_b= 44 \pm 12\, m_{\oplus}$ and $m_c = 15.9 \pm 7.0\, m_{\oplus}$for the inner and the outer planets respectively, leading to densities close touranus. we also show that our method allows the derivation of mass ratios usingonly the 80 days of observations during the first campaign of k2.

1510.06446	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets. xxxviii. bayesian  re-analysis of three systems. new super-earths, unconfirmed signals, and  magnetic cycles	we present the analysis of the entire harps observations of three stars thathost planetary systems: hd1461, hd40307, and hd204313. the data set spans eightyears and contains more than 200 nightly averaged velocity measurements foreach star. this means that it is sensitive to both long-period and low-massplanets and also to the effects induced by stellar activity cycles. we modelledthe data using keplerian functions that correspond to planetary candidates andincluded the short- and long-term effects of magnetic activity. a bayesianapproach was taken both for the data modelling, which allowed us to includeinformation from activity proxies such as $\log{(r'_{\rm hk})}$ in the velocitymodelling, and for the model selection, which permitted determining the numberof significant signals in the system. the bayesian model comparison overcomesthe limitations inherent to the traditional periodogram analysis. we report anadditional super-earth planet in the hd1461 system. four out of the six planetspreviously reported for hd40307 are confirmed and characterised. we discuss theremaining two proposed signals. in particular, we show that when the systematicuncertainty associated with the techniques for estimating model probabilitiesare taken into account, the current data are not conclusive concerning theexistence of the habitable-zone candidate hd40307 g. we also fully characterisethe neptune-mass planet that orbits hd204313 in 34.9 days.

astro-ph;0011340	optical and infrared spectroscopy of the type iin sn 1998s : days 3-127	we present contemporary infrared and optical spectroscopic observations ofthe type iin sn 1998s for the period between 3 and 127 days after discovery. inthe first week the spectra are characterised by prominent broad emission lineswith narrow peaks superimposed on a very blue continuum(t~24000k). in thefollowing two weeks broad, blueshifted absorption components appeared in thespectra and the temperature dropped. by day 44, broad emission components in hand he reappeared in the spectra. these persisted to 100-130d, becomingincreasingly asymmetric. we agree with leonard et al. (2000) that the broademission lines indicate interaction between the ejecta and circumstellarmaterial (csm) and deduce that progenitor of sn 1998s appears to have gonethrough at least two phases of mass loss, giving rise to two csm zones.examination of the spectra indicates that the inner zone extended to &lt;90au,while the outer csm extended from 185au to over 1800au. analysis of highresolution spectra shows that the outer csm had a velocity of 40-50 km/s.assuming a constant velocity, we can infer that the outer csm wind commencedmore than 170 years ago, and ceased about 20 years ago, while the inner csmwind may have commenced less than 9 years ago. during the era of the outer csmwind the outflow was high, &gt;2x10^{-5}m_{\odot}/yr corresponding to a mass lossof at least 0.003m_{\odot} and suggesting a massive progenitor. we also modelthe co emission observed in sn 1998s. we deduce a co mass of ~10^{-3} m_{\odot}moving at ~2200km/s, and infer a mixed metal/he core of ~4m_{\odot}, againindicating a massive progenitor.

astro-ph;0609418	a fast hybrid algorithm for exoplanetary transit searches	we present a fast and efficient hybrid algorithm for selecting exoplanetarycandidates from wide-field transit surveys. our method is based on thewidely-used sysrem and box least-squares (bls) algorithms. patterns ofsystematic error that are common to all stars on the frame are mapped andeliminated using the sysrem algorithm. the remaining systematic errors causedby spatially localised flat-fielding and other errors are quantified using aboxcar-smoothing method. we show that the dimensions of the search-parameterspace can be reduced greatly by carrying out an initial bls search on a coarsegrid of reduced dimensions, followed by newton-raphson refinement of thetransit parameters in the vicinity of the most significant solutions. weillustrate the method's operation by applying it to data from one field of thesuperwasp survey, comprising 2300 observations of 7840 stars brighter thanv=13.0. we identify 11 likely transit candidates. we reject stars that exhibitsignificant ellipsoidal variations indicative of a stellar-mass companion. weuse colours and proper motions from the 2mass and usno-b1.0 surveys to estimatethe stellar parameters and the companion radius. we find that two stars showingunambiguous transit signals pass all these tests, and so qualify for detailedhigh-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.

astro-ph;0609688	wasp-1b and wasp-2b: two new transiting exoplanets detected with  superwasp and sophie	we have detected low-amplitude radial-velocity variations in two stars,usno-b1.0 1219-0005465 (gsc 02265-00107 = wasp-1) and usno-b1.0 0964-0543604(gsc 00522-01199 = wasp-2). both stars were identified as being likely hoststars of transiting exoplanets in the 2004 superwasp wide-field transit survey.using the newly-commissioned radial-velocity spectrograph sophie at theobservatoire de haute-provence, we found that both objects exhibit reflexorbital radial-velocity variations with amplitudes characteristic ofplanetary-mass companions and in-phase with the photometric orbits.line-bisector studies rule out faint blended binaries as the cause of eitherthe radial-velocity variations or the transits. we perform preliminary spectralanalyses of the host stars, which together with their radial-velocityvariations and fits to the transit light curves, yield estimates of theplanetary masses and radii. wasp-1b and wasp-2b have orbital periods of 2.52and 2.15 days respectively. given mass estimates for their f7v and k1vprimaries we derive planet masses 0.80 to 0.98 and 0.81 to 0.95 times that ofjupiter respectively. wasp-1b appears to have an inflated radius of at least1.33 r_jup, whereas wasp-2b has a radius in the range 0.65 to 1.26 r_jup.

astro-ph;9811208	the rapid evolution of the born-again giant sakurai's object	the extraordinarily rapid evolution of the born-again giant sakurai's objectcan be traced both in a continued cooling of the stellar surface and dramaticchanges in chemical composition on a timescale of a mere few months. theabundance alterations are the results of the mixing and nuclear reactions whichhave ensued due to the final he-shell flash which occurred during the descentalong the white dwarf cooling track. the observed changes in the h and liabundances can be explained by ingestion and burning of the h-rich envelope andli-production through the cameron-fowler mechanism. the rapidly increasingabundances of the light s-elements (including sc) is consistent with currents-processing by neutrons released from the concomitantly produced 13c. however,the possibility that the s-elements have previously been synthesized during theagb-phase and only mixed to the surface in connection with the final he-shellflash cannot be convincingly ruled out either. since sakurai's object showssubstantial abundance similarities with the r crb stars and has recentlyundergone rcrb-like visual fading events, the ``birth'' of an rcrb star mayhave been witnessed for the first time ever.
