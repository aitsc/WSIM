0903.2857	globular cluster systems in nearby dwarf galaxies - ii. nuclear star  clusters and their relation to massive galactic globular clusters	(abridged) using luminosities and structural parameters of globular clusters(gcs) in the nuclear regions (ngcs) of low-mass dwarf galaxies from hst/acsimaging we derive the present-day escape velocities (v_esc) of stellar ejectato reach the cluster tidal radius and compare them with those of galactic gcswith extended (hot) horizontal branches (ehbs-gcs). for ehb-gcs, we find acorrelation between the present-day v_esc and their metallicity as well as(v-i)_0 colour. the similar v_esc, (v-i)_0 distribution of ngcs and ehb-gcsimplies that ngcs could also have complex stellar populations. the v_esc-[fe/h]relation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocitywith metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusterstypically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than moremetal-rich clusters of the same mass do. thus the cluster v_esc can be used asparameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment. the ngcs populate the samemv vs. rh region as ehb-gcs, although they do not reach the sizes of thelargest ehb-gcs like wcen and ngc 2419. we argue that during accretion the rhof an ngc could increase due to significant mass loss in the cluster vicinityand the resulting drop in the external potential in the core once the dwarfgalaxy dissolves. our results support the scenario in which galactic ehb-gcshave originated in the centres of pre-galactic building blocks or dwarfgalaxies that were later accreted by the milky way.

0903.4511	population parameters of intermediate-age star clusters in the large  magellanic cloud. i. ngc 1846 and its wide main sequence turnoff	the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope has beenused to obtain deep, high-resolution images of the intermediate-age starcluster ngc 1846 in the large magellanic cloud. we present new color-magnitudediagrams (cmds) based on f435w, f555w, and f814w imaging. we test thepreviously observed broad main sequence turnoff region for "contamination" byfield stars and (evolved) binary star systems. we find that while these impactthe number of objects in this region, none can fully account for the largecolor spread. our results therefore solidify the recent finding that stars inthe main sequence turnoff region of this cluster have a large spread in colorwhich is unrelated to measurement errors or contamination by field stars, andlikely due to a ~300 myr range in the ages of cluster stars. an unbiasedestimate of the stellar density distribution across the main sequence turnoffregion shows that the spread is fairly continuous rather than strongly bimodalas suggested previously. we fit the cmds with several different sets oftheoretical isochrones, and determine systematic uncertainties for populationparameters when derived using any one set of isochrones. we note a degeneracybetween age and [alpha/fe], which can be lifted by matching the shape(curvature) of the full red giant branch in the cmd. we find that stars in theupper part of the main sequence turnoff region are more centrally concentratedthan those in any other region of the cmd, including more massive red giantbranch and asymptotic giant branch stars. we consider several possibleformation scenarios which account for the unusual features observed in the cmdof ngc 1846.

0909.0398	the remnants of galaxy formation from a panoramic survey of the region  around m31	in hierarchical cosmological models, galaxies grow in mass through thecontinual accretion of smaller ones. the tidal disruption of these systems isexpected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distancesthat reach $10 - 100$ times the radius of the central disk. the number,luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significantclues to galaxy formation history, but obtaining a comprehensive survey ofthese components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vastextent. here we report a panoramic survey of the andromeda galaxy (m31). wedetect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants ofdwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of m31. an improved census of theirsurviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of m31's satellites brighterthan $m_v &lt; -6$ await discovery. the brightest companion, triangulum (m33), issurrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for arecent encounter with m31. this panorama of galaxy structure directly confirmsthe basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals theshared history of m31 and m33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies.

1002.1973	chemodynamics of compact stellar systems in ngc 5128: how similar are  globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and dwarf galaxies?	velocity dispersion measurements are presented for luminous gcs in ngc 5128derived from high-res. uves spectra. the measurements are made with the ppxfcode that parametrically recovers line-of-sight velocity dispersions. combiningthe measured velocity dispersions with surface photometry and structuralparameter data from hst enables both dynamical masses and m/l ratios to bederived. the fundamental plane relations of these clusters are investigated inorder to fill the apparent gap between the relations of local group gcs andmore massive early-type galaxies. it is found that the properties of thesemassive stellar systems match those of nuclear clusters in dwarf ellipticalgalaxies and ucds better than those of local group gcs, and that all objectsshare similarly old (&gt;8 gyr) ages, suggesting a possible link between theformation and evolution of de,ns, ucds and massive gcs. we find a very steepcorrelation between dynamical (m/l) ratio and dynamical mass of the form(m/l)_dyn ~ m_dyn^(0.24+/-0.02) above m_dyn = 2x10^6 msol. formation scenariosare investigated with a chemical abundance analysis using absorption linestrengths calibrated to the lick/ids index system. the results lend support totwo scenarios contained within a single general formation scheme. old, massive,super-solar [alpha/fe] systems are formed on short (&lt;100 myr) timescalesthrough the merging of single-collapse gcs which themselves are formed withinsingle, giant molecular clouds. more intermediate- and old-aged (~3-10 gyr),solar- to sub-solar [alpha/fe] systems are formed on much longer (~gyr)timescales through the stripping of de,ns in the 10^13-10^15 msol potentialwells of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters.

1002.2144	sao-6m telescope spectroscopic observations of globular clusters in  nearby galaxies	we present the results of medium-resolution spectroscopy of 28 globularclusters (gcs) in six nearby galaxies of different luminosities andmorphological types, situated in: m33 (15 objects), m31 (3), ic10 (4), ugca86(4), holmbergix (1), and ddo71 (1) obtained at the special astrophysicalobservatory 6-meter telescope. measurements of lick absorption-line indices andcomparison with ssp models enabled us to obtain their spectroscopic ages,metallicities and alpha-element to fe abundance ratios. we found that all oldand intermediate-age gcs in our sample have low metallicities [z/h] &lt; -0.8 dex.metal-rich clusters are young and are preferentially found in galaxies moremassive than ~10^9 m_sun. the least massive dwarfs of our sample, ddo71 andholmbergix, host one massive intermediate-age and one massive young metal-poorgc, respectively. [a/fe] abundance ratios tend to be enhanced but closer tosolar values for dwarf galaxies compared to gcs in more massive galaxies. weanalyse the age-metallicity relation for gcs in our galaxy sample and othersfrom the literature, and find, that 1) there is a general trend for gcs in lowsurface brightness dwarf galaxies to be more metal-poor at a given age than gcsin more massive galaxies; 2) the gc metallicity spread is wider for moremassive galaxies; 3) intermediate-age gcs in early-type dwarf galaxies are moremetal-rich at any given age than those in irregular galaxies of similarluminosity.

1004.2039	globular cluster systems in nearby dwarf galaxies: iii. formation  efficiencies of old globular clusters	we investigate the globular cluster (gc) system scaling parameters as afunction of galaxy mass, i.e. specific frequency (s_n), specific luminosity(s_l), specific mass (s_m), and specific number (^t) of gcs. we sample theentire range in galaxy luminosity (mv = -11 to -23 mag = 10^6 - 10^11 l_sol),environment, and morphology. irrespective of galaxy type, we confirm theincrease of the s_n-value above and below a galaxy magnitude of mv = -20 mag.over the full mass range, the s_l-value of early-type galaxies is, on average,twice that of late-types. to investigate the observed trends we derivetheoretical predictions of gc system scaling parameters as a function of hostgalaxy mass based on the models of dekel &amp; birnboim (2006) in whichstar-formation processes are regulated by stellar and supernova feedback belowa stellar mass of 3x10^10 m_sol, and by virial shocks above it. we find thatthe analytical model describes remarkably well the shape of the gc systemscaling parameter distributions with a universal specific gc formationefficiency, eta, which relates the total mass in gcs to the total galaxy halomass. early-type and late-type galaxies show a similar mean value of eta =5.5e-5, with an increasing scatter towards lower galaxy masses. this can be dueto the enhanced stochastic nature of the star and star-cluster formationprocesses for such systems. some massive galaxies have excess eta valuescompared to what is expected from the mean model prediction for galaxies moreluminous than mv = -20 mag (lv=10^10l_sol). this may be attributed to a veryefficient early gc formation, less efficient production of field stars oraccretion of predominantly low-mass/luminosity high-eta galaxies, or a mixtureof all these effects.

1005.3300	the hst/acs coma cluster survey. ii. data description and source  catalogs	the coma cluster was the target of a hst-acs treasury program designed fordeep imaging in the f475w and f814w passbands. although our survey wasinterrupted by the acs instrument failure in 2007, the partially completedsurvey still covers ~50% of the core high-density region in coma. observationswere performed for 25 fields that extend over a wide range of cluster-centricradii (~1.75 mpc) with a total coverage area of 274 arcmin^2. the majority ofthe fields are located near the core region of coma (19/25 pointings) with sixadditional fields in the south-west region of the cluster. in this paper wepresent reprocessed images and sextractor source catalogs for our surveyfields, including a detailed description of the methodology used for objectdetection and photometry, the subtraction of bright galaxies to measure faintunderlying objects, and the use of simulations to assess the photometricaccuracy and completeness of our catalogs. we also use simulations to performaperture corrections for the sextractor kron magnitudes based only on themeasured source flux and half-light radius. we have performed photometry for~73,000 unique objects; one-half of our detections are brighter than the10-sigma point-source detection limit at f814w=25.8 mag (ab). the slightmajority of objects (60%) are unresolved or only marginally resolved by acs. weestimate that coma members are 5-10% of all source detections, which consist ofa large population of unresolved objects (primarily gcs but also ucds) and awide variety of extended galaxies from a cd galaxy to dwarf lsb galaxies. thered sequence of coma member galaxies has a constant slope and dispersion across9 magnitudes (-21&lt;m_f814w&lt;-13). the initial data release for the hst-acs comatreasury program was made available to the public in 2008 august. the imagesand catalogs described in this study relate to our second data release.

1007.4962	the formation of spheroids in early-type spirals: clues from their  globular clusters	we use deep hubble space telescope images taken with the advanced camera forsurveys (acs) in the f475w and f814w filters to investigate the globularcluster systems in four edge-on sa spiral galaxies covering a factor of 4 inluminosity. the specific frequencies of the blue globular clusters in thegalaxies in our sample fall in the range 0.34 -- 0.84, similar to typicalvalues found for later-type spirals. the number of red globular clustersassociated with the bulges generally increases with the bulge luminosity,similar to what is observed for elliptical galaxies, although the specificfrequency of bulge clusters is a factor of 2-3 lower for the lowest luminositybulges than for the higher luminosity bulges. we present a new empiricalrelation between the fraction of red globular clusters and total bulgeluminosity based on the elliptical galaxies studied by acsvcs (acs virgocluster survey), and discuss how this diagram can be used to assess theimportance that dissipative processes played in building spiral bulges. ourresults suggest a picture where dissipative processes, which are expectedduring gas-rich major mergers, were more important for building luminous bulgesof sa galaxies, whereas secular evolution may have played a larger role inbuilding lower-luminosity bulges in spirals.

1101.2450	the m33 globular cluster system with pandas data: the last outer halo  cluster?	we use cfht/megacam data to search for outer halo star clusters in m33 aspart of the pan-andromeda archaeological survey (pandas). this work extendsprevious studies out to a projected radius of 50 kpc and covers over 40 squaredegrees. we find only one new unambiguous star cluster in addition to the fivepreviously known in the m33 outer halo (10 kpc &lt;= r &lt;= 50 kpc). although weidentify 2440 cluster candidates of various degrees of confidence from ourobjective image search procedure, almost all of these are likely backgroundcontaminants, mostly faint unresolved galaxies. we measure the luminosity,color and structural parameters of the new cluster in addition to the fivepreviously-known outer halo clusters. at a projected radius of 22 kpc, the newcluster is slightly smaller, fainter and redder than all but one of the otherouter halo clusters, and has g' ~ 19.9, (g'-i') ~ 0.6, concentration parameterc ~ 1.0, a core radius r_c ~ 3.5 pc, and a half-light radius r_h ~ 5.5 pc. form33 to have so few outer halo clusters compared to m31 suggests either tidalstripping of m33's outer halo clusters by m31, or a very different, much calmeraccretion history of m33.

1102.3501	density variations in the nw star stream of m31	the pan andromeda archeological survey (pandas) cfht megaprime survey of them31-m33 system has found a star stream which extends about 120 kpc nw from thecenter of m31. the great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it doesnot significantly intersect the disk of m31, means that it is unusually wellsuited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a testfor the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. the main result of thispaper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about threetimes the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. the probability thatthe variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.as a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the samelocation in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [fe/h]=[0, -0.5] andfind no variations above the expected shot noise. the lumpiness of the streamis not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,nor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible m31satellite galaxies. the stream's density variations appear to be consistentwith the effects of a large population of steep mass function dark mattersub-halos, such as found in lcdm simulations, acting on an approximately 10gyrold star stream. the effects of a single set of halo substructure realizationsare shown for illustration, reserving a statistical comparison for anotherstudy.

1105.1317	population parameters of intermediate-age star clusters in the large  magellanic cloud. iii. dynamical evidence for a range of ages being  responsible for extended main sequence turnoffs	we present new analysis of 11 intermediate-age (1-2 gyr) star clusters in thelarge magellanic cloud based on hubble space telescope imaging data. seven ofthe clusters feature main sequence turnoff (msto) regions that are wider thancan be accounted for by a simple stellar population, whereas their red giantbranches indicate a single value of [fe/h]. the star clusters cover a range inpresent-day mass from about 1e4 to 2e5 solar masses. we compare radialdistributions of stars in the upper and lower parts of the msto region, andcalculate cluster masses and escape velocities from the present time back to acluster age of 10 myr. our main result is that for all clusters in our samplewith estimated escape velocities &gt; 15 km/s at an age of 10 myr, the stars inthe brightest half of the msto region are significantly more centrallyconcentrated than the stars in the faintest half and more massive red giantbranch and asymptotic giant branch stars. this is not the case for clusterswith escape velocities &lt; 10 km/s at an age of 10 myr. we argue that the widemsto region of such clusters is mainly caused by to a 200 - 500 myr range inthe ages of cluster stars due to extended star formation within the clusterfrom material shed by first-generation stars featuring slow stellar winds.dilution of this enriched material by accretion of ambient interstellar matteris deemed plausible if the spread of [fe/h] in this ambient gas was very smallwhen the second-generation stars were formed in the cluster.

1105.1337	population parameters of intermediate-age star clusters in the large  magellanic cloud. ii. new insights from extended main sequence turnoffs in 7  star clusters	we discuss new photometry from high-resolution images of 7 intermediate-age(1-2 gyr) star clusters in the large magellanic cloud taken with the advancedcamera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope. we fit color-magnitudediagrams (cmds) with several different sets of theoretical isochrones, anddetermine systematic uncertainties for population parameters when derived usingany one set of isochrones. the cluster cmds show several interesting features,including extended main sequence turnoff (msto) regions, narrow red giantbranches, and clear sequences of unresolved binary stars. we show that theextended mstos are not caused by photometric uncertainties, contamination byfield stars, or the presence of binary stars. enhanced helium abundances in afraction of cluster stars are also ruled out as the reason for the extendedmstos. quantitative comparisons with simulations indicate that the msto regionsare better described by a spread in ages than by a bimodal age distribution,although we can not formally rule out the latter for the three lowest-massclusters in our sample (which have masses lower than about 3e4 solar masses).this conclusion differs from that of some previous works which suggested thatthe age distribution in massive clusters in our sample is bimodal. thissuggests that any secondary star formation occurred in an extended fashionrather than through short bursts. we discuss these results in the context ofthe nature of multiple stellar populations in star clusters.

1105.2561	probing the gc-lmxb connection in ngc 1399: a wide-field study with hst  and chandra	we present a wide field study of the globular clusters/low mass x-ray binary(lmxb) connection in the giant elliptical ngc1399. the large fov of theacs/wfc, combined with the hst and chandra high resolution, allow us toconstrain the lmxb formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies. we confirm thatngc1399 has the highest lmxb fraction in gcs of all nearby elliptical galaxiesstudied so far, even though the exact value depends on galactocentric distancedue to the interplay of a differential gc vs galaxy light distribution and thegc color dependence. in fact lmxbs are preferentially hosted by bright, red gcsout to $&gt;5 r_{eff}$ of the galaxy light. the finding that gc hosting lmxbsfollow the radial distribution of their parent gc population, argues againstthe hypothesis that the external dynamical influence of the galaxy affects lmxbformation in gcs. on the other hand field lmxbs closely match the host galaxylight, thus indicating that they are originally formed in situ and not insidegcs. we measure gc structural parameters, finding that the lmxb formationlikelihood is influenced independently by mass, metallicity and gcs structuralparameters. in particular the gc central density plays a major role inpredicting which gc host accreting binaries. finally our analysis shows thatlmxbs in gcs are marginally brighter than those in the field, and in particularthe only color-confirmed gc with $l_x&gt;10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ shows novariability, which may indicate a superposition of multiple lmxbs in thesesystems.

1111.1716	new insights into the star formation histories of candidate  intermediate-age early-type galaxies from k'-band imaging of globular  clusters	we investigate age and metallicity distributions of bright globular clusters(gcs) in the candidate intermediate-age early-type galaxies ngc 3610, ngc 584and ngc 3377 using a combination of new gemini/niri k'-band imaging andexisting optical v,i photometry from hst data. the v-i vs i-k' colour-colourdiagram is found to break the age-metallicity degeneracy present in opticalcolours, as i-k' primarily measures a populations' metallicity and isrelatively insensitive, unlike optical spectroscopy, to the effect of hothorizontal branch (hb) stars, known to be present in massive old gcs. we derivegcs' photometric age, z and masses. in general, metal-poor ([z/h]&lt;-0.7dex) gcsare older than more metal-rich gcs. for the most massive gcs (m&gt;6x10^5 m_sol)in ngc 3610 with available spectroscopic data, photometric ages are older by ~2gyr, and this difference is more pronounced for the metal-poor gcs. however,photometric and spectroscopic metallicities are in good agreement. we suggestthat this indicates the presence of a hot hb in these massive clusters, whichrenders spectroscopic ages from balmer line strengths to be underestimated. tosupport this suggestion we show that all galactic gcs with m&gt;6x10^5 m_solfeature hot hbs, except 47 tuc. using the relation between the most massive gcmass and the galaxy's sfr, we find that the galaxies' peak sfr was attained atthe epoch of the formation of the oldest (metal-poor) gcs. age and [z/h]distributions of the metal-rich gcs are broad, indicating prolonged galaxy starformation histories. the peak value of the age and [z/h] distributions of thegcs correlates with host galaxy integrated age and [z/h], showing that gcs canindeed be used as relevant proxies of the star formation histories ofgalaxies.(abridged)

1211.2802	the impact of galaxy harassment on the globular cluster systems of  early-type cluster dwarf galaxies	the dynamics of globular cluster systems (gcss) around galaxies are oftenused to assess the total enclosed mass, and even to constrain the dark matterdistribution. the globular cluster system of a galaxy is typically assumed tobe in dynamical equilibrium within the potential of the host galaxy. howevercluster galaxies are subjected to a rapidly evolving and, at times, violentlydestructive tidal field. we investigate the impact of the harassment on thedynamics of gcs surrounding early type cluster dwarfs, using numericalsimulations. we find that the dynamical behaviour of the gcs is stronglyinfluenced by the fraction of bound dark matter f_{dm} remaining in the galaxy.only when f_{dm} falls to ~15%, do stars and gcs begin to be stripped. stillthe observed gc velocity dispersion can be used to measure the true enclosedmass to within a factor of 2, even when f_{dm} falls as low as ~3%. this ispossible partly because unbound gcs quickly separate from the galaxy body.however even the distribution of {\it{bound}} gcs may spatially expand by afactor of 2-3. once f_{dm} falls into the &lt;3% regime, the galaxy is close tocomplete disruption, and gcs dynamics can no longer be used to reliablyestimate the enclosed mass. in this regime, the remaining bound gcs mayspatially expand by a factor of 4 to 8. it may be possible to test if a galaxyis in this regime by measuring the dynamics of the stellar disk. we demonstratethat if a stellar disk is rotationally supported, it is likely that a galaxyhas sufficient dark matter, that the dynamics of the gcs can be used toreliably estimate the enclosed mass.

1311.0873	the next generation virgo cluster survey - infrared (ngvs-ir): i. a new  near-uv/optical/near-ir globular cluster selection tool	the ngvs-ir project (next generation virgo survey - infrared) is a contiguousnear-infrared imaging survey of the virgo cluster of galaxies. it complementsthe optical wide-field survey of virgo (ngvs). the current state of ngvs-irconsists of ks-band imaging of 4 deg^2 centered on m87, and j and ks-bandimaging of 16 deg^2 covering the region between m49 and m87. in this paper, wepresent the observations of the central 4 deg^2 centered on virgo's coreregion. the data were acquired with wircam on the canada-france-hawaiitelescope and the total integration time was 41 hours distributed in 34contiguous tiles. a survey-specific strategy was designed to account forextended galaxies while still measuring accurate sky brightness within thesurvey area. the average 5\sigma limiting magnitude is ks=24.4 ab mag and the50% completeness limit is ks=23.75 ab mag for point source detections, whenusing only images with better than 0.7" seeing (median seeing 0.54"). starclusters are marginally resolved in these image stacks, and virgo galaxies with\mu_ks=24.4 ab mag arcsec^-2 are detected. combining the ks data with opticaland ultraviolet data, we build the uik color-color diagram which allows a veryclean color-based selection of globular clusters in virgo. this diagnostic plotwill provide reliable globular cluster candidates for spectroscopic follow-upcampaigns needed to continue the exploration of virgo's photometric andkinematic sub-structures, and will help the design of future searches forglobular clusters in extragalactic systems. equipped with this powerful newtool, future ngvs-ir investigations based on the uik diagram will address themapping and analysis of extended structures and compact stellar systems in andaround virgo galaxies.

1312.2545	blue straggler star populations in globular clusters: i. dynamical  properties of blue straggler stars in ngc 3201, ngc 6218 and $\omega$  centauri	we present the first dynamical study of blue straggler stars (bsss) in threegalactic globular clusters, ngc\,3201, ngc\,5139 ($\omega$cen), and ngc\,6218,based on medium-resolution spectroscopy (r 10000) obtained with imacs. our bsscandidate selection technique uses hst/acs and eso/wfi photometric data out to$&gt;\!4.5\,r_c$. we use radial velocity measurements to discard non-members andachieve a success rate of $\sim93\%$, which yields a sample of 116 confirmedbsss. using the penalized pixel fitting method (ppxf) we measure the $v\sin(i)$values of the sample bsss and find their distribution functions peaked at slowvelocities with a long tail towards fast velocities in each globular cluster.we find that the bsss in ngc\,3201 and ngc\,6218 which show $v\sin(i)\!&gt;\!50$km s$^{-1}$ are all found in the central cluster regions, inside a projected$2\,r_c$, of their parent clusters. we find a similar result in $\omega$cen forbsss with $v\sin(i)\!&gt;\!70$ km s$^{-1}$ which are all, except for two,concentrated inside $2\,r_c$. in all globular clusters we find rapidly rotatingbsss that have relatively high differential radial velocities which likely putthem on hyperbolic orbits, suggestive of strong dynamical interactions in thepast. we estimate that all the observed rapidly rotating bsss are likely toform in their central cluster regions no longer than $\sim\!300$ myr ago. usingdereddened $v\!-\!i$ colors of our photometric selection we show that blue bsssin $\omega$cen with $(v-i)_0$&lt;0.25 mag show a significantly increased$v\sin(i)$ dispersion compared with their red counterparts and all other bsssin our sample, therefore strongly implying that fast rotating bsss in$\omega$cen are preferentially bluer, i.e. more massive. this may indicate thatthis particular blue bss population was formed in an unique formation eventand/or through an unique mechanism.

0704.0535	the formation of globular cluster systems in massive elliptical  galaxies: globular cluster multimodality from radial variation of stellar  populations	the most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi-modality in theirglobular cluster system color distributions. understanding the mechanisms whichlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a completepicture of massive galaxy formation. by assuming that globular clusterformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radialvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the pipino &amp;matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute thedistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentricradius. we compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globularclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by puzia et al. (2006) and show that theobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals canbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellarpopulations. our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich populationof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in verygood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. furthermore, we investigatethe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicitydistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role ofmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicitytransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model(abridged)

1402.6714	wide-field hubble space telescope observations of the globular cluster  system in ngc1399	we present a comprehensive high spatial-resolution imaging study of globularclusters (gcs) in ngc1399, the central giant elliptical cd galaxy in the fornaxgalaxy cluster, conducted with hst/acs. using a novel technique to constructdrizzled psf libraries for hst/acs data, we accurately determine the fidelityof gc structural parameter measurements from detailed artificial star clusterexperiments. the measurement of rh for the major fraction of the ngc1399 gcsystem reveals a trend of increasing rh versus galactocentric distance, rgal,out to about 10 kpc and a flat relation beyond. this trend is very similar forblue and red gcs which are found to have a mean size ratio ofrh(red)/rh(blue)=0.82+/-0.11 at all galactocentric radii from the core regionsof the galaxy out to ~40 kpc. this suggests that the size difference betweenblue and red gcs is due to internal mechanisms related to the evolution oftheir constituent stellar populations. modeling the mass density profile ofngc1399 shows that additional external dynamical mechanisms are required tolimit the gc size in the galaxy halo regions to rh~2 pc. we suggest that thismay be realized by an exotic gc orbit distribution function, an extended darkmatter halo, and/or tidal stress induced by the increased stochasticity in thedwarf halo substructure at larger rgal. we match our gc rh measurements withradial velocity data from the literature and find that compact gcs show asignificantly smaller line-of-sight velocity dispersion, &lt;sigma(cmp)&gt;=225+/-25km/s, than their extended counterparts, &lt;sigma(ext)&gt;=317+/-21 km/s. consideringthe weaker statistical correlation in the gc rh-color and the gc rh-rgalrelations, the more significant gc size-dynamics relation appears to beastrophysically more relevant and hints at the dominant influence of the gcorbit distribution function on the evolution of gc structural parameters.

1405.0618	the luminosity function of low mass x-ray binaries in the globular  cluster system of ngc 1399	we present a study of the faint-end of the x-ray luminosity function of lowmass x-ray binaries in the globular cluster system of the cd galaxy ngc 1399 byperforming a stacking experiment on 618 x-ray undetected gcs, in order toverify the presence of faint lmxbs and to constrain the faint-end slope of thegc-lmxbs xlf below the individual detection threshold of $8\times10^{37}$ ergs$^{-1}$ in the $0.5-8$ kev band. we obtain a significant x-ray detection forthe whole gc sample, as well as for the red and blue gc subpopulations,corresponding to an average luminosity per gc $&lt;l_{x}&gt;_{gc}$ of$(3.6\pm1.0)\times10^{36}\ erg\ s^{-1}$, $(6.9\pm2.1)\times10^{36}\ erg\s^{-1}$ and $(1.7\pm0.9)\times10^{36}\ erg\ s^{-1}$, respectively for all, redand blue gcs. if lmxbs in red and blue gcs have the same average intrinsicluminosity, we derive a red/blu ratio $\simeq 3$ of gcs hosting lmxbs($2.5\pm1.0$ or $4.1\pm2.5$ depending on the surveyed region); alternatively,assuming the fractions observed for brighter sources, we measure an averagex-ray luminosity of $l_{x}=(4.3\pm1.3)\times10^{37}\ erg\ s^{-1}$ and$l_{x}=(3.4\pm1.7)\times10^{37}\ erg\ s^{-1}$ per red and blue gc-lmxbsrespectively. in the assumption that the xlf follows a power-law distribution,we find that a low-luminosity break is required at $l_{x}\leq 8\times10^{37}$erg s$^{-1}$ both in the whole, as well as in the color-selected (red and blue)subsamples. given the bright-end slopes measured above the x-ray completenesslimit, this result is significant at $&gt;3\sigma$ level. our best estimates forthe faint end slope are $\beta_{l}=-1.39/-1.38/-1.36$ for all/red/bluegc-lmxbs. we also find evidence that the luminosity function becomes steeper atluminosities $l_x\gtrsim 3\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, as observed in oldellipticals.

1407.1449	searching for dust around hyper metal-poor stars	we examine the mid-infrared fluxes and spectral energy distributions formetal-poor stars with iron abundances [fe/h] $\lesssim-5$, as well as twocemp-no stars, to eliminate the possibility that their low metallicities arerelated to the depletion of elements onto dust grains in the formation of adebris disk. six out of seven stars examined here show no mid-ir excess. thesenon-detections rule out many types of circumstellar disks, e.g. a warm debrisdisk ($t\!\le\!290$ k), or debris disks with inner radii $\le1$ au, such asthose associated with the chemically peculiar post-agb spectroscopic binariesand rv tau variables. however, we cannot rule out cooler debris disks, northose with lower flux ratios to their host stars due to, e.g. a smaller diskmass, a larger inner disk radius, an absence of small grains, or even amulticomponent structure, as often found with the chemically peculiar lambdabootis stars. the only exception is he0107-5240, for which a small mid-irexcess near 10 microns is detected at the 2-$\sigma$ level; if the excess isreal and associated with this star, it may indicate the presence of (recent)dust-gas winnowing or a binary system.

1407.6957	new clues to the cause of extended main sequence turn-offs in  intermediate-age star clusters in the magellanic clouds	we use the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) onboard the hubble space telescope(hst) to obtain deep, high resolution images of two intermediate-age starclusters in the large magellanic cloud of relatively low mass ($\approx$ $10^4$$m_{\odot}$) and significantly different core radii, namely ngc2209 andngc2249. for comparison purposes, we also re-analyzed archival hst images ofngc1795 and ic2146, two other relatively low mass star clusters. from thecomparison of the observed color-magnitude diagrams with monte carlosimulations, we find that the main sequence turnoff (msto) regions in ngc2209and ngc2249 are significantly wider than that derived from simulations ofsimple stellar populations, while those in ngc1795 and ic2146 are not. wedetermine the evolution of the clusters' masses and escape velocities from anage of 10 myr to the present age. we find that the differences among theseclusters can be explained by dynamical evolution arguments if the currentlyextended clusters (ngc2209 and ic2146) experienced stronger levels of initialmass segregation than the currently compact ones (ngc2249 and ngc1795). underthis assumption, we find that ngc2209 and ngc2249 have estimated escapevelocities $v_{\rm esc}$ $\geq$ 15 km s$^{-1}$ at an age of 10 myr, largeenough to retain material ejected by slow winds of first-generation stars,while the two clusters that do not feature extended mstos have $v_{\rm esc}$$\leq$ 12 km s$^{-1}$ at that age. these results suggest that the extended mstophenomenon can be better explained by a range of stellar ages rather than arange of stellar rotation velocities or interacting binaries.

1410.3840	extended main sequence turnoffs in intermediate-age star clusters: a  correlation between turnoff width and early escape velocity	we present color-magnitude diagram analysis of deep hubble space telescopeimaging of a mass-limited sample of 18 intermediate-age (1 - 2 gyr old) starclusters in the magellanic clouds, including 8 clusters for which new data wasobtained. we find that ${\it all}$ star clusters in our sample feature extendedmain sequence turnoff (emsto) regions that are wider than can be accounted forby a simple stellar population (including unresolved binary stars). fwhm widthsof the mstos indicate age spreads of 200-550 myr. we evaluate dynamicalevolution of clusters with and without initial mass segregation. our mainresults are: (1) the fraction of red clump (rc) stars in secondary rcs in emstoclusters scales with the fraction of msto stars having pseudo-ages $\leq 1.35$gyr; (2) the width of the pseudo-age distributions of emsto clusters iscorrelated with their central escape velocity $v_{\rm esc}$, both currently andat an age of 10 myr. we find that these two results are unlikely to bereproduced by the effects of interactive binary stars or a range of stellarrotation velocities. we therefore argue that the emsto phenomenon is mainlycaused by extended star formation within the clusters; (3) we find that $v_{\rmesc} \geq 15$ km/s out to ages of at least 100 myr for ${\it all}$ clustersfeaturing emstos, while $v_{\rm esc} \leq 12$ km/s at all ages for twolower-mass clusters in the same age range that do ${\it not}$ show emstos. weargue that emstos only occur for clusters whose early escape velocities arehigher than the wind velocities of stars that provide material from whichsecond-generation stars can form. the threshold of 12-15 km/s is consistentwith wind velocities of intermediate-mass agb stars in the literature.

1411.7314	a starburst in the core of a galaxy cluster: the dwarf irregular ngc  1427a in fornax	gas-rich galaxies in dense environments such as galaxy clusters and massivegroups are affected by a number of possible types of interactions with thecluster environment, which make their evolution radically different than thatof field galaxies. the dirr galaxy ngc 1427a, presently infalling towards thecore of the fornax galaxy cluster, offers a unique opportunity to study thoseprocesses in a level of detail not possible to achieve for galaxies at higherredshifts. using hst/acs and auxiliary vlt/fors ground-based observations, westudy the properties of the most recent episodes of star formation in thisgas-rich galaxy, the only one of its type near the core of the fornax cluster.we study the structural and photometric properties of young star clustercomplexes in ngc 1427a, identifying 12 bright such complexes with exceptionallyblue colors. the comparison of our broadband near-uv/optical photometry withsimple stellar population models yields ages below ~4x10^6 yr and stellarmasses from a few thousand up to ~3x10^4 msun, slightly dependent on theassumption of cluster metallicity and imf. their grouping is consistent withhierarchical and fractal star cluster formation. we use deep ha imaging data todetermine the current star formation rate (sfr) in ngc 1427a and estimate theratio, gamma, of star formation occurring in these star cluster complexes tothat in the entire galaxy. we find gamma to be among the largest such valuesavailable in the literature, consistent with starburst galaxies. thus a largefraction of the current star formation in ngc 1427a is occurring in starclusters, with the peculiar spatial arrangement of such complexes stronglyhinting at the possibility that the starburst is being triggered by the passageof the galaxy through the cluster environment.

1503.07862	on the interpretation of sub-giant branch morphologies of  intermediate-age star clusters with extended main sequence turnoffs	recent high-quality photometry of many star clusters in the magellanic cloudswith ages of 1$\,-\,$2 gyr revealed main sequence turnoffs (mstos) that aresignificantly wider than can be accounted for by a simple stellar population(ssp). such extended mstos (emstos) are often interpreted in terms of an agespread of several $10^8$ yr, challenging the traditional view of star clustersas being formed in a single star formation episode. li et al. and bastian &amp;niederhofer recently investigated the sub-giant branches (sgbs) of ngc 1651,ngc 1806, and ngc 1846, three star clusters in the large magellanic cloud (lmc)that exhibit an emsto. they argued that the sgb of these star clusters can beexplained only by a ssp. we study these and two other similar star clusters inthe lmc, using extensive simulations of ssps including unresolved binaries. wefind that the shapes of the cross-sgb profiles of all star clusters in oursample are in fact consistent with their cross-msto profiles when the latterare interpreted as age distributions. conversely, sgb morphologies of starclusters with emstos are found to be inconsistent with those of simulated ssps.finally, we create parsec isochrones from tracks featuring a grid of convectiveovershoot levels and a very fine grid of stellar masses. a comparison of theobserved photometry with these isochrones shows that the morphology of the redclump (rc) of such star clusters is also consistent with that implied by theirmsto in the age spread scenario. we conclude that the sgb and rc morphologiesof star clusters featuring emstos are consistent with the scenario in which theemstos are caused by a distribution of stellar ages.

1504.03299	new constraints on the star formation history of the star cluster ngc  1856	we use the wide field camera 3 onboard the hubble space telescope to obtaindeep, high-resolution photometry of the young (age ~ 300 myr) star clusterngc1856 in the large magellanic cloud. we compare the observed colour-magnitudediagram (cmd), after having applied a correction for differential reddening,with monte carlo simulations of simple stellar populations (ssps) of variousages. we find that the main sequence turn-off (msto) region is wider than thatderived from the simulation of a single ssp. using constraints based on thedistribution of stars in the msto region and the red clump, we find that thecmd is best reproduced using a combination of two different ssps with agesseparated by 80 myr (0.30 and 0.38 gyr, respectively). however, we can notformally exclude that the width of the msto could be due to a range of stellarrotation velocities if the efficiency of rotational mixing is higher thantypically assumed. using a king-model fit to the surface number density profilein conjunction with dynamical evolution models, we determine the evolution ofcluster mass and escape velocity from an age of 10 myr to the present age,taking into account the possible effects of primordial mass segregation. wefind that the cluster has an escape velocity vesc ~ 17 km/s at an age of 10myr, and it remains high enough during a period of ~ 100 myr to retain materialejected by slow winds of first-generation stars. our results are consistentwith the presence of an age spread in ngc1856, in contradiction to the resultsof bastian &amp; silva-villa (2013).

1509.02537	the sensitivity of harassment to orbit: mass loss from early-type dwarfs  in galaxy clusters	we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of the orbital dependence ofharassment on early-type dwarfs consisting of 168 different orbits within arealistic, virgo-like cluster, varying in eccentricity and pericentre distance.we find harassment is only effective at stripping stars or truncating theirstellar disks for orbits that enter deep into the cluster core. comparing tothe orbital distribution in cosmological simulations, we find that the majorityof the orbits (more than three quarters) result in no stellar mass loss. wealso study the effects on the radial profiles of the globular cluster systemsof early-type dwarfs. we find these are significantly altered only ifharassment is very strong. this suggests that perhaps most early-type dwarfs inclusters such as virgo have not suffered any tidal stripping of stars orglobular clusters due to harassment, as these components are safely embeddeddeep within their dark matter halo. we demonstrate that this result is actuallyconsistent with an earlier study of harassment of dwarf galaxies, despite theapparent contradiction. those few dwarf models that do suffer stellar strippingare found out to the virial radius of the cluster at redshift=0, which mixesthem in with less strongly harassed galaxies. however when placed onphase-space diagrams, strongly harassed galaxies are found offset to lowervelocities compared to weakly harassed galaxies. this remains true in acosmological simulation, even when halos have a wide range of masses andconcentrations. thus phase-space diagrams may be a useful tool for determiningthe relative likelihood that galaxies have been strongly or weakly harassed.

1511.05166	compact stellar systems in the polar ring galaxies ngc 4650a and ngc  3808b: clues to polar disk formation	polar ring galaxies (prgs) are composed of two kinematically distinct andnearly orthogonal components, a host galaxy (hg) and a polar ring/disk (pr).the hg usually contains an older stellar population than the pr. the suggestedformation channel of prgs is still poorly constrained. suggested options aremerger, gas accretion, tidal interaction, or a combination of both. toconstrain the formation scenario of prgs, we study the compact stellar systems(csss) in two prgs at different evolutionary stages: ngc 4650a withwell-defined pr, and ngc 3808b, which is in the process of pr formation. we usearchival hst/wfpc2 imaging. psf-fitting techniques, and color selectioncriteria are used to select cluster candidates. photometric analysis of thecsss was performed to determine their ages and masses using stellar populationmodels at a fixed metallicity. both prgs contain young csss ($&lt; 1$ gyr) withmasses of up to 5$\times$10$^6$m$_\odot$, mostly located in the pr and alongthe tidal debris. the most massive csss may be progenitors of metal-richglobular clusters or ultra compact dwarf (ucd) galaxies. we identify one suchyoung ucd candidate, ngc 3808 b-8, and measure its size of $r_{\rmeff}=25.23^{+1.43}_{-2.01}$ pc. we reconstruct the star formation history ofthe two prgs and find strong peaks in the star formation rate (sfr $\simeq$200m$_\odot$/yr) in ngc 3808b, while ngc 4650a shows milder (declining) starformation (sfr $&lt;$ 10m$_\odot$/yr). this difference may support differentevolutionary paths between these prgs. the spatial distribution, masses, andpeak star formation epoch of the clusters in ngc 3808 suggest for a tidallytriggered star formation. incompleteness at old ages prevents us from probingthe sfr at earlier epochs of ngc 4650a, where we observe the fading tail of cssformation. this also impedes us from testing the formation scenarios of thisprg.

1512.00253	evidence for the rapid formation of low mass early-type galaxies in  dense environments	we explore the environmental dependence of star formation timescales in lowmass galaxies using the [$\alpha$/fe] abundance ratio as an evolutionary clock.we present integrated [$\alpha$/fe] measurements for 11 low mass ($m_\star \sim10^9~m_\odot$) early-type galaxies (etgs) with a large range of cluster-centricdistance in the virgo cluster. we find a gradient in [$\alpha$/fe], where thegalaxies closest to the cluster center (the cd galaxy, m87) have the highestvalues. this trend is driven by galaxies within a projected radius of 0.4~mpc(0.26 times the virial radius of virgo~a), all of which have super-solar[$\alpha$/fe]. galaxies in this mass range exhibit a large scatter in the[$\alpha$/fe]--$\sigma$ diagram, and do not obviously lie on an extension ofthe relation defined by massive etgs. in addition, we find a correlationbetween [$\alpha$/fe] and globular cluster specific frequency ($s_n$),suggesting that low-mass etgs that formed their stars over a short period oftime, were also efficient at forming massive star clusters. the innermostlow-mass etgs in our sample have [$\alpha$/fe] values comparable to that ofm87, implying that environment is the controlling factor for star formationtimescales in dense regions. these low-mass galaxies could be the survivingcounterparts of the objects that have already been accreted into the halo ofm87, and may be the link between present-day low-mass galaxies and the old,metal-poor, high-[$\alpha$/fe], high-$s_n$ stellar populations seen in theouter halos of massive etgs.

astro-ph;0005008	globular clusters in the de,n galaxy ngc 3115 dw1: new insights from  spectroscopy and hst photometry	the properties of globular clusters in dwarf galaxies are key tounderstanding the formation of globular cluster systems, and in particular inverifying scenarios in which globular cluster systems of larger galaxies formed(at least partly) from the accretion of dwarf galaxies. here, we revisit theglobular cluster system of the de,n galaxy ngc 3115 dw1 - a companion of thenearby s0 galaxy ngc 3115 - adding keck/lris spectroscopy and hst/wfpc2 imagingto previous ground-based photometry. spectra for seven globular clusters revealnormal abundance ratios with respect to the milky way and m31 clusters, as wellas a relatively high mean metallicity ([fe/h] = -1.0+/-0.1 dex). crudekinematics indicate a high velocity dispersion within 10 kpc which could eitherbe caused by dark matter dominated outer regions, or by the stripping of outerglobular clusters by the nearby giant galaxy ngc 3115. the total galaxy massout to 3 and 10 kpc lies between 10^10 and 10^11 solar masses and 2*10^10 and4*10^11 solar masses, respectively, depending on the mass estimator used andthe assumptions on cluster orbits and systemic velocity. the hst imaging allowsmeasurement of sizes for two clusters, returning core radii around 2.0 pc,similar to the sizes observed in other galaxies. spectroscopy allows anestimate of the degree of contamination by foreground stars or backgroundgalaxies for the previous ground-based photometry, but does not require arevision of previous results: ngc 3115 dw1 hosts around 60+/-20 clusters whichcorresponds to a specific frequency of 4.9+/-1.9, on the high end for massivedes. given its absolute magnitude (m_v=-17.7 mag) and the properties of itscluster system, ngc 3115 dw1 appears to be a transition between a luminous deand low-luminosity e galaxy.

astro-ph;0209238	integrated spectroscopy of bulge globular clusters and fields i. the  data base and comparison of individual lick indices in clusters and bulge	we present a comprehensive spectroscopic study of the integrated light ofmetal-rich galactic globular clusters and the stellar population in thegalactic bulge. we measure line indices which are defined by the lick standardsystem and compare index strengths of the clusters and galactic bulge. bothmetal-rich globular clusters and the bulge are similar in most of the indices,except for the cn index. we find a significant enhancement in the cn/&lt;fe&gt; indexratio in metal-rich globular clusters compared with the galactic bulge. themean iron index &lt;fe&gt; of the two metal-rich globular clusters ngc 6528 and ngc6553 is comparable with the mean iron index of the bulge. index ratios such asmgb/&lt;fe&gt;, mg2/&lt;fe&gt;, ca4227/&lt;fe&gt;, and tio/&lt;fe&gt;, are comparable in both stellarpopulation indicating similar enhancements in individual elements which aretraced by the indices. from the globular cluster data we fully empiricallycalibrate several metallicity-sensitive indices as a function of [fe/h] andfind tightest correlations for the mg2 index and the composite [mgfe] index. wefind that all indices show a similar behavior with galactocentric radius,except for the balmer series, which show a large scatter at all radii. however,the scatter is entirely consistent with the cluster-to-cluster variations inthe horizontal branch morphology.

astro-ph;0304445	some constraints on the effects of age and metallicity on the low mass  x-ray binary formation rate	we have studied the low mass x-ray binary (lmxb) populations within andoutside globular clusters (gc) in ngc 4365 and ngc 3115. using published ageand metallicity constraints from optical and ir observations of their gcs, wedo not find any evidence for an increase in the lmxb formation rate in theintermediate age cluster population of ngc 4365, as has been proposed in somescenarios of dynamical lmxb formation in gcs. the old, metal-rich, redpopulation of gcs in ngc 3115 on the other hand is {\it at least} three timesas efficient at creating lmxbs as the old, metal-poor, blue clusters. thesedata suggest that the higher formation efficiency of lmxbs in the red gcsubsystems of many galaxies is largely a consequence of their highermetallicity. a comparison of the densities of field lmxbs in different galaxiesdoes not reveal an obvious correlation with the age of the field stars aspredicted by models in which the lmxb formation rate in the field dropsmonotonically with time after an initial burst. this suggests that either asignificant fraction of the field lmxbs are created in gcs and subsequentlyinjected into the field, or the lmxb formation rate has a more complex timeevolution pattern.

[mgfe]' is used as aspectroscopic metallicity indicator which is least affected by [alpha/fe]variations. we introduce an interpolation routine to simultaneously deriveages, metallicities, and [alpha/fe] ratios from diagnostic grids constructedfrom lick indices. from a comparison of high-quality data with ssp modelpredictions, we find that ~2/3 of the globular clusters in early-type galaxiesare older than 10 gyr, up to 1/3 have ages in the range ~5-10 gyr, and only afew cluster are younger than ~5 gyr. our sample of globular clusters coversmetallicities from [z/h] = -1.3 up to ~0.5 dex. we find that metal-richglobular clusters show on average a smaller mean age and a larger age scatterthan their metal-poor counterparts. [alpha/fe] diagnostic plots show thatglobular cluster systems in early-type galaxies have super-solar alpha/feabundance ratios with a mean [alpha/fe] = 0.47+/-0.06 dex and a dispersion ofabout 0.3 dex. we find evidence for a correlation between [alpha/fe] andmetallicity, in the sense that more metal-rich clusters exhibit loweralpha-element enhancements.

astro-ph;0607617	a database of 2mass near-infrared colors of magellanic cloud star  clusters	the (rest-frame) near-ir domain contains important stellar populationdiagnostics and is often used to estimate masses of galaxies at low as well ashigh redshifts. however, many stellar population models are still relativelypoorly calibrated in this part of the spectrum. to allow an improvement of thiscalibration we present a new database of integrated near-infrared jhksmagnitudes for 75 star clusters in the magellanic clouds, using the 2-micronall-sky survey (2mass). the majority of the clusters in our sample have robustage and metallicity estimates from color-magnitude diagrams available in theliterature, and populate a range of ages from 10 myr to 15 gyr and a range in[fe/h] from -2.17 to +0.01 dex. a comparison with matched star clusters in the2mass extended source catalog (xsc) reveals that the xsc only provides a goodfit to the unresolved component of the cluster stellar population. we alsocompare our results with the often-cited single-channel jhk photometry ofpersson and collaborators, and find significant differences, especially fortheir 30"-diameter apertures up to ~2.5 mag in the k-band, more than 1 mag inj-k, and up to 0.5 mag in h-k. using simulations to center apertures based onmaximum light throughput (as performed by persson et al, we show that thesedifferences can be attributed to near-ir-bright cluster stars (e.g., carbonstars) located away from the true center of the star clusters. the wide age andmetallicity coverage of our integrated jhks photometry sample constitutes afundamental dataset for testing population synthesis model predictions, and fordirect comparison with near-ir observations of distant stellar populations.

astro-ph;9908203	the age difference between the globular cluster sub-populations in ngc  4472	the age difference between the two main globular cluster sub-populations inthe virgo giant elliptical galaxy, ngc 4472 (m 49), has been determined usinghst wfpc2 images in the f555w and f814w filters. accurate photometry has beenobtained for several hundred globular clusters in each of the two mainsub-populations, down to more than one magnitude below the turn-over of theirluminosity functions. this allows precise determinations of both the meancolors and the turn-over magnitudes of the two main sub-populations. bycomparing the data with various population synthesis models, theage-metallicity pairs that fit both the observed colors and magnitudes havebeen identified. the metal-poor and the metal-rich globular clusters are foundto be coeval within the errors ($\sim 3$ gyr). if one accepts the validity ofour assumptions, these errors are dominated by model uncertainties. asystematic error of up to 4 gyr could affect this result if the blue and thered clusters have significantly different mass distributions. however, that onesub-population is half as old as the other is excluded at the 99% confidencelevel. the different globular cluster populations are assumed to trace thegalaxy's major star-formation episodes. consequently, the vast majority ofglobular clusters, and by implication the majority of stars, in ngc 4472 formedat high redshifts but by two distinct mechanisms or in two episodes.

0810.3660	globular cluster systems in nearby dwarf galaxies: i. hst/acs  observations and dynamical properties of globular clusters at low  environmental density	we investigate the old globular cluster (gc) population of 68 faint (mv&gt;-16mag) dwarf galaxies located in the halo regions of nearby (&lt;12 mpc) loosegalaxy groups and in the field environment based on archival hst/acs images inf606w and f814w filters. the combined color distribution of 175 gc candidatespeaks at (v-i)=0.96 +/- 0.07 mag and the gc luminosity function turnover forthe entire sample is found at mv,to = -7.6 +/- 0.11 mag, similar to the oldmetal-poor lmc gc population. our data reveal a tentative trend of mv,tobecoming fainter from late-type to early-type galaxies. the luminosity andcolor distributions of gcs in dirrs shows a lack of faint blue gcs. ouranalysis reveals that this might reflect a relatively younger gc system thantypically found in luminous early-type galaxies. if verified by spectroscopythis would suggest a later formation epoch of the first metal-poor starclusters in dwarf galaxies. we find several bright (massive) gcs which residein the nuclear regions of their host galaxies. these nuclear clusters havesimilar luminosities and structural parameters as the peculiar galacticclusters suspected of being the remnant nuclei of accreted dwarf galaxies, suchas m54 and wcen. except for these nuclear clusters, the distribution of gcs indirrs in the half-light radius vs. cluster mass plane is very similar to thatof galactic young halo clusters, which suggests comparable formation anddynamical evolution histories. a comparison with theoretical models of clusterdisruption indicates that gcs in low-mass galaxies evolve dynamically asself-gravitating systems in a benign tidal environment.

0810.4621	globular cluster populations in four early-type poststarburst galaxies	we present a study of the globular cluster systems of four early-typepoststarburst galaxies using deep g and i-band images from the acs cameraaboard the hubble space telescope (hst). all the galaxies feature shellsdistributed around their main bodies and are thus likely merger remnants. thecolor distribution of the globular clusters in all four galaxies shows a broadpeak centered on g-i ~ 1.4, while pgc 6240 and pgc 42871 show a significantnumber of globular clusters with g-i ~ 1.0. the latter globular clusters areinterpreted as being of age ~ 500 myr and likely having been formed in themerger. the color of the redder peak is consistent with that expected for anold metal-poor population that is very commonly found around normal galaxies.however, all galaxies except pgc 10922 contain several globular clusters thatare significantly brighter than the maximum luminosity expected of a single oldmetal-poor population. to test for multiple-age populations of overlapping g-icolor, we model the luminosity functions of the globular clusters as compositesof an old metal-poor subpopulation with a range of plausible specificfrequencies and an intermediate-age subpopulation of solar metallicity. we findthat three of the four sample galaxies show evidence for the presence of anintermediate-age (~ 1 gyr) globular cluster population, in addition to the oldmetal-poor gc population seen in normal early-type galaxies. none of thegalaxies show a significant population of clusters consistent with an old,metal-rich red cluster population that is typically seen in early-typegalaxies.
