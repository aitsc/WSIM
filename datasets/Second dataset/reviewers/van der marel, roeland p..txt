0902.2835	properties of dark matter revealed by astrometric measurements of the  milky way and local galaxies	the fact that dark matter (dm), thus far, has revealed itself only on scalesof galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and theresponsibility to confront the age old mystery "what is the nature of matter?"by deriving basic data on the nature of dm - e.g., mass of its particle(s),present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in theuniverse, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering theproperties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantlyextending the standard models of particle physics. determining the mass of thedm particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle familyto which it (or they) belongs. beyond mass, there are issues of stability. thedm particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may becomeunstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. in bothcases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component.  some key parameters of dm can most accurately be measured in the very nearbyuniverse because dm dominates the mass in the outer milky way (mw), in othergalaxies in the local group, and in the local group in its entirety. thepresence and amount of dm can be quantified by study of dynamical processesobservable in fine detail within these entities. precise measurements of 3-dvelocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellarsystems out to the edge of the galaxy can reveal "what is the shape,orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo" as well as"what is the total mass of the galaxy?"

0904.3326	mass segregation in ngc 2298: limits on the presence of an intermediate  mass black hole	[abridged] theoretical investigations have suggested the presence ofintermediate mass black holes (imbhs, with masses in the 100-10000 msun range)in the cores of some globular clusters (gcs). in this paper we present thefirst application of a new technique to determine the presence or absence of acentral imbh in globular clusters that have reached energy equipartition viatwo-body relaxation. the method is based on the measurement of the radialprofile for the average mass of stars in the system, using the fact that aquenching of mass segregation is expected when an imbh is present. here wemeasure the radial profile of mass segregation using main-sequence stars forthe globular cluster ngc 2298 from resolved source photometry based on hst-acsdata. the observations are compared to expectations from direct n-bodysimulations of the dynamics of star clusters with and without an imbh. the masssegregation profile for ngc 2298 is quantitatively matched to that inferredfrom simulations without a central massive object over all the radial rangeprobed by the observations, that is from the center to about two half-massradii. profiles from simulations containing an imbh more massive than ~ 300-500msun (depending on the assumed total mass of ngc 2298) are instead inconsistentwith the data at about 3 sigma confidence, irrespective of the imf and binaryfraction chosen for these runs. while providing a null result in the quest ofdetecting a central black hole in globular clusters, the data-model comparisoncarried out here demonstrates the feasibility of the method which can also beapplied to other globular clusters with resolved photometry in their cores.

0905.0627	new limits on an intermediate mass black hole in omega centauri: i.  hubble space telescope photometry and proper motions	we analyze data from the hubble space telescope's advanced camera for surveysof the globular cluster omega cen. we construct a photometric and proper-motioncatalog using the go-9442, go-10252, and go-10775 data sets. the 2.5- to 4-yearbaseline between observations yields a catalog of some 10^5 proper motions,with 53,382 high-quality measurements in a central field. we determine thecluster center to ~1-arcsecond accuracy using two different star-count methods,and a completely independent method using 2mass images. we also determine thekinematical center of the proper motions, which agrees with the star-countcenter to within its uncertainty. the proper-motion dispersion of the clusterincreases gradually inwards, but there is no variation in kinematics withposition within the central ~15 arcsec: there is no dispersion cusp and nostars with unusually high velocities. we measure for the first time in anyglobular cluster the variation in proper-motion dispersion with mass along themain sequence, and find the cluster not yet to be in equipartition. ourproper-motion results do not confirm the arguments put forward by noyola,gebhardt &amp; bergmann to suspect an intermediate-mass black hole (imbh) in omegacen. in paper ii we present new dynamical models for the high-quality datapresented here, with the aim of putting quantitative contraints on the mass ofany possible imbh.

0708.2645	the toomre sequence revisited with hst/nicmos: nuclear brightness  profiles and colors of interacting and merging galaxies	we discuss the near-infrared properties of the nuclei in the 11 merginggalaxies of the toomre sequence, based on high spatial resolution j, h, and kimaging data using nicmos onboard the hubble space telescope (hst). theobservations are less affected by dust extinction than our previous hst/wfpc2observations and offer higher spatial resolution than existing ground-basednear-ir data. we see a marginal trend for the nuclei to become bluer withadvancing merger stage, which we attribute to a dispersal of dust at late timesin the merging process. our data also indicate a statistically significanttrend for the nuclei in the sequence to become more luminous, within anaperture of fixed physical size and after correcting for dust extinction, withadvancing merger stage. we derive k-band surface brightness profiles for thosenuclei for which the morphology allows a meaningful isophotal analysis, and fitthe profiles with a ``nuker law'' for comparison with other samples of galaxiesobserved with hst. the majority of the nuclei have steep profiles that can becharacterized as power-law type. in general, the toomre sequence galaxies tendto have steeper profiles and higher central luminosity surface densities thane/s0's. we derive v-k color profiles for the nuclei to further address thispossibility, but find that the large amounts of dust extinction complicatetheir interpretation. overall, our results are consistent with the genericpredictions of n-body simulations of spiral galaxy mergers. if left to evolveand fade for several gyrs, it is possible that the properties of the toomresequence nuclei would resemble theproperties of the nuclei of normal e/s0galaxies. our results therefore support the view that mergers of spiralgalaxies can lead to the formation of early-type galaxies (abridged).

1008.2210	simulations of the magellanic stream in a first infall scenario	recent high precision proper motions from the hubble space telescope (hst)suggest that the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively)are either on their first passage or on an eccentric long period (&gt;6 gyr) orbitabout the milky way (mw). this differs markedly from the canonical picture inwhich the clouds travel on a quasi-periodic orbit about the mw (period of ~2gyr). without a short period orbit about the mw, the origin of the magellanicstream, a young (1-2 gyr old) coherent stream of hi gas that trails the clouds~150 degrees across the sky, can no longer be attributed to stripping by mwtides and/or ram pressure stripping by mw halo gas. we propose an alternativeformation mechanism in which material is removed by lmc tides acting on the smcbefore the system is accreted by the mw. we demonstrate the feasibility andgenerality of this scenario using an n-body/sph simulation with cosmologicallymotivated initial conditions constrained by the observations. under theseconditions we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the origin of themagellanic stream in a first infall scenario. this picture is genericallyapplicable to any gas-rich dwarf galaxy pair infalling towards a massive hostor interacting in isolation.

1104.0899	hubble space telescope study of resolved red giant stars in the outer  halos of nearby dwarf starburst galaxies	[abridged] aims. we observed the outer parts of ngc 1569 and ngc 4449, two ofthe closest and strongest dwarf starburst galaxies in the local universe, tocharacterize their stellar density and populations, and obtain new insightsinto the structure, formation, and evolution of starburst galaxies and galaxyhalos. methods. we obtained hst/wfpc2 images between 5 and 8 scale radii fromthe center, along the intermediate and minor axes. we performed point-sourcephotometry to determine color magnitude diagrams of i vs. v-i. we compared theresults at different radii, including also our prior hst/acs results for morecentrally located fields. results. we detect stars in the rgb and tp-agb(carbon star) phases in all outer fields, but not younger stars such as thosepresent at smaller radii. the rgb star density profile is well fit by either ade vaucouleurs profile or a power-law profile, but has more stars at largeradii than a single exponential. to within the uncertainties, there are noradial gradients in the rgb color or carbon-to-rgb-star ratio at large radii.conclusions. the galaxies have faint outer stellar envelopes that are nottidally truncated within the range of radii addressed by our study. the densityprofiles suggest that these are not outward extensions of the inner disks, butare instead distinct stellar halos. this agrees with other work on galaxies ofsimilar morphology. the presence of such halos is consistent with predictionsof hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios. the halos consist ofintermediate-age/old stars, confirming the results of other studies that haveshown the starburst phenomenon to be very centrally concentrated. there is noevidence for stellar-population age/metallicity gradients within the halosthemselves.

0709.3747	m31 transverse velocity and local group mass from satellite kinematics	we present several different statistical methods to determine the transversevelocity vector of m31. the underlying assumptions are that the m31 satelliteson average follow the motion of m31 through space, and that the galaxies in theouter parts of the local group on average follow the motion of the local groupbarycenter through space. we apply the methods to the line-of-sight velocitiesof 17 m31 satellites, to the proper motions of the 2 satellites m33 and ic 10,and to the line-of-sight velocities of 5 galaxies near the local group turnaround radius, respectively. this yields 4 independent but mutually consistentdeterminations of the heliocentric m31 transverse velocities in the west andnorth directions, with weighted averages &lt;v_w&gt; = -78+/-41 km/s and &lt;v_n&gt; =-38+/-34 km/s. the galactocentric tangential velocity of m31 is 42 km/s, with1-sigma confidence interval v_tan &lt;= 56 km/s. the implied m31-milky way orbitis bound if the total local group mass m exceeds 1.72^{+0.26}_{-0.25}x10^{12}solar masses. if indeed bound, then the timing argument combined with the knownage of the universe implies that m = 5.58^{+0.85}_{-0.72}x10^{12} solar masses.this is on the high end of the allowed mass range suggested by cosmologicallymotivated models for the individual structure and dynamics of m31 and the milkyway, respectively. it is therefore possible that the timing mass is anoverestimate of the true mass, especially if one takes into account recentresults from the millennium simulation that show that there is also atheoretical uncertainty of 41 percent (gaussian dispersion) in timing massestimates. the m31 transverse velocity implies that m33 is in a tightly boundorbit around m31. this may have led to some tidal deformation of m33. it willbe worthwhile to search for observational evidence of this.

1108.0694	the cluster population of the irregular galaxy ngc 4449 as seen by the  hubble advanced camera for surveys	we present a study of the star cluster population in the starburst irregulargalaxy ngc 4449 based on b, v, i, and ha images taken with the advanced camerafor surveys on the hubble space telescope. we derive the cluster propertiessuch as size, ellipticity, and total magnitudes. cluster ages and masses arederived fitting the observed spectral energy distributions with differentpopulation synthesis models. our analysis is strongly affected by theage-metallicity degeneracy; however, if we assume a metallicity of ~1/4 solar,as derived from spectroscopy of hii regions, we find that the clusters haveages distributed quite continuously over a hubble time, and they have massesfrom ~10^3 m_sun up to ~2 x 10^6 m_sun, assuming a salpeters' imf down to 0.1m_sun. young clusters are preferentially located in regions of young starformation, while old clusters are distributed over the whole ngc 4449 field ofview, like the old stars (although we notice that some old clusters followlinear structures, possibly a reflection of past satellite accretion). the highsf activity in ngc 4449 is confirmed by its specific frequency of young massiveclusters, higher than the average value found in nearby spirals and in the lmc(but lower than in other starburst dwarfs such as ngc 1705 and ngc 1569), andby the flat slope of the cluster luminosity function (dn(l_v)\propto l_v^{-1.5}dl for clusters younger than 1 gyr). we use the upper envelope of the clusterlog(mass) versus log(age) distribution to quantify cluster disruption, and donot find evidence for the high (90%) long-term infant mortality found by somestudies. for the red clusters, we find correlations between size, ellipticity,luminosity and mass: brighter and more massive clusters tend to be morecompact, and brighter clusters tend to be also more elliptical.

1112.2154	dwarfs gobbling dwarfs: a stellar tidal stream around ngc 4449 and  hierarchical galaxy formation on small scales	a candidate diffuse stellar substructure was previously reported in the haloof the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 4449 by karachentsev et al. we map andanalyze this feature using a unique combination of deep integrated-light imagesfrom the black bird 0.5-meter telescope, and high-resolution wide-field imagesfrom the 8-meter subaru telescope, which resolve the nebulosity into a streamof red giant branch stars, and confirm its physical association with ngc 4449.the properties of the stream imply a massive dwarf spheroidal progenitor, whichafter complete disruption will deposit an amount of stellar mass that iscomparable to the existing stellar halo of the main galaxy. the ratio betweenluminosity or stellar-mass between the two galaxies is ~1:50, while theindirectly measured dynamical mass-ratio, when including dark matter, may be~1:10-1:5. this system may thus represent a "stealth" merger, where aninfalling satellite galaxy is nearly undetectable by conventional means, yethas a substantial dynamical influence on its host galaxy. this singulardiscovery also suggests that satellite accretion can play a significant role inbuilding up the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies, and possibly in triggeringtheir starbursts.

1201.1299	the role of dwarf galaxy interactions in shaping the magellanic system  and implications for magellanic irregulars	we present a novel pair of numerical models of the interaction historybetween the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively) andour milky way (mw) in light of recent high precision proper motions(kallivayalil et al. 2006a,b). given the new velocities, cosmologicalsimulations of structure formation favor a scenario where the magellanic clouds(mcs) are currently on their first infall towards our galaxy (boylan-kolchin etal. 2011, busha et al. 2011). we illustrate here that the observed irregularmorphology and internal kinematics of the mcs (in gas and stars) are naturallyexplained by interactions between the lmc and smc, rather than gravitationalinteractions with the mw. this picture further supports a first infall scenario(besla et a. 2007). in particular, we demonstrate that the magellanic stream, aband of hi gas trailing behind the mcs 150 degrees across the sky, can beaccounted for by the action of lmc tides on the smc before the system wasaccreted by the mw. we further demonstrate that the off-center, warped stellarbar of the lmc and its one-armed spiral, can be naturally explained by a recentdirect collision with the smc. such structures are key morphologicalcharacteristics of a class of galaxies referred to as magellanic irregulars (devaucouleurs &amp; freeman 1972), the majority of which are not associated withmassive spiral galaxies. we infer that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions areimportant drivers for the morphological evolution of magellanic irregulars andcan dramatically affect the efficiency of baryon removal from dwarf galaxiesvia the formation of extended tidal bridges and tails. such interactions areimportant not only for the evolution of dwarf galaxies but also have directconsequences for the buildup of baryons in our own mw, as lmc-mass systems arebelieved to be the dominant building blocks of mw-type halos.

1308.4633	optical proper motion measurements of the m87 jet: new results from the  hubble space telescope	we report new results from an hst archival program to study proper motions inthe optical jet of the nearby radio galaxy m87. using over 13 years of archivalimaging, we reach accuracies below 0.1c in measuring the apparent velocities ofindividual knots in the jet. we confirm previous findings of speeds up to 4.5cin the inner 6" of the jet, and report new speeds for optical components in theouter part of the jet. we find evidence of significant motion transverse to thejet axis on the order of 0.6c in the inner jet features, and superluminalvelocities parallel and transverse to the jet in the outer knot components,with an apparent ordering of velocity vectors possibly consistent with ahelical jet pattern. previous results suggested a global deceleration over thelength of the jet in the form of decreasing maximum speeds of knot componentsfrom hst-1 outward, but our results suggest that superluminal speeds persistout to knot c, with large differentials in very nearby features all along thejet. we find significant apparent accelerations in directions parallel andtransverse to the jet axis, along with evidence for stationary features inknots d, e, and i. these results are expected to place important constraints ondetailed models of kpc-scale relativistic jets.

1409.6733	local group proper motion dynamics	our knowledge of the dynamics and masses of galaxies in the local group haslong been limited by the fact that only line-of-sight velocities wereobservationally accessible. this introduces significant degeneracies indynamical models, which can only be resolved by measuring also the velocitycomponents perpendicular to the line of sight. however, beyond the solarneighborhood, the corresponding proper motions have generally been too small tomeasure. this has changed dramatically over the past decade, especially due tothe angular resolution and stability available on the hubble space telescope.proper motions can now be reliably measured throughout the local group, asillustrated by, e.g., the work of the hstpromo collaboration. in this review, isummarize the importance of proper motions for local group science, and idescribe the current and future observational approaches and facilitiesavailable to measure proper motions. i highlight recent results on variousmilky way populations (globular clusters, the bulge, the metal-poor halo,hypervelocity stars, and tidal streams), dwarf satellite galaxies, themagellanic clouds and the andromeda system.

1502.00005	hubble space telescope proper motion (hstpromo) catalogs of galactic  globular clusters. ii. kinematic profiles and maps	we present kinematical analyses of 22 galactic globular clusters using thehubble space telescope proper motion (hstpromo) catalogues recently presentedin bellini et al. (2014). for most clusters, this is the first proper-motionstudy ever performed, and, for many, this is the most detailed kinematic studyof any kind. we use cleaned samples of bright stars to determine binnedvelocity-dispersion and velocity-anisotropy radial profiles and two-dimensionalvelocity-dispersion spatial maps. using these profiles, we search forcorrelations between cluster kinematics and structural properties. we findthat: (1) more centrally-concentrated clusters have steeper radialvelocity-dispersion profiles; (2) on average, at 1\sigma confidence in twodimensions, the photometric and kinematic centres of globular clusters agree towithin ~1", with a cluster-to-cluster rms of 4" (including observationaluncertainties); (3) on average, the cores of globular clusters have isotropicvelocity distributions to within 1% (\sigma_t/\sigma_r = 0.992 +/- 0.005), witha cluster-to-cluster rms of 2% (including observational uncertainties); (4)clusters generally have mildly radially anisotropic velocity distributions(\sigma_t/\sigma_r ~ 0.8-1.0) near the half-mass radius, with bigger deviationsfrom isotropy for clusters with longer relaxation times; (5) there is arelation between \sigma_minor/\sigma_major and ellipticity, such that the moreflattened clusters in the sample tend to be more anisotropic, with\sigma_minor/\sigma_major ~ 0.9-1.0. aside from these general results andcorrelations, the profiles and maps presented here can provide a basis fordetailed dynamical modelling of individual globular clusters. given the qualityof the data, this is likely to provide new insights into a range of topicsconcerning globular cluster mass profiles, structure, and dynamics.

0804.3819	hst/acs observations of star formation driven outflows in nearby edge-on  spiral galaxies: dependence of halo morphology on star formation activity	(abridged). we present new high spatial resolution narrowband imagingobservations of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (edig) in four late-type,actively star forming edge-on spirals, obtained with acs on-board hst. ourf658n (h-alpha) observations reveal a multitude of structures on both small andlarge scales. whereas all four galaxies have been studied with ground-basedtelescopes before, here the small scale structure of the extended emission linegas is presented for the first time at a spatial resolution of 0.05",corresponding to 5.0 pc at the mean distance to the target galaxies. the edigmorphology is very different for all four targets, probably as a result oftheir different levels of star formation activity. we find that the morphologyof the edig, in particular the break-up of diffuse emission into filaments ingalaxy halos, shows a strong dependence on the level of star formation activityper unit area, and edig can be arranged into a morphological sequence. ngc4634and ngc5775 have the highest sf rate per unit area in our sample and theobserved morphology suggests that the break-up of the smooth edig layer intoindividual resolved filaments occurs only above a certain threshold of sfactivity per unit area. combined with ground-based data for samples that span alarger range of galaxy mass our results indicate that the gravitationalpotential also plays an important role in the edig morphology. in low-massgalaxies the gas can be expelled due to shallow gravitational potentials moreeasily and couple with strong star formation driven outflows on a local scale.this is in contrast to the more massive galaxies, which show smooth ediglayers, unless they are powered by a superwind, as in the case of nucleatedstarburst galaxies.

0804.4228	spatially resolved stellar kinematics of field early-type galaxies at  z=1: evolution of the rotation rate	we use the spatial information of our previously published vlt/fors2absorption line spectroscopy to measure mean stellar velocity and velocitydispersion profiles of 25 field early-type galaxies at a median redshift z=0.97(full range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2). this provides the first detailed study of early-typegalaxy rotation at these redshifts. from surface brightness profiles from hstimaging we calculate two-integral oblate axisymmetric jeans equation models forthe observed kinematics. fits to the data yield for each galaxy the degree ofrotational support and the mass-to-light ratio m/l_jeans. s0 and sa galaxiesare generally rotationally supported, whereas elliptical galaxies rotate lessrapidly or not at all. down to m(b)=-19.5 (corrected for luminosity evolution),we find no evidence for evolution in the fraction of rotating early-type (e+s0)galaxies between z=1 (63+/-11%) and the present (61+/-5%). we interpret this asevidence for little or no change in the field s0 fraction with redshift. wecompare m/l_jeans with m/l_vir inferred from the virial theorem and globallyaveraged quantities and assuming homologous evolution. there is good agreementfor non-rotating (mostly e) galaxies. however, for rotationally supportedgalaxies (mostly s0) m/l_jeans is on average ~40% higher than m/l_vir. wediscuss possible explanations and the implications for the evolution of m/lbetween z=1 and the present and its dependence on mass.

1507.07935	ram pressure stripping of the large magellanic cloud's disk as a probe  of the milky way's circumgalactic medium	recent observations have constrained the orbit and structure of the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), implying a well-constrained pericentric passage aboutthe milky way (mw) ~ 50 myr ago. in this scenario, the lmc's gaseous disk hasrecently experienced maximal ram pressure stripping, suggesting the currentextent of its hi disk directly probes the medium in which it is moving. fromthe observed stellar and hi distributions of the system we find evidence of atruncated gas profile along the windward ``leading edge' of the lmc disk,despite a far more extended stellar component. we explore the implications ofthis ram pressure stripping signature, using both analytic prescriptions andfull 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the lmc. our simulations subjectthe system to a headwind whose velocity components correspond directly to therecent orbital history of the lmc. we vary the density of this headwind, usinga variety of sampled parameters for a beta-profile for a theoretical mwcircumgalactic medium (cgm), comparing the resulting hi morphology directly toobservations of the lmc hi and stellar components. this model can match theradial extent of the lmc's leading (windward) edge only in scenarios where themw cgm density at pericentric passage is n(r = 48.2 +/- 5 kpc) = 1.1(+.44/-.45) x 1e-4 cm^-3. the implied pericentric density proves insensitive toboth the broader cgm structure and temperature profile, thus providing amodel-independent constraint on the local gas density. this result imposes animportant constraint on the density profile of the mw's cgm, and thus the totalbaryon content of the mw. from our work, assuming a beta-profile valid to ~rvir, we infer a total diffuse cgm mass m(300 kpc) = 2.6 +/- 1.4 x 1e10 msun orapproximately 15% of a 1e12 msun mw's baryonic mass budget.

1509.00513	hubble space telescope proper motion (hstpromo) catalogs of galactic  globular clusters. iii. dynamical distances and mass-to-light ratios	we present dynamical distance estimates for 15 galactic globular clusters anduse these to check the consistency of dynamical and photometric distanceestimates. for most of the clusters, this is the first dynamical distanceestimate ever determined. we extract proper-motion dispersion profiles usingcleaned samples of bright stars from the hubble space telescope proper-motioncatalogs recently presented in bellini et al. (2014) and compile a set ofline-of-sight velocity-dispersion profiles from a variety of literaturesources. distances are then estimated by fitting spherical, non-rotating,isotropic, constant mass-to-light (m/l) dynamical models to the proper-motionand line-of-sight dispersion profiles together. we compare our dynamicaldistance estimates with literature photometric estimates from the harris (1996,2010 edition) globular cluster catalog and find that the mean fractionaldifference between the two types is consistent with zero at just $-1.9 \pm 1.7\%$. this indicates that there are no significant biases in either estimationmethod and provides an important validation of the stellar-evolution theorythat underlies photometric distance estimates. the analysis also estimatesdynamical m/l ratios for our clusters; on average, the dynamically-inferred m/lratios agree with existing stellar-population-based m/l ratios that assume achabrier initial mass function (imf) to within $-8.8 \pm 6.4 \%$, implying thatsuch an imf is consistent with our data. our results are also consistent with akroupa imf, but strongly rule out a salpeter imf. we detect no correlationbetween our m/l offsets from literature values and our distance offsets fromliterature values, strongly indicating that our methods are reliable and ourresults are robust.

astro-ph;0107248	the shapes of galaxies and their halos as traced by stars: the milky way  dark halo and the lmc disk	stars and their kinematics provide one of the tools available for studies ofthe shapes of galaxies and their halos. in this review i focus on two specificapplications: the shape of the milky way dark halo and the shape of the lmcdisk. the former is constrained by a variety of observations, but an accuratedetermination of the axial ratio q_dh remains elusive. a very flattened milkyway dark halo with q_dh &lt; 0.4 is ruled out, and values q_dh &gt; 0.7 appear mostconsistent with the data. near-ir surveys have revealed that the lmc disk isnot approximately circular, as long believed, but instead has an axial ratio of0.7 in the disk plane. the elongation is perpendicular to the magellanicstream, indicating that it is most likely due to the tidal force of the milkyway. equilibrium dynamical modeling of galaxies is important for manyapplications. at the same time, detailed studies of tidal effects and tidalstreams have the potential to improve our understanding of both the milky waydark halo and the structure of satellite galaxies such as the lmc.

(2002), assume that all neutron stars are retained duringcluster evolution. this conflicts with predictions of the neutron-starretention rate (typically below 10 per cent) based on pulsar kick velocities.the presence of a single bh therefore continues to be a viable interpretationof the data. the best fit bh mass with the corrected d97 m/l profile is m_bh =1.7^{+2.7}_{-1.7} x 10^3 solar masses, and with a constant m/l it is m_bh =3.2^{+2.2}_{-2.2} x 10^3 solar masses. a model that includes both neutron starescape and mass segregation would probably yield a value between these numbers.this agrees with the correlation between velocity dispersion and bh massinferred for galaxies. however, with the presently available models and data itis neither uniquely implied nor ruled out that m15 has an intermediate-mass bh.

astro-ph;0211074	hubble space telescope imaging of brightest cluster galaxies	we used the hst wfpc2 to obtain i-band images of the centers of 81 brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs), drawn from a volume-limited sample of nearby bcgs. theimages show a rich variety of morphological features, including multiple ordouble nuclei, dust, stellar disks, point source nuclei, and central surfacebrightness depressions. high resolution surface brightness profiles could beinferred for 60 galaxies. of those, 88% have well-resolved cores. twelvepercent of the bcg sample lacks a well-resolved core; all but one of these bcgshave ``power-law'' profiles. some of these galaxies have higher luminositiesthan any power-law galaxy identified by faber et al. (1997), and have physicalupper limits on the break radius well below the values observed for coregalaxies of the same luminosity. these results support the idea that thecentral structure of early-type galaxies is bimodal in its physical properties,but also suggest that there exist high luminosity galaxies with power-lawprofiles (or unusually small cores). the bcgs in the latter category tend tofall at the low end of the bcg luminosity function and tend to have low valuesof the quantity alpha (the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity as afunction of radius, at 10 kpc). since theoretical calculations have shown thatthe luminosities and alpha values of bcgs grow with time as a result ofaccretion, this suggests a scenario in which elliptical galaxies evolve frompower-law profiles to core profiles through accretion and merging. this isconsistent with theoretical scenarios that invoke the formation of massiveblack hole binaries during merger events (abridged).

astro-ph;0212078	searching for bulges at the end of the hubble sequence	we investigate the stellar disk properties of a sample of 19 nearby spiralgalaxies with low inclination and late hubble type (scd or later). we combineour high-resolution hst i-band observations with existing ground-based opticalimages to obtain surface brightness profiles that cover a high dynamic range ofgalactic radius. most of these galaxies contain a nuclear star cluster, asdiscussed in a separate paper. the main goal of the present work is toconstrain the properties of stellar bulges at these extremely late hubbletypes. we find that the surface brightness profiles of the latest-type spiralsare complex, with a wide range in shapes. we have sorted our sample in asequence, starting with ``pure'' disk galaxies (approximately 30% of thesample). these galaxies have exponential stellar disks that extend inwards towithin a few tens of pc from the nucleus, where the light from the nuclearcluster starts to dominate. they appear to be truly bulge-less systems.progressing along the sequence, the galaxies show increasingly prominentdeviations from a simple exponential disk model on kpc scales. traditionally,such deviations have prompted ``bulge-disk'' decompositions. indeed, thesurface brightness profiles of these galaxies are generally well fit by addinga second (exponential) bulge component. however, we find that most surfacebrightness profiles can be fit equally well (or better) with a singlesersic-type r^{1/n} profile over the entire radial range of the galaxy, withoutrequiring a separate ``bulge'' component. we warn in a general sense againstidentification of bulges solely on the basis of single-band surface brightnessprofiles.

astro-ph;0308489	observational constraints on disk heating as a function of hubble type	current understanding of the secular evolution of galactic disks suggeststhat this process is dominated by two or more heating mechanisms, whichincrease the random motions of stars in the disk. in particular, thegravitational influence of giant molecular clouds and irregularities in thespiral potential have been proposed to explain the observed velocitydispersions in the solar neighborhood. each of these mechanisms acts ondifferent components of the stellar velocities, which affects the ratio of thevertical and radial components of the stellar velocity dispersion since therelative strengths of giant molecular clouds and spiral irregularities varywith hubble type. a study of this ratio as function of hubble type has thepotential to provide strong constraints on disk heating mechanisms. we presentmajor and minor axis stellar kinematics for four spiral galaxies of hubble typefrom sa to sbc, and use the data to infer the ratios sigma_z/sigma_r in thegalaxy disks. the results combined with two galaxies studied previously andwith milky way data show that the ratio is generally in the range 0.5 - 0.8.there is a marginally significant trend of decreasing ratio with advancinghubble type, consistent with the predictions of disk heating theories. however,the errors on individual measurements are large, and the absence of any trendis consistent with the data at the 1-sigma level. as a byproduct of our study,we find that three of the four galaxies in our sample have a central drop intheir stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion, a phenomenon that isincreasingly observed in spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0309377	hubble space telescope/wfpc2 investigation of the nuclear morphology in  the toomre sequence of merging galaxies	we report on the properties of nuclear regions in the toomre sequence ofmerging galaxies, based on imaging data gathered with the hubble spacetelescope wfpc2 camera. we have imaged the 11 systems in the proposedevolutionary merger sequence in the f555w and f814w broad-band filters, and inh-alpha+[nii] narrow-band filters. the broad-band morphology of the nuclearregions varies from non-nucleated starburst clumps through dust-covered nucleito a nucleated morphology. there is no unambiguous trend in the morphology withmerger stage. the emission-line morphology is extended beyond the nucleus inmost cases, but centrally concentrated (within 1 kpc) emission-line gas can beseen in the four latest-stage merger systems. we have quantified the intrinsicluminosity densities and colors within the inner 100 pc and 1 kpc of eachidentified nucleus. we find little evidence for a clear trend in nuclearproperties along the merger sequence, other than a suggestive rise in thenuclear luminosity density in the most evolved members of the sequence. thelack of clear trends in nuclear properties is likely due both to the effects ofobscuration and geometry, as well as the physical variety of galaxies includedin the toomre sequence.

astro-ph;0310029	hubble space telescope observations of ngc 6240: a case study of an  ultra-luminous infrared galaxy with obscured activity	we present results from an hst study of the morphology and kinematics of ngc6240. this merging galaxy with a double nucleus is one of the nearest andbest-studied ultraluminous infrared galaxies. hst resolves both nuclei intoseperate components. the distance between the northern and southernoptical/near-infrared components is greater than that observed in radio andx-ray studies, arguing that even in k-band we may not be seeing all the waythrough the dust to the true nuclei. the ionized gas does not display rotationaround either of the nuclei, or equilibrium motion in general. there is astrong velocity gradient between the nuclei, similar to what is seen in codata. there is no such gradient in our stellar kinematics. the velocitydispersion of the gas is larger than expected for a cold disk. we also map andmodel the emission-line velocity field at an off-nuclear position where a steepvelocity gradient was previously detected in ground-based data. overall, thedata indicate that line-of-sight projection effects, dust absorption,non-equilibrium merger dynamics, and the possible influence of a wind may beplaying an important role in the observed kinematics. chandra observations ofhard x-rays have shown that both of the nuclei contain an active galacticnucleus (agn). the hst data show no clear sign of the two agns: neithercontinuum nor narrow-band imaging shows evidence for unresolved components inthe nuclei, and there are no increased emission line widths or rapid rotationnear the nuclei. this underscores the importance of x-ray data for identifyingagns in highly dust-enshrouded environments.

astro-ph;0604138	stellar populations in the nuclei of late-type spiral galaxies	(abridged) as part of an ongoing effort to study the stellar nuclei of verylate-type, bulge-less spirals, we present results from a high-resolutionspectroscopic survey of nine such nuclear star clusters, undertaken withvlt/uves. we fit the spectra with population synthesis models and measurelick-type indices to determine mean luminosity-weighted ages, which range from4.1*10^7 to 1.1*10^10 years and are insensitive to assumed metallicity orinternal extinction. the average metallicity of nuclear clusters in late-typespirals is slightly sub-solar (&lt;z&gt; = 0.015) but shows significant scatter. thefits also show that the nuclear cluster spectra are best described by a mix ofseveral generations of stars. this is supported by the fact that only modelswith composite stellar populations yield mass-to-light ratios that match thoseobtained from dynamical measurements. the last star formation episode was onaverage 34 myr ago, while all clusters experienced some star formation in thelast 100 myr. we thus conclude that the nuclear clusters undergo repeatedepisodes of star formation. the robustness with respect to possiblecontamination from the underlying galaxy disk is demonstrated by comparison tospectra obtained with hst/stis. combining these results with those from walcheret al. (2005), we have thus shown that the stellar nuclei of these bulge-lessgalaxies are massive and dense star clusters that form stars recurrently untilthe present day. this unique set of properties is likely due to the centrallocation of these clusters in their host galaxies.

astro-ph;0604140	hst/stis spectra of nuclear star clusters in spiral galaxies: dependence  of age and mass on hubble type	(abridged) we study the nuclear star clusters in spiral galaxies of varioushubble types using spectra obtained with stis on-board hst. we observed thenuclear clusters in 40 galaxies, selected from two previous hst/wfpc2 imagingsurveys. the spectra provide a better separation of cluster light fromunderlying galaxy light than is possible with ground-based spectra. to inferthe star formation history, metallicity and dust extinction, we fit weightedsuperpositions of single-age stellar population templates to the spectra. theluminosity-weighted age ranges from 10 myrs to 10 gyrs. the stellar populationsof ncs are generally best fit as a mixture of populations of different ages.this indicates that ncs did not form in a single event, but instead they hadadditional star formation long after the oldest stars formed. on average, thesample clusters in late-type spirals have a younger luminosity-weighted meanage than those in early-type spirals (log(age/yr) = 8.37+/-0.25 vs.9.23+/-0.21). the average cluster masses are smaller in late-type spirals thanin early-type spirals (log(m/msun) = 6.25+/-0.21 vs. 7.63+/-0.24), and exceedthe masses typical of globular clusters. the cluster mass correlates stronglywith both the hubble type of the host galaxy and the luminosity of its bulge.the latter correlation has the same slope as the well-known correlation betweensupermassive black hole mass and bulge luminosity. the properties of bothnuclear clusters and black holes are therefore intimately connected to theproperties of the host galaxy.

0809.4263	new analysis of the proper motions of the magellanic clouds using  hst/wfpc2	in hst cycles 11 and 13 we obtained two epochs of acs/hrc data for fields inthe magellanic clouds centered on background quasars. we used these data todetermine the proper motions of the lmc and smc to better than 5% and 15%respectively. the results had a number of unexpected implications for the milkyway-lmc-smc system. the implied three-dimensional velocities were larger thanpreviously believed and close to the escape velocity in a standard 10^12 solarmass milky way dark halo, implying that the clouds may be on their firstpassage. also, the relative velocity between the lmc and smc was larger thanexpected, leaving open the possibility that the clouds may not be bound to eachother. to further verify and refine our results we requested an additionalepoch of data in cycle 16 which is being executed with wfpc2/pc due to thefailure of acs. we present the results of an ongoing analysis of these wfpc2data which indicate good consistency with the two-epoch results.

0809.4265	the binarity of the magellanic clouds and the formation of the  magellanic stream	the hst proper motion (pm) measurements of the clouds have severeimplications for their interaction history with the milky way (mw) and witheach other. the clouds are likely on their first passage about the mw and thesmc's orbit about the lmc is better described as quasi-periodic rather thancircular. binary l/smc orbits that satisfy observational constraints on theirmutual interaction history (e.g. the formation of the magellanic bridge duringa collision between the clouds ~300 myr ago) can be located within 1 sigma ofthe mean pms. however, these binary orbits are not co-located with themagellanic stream (ms) when projected on the plane of the sky and theline-of-sight velocity gradient along the lmc's orbit is significantly steeperthan that along the ms. these combined results ultimately rule out a purelytidal origin for the ms: tides are ineffective without multiple pericentricpassages and can neither decrease the velocity gradient nor explain the offsetstream in a polar orbit configuration. alternatively, ram pressure stripping ofan extended gaseous disk may naturally explain the deviation. the offset alsosuggests that observations of the little-explored region between ra 21h and 23hare crucial for characterizing the full extent of the ms.

0809.4268	kinematical structure of the magellanic system	we review our understanding of the kinematics of the lmc and the smc, andtheir orbit around the milky way. the line-of-sight velocity fields of both thelmc and smc have been mapped with high accuracy using thousands of discretetraces, as well as hi gas. the lmc is a rotating disk for which the viewingangles have been well-established using various methods. the disk is ellipticalin its disk plane. the disk thickness varies depending on the tracerpopulation, with v/sigma ranging from 2-10 from the oldest to the youngestpopulation. for the smc, the old stellar population resides in a spheroidaldistribution with considerable line-of-sight depth and low v/sigma. young starsand hi gas reside in a more irregular rotating disk. mass estimates based onthe kinematics indicate that each cloud is embedded in a dark halo. propermotion measurements with hst show that both galaxies move significantly morerapidly around the milky way than previously believed. this indicates that fora canonical 10^12 solar mass milky way the clouds are only passing by us forthe first time. although a higher milky way mass yields a bound orbit, thisorbit is still very different from what has been previously assumed in modelsof the magellanic stream. hence, much of our understanding of the history ofthe magellanic system and the formation of the magellanic stream may need to berevised. the accuracy of the proper motion data is insufficient to say whetheror not the lmc and smc are bound to each other, but bound orbits do existwithin the proper motion error ellipse.
