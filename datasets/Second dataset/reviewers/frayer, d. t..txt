0901.1543	the 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 star formation history of the universe as viewed in  the far-infrared	[abridged] we use the deepest existing mid- and far-infrared observations(reaching ~3 mjy at 70 um) obtained with spitzer in the goods and fidel fieldsto derive the evolution of the rest-frame 15 um, 35 um, and total infraredluminosity functions of galaxies spanning z &lt; 1.3. in comparison with previousstudies, the present one takes advantage of deep 70 um observations thatprovide a more robust infrared luminosity indicator than 24 um affected by theemission of pahs at high redshift (z~1), and we use several independent fieldsto control cosmic variance. we use a new extraction technique based on thewell-determined positions of galaxies at shorter wavelengths to extract the 24and 70 um flux densities of galaxies. using a combination of photometric andspectroscopic redshifts that exist for ~80% of the sources in our sample, weare able to estimate the rest-frame luminosities of galaxies at 15um and 35um.then using a careful stacking analysis to validate the infrared bolometriccorrections we compute the infrared luminosity function in three redshift binsz~0.55, z~0.85, and z~1.15. we find that the average infrared spectral energydistribution of galaxies over the last 2/3 of the cosmic time is consistentwith that of local galaxies, although individual sources do present significantscatter. we also measured both the bright and faint ends of the infraredluminosity functions and find no evidence for a change in the slope of thedouble power law used to characterize the luminosity function. the redshiftevolution of infrared luminous galaxies is consistent with pure luminosityevolution proportional to (1+z)^3.6 up to z~1.3. the comoving number density ofinfrared luminous galaxies has increased by a factor of ~100 between 0&lt; z &lt;1.by z~1.0, lirgs produce half of the total comoving infrared luminosity density.

0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0707.2103	absolute calibration and characterization of the multiband imaging  photometer for spitzer. iii. an asteroid-based calibration of mips at 160  microns	we describe the absolute calibration of the multiband imaging photometer forspitzer (mips) 160 micron channel. after the on-orbit discovery of a near-irghost image that dominates the signal for sources hotter than about 2000 k, weadopted a strategy utilizing asteroids to transfer the absolute calibrations ofthe mips 24 and 70 micron channels to the 160 micron channel. near-simultaneousobservations at all three wavelengths are taken, and photometry at the twoshorter wavelengths is fit using the standard thermal model. the 160 micronflux density is predicted from those fits and compared with the observed 160micron signal to derive the conversion from instrumental units to surfacebrightness. the calibration factor we derive is 41.7 mjy/sr/mips160 (mips160being the instrumental units). the scatter in the individual measurements ofthe calibration factor, as well as an assesment of the external uncertaintiesinherent in the calibration, lead us to adopt an uncertainty of 5.0mjy/sr/mips160 (12%) for the absolute uncertainty on the 160 micron fluxdensity of a particular source as determined from a single measurement. forsources brighter than about 2 jy, non-linearity in the response of the 160micron detectors produces an under-estimate of the flux density: for objects asbright as 4 jy, measured flux densities are likely to be ~20% too low. thiscalibration has been checked against that of iso (using ulirgs) and iras (usingiras-derived diameters), and is consistent with those at the 5% level.

0911.4515	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field i: spectral energy distributions and luminosities	we present a large robust sample of 1503 reliable and unconfused 70micromselected sources from the multiwavelength data set of the cosmic evolutionsurvey (cosmos). using the spitzer irac and mips photometry, we estimate thetotal infrared luminosity, l_ir (8--1000 microns), by finding the best fittemplate from several different template libraries. the long wavelength 70 and160 micron data allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of l_ir, accurate towithin 0.2 and 0.05 dex, respectively. the 70 micron data point enables asignificant improvement over the luminosity estimates possible with only a 24micron detection. the full sample spans a wide range in l_ir, l_ir ~ 10^8-10^14l_sun, with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. we identify a total of 687luminous, 303 ultraluminous, and 31 hyperluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,ulirgs, and hylirgs) over the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt;3.5 with a median redshiftof 0.5. presented here are the full spectral energy distributions for each ofthe sources compiled from the extensive multiwavelength data set from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (fir). using sed fits we find possibleevidence for a subset of cooler ultraluminous objects than observed locally.however, until direct observations at longer wavelengths are obtained, the peakof emission and the dust temperature cannot be well constrained. we use theseseds, along with the deep radio and x-ray coverage of the field, to identify alarge sample of candidate active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that thefraction of agn increases strongly with l_ir, as it does in the local universe,and that nearly 70% of ulirgs and all hylirgs likely host a powerful agn.

1001.1354	the vla-cosmos perspective on the ir-radio relation. i. new constraints  on selection biases and the non-evolution of the ir/radio properties of star  forming and agn galaxies at intermediate and high redshift	vla 1.4 ghz (rms noise ~0.012 mjy) and mips 24 and 70 micron (rms noise ~0.02and ~1.7 mjy, respectively) observations covering the 2 square degree cosmosfield are combined with an extensive multi-wavelength data set to study theevolution of the ir-radio relation at intermediate and high redshift. with~4500 sources -- of which ~30% have spectroscopic redshifts -- the currentsample is significantly larger than previous ones used for the same purpose.both monochromatic ir/radio flux ratios (q24 &amp; q70), as well as the ratio ofthe total ir and the 1.4 ghz luminosity (qtir) are used as indicators for their/radio properties of star forming galaxies and agn.  using a sample jointly selected at ir and radio wavelengths in order toreduce selection biases, we provide firm support for previous findings that their-radio relation remains unchanged out to at least z~1.4. moreover, based ondata from ~150 objects we also find that the local relation likely still holdsat 2.5&lt;z&lt;5. at redshift z&lt;1.4 we observe that radio-quiet agn populate thelocus of the ir-radio relation in similar numbers as star forming sources. inour analysis we employ the methods of survival analysis in order to ensure astatistically sound treatment of flux limits arising from non-detections. wedetermine the observed shift in average ir/radio properties of ir- and radio-selected populations and show that it can reconcile apparently discrepantmeasurements presented in the literature. finally, we also investigatevariations of the ir/radio ratio with ir and radio luminosity and find that ithardly varies with ir luminosity but is a decreasing function of radioluminosity.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1006.2873	ultra-deep spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of lirgs and ulirgs at z ~  1-2	we present ultra-deep mid-ir spectra of 48 infrared-luminous galaxies in thegoods-south field obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on the spitzerspace telescope. these galaxies are selected among faint infrared sources (0.14- 0.5 mjy at 24 um) in two redshift bins (0.76-1.05 and 1.75-2.4) to sample themajor contributors to the cosmic infrared background at the most active epochs.we estimate redshifts for 92% of the sample using pah and si absorptionfeatures. only few of these galaxies (5% at z~1 and 12% at z~2) have theirtotal infrared luminosity dominated by emission from agn. the averaged mid-irspectra of the z~1 lirgs and of the z~2 ulirgs are very similar to the averagedspectrum of local starbursts and hii-like ulirgs, respectively. we find that6.2um pah equivalent widths reach a plateau of ~1 um for l(24 mu) &lt; 1e11l(sun). at higher luminosities, ew (6.2 mu) anti-correlates with l(24 um).intriguingly, high-z ulirgs and smg lie above the local ew (6.2 um) - l(24 um)relationship suggesting that, at a given luminosity, high-z ulirgs have agncontributions to their dust emission lower than those of local counterparts. aquantitative analysis of their morphology shows that most of the luminous irgalaxies have morphologies similar to those of ir-quiet galaxies at the sameredshift. all z~2 ulirgs of our sample are ir-excess bzk galaxies and most ofthem have l(fir)/l(1600a) ratios higher than those of starburst galaxies at agiven uv slope. the ``ir excess'' (daddi et al. 2007) is mostly due to strong7.7 um pah emission and under-estimation of uv dust extinction. on the basis ofthe agn-powered l (6 um) continuum measured directly from the mid-ir spectra,we estimate an average intrinsic x-ray agn luminosity of l(2-10 kev) = (0.1 +/-0.6) 1e43 erg/s, a value substantially lower than the prediction by daddi etal.

1006.4956	a multiwavelength study of a sample of 70 micron selected galaxies in  the cosmos field ii: the role of mergers in galaxy evolution	we analyze the morphological properties of a large sample of 1503 70 micronselected galaxies in the cosmos field spanning the redshift range 0.01&lt;z&lt; 3.5with a median redshift of 0.5 and an infrared luminosity range of10^8&lt;l_ir&lt;10^14l_sun with a median luminosity of 10^11.4 l_sun. in generalthese galaxies are massive, with a stellar mass range of 10^10-10^12 m_sun, andluminous, with -25&lt;m_k&lt;-20. we find a strong correlation between the fractionof major mergers and l_ir, with the fraction at the highest luminosity being upto 50%. we also find that the fraction of spirals drops dramatically with l_ir.minor mergers likely play a role in boosting the infrared luminosity forsources with low luminosities. the precise fraction of mergers in any givenl_ir bin varies by redshift due to sources at z&gt;1 being difficult to classifyand subject to the effects of band pass shifting, therefore, these numbers canonly be considered lower limits. at z&lt;1, where the morphologicalclassifications are most robust, major mergers clearly dominate the ulirgpopulation (50-80%) and are important for the lirg population (25-40%). at z&gt;1the fraction of major mergers is at least 30-40% for ulirgs. although thegeneral morphological trends agree with what has been observed for local(u)lirgs, the fraction of major mergers is slightly lower than seen locally.this is in part due to the difficulty of identifying merger signatures at highredshift. we argue that given the number of major gas-rich mergers observed andthe relatively short timescale that they would be observable in the (u)lirgphase that it is plausible for the observed red sequence of massive ellipticals(&lt;10^12 m_sun) to have been formed entirely by gas-rich major mergers.

1101.2467	evolution of the dusty infrared luminosity function from z=0 to z=2.3  using observations from spitzer	we derive the evolution of the infrared (ir) luminosity function (lf) overthe last 4/5ths of cosmic time, using deep 24um and 70um imaging of the goodsnorth and south fields. we use an extraction technique based on prior sourcepositions at shorter wavelengths to build the 24 and 70um source catalogs. themajority (93%) of the sources have a spectroscopic (39%) or a photometricredshift (54%) and, in our redshift range of interest (i.e., 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.3) ~20% ofthe sources have a spectroscopic redshifts. to extend our study to lower 70umluminosities we perform a stacking analysis and we characterize the observedl_24/(1+z) vs l_70/(1+z) correlation. using spectral energy distributiontemplates which best fit this correlation, we derive the ir luminosity ofsources from their 24 and 70 um fluxes. we then compute the ir lf atz=1.55+/-0.25 and z=2.05+/-0.25. the redshift evolution of the ir lf from z=1.3to z=2.3 is consistent with a luminosity evolution proportional to(1+z)^1.0+/-0.9 combined with a density evolution proportional to(1+z)^-1.1+/-1.5. at z~2, luminous ir galaxies (lirgs: 10^11lsun&lt; lir&lt;10^12lsun) are still the main contributors to the total comoving ir luminositydensity (ir ld) of the universe. at z~2, lirgs and ultra-luminous ir galaxies(ulirgs: 10^12lsun&lt; lir) account for ~49% and ~17% respectively of the total irld of the universe. combined with previous results for galaxies at z&lt;1.3 andassuming a constant conversion between the ir luminosity and star-formationrate (sfr) of a galaxy, we study the evolution of the sfr density of theuniverse from z=0 to z=2.3. we find that the sfr density of the universestrongly increased with redshift from z=0 to z=1.3, but is nearly constant athigher redshift out to z=2.3. as part of the online material accompanying thisarticle, we present source catalogs at 24um and 70um for both the goods-northand -south fields.

1102.3920	an accounting of the dust-obscured star formation and accretion  histories over the last ~11~billion years	(abridged) we report on an accounting of the star formation and accretiondriven energetics of 24um detected sources in goods north. for sources havinginfrared (ir; 8-1000um) luminosities &gt;3x10^12 l_sun when derived by fittinglocal seds to 24um photometry alone, we find these ir luminosity estimates tobe a factor of ~4 times larger than those estimated when the sed fittingincludes additional 16 and 70um data (and in some cases mid-infraredspectroscopy and 850um data). this discrepancy arises from the fact that highluminosity sources at z&gt;&gt;0 appear to have far- to mid-infrared ratios, as wellas aromatic feature equivalent widths, typical of lower luminosity galaxies inthe local universe. using our improved estimates for ir luminosity and agncontributions, we investigate the evolution of the ir luminosity density versusredshift arising from star formation and agn processes alone. we find that,within the uncertainties, the total star formation driven ir luminosity densityis constant between 1.15 &lt; z &lt; 2.35, although our results suggest a slightlylarger value at z&gt;2. agn appear to account for &lt;18% of the total ir luminositydensity integrated between 0&lt; z &lt; 2.35, contributing &lt;25% at each epoch. lirgappear to dominate the star formation rate (sfr) density along with normalstar-forming galaxies (l_ir &lt; 10^11 l_sun) between 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.15. once beyondz &gt;2, the contribution from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ulirgs becomescomparable with that of lirgs. using our improved ir luminosity estimates, wefind existing calibrations for uv extinction corrections based on measurementsof the uv spectral slope typically overcorrect uv luminosities by a factor of~2, on average, for our sample of 24um-selected sources; accordingly we havederived a new uv extinction correction more appropriate for our sample.

astro-ph;0405604	obscured and unobscured active galactic nuclei in the spitzer space  telescope first look survey	selection of active galactic nuclei (agn) in the infrared allows thediscovery of agn whose optical emission is extinguished by dust. in this paper,we use the spitzer space telescope first look survey (fls) to assess whatfraction of agn with mid-infrared luminosities comparable to quasars are missedin optical quasar surveys due to dust obscuration. we begin by using the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) database to identify 54 quasars within the 4 deg^2extragalactic fls. these quasars occupy a distinct region in mid-infrared colorspace by virtue of their strong, red, continua. this has allowed us to define amid-infrared color criterion for selecting agn candidates. about 2000 flsobjects have colors consistent with them being agn, but most are much fainterin the mid-infrared than the sdss quasars, which typically have 8 micron fluxdensities, s(8.0), ~1 mjy. we have investigated the properties of the 43objects with s(8.0) &gt;= 1 mjy satisfying our agn color selection. this sampleshould contain both unobscured quasars, and agn which are absent from the sdsssurvey due to extinction in the optical. after removing 16 known quasars, threeprobable normal quasars, and eight spurious or confused objects from theinitial sample of 43, we are left with 16 objects which are likely to beobscured quasars or luminous seyfert-2 galaxies. this suggests the numbers ofobscured and unobscured agn are similar in samples selected in the mid-infraredat s(8.0)~1 mjy.

(2) 2% of the sample(85/sq.degrees) have colors similar to dust reddened agns, like mrk231 atz~0.6-3. (3) we anticipate that some of these sources with extremely red colorsmay be new types of sources, since they can not be modelled with any familiartype of spectral energy distribution. we find that 17% of the 24um sources haveno detectable optical counterparts brighter than r limit of 25.5mag. opticalspectroscopy of these optical extremely faint 24um sources would be verydifficult, and mid-infrared spectroscopy from the spitzer would be critical forunderstanding their physical nature (abridged).

astro-ph;0406148	identification of luminous infrared galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2.5	we present preliminary results on 24micron detections of luminous infraredgalaxies at z&gt;1 with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips).observations were performed in the lockman hole and the extended groth strip(egs), and were supplemented by data obtained with the infrared array camera(irac) between 3 and 9microns. the positional accuracy of ~2arcsec for mostmips/irac detections provides unambiguous identifications of their opticalcounterparts. using spectroscopic redshifts from the deep extragalacticevolutionary probe survey, we identify 24micron sources at z&gt;1 in the egs,while the combination of the mips/irac observations with $bvrijhk$ ancillarydata in the lockman hole also shows very clear cases of galaxies withphotometric redshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;2.5.  the observed 24micron fluxes indicate infrared luminosities greater than10^11 l_sol, while the data at shorter wavelengths reveal rather red andprobably massive (m&gt;=m*) galaxy counterparts. it is the first time that thispopulation of luminous objects is detected up to z~2.5 in the infrared. ourwork demonstrates the ability of the mips instrument to probe the dustyuniverse at very high redshift, and illustrates how the forthcoming spitzerdeep surveys will offer a unique opportunity to illuminate a dark side ofcosmic history not explored by previous infrared experiments.

astro-ph;0406158	spitzer observations of mambo galaxies: weeding out active nuclei in  starbursting proto-ellipticals	we present spitzer observations in five wavebands between 3.6 and 24um of anunbiased sample of 9 luminous, dusty galaxies selected at 1200um by the mambocamera on the iram 30-m telescope, a population akin to the well-known submm or`scuba' galaxies (hereafter smgs). owing to the coarse resolution of submm/mminstrumentation, smgs have traditionally been difficult to identify at otherwavelengths. we compare our multi-wavelength catalogs to show that the overlapbetween 24 and 1200um must be close to complete at these flux levels. we findthat all (4/4) of the most secure &gt;=4sigma smgs have robust &gt;=4sigmacounterparts at 1.4ghz, while the fraction drops to 7/9 using all &gt;=3sigmasmgs. we show that combining mid-ir and marginal (&gt;=3sigma) radio detectionsprovides plausible identifications in the remaining cases, enabling us toidentify the complete sample. accretion onto an obscured central engine isbetrayed by the shape of the mid-ir continuum emission for several sources,confirming spitzer's potential to weed out active galaxies. we demonstrate thepower of a s(24um)/s(8um) vs s(8um)/s(4.5um) color-color plot as a diagnosticfor this purpose. however, we conclude that the majority (~75%) of smgs haverest-frame mid-/far-ir seds commensurate with obscured starbursts. sensitive24-um observations are clearly a useful route to identify and characterizereliable counterparts to high-redshift far-ir-bright galaxies, complementingwhat is possible via deep radio imaging.

astro-ph;0502079	reduction algorithms for the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer	we describe the data reduction algorithms for the multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) instrument. these algorithms were based onextensive preflight testing and modeling of the si:as (24 micron) and ge:ga (70and 160 micron) arrays in mips and have been refined based on initial flightdata. the behaviors we describe are typical of state-of-the-art infrared focalplanes operated in the low backgrounds of space. the ge arrays are bulkphotoconductors and therefore show a variety of artifacts that must be removedto calibrate the data. the si array, while better behaved than the ge arrays,does show a handful of artifacts that also must be removed to calibrate thedata. the data reduction to remove these effects is divided into three parts.the first part converts the non-destructively read data ramps into slopes whileremoving artifacts with time constants of the order of the exposure time. thesecond part calibrates the slope measurements while removing artifacts withtime constants longer than the exposure time. the third part uses theredundancy inherit in the mips observing modes to improve the artifact removaliteratively. for each of these steps, we illustrate the relevant laboratoryexperiments or theoretical arguments along with the mathematical approachestaken to calibrate the data. finally, we describe how these preflightalgorithms have performed on actual flight data.

astro-ph;0504604	molecular gas and nuclear activity in radio galaxies detected by iras	this paper reports the latest results from a millimeter-wave (co)spectroscopic survey of iras-detected radio galaxies with l_1.4ghz ~ 10^23-28w/hz in the redshift range z ~ 0.02-0.15. the iras flux-limited sample contains33 radio galaxies with different radio morphologies and a broad range ofinfrared luminosities l_ir = 10^9-12 l_sun), allowing for an investigation of(a) whether low-z radio-selected agn reside in molecular gas-rich host galaxes,and (b) whether the co properties are correlated with the properties of thehost galaxy or the agn. all of the radio galaxies in mazzarella et al. (1993)and mirabel et al. (1989) have been reobserved. three new co detections havebeen made, raising the total number of co detections to nine and setting thesurvey detection rate at ~ 25%. many of the co lines have double-peakedprofiles, and the co line widths are broad (average delta v_fwhm ~ 500+/-130km/s), exceeding the average co widths of both ultraluminous infrared galaxies(300+/-90 km/s) and palomar-green qsos (260+/-160 km/s), and thus beingindicative of massive host galaxies. the co luminosities translate intomolecular gas masses of ~ 0.4-7x10^9 m_sun, however, the 3-sigma co upperlimits for nondetections do not rule out a molecular gas mass as high as thatof the milky way (~ 3x10^9 m_sun). optical images of eight out of ninemolecular gas-rich radio galaxies show evidence of close companions and/ortidal features. finally, there is no obvious correlation between radio powerand molecular gas mass. however, it is notable that only one f-r ii galaxy outof 12 is detected in this co survey; the remaining detections are of galaxieshosting f-r i and compact radio jets.

astro-ph;0509894	star formation rates and extinction properties of ir-luminous galaxies  in the spitzer first look survey	we investigate the instantaneous star formation rates (sfr) and extinctionproperties for a large (n=274), near-infrared (2.2 micron) + mid-infrared (24micron) selected sample of normal to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs)[10^9&lt;l_{ir}/l_{sun}&lt;10^12.5] with &lt;z&gt;~0.8 in the spitzer extragalactic firstlook survey. we combine spitzer mips 24-micron observations withhigh-resolution, optical keck deimos spectroscopy to derive opticalemission-line and infrared star formation rates (sfr_{opt} &amp; sfr_{ir},respectively). direct comparison of these sfr diagnostics reveals that oursample exhibits a wide range of extinction (1.0&lt;av&lt;4.0 mag). this is afterremoving spectroscopic and irac color-selected agn candidates that account for12% of the sample. objects with sfrs of a few solar masses per year have avvalues consistent with those of normal spirals (av~1.0 mag). by contrast, lirgsat z&gt;1, which make up a large fraction of our sample, have sfr~100 m_{sun}/yrand &lt;av&gt;~2.5 mag. this translates to a 97% mean attenuation of the [oii]forbidden line doublet, with the most extreme sources having as much as 99.7%of their [oii] line flux extinguished by dust. based on a sfr_{ir}/sfr_{opt}diagnostic, we derive an ir-luminosity-dependent av^{ir} function[av^{ir}=0.75*log(l_{ir}/l_{sun})-6.35 mag] that we use to extinction correctour emission line luminosities. application of this correction results in acorrelation between sfr_{ir} and sfr_{opt} that has a dispersion of 0.2 dex.investigation of the av dependence on redshift reveals that for a fixed l_{ir},there is no significant av evolution. the mean attenuation of our sample isintermediate between that of local optical/uv- and radio-selected samples andhas a marginally stronger l_{ir} dependence.
