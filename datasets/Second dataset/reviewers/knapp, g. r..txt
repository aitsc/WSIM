0907.0258	automated determination of [fe/h] and [c/fe] from low-resolution  spectroscopy	we develop an automated spectral synthesis technique for the estimation ofmetallicities ([fe/h]) and carbon abundances ([c/fe]) for metal-poor stars,including carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, for which other methods may proveinsufficient. this technique, automoog, is designed to operate on relativelystrong features visible in even low- to medium-resolution spectra, yieldingresults comparable to much more telescope-intensive high-resolution studies. wevalidate this method by comparison with 913 stars which have existinghigh-resolution and low- to medium-resolution to medium-resolution spectra, andthat cover a wide range of stellar parameters. we find that at lowmetallicities ([fe/h] &lt; -2.0), we successfully recover both the metallicity andcarbon abundance, where possible, with an accuracy of ~ 0.20 dex. at highermetallicities, due to issues of continuum placement in spectral normalizationdone prior to the running of automoog, a general underestimate of the overallmetallicity of a star is seen, although the carbon abundance is stillsuccessfully recovered. as a result, this method is only recommended for use onsamples of stars of known sufficiently low metallicity. for theselow-metallicity stars, however, automoog performs much more consistently andquickly than similar, existing techniques, which should allow for analyses oflarge samples of metal-poor stars in the near future. steps to improve andcorrect the continuum placement difficulties are being pursued.

0911.2712	chromospheric variability in sdss m dwarfs. ii. short-timescale h-alpha  variability	[abridged] we present the first comprehensive study of short-timescalechromospheric h-alpha variability in m dwarfs using the individual 15 minspectroscopic exposures for 52,392 objects from the sloan digital sky survey.our sample contains about 10^3-10^4 objects per spectral type bin in the rangem0-m9, with a total of about 206,000 spectra and a typical number of 3exposures per object (ranging up to a maximum of 30 exposures). using thisextensive data set we find that about 16% of the sources exhibit h-alphaemission in at least one exposure, and of those about 45% exhibit h-alphaemission in all of the available exposures. within the sample of objects withh-alpha emission, only 26% are consistent with non-variable emission,independent of spectral type. the h-alpha variability, quantified in terms ofthe ratio of maximum to minimum h-alpha equivalent width (r_ew), and the ratioof the standard deviation to the mean (sigma_ew/&lt;ew&gt;), exhibits a rapid risefrom m0 to m5, followed by a plateau and a possible decline in m9 objects. inparticular, r_ew increases from a median value of about 1.8 for m0-m3 to about2.5 for m7-m9, and variability with r_ew&gt;10 is only observed in objects laterthan m5. for the combined sample we find that the r_ew values follow anexponential distribution with n(r_ew) exp[-(r_ew-1)/2]; for m5-m9 objects thecharacteristic scale is r_ew-1\approx 2.7, indicative of stronger variability.in addition, we find that objects with persistent h-alpha emission exhibitsmaller values of r_ew than those with intermittent h-alpha emission. based onthese results we conclude that h-alpha variability in m dwarfs on timescales of15 min to 1 hr increases with later spectral type, and that the variability islarger for intermittent sources.

1005.5162	imaging of a transitional disk gap in reflected light: indications of  planet formation around the young solar analog lkca 15	we present h- and ks-band imaging data resolving the gap in the transitionaldisk around lkca 15, revealing the surrounding nebulosity. we detect sharpelliptical contours delimiting the nebulosity on the inside as well as theoutside, consistent with the shape, size, ellipticity, and orientation ofstarlight reflected from the far-side disk wall, whereas the near-side wall isshielded from view by the disk's optically thick bulk. we note thatforward-scattering of starlight on the near-side disk surface could provide analternate interpretation of the nebulosity. in either case, this discoveryprovides confirmation of the disk geometry that has been proposed to explainthe spectral energy distributions (sed) of such systems, comprising anoptically thick outer disk with an inner truncation radius of ~46 au enclosinga largely evacuated gap. our data show an offset of the nebulosity contoursalong the major axis, likely corresponding to a physical pericenter offset ofthe disk gap. this reinforces the leading theory that dynamical clearing by atleast one orbiting body is the cause of the gap. based on evolutionary models,our high-contrast imagery imposes an upper limit of 21 jupiter masses oncompanions at separations outside of 0.1" and of 13 jupiter masses outside of0.2". thus, we find that a planetary system around lkca 15 is the most likelyexplanation for the disk architecture.

1203.1612	the missing cavities in the seeds polarized scattered light images of  transitional protoplanetary disks: a generic disk model	transitional circumstellar disks around young stellar objects have adistinctive infrared deficit around 10 microns in their spectral energydistributions (sed), recently measured by the spitzer infrared spectrograph(irs), suggesting dust depletion in the inner regions. these disks have beenconfirmed to have giant central cavities by imaging of the submillimeter(sub-mm) continuum emission using the submillimeter array (sma). however, thepolarized near-infrared scattered light images for most objects in a systematicirs/sma cross sample, obtained by hiciao on the subaru telescope, show noevidence for the cavity, in clear contrast with sma and spitzer observations.radiative transfer modeling indicates that many of these scattered light imagesare consistent with a smooth spatial distribution for micron-sized grains, withlittle discontinuity in the surface density of the micron-sized grains at thecavity edge. here we present a generic disk model that can simultaneouslyaccount for the general features in irs, sma, and subaru observations.particularly, the scattered light images for this model are computed, whichagree with the general trend seen in subaru data. decoupling between thespatial distributions of the micron-sized dust and mm-sized dust inside thecavity is suggested by the model, which, if confirmed, necessitates amechanism, such as dust filtration, for differentiating the small and big dustin the cavity clearing process. our model also suggests an inwardly increasinggas-to-dust-ratio in the inner disk, and different spatial distributions forthe small dust inside and outside the cavity, echoing the predictions in graincoagulation and growth models.

1205.3159	high-contrast nir polarization imaging of mwc480	one of the key predictions of modeling from the ir excess of herbig ae starsis that for protoplanetary disks, where significant grain growth and settlinghas occurred, the dust disk has flattened to the point that it can be partiallyor largely shadowed by the innermost material at or near the dust sublimationradius. when the self-shadowing has already started, the outer disk is expectedto be detected in scattered light only in the exceptional cases that the scaleheight of the dust disk at the sublimation radius is smaller than usual.high-contrast imaging combined with the ir spectral energy distribution allowus to measure the degree of flattening of the disk, as well as to determine theproperties of the outer disk. we present polarimetric differential imaging in$h$ band obtained with subaru/hiciao of one such system, mwc 480. the hiciaodata were obtained at a historic minimum of the nir excess. the disk isdetected in scattered light from 0\farcs2-1\farcs0 (27.4-137au). together withthe marginal detection of the disk from 1998 february 24 by hst/nicmos, ourdata constrain the opening half angle for the disk to lie between1.3$\leq\theta\leq 2.2^\circ$. when compared with similar measures in co forthe gas disk from the literature, the dust disk subtends only $\sim$30% of thegas disk scale height (h/r$\sim$0.03). such a dust disk is a factor of 5-7flatter than transitional disks, which have structural signatures that giantplanets have formed.

1209.3772	the structure of pre-transitional protoplanetary disks i: radiative  transfer modeling of the disk+cavity in the pds 70 system	through detailed radiative transfer modeling, we present a disk+cavity modelto simultaneously explain both the sed and subaru h-band polarized lightimaging for the pre-transitional protoplanetary disk pds 70. particularly, weare able to match not only the radial dependence, but also the absolute scale,of the surface brightness of the scattered light. our disk model has a cavity65 au in radius, which is heavily depleted of sub-micron-sized dust grains, anda small residual inner disk which produces a weak but still optically thick nirexcess in the sed. to explain the contrast of the cavity edge in the subaruimage, a factor of ~1000 depletion for the sub-micron-sized dust inside thecavity is required. the total dust mass of the disk may be on the order of 1e-4m_sun, only weakly constrained due to the lack of long wavelength observationsand the uncertainties in the dust model. the scale height of thesub-micron-sized dust is ~6 au at the cavity edge, and the cavity wall isoptically thick in the vertical direction at h-band. pds 70 is not a member ofthe class of (pre-)transitional disks identified by dong et al. (2012), whosemembers only show evidence of the cavity in the millimeter-sized dust but notthe sub-micron-sized dust in resolved images. the two classes of(pre-)transitional disks may form through different mechanisms, or they mayjust be at different evolution stages in the disk clearing process.

(2012). by obtaining images and spectra at the same light echo positionbetween 2011 and 2014, we follow the evolution of the great eruption on athree-year timescale. we find remarkable changes in the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of the echo light. the $i$-band light curve shows adecline of $\sim 0.9$ mag in $\sim 1$ year after the peak observed in early2011 and a flattening at later times. the spectra show a pure-absorption earlyg-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the[ca ii] triplet develop strong p-cygni profiles and we see the appearance of[ca ii] 7291,7324 doublet in emission. these emission features and theirevolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some type iinsupernovae and supernova impostors. most surprisingly, starting $\sim 300$ daysafter peak brightness, the spectra show strong molecular transitions of cn at$\gtrsim 6800$ \aa. the appearance of these cn features can be explained if theejecta are strongly nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modernspectroscopic studies of the bipolar homunculus nebula. given the spectroscopicevolution of the light echo, velocities of the main features, and detection ofstrong cn, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to thehomunculus nebula.

0804.3810	additional ultracool white dwarfs found in the sloan digital sky survey	we identify seven new ultracool white dwarfs discovered in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). the sdss photometry, spectra, and proper motions arepresented, and additional bvri data are given for these and other previouslydiscovered ultracool white dwarfs. the observed colors span a remarkably widerange, qualitatively similar to colors predicted by models for very cool whitedwarfs. one of the new stars (sdss j1251+44) exhibits strong collision-inducedabsorption (cia) in its spectra, while the spectra and colors of the other sixare consistent with mild cia. another of the new discoveries (sdss j2239+00a)is part of a binary system -- its companion is also a cool white dwarf, andother data indicate that the companion exhibits an infrared flux deficiency,making this the first binary system composed of two cia white dwarfs. a thirddiscovery (sdss j0310-00) has weak balmer emission lines. the proper motions ofall seven stars are consistent with membership in the disk or thick disk.

astro-ph;0005247	five high-redshift quasars discovered in commissioning imaging data of  the sloan digital sky survey	we report the discovery of five quasars with redshifts of 4.67 - 5.27 andz'-band magnitudes of 19.5-20.7 m_b ~ -27. all were originally selected asdistant quasar candidates in optical/near-infrared photometry from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), and most were confirmed as probable high-redshiftquasars by supplementing the sdss data with j and k measurements. the quasarspossess strong, broad lyman-alpha emission lines, with the characteristic sharpcutoff on the blue side produced by lyman-alpha forest absorption. threequasars contain strong, broad absorption features, and one of them exhibitsvery strong n v emission. the amount of absorption produced by the lyman-alphaforest increases toward higher redshift, and that in the z=5.27 object (d_a ~0.7) is consistent with a smooth extrapolation of the absorption seen in lowerredshift quasars. the high luminosity of these objects relative to most otherknown objects at z &gt;~ 5 makes them potentially valuable as probes of earlyquasar properties and of the intervening intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0005414	the discovery of a luminous z=5.80 quasar from the sloan digital sky  survey	we present observations of sdssp j104433.04--012502.2, a luminous quasar atz=5.80 discovered from sloan digital sky survey (sdss) multicolor imaging data.this object was selected as an i'-band dropout object, with i*=21.8 +/- 0.2,z*=19.2 +/- 0.1. it has an absolute magnitude m1450 = -27.2 (h_0 =50 km/s/mpc,q0 = 0.5). the spectrum shows a strong and broad ly alpha emission line, strongly alpha forest absorption lines with a mean continuum decrement d_a = 0.91,and a lyman limit system at z=5.72. the spectrum also shows strong oi and siivemission lines similar to those of quasars at z&lt;= 5, suggesting that thesemetals were produced at redshift beyond six. the lack of a gunn-peterson troughin the spectrum indicates that the universe is already highly ionized at z ~5.8. using a high-resolution spectrum in the ly alpha forest region, we place aconservative upper limit of the optical depth due to the gunn-peterson effectof tau &lt; 0.5 in regions of minimum absorption. the ly alpha forest absorptionin this object is much stronger than that in quasars at z&lt;= 5. the object isunresolved in a deep image with excellent seeing, implying that it is unlensed.the black hole mass of this quasar is ~3 x 10^9 m_solar if we assume that it isradiating at the eddington luminosity and no lensing amplification, implyingthat it resides in a very massive dark matter halo. the discovery of one quasarat m_1450 &lt; -27 in a survey area of 600 deg^2 is consistent with anextrapolation of the observed luminosity function at lower redshift. theabundance and evolution of such quasars can provide sensitive tests of modelsof quasar and galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0008401	discovery of a close pair of z = 4.25 quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we report the discovery of a pair of z = 4.25 quasars with a separation of 33arcseconds. the brighter of the two objects was identified as a high-redshiftquasar candidate from sloan digital sky survey multicolor imaging data, and theredshift was measured from a spectrum obtained with the hobby-eberly telescope.the slit orientation of this observation {\it by chance} included anotherquasar, approximately one magnitude fainter and having the same redshift as thetarget. this is the third serendipitous discovery of a z &gt; 4 quasar. thedifferences in the relative strengths and profiles of the emission linessuggest that this is a quasar pair and not a gravitational lens. the twoobjects are likely to be physically associated; the projected physicalseparation is approximately 210 $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc and the redshifts areidentical to $\approx$ 0.01, implying a radial physical separation of 950$h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc or less. the existence of this pair is strong circumstantialevidence that $z \sim 4$ quasars are clustered.

astro-ph;0102059	infrared spectroscopy of brown dwarfs: the onset of methane absorption  in l dwarfs and the l/t transition	we present infrared spectra of brown dwarfs with spectral types from mid-l tot. the 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m spectra of three dwarfs found by the sloan digital skysurvey contain absorption bands of both methane and carbon monoxide and bridgethe gap between late l and previously observed t dwarfs. these dwarfs form aclear spectral sequence, with ch$_{4}$ absorption increasing as the coabsorption decreases. water vapor band strengths increase in parallel with themethane bands and thus also link the l and t types. we suggest that objectswith detectable co and ch$_{4}$ in the h and k bands should define the earliestt subclasses. from observations of bright (k~$\leq$~13 mag) l dwarfs found by2mass, we find that the onset of detectable amounts of ch$_{4}$ occurs nearspectral type l5. for this spectral type methane is observable in the3.3~$\mu$m $\nu$$_{3}$ band only, and not in the overtone and combination bandsat h and k.

astro-ph;0102216	analysis of stars common to the iras and hipparcos surveys	for about 11,000 stars observed in the hipparcos survey and detected by iraswe calculate bolometric luminosities by integrating their spectral energydistributions from the b band to far-ir wavelengths. we present an analysis ofthe dependence of dust emission on spectral type and correlations between theluminosity and dust emission for about 1000 sources with the best data(parallax error less than 30%, error in luminosity of about 50% or better).this subsample includes stars of all spectral types and is dominated by k and mgiants.  we use the iras [25]-[12] color to select stars with emission fromcircumstellar dust and show that they are found throughout thehertzsprung-russell diagram, including on the main sequence. clear evidence isfound that m giants with dust emission have luminosities about 3 times larger(about 3000 lsun) than their counterparts without dust, and that mass loss onthe asymptotic giant branch for both m and c stars requires a minimumluminosity of order 2000 lsun. above this threshold the mass-loss rate seems tobe independent of, or only weakly dependent on, luminosity. we also show thatthe mass-loss rate for these stars is larger than the core mass growth rate,indicating that their evolution is dominated by mass loss.

astro-ph;0102217	100-year mass loss modulations on the asymptotic giant branch	we analyze the differences in infrared circumstellar dust emission betweenoxygen rich mira and non-mira stars, and find that they are statisticallysignificant. in particular, we find that these stars segregate in the k-[12]vs. [12]-[25] color-color diagram, and have distinct properties of the iras lrsspectra, including the peak position of the silicate emission feature. we showthat the infrared emission from the majority of non-mira stars cannot beexplained within the context of standard steady-state outflow models. themodels can be altered to fit the data for non-mira stars by postulatingnon-standard optical properties for silicate grains, or by assuming that thedust temperature at the inner envelope radius is significantly lower (300-400k) than typical silicate grain condensation temperatures (800-1000 k). we arguethat the latter is more probable and provide detailed model fits to the iraslrs spectra for 342 stars. these fits imply that 2/3 of non-mira stars and 1/3of mira stars do not have hot dust ($&gt;$ 500 k) in their envelopes. the absenceof hot dust can be interpreted as a recent (order of 100 yr) decrease in themass-loss rate. the distribution of best-fit model parameters agrees with thisinterpretation and strongly suggests that the mass loss resumes on similar timescales. such a possibility appears to be supported by a number of spatiallyresolved observations (e.g. recent hst images of the multiple shells in the eggnebula) and is consistent with new dynamical models for mass loss on theasymptotic giant branch.

astro-ph;0103141	reprocessing the hipparcos data for evolved giant stars ii. absolute  magnitudes for the r-type carbon stars	the hipparcos intermediate astrometric data for carbon stars have beenreprocessed using an algorithm which provides an objective criterion forrejecting anomalous data points and constrains the parallax to be positive. newparallax solutions have been derived for 317 cool carbon stars, mostly of typesr and n. in this paper we discuss the results for the r stars. the mostimportant result is that the early r stars (i.e., r0 - r3) have absolutemagnitudes and v-k colors locating them among red clump giants in thehertzsprung-russell diagram. stars with subtypes r4 - r9 tend to be cooler andhave similar luminosity to the n-type carbon stars, as confirmed by theirposition in the (j-h, h-k) color-color diagram. the sample of early r-typestars selected from the hipparcos catalogue appears to be approximatelycomplete to magnitude k_0 ~ 7, translating into a completeness distance of 600pc if all r stars had m_k= -2 (400 pc if m_k= -1). with about 30 early r-typestars in that volume, they comprise about 0.04% (0.14% for m_k= -1) of the redclump stars in the solar neighborhood. identification with the red clumplocates these stars at the helium core burning stage of stellar evolution,while the n stars are on the asymptotic giant branch, where helium shellburning occurs. the present analysis suggests that for a small fraction of thehelium core burning stars (far lower than the fraction of helium shell-burningstars), carbon produced in the interior is mixed to the atmosphere insufficient quantities to form a carbon star.

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0108153	spectroscopic target selection for the sloan digital sky survey: the  luminous red galaxy sample	we describe the target selection and resulting properties of a spectroscopicsample of luminous, red galaxies (lrg) from the imaging data of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). these galaxies are selected on the basis of colorand magnitude to yield a sample of luminous, intrinsically red galaxies thatextends fainter and further than the main flux-limited portion of the sdssgalaxy spectroscopic sample. the sample is designed to impose apassively-evolving luminosity and rest-frame color cut to a redshift of 0.38.additional, yet more luminous, red galaxies are included to a redshift of 0.5.approximately 12 of these galaxies per square degree are targeted forspectroscopy, so the sample will number over 100,000 with the full survey. sdsscommissioning data indicate that the algorithm efficiently selects luminous(m_g=-21.4), red galaxies, that the spectroscopic success rate is very high,and that the resulting set of galaxies is approximately volume-limited out toz=0.38. when the sdss is complete, the lrg spectroscopic sample will fill over1h^-3 gpc^3 with an approximately homogeneous population of galaxies and willtherefore be well suited to studies of large-scale structure and clusters outto z=0.5.

astro-ph;0108443	towards spectral classification of l and t dwarfs: infrared and optical  spectroscopy and analysis	we present 0.6-2.5um, r~400 spectra of twenty-seven cool, low luminositystars and substellar objects. based on these and previously published spectrawe develop a preliminary spectral classification system for l and t dwarfs. forlate l and t types the classification system is based entirely on four spectralindices in the 1-2.5um interval. two of these indices are derived from waterabsorption bands at 1.15um and 1.4um, the latter of which shows a smoothincrease in depth through the l and t sequences and can be used to classifyboth spectral types. the other two indices make use of methane absorptionfeatures in the h and k bands, with the k band index also applicable to mid tolate l dwarfs. continuum indices shortward of 1um used by previous authors toclassify l dwarfs are found to be useful only through mid l subclasses. weemploy the 1.5um water index and the 2.2um methane index to complete the lclassification through l9.5 and to link the new system with a modified versionof the 2mass ``color-d'' index. by correlating the depths of the methane andwater absorption features, we establish a t spectral sequence from types t0 tot8, based on all four indices, which is a smooth continuation of the lsequence. we reclassify two 2mass l8 dwarfs as l9 and l9.5 and identify onesdss object as l9. in the proposed system methane absorption appears in the kband approximately at l8, two subclasses earlier than its appearance in the hband. the l and t spectral classes are distinguished by the absence andpresence, respectively, of h band methane absorption.

astro-ph;0109331	infrared classification of l and t dwarfs	we use new and published medium resolution 0.6--2.5 $\mu$m spectra of l and tdwarfs to develop a unified classification system for both of these newspectral classes. two indices of the system at 1.2 $\mu$m and 1.5 $\mu$m arebased on nearby absorption bands of water vapor and two are associated withmethane bands near 1.6 $\mu$m and 2.2 $\mu$m. the 1.5 $\mu$m index is monotonicthrough the l and t sequences, and forms the backbone of the system; theindices for the other bands provide extensive, but only partial, coverage. wecorrelate the 1.5 $\mu$m index with continuum indices shortward of 1 $\mu$mdevised by others for classifying l dwarfs, in order to obtain a tight linkbetween optical and infrared classifications. our proposed system defines tenspectral subclasses for l (l0--l9) and nine for t (t0--t8). the boundarybetween l and t is defined to be the onset of absorption by methane in the hband. methane absorption in the k band near 2.2 $\mu$m is found to beginapproximately at l8.

astro-ph;0111024	the optical, infrared and radio properties of extragalactic sources  observed by sdss, 2mass and first surveys	we positionally match sources observed by the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), the two micron all sky survey (2mass), and the faint images of theradio sky at twenty-cm (first) survey. practically all 2mass sources arematched to an sdss source within 2 arcsec; ~11% of them are optically resolvedgalaxies and the rest are dominated by stars. about 1/3 of first sources arematched to an sdss source within 2 arcsec; ~80% of these are galaxies and therest are dominated by quasars. based on these results, we project that by thecompletion of these surveys the matched samples will include about 10^7 starsand 10^6 galaxies observed by both sdss and 2mass, and about 250,000 galaxiesand 50,000 quasars observed by both sdss and first. here we present apreliminary analysis of the optical, infrared and radio properties for theextragalactic sources from the matched samples. in particular, we find that thefraction of quasars with stellar colors missed by the sdss spectroscopic surveyis probably not larger than ~10%, and that the optical colors of radio-loudquasars are ~0.05 mag. redder (with 4-sigma significance) than the colors ofradio-quiet quasars.

astro-ph;0202407	the galactic distribution of asymptotic giant branch stars	we study the galactic distribution of ~10,000 asymptotic giant branch (agb)stars selected by iras colors and variability index. the distance to each staris estimated by assuming a narrow luminosity function and a model-derivedbolometric correction. the characteristic agb star luminosity, l_agb, isdetermined from the condition that the highest number density must coincidewith the galactic bulge. assuming a bulge distance of 8 kpc, we determine l_agb\~ 3,500 lo, in close agreement with values obtained for nearby agb stars usingthe hipparcos data. we find that there are no statistically significantdifferences in the galactic distribution of agb stars with different irascolors, implying a universal density distribution. the direct determination ofthis distribution shows that it is separable in the radial, r, and vertical, z,directions. perpendicular to the galactic plane, the number density of agbstars is well described by an exponential function with a vertical scale heightof 300 pc. in the radial direction the number density of agb stars is constantup to r ~ 5 kpc, and then it decreases exponentially with a scale length of\~1.6 kpc. this fall-off extends to at least 12 kpc, where the sample becomestoo small. the overall normalization implies that there are about 200,000 agbstars in the galaxy. we estimate the [25]-[12] color distribution of agb starsfor an unbiased volume-limited sample. by using a model-dependenttransformation between the color and mass-loss rate, mdot, we constrain thetime dependence of mdot. the results suggest that for 10^-6 mo/yr &lt; mdot &lt;10^-5 mo/yr the mass-loss rate increases exponentially with time. we find onlymarginal evidence that the mass-loss rate increases with stellar mass.

astro-ph;0301019	a catalog of broad absorption line quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey early data release	we present a catalog of 224 broad absorption line quasars (balqsos) from thesloan digital sky survey's early data release quasar catalog, including arelatively complete and homogeneous subsample of 131 balqsos. since theidentification of balqsos is subject to considerable systematic uncertainties,we attempt to create a complete sample of sdss balqsos by combining the resultsof two automated selection algorithms and a by-eye classification scheme. oneof these automated algorithms finds broad absorption line troughs by comparisonwith a composite quasar spectrum. we present the details of this algorithm andcompare this method to that which uses a power-law fit to the continuum. thebalqsos in our sample are further classified as high-ionization balqsos(hibals), low-ionization balqsos (lobals), and balqsos with excited ironabsorption features (felobals); composite spectra of each type are presented.we further present a study of the properties of the balqsos in terms of thebalnicity distribution, which rises with decreasing balnicity. thisdistribution of balnicities suggests that the fraction of quasars withintrinsic outflows may be significantly underestimated.

astro-ph;0301579	reprocessing the hipparcos data for evolved stars iii revised hipparcos  period-luminosity relationship for galactic long-period variable stars	we analyze the k band luminosities of a sample of galactic long-periodvariables using parallaxes measured by the hipparcos mission. the parallaxesare in most cases re-computed from the hipparcos intermediate astrometric datausing improved astrometric fits and chromaticity corrections. the k bandmagnitudes are taken from the literature and from measurements by cobe, and arecorrected for interstellar and circumstellar extinction. the sample containsstars of several spectral types: m, s and c, and of several variabilityclasses: mira, semiregular sra, and srb. we find that the distribution of starsin the period-luminosity plane is independent of circumstellar chemistry, butthat the different variability types have different p-l distributions. both themira variables and the srb variables have reasonably well-definedperiod-luminosity relationships, but with very different slopes. the sravariables are distributed between the two classes, suggesting that they are amixture of miras and srb, rather than a separate class of stars. newperiod-luminosity relationships are derived based on our revised hipparcosparallaxes. the miras show a similar period-luminosity relationship to thatfound for large magellanic cloud miras by feast et al. (1989). the maximumabsolute k magnitude of the sample is about -8.2 for both miras andsemi-regular stars, only a little fainter than the expected agb limit. we showthat the stars with the longest periods (p&gt;400d) have high mass loss rates andare almost all mira variables.

astro-ph;0302526	hubble space telescope observations of binary very-low-mass stars and  brown dwarfs	we present analysis of hubble space telescope images of 82 nearby fieldlate-m and l dwarfs. we resolve 13 of these systems into double m/l dwarfsystems and identify an additional possible binary. combined with previousobservations of 20 l dwarfs, we derive an observed binary fraction forultracool dwarfs of 17+4-3%, where the statistics included systems withseparations in the range 1.6-16 a.u. we argue that accounting for biases andincompleteness leads to an estimated binary fraction 15+-5% in the range 1.6-16a.u. no systems wider than 16 a.u. are seen, implying that the wide companionfrequency is less than 1.7%; the distribution of orbital separation is peakedat ~2-4 a.u. and differs greatly from the g dwarf binary distribution. indirectevidence suggests that the binary fraction is ~5+-3% for separations less than1.6 a.u. we find no evidence for differences in the binary fraction betweenstellar late-m and l dwarfs and substellar l dwarfs. we note, however, that thewidest (&gt;10 a.u.) systems in our sample are all of earlier (m8-l0) spectraltype; a larger sample is needed determine if this is a real effect. one systemwith a spectral type of l7 has a secondary that is fainter in the hst f814wfilter but brighter in f1042m; we argue that this secondary is an early-tdwarf.

astro-ph;0305305	red and reddened quasars in the sloan digital sky survey	we investigate the continuum and emission line properties of 4576 sdssquasars as a function of their optical/uv seds. the optical/uv colordistribution of our sample is roughly gaussian, but with a red tail; wedistinguish between 1) intrinsically blue (optically flat) quasars, 2)intrinsically red (optically steep) quasars, and 3) the 273 (6%) of our quasarswhose continua are inconsistent with a single power-law and appear redder dueto smc-like dust reddening rather than synchrotron emission. the colordistribution suggests that the population of moderately dust reddenedbroad-line quasars is smaller than that of unobscured quasars, but we estimatethat a further 10% of the luminous quasar population is missing from the sdsssample because of dust extinction with e(b-v)&lt;0.5. we also investigate theemission and absorption line properties of these quasars as a function of colorwith regard to boroson &amp; green type eigenvectors. intrinsically red (opticallysteep) quasars tend to have narrower balmer lines and weaker civ, ciii], heiiand 3000a bump emission as compared with bluer (optically flatter) quasars. thechange in strength of the 3000a bump appears to be dominated by the balmercontinuum and not by feii emission. the dust reddened quasars have evennarrower balmer lines and weaker 3000a bumps, in addition to havingconsiderably larger equivalent widths of [oii] and [oiii] emission. thefraction of broad absorption line quasars (balqsos) increases from ~3.4% forthe bluest quasars to perhaps as large as 20% for the dust reddened quasars,but the intrinsic color distribution is affected by dust reddening.

astro-ph;0305347	an initial survey of white dwarfs in the sloan digital sky survey	an initial assessment is made of white dwarf and hot subdwarf stars observedin the sloan digital sky survey. in a small area of sky (190 square degrees),observed much like the full survey will be, 269 white dwarfs and 56 hotsubdwarfs are identified spectroscopically where only 44 white dwarfs and 5 hotsubdwarfs were known previously. most are ordinary da (hydrogen atmosphere) anddb (helium) types. in addition, in the full survey to date, a number of wdshave been found with uncommon spectral types. among these are blue dq starsdisplaying lines of atomic carbon; red dq stars showing molecular bands of c_2with a wide variety of strengths; dz stars where ca and occasionally mg, na,and/or fe lines are detected; and magnetic wds with a wide range of magneticfield strengths in da, db, dq, and (probably) dz spectral types. photometryalone allows identification of stars hotter than 12000 k, and the density ofthese stars for 15&lt;g&lt;20 is found to be ~2.2 deg^{-2} at galactic latitudes29-62 deg. spectra are obtained for roughly half of these hot stars. thespectra show that, for 15&lt;g&lt;17, 40% of hot stars are wds and the fraction ofwds rises to ~90% at g=20. the remainder are hot sdb and sdo stars.

astro-ph;0308508	continuum and emission-line properties of broad absorption line quasars	we investigate the continuum and emission-line properties of 224 broadabsorption line quasars (balqsos) with 0.9&lt;z&lt;4.4 drawn from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) early data release (edr), which contains 3814 bona fidequasars. we find that low-ionization balqsos (lobals) are significantlyreddened as compared to normal quasars, in agreement with previous work.high-ionization balqsos (hibals) are also more reddened than the averagenonbalqso. assuming smc-like dust reddening at the quasar redshift, the amountof reddening needed to explain hibals is e(b-v)~0.023 and lobals ise(b-v)~0.077 (compared to the ensemble average of the entire quasar sample). wefind that there are differences in the emission-line properties between theaverage hibal, lobal, and nonbal quasar. these differences, along withdifferences in the absorption line troughs, may be related to intrinsic quasarproperties such as the slope of the intrinsic (unreddened) continuum; moreextreme absorption properties are correlated with bluer intrinsic continua.despite the differences among balqso sub-types and nonbalqsos, balqsos appearto be drawn from the same parent population as nonbalqsos when both areselected by their uv/optical properties. we find that the overall fraction oftraditionally defined balqsos, after correcting for color-dependent selectioneffects due to different seds of balqso and nonbalqsos, is 13.4+/-1.2% andshows no significant redshift dependence for 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.45. after a roughcompleteness correction for the effects of dust extinction, we find thatapproximately one in every six quasars is a balqso.

astro-ph;0402118	faint high-latitude carbon stars discovered by the sloan digital sky  survey: an initial catalog	a search of more than 3,000 square degrees of high latitude sky by the sloandigital sky survey has yielded 251 faint high-latitude carbon stars (fhlcs),the large majority previously uncataloged. we present homogeneous spectroscopy,photometry, and astrometry for the sample. the objects lie in the 15.6 &lt; r &lt;20.8 range, and exhibit a wide variety of apparent photospheric temperatures,ranging from spectral types near m to as early as f. proper motion measurementsfor 222 of the objects show that at least 50%, and quite probably more than60%, of these objects are actually low luminosity dwarf carbon (dc) stars, inagreement with a variety of recent, more limited investigations which show thatsuch objects are the numerically dominant type of star with c_2 in thespectrum. this sdss homogeneous sample of ~110 dc stars now constitutes 90% ofall known carbon dwarfs, and will grow by another factor of 2-3 by thecompletion of the survey. as the spectra of the dc and the faint halo giant cstars are very similar (at least at spectral resolution of 1,000) despite adifference of 10 mag in luminosity, it is imperative that simple luminositydiscriminants other than proper motion be developed. we use our enlarged sampleof fhlcs to examine a variety of possible luminosity criteria, including manypreviously suggested, and find that, with certain important caveats, jhkphotometry may segregate dwarfs and giants.

astro-ph;0402475	l' and m' photometry of ultracool dwarfs	we have compiled l' and m' photometry of 63 single and binary m, l,and tdwarfs obtained at ukirt using the mko filter set. this compilation includesnew l' data for 8 l dwarfs and 13 t dwarfs and new m' data for 7 l dwarfs, 5 tdwarfs, and gl 229a. we compute l_bol, bc_k, and t_eff for 42 dwarfs whoseflux-calibrated jhk spectra, l' photometry, and trigonometric parallaxes areavailable, and we estimate these quantities for 9 other dwarfs whose parallaxesand flux-calibrated spectra have been obtained. bc_k is a well-behaved functionof near-ir spectral type with a dispersion of ~0.1 mag for types m6-t5; it issignificantly more scattered for types t5-t9. t_eff declines steeply andmonotonically for types m6-l7 and t4-t9, but is nearly constant at ~1450 k fortypes l7-t4 with assumed ages of ~3 gyr. this constant t_eff is evidenced bynearly unchanging values of l'-m' between types l6 and t3. we compare theobserved k, l', and m' luminosities of l and t dwarfs in our sample with thosepredicted by model atmospheres with varying surface gravities and sedimentationefficiencies. the models indicate that the l3-t4.5 dwarfs generally have highergravities (log g = 5.0-5.5) than the t6-t9 dwarfs (log g = 4.5-5.0). thepredicted m' luminosities of t dwarfs are 1.5-2.5 times larger than thosederived empirically for the t dwarfs in our sample. this discrepancy isattributed to absorption at 4.5-4.9 um by co, which is not expected under thecondition of chemical equilibrium assumed in the models. we determine that thel3 dwarf kelu-1 and the t0 dwarf sdss j0423-0414 are probable binary systems.we compute log(l_bol/l_sun) = -5.73 +/- 0.05 and t_eff = 600-750 k for the t9dwarf 2mass j0415-0935, which supplants gl 570d as the least luminous andcoolest brown dwarf presently known.

astro-ph;0403319	variable faint optical sources discovered by comparing poss and sdss  catalogs	we present a study of variable faint optical sources discovered by comparingthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the palomar observatory sky survey(poss) catalogs. we use sdss measurements to photometrically recalibrateseveral publicly available poss catalogs; a piecewise recalibration in 100arcmin2 patches generally results in an improvement of photometric accuracy(rms) by nearly a factor of two, compared to the original data. the poss imagnitudes can be improved to ~0.15 mag accuracy, and poss ii magnitudes to\~0.10 mag accuracy. we use the recalibrated catalogs for the ~2,000 deg2 ofsky in the sdss data release 1 to construct a catalog of ~60,000 sourcesvariable on time scales 10-50 years. a series of statistical tests based on themorphology of sdss color-color diagrams, as well as visual comparison of imagesand comparison with repeated sdss observations, demonstrate the robustness ofthe selection methods. we quantify the distribution of variable sources in thesdss color-color diagrams, and the variability characteristics of quasars. wedetect a turn-over in quasar structure function which suggests that thecharacteristic time scale for quasar variability is of the order one year. thelong-term (&gt;1 year) quasar variability decreases with luminosity and rest-framewavelength similarly to the short-term (&lt;1 year) behavior. we also demonstratethat candidate rr lyrae stars trace the same halo structures, such as the sgrdwarf tidal stream, that were discovered using repeated sdss observations. weutilize the poss-sdss selected candidates to constrain the halo structure inthe parts of sky for which repeated sdss observations do not exist.

astro-ph;0408569	the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy correlation function	we study the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy 2-pointcorrelation function in the sloan digital sky survey, starting from a sample of200,000 galaxies over 2500 deg^2. we concentrate on the projected correlationfunction w(r_p), which is directly related to the real space \xi(r). theamplitude of w(r_p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeplyabove the characteristic luminosity l_*. redder galaxies exhibit a higheramplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. the correlationamplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but theluminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright redgalaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies morestrongly clustered at small scales. we interpret these results using halooccupation distribution (hod) models assuming concordance cosmologicalparameters. for most samples, an hod model with two adjustable parameters fitsthe w(r_p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r_p ~ 1-3mpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of \xi(r). theimplied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminositythreshold l grows as m_min ~ l at low luminosities and more steeply above l_*.the mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than l ism_1 ~ 23 m_min(l). these results imply a conditional luminosity function (atfixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a schechter functionextrapolation of the satellite population. hod models nicely explain the jointluminosity-color dependence of w(r_p) in terms of the color fractions ofcentral and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. the inferred hodproperties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.

(2002). we have compiled a sample of 105 l and tdwarfs that are uniformly classified and measured on a single photometricsystem. the scattered jhk spectral indices and colors of l dwarfs are likelycaused by variations in the altitudes, distributions, and thicknesses ofcondensate clouds. scatter in the h-k colors of late t dwarfs probably reflectsthe sensitivity of the k-band flux to pressure induced h_2 opacity, whichitself is sensitive to surface gravity. the m' luminosities of late-t dwarfsare 1.5-2.5 times fainter than predicted under conditions of chemicalequilibrium. we have computed l_bol and t_eff for 42 l and t dwarfs whosetrigonometric parallaxes have been measured. we find that t_eff ~ 1450 k fortypes l7-t4, which supports recent models that attribute the changing jhk-bandluminosities and spectral features across the l-t transition to rapid changesin the condensate clouds over a narrow range of t_eff. we compute t_eff =600-750 k for 2mass 0415-0935 (t9), which supplants gl 570d as the coolestknown brown dwarf.

astro-ph;0605302	the clustering of luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey  imaging data	we present the 3d real space clustering power spectrum of a sample of\~600,000 luminous red galaxies (lrgs) measured by the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), using photometric redshifts. this sample of galaxies ranges fromredshift z=0.2 to 0.6 over 3,528 deg^2 of the sky, probing a volume of 1.5(gpc/h)^3, making it the largest volume ever used for galaxy clusteringmeasurements. we measure the angular clustering power spectrum in eightredshift slices and combine these into a high precision 3d real space powerspectrum from k=0.005 (h/mpc) to k=1 (h/mpc). we detect power on gigaparsecscales, beyond the turnover in the matter power spectrum, on scalessignificantly larger than those accessible to current spectroscopic redshiftsurveys. we also find evidence for baryonic oscillations, both in the powerspectrum, as well as in fits to the baryon density, at a 2.5 sigma confidencelevel. the statistical power of these data to constrain cosmology is ~1.7 timesbetter than previous clustering analyses. varying the matter density and baryonfraction, we find \omega_m = 0.30 \pm 0.03, and \omega_b/\omega_m = 0.18 \pm0.04, the detection of baryonic oscillations also allows us to measure thecomoving distance to z=0.5; we find a best fit distance of 1.73 \pm 0.12 gpc,corresponding to a 6.5% error on the distance. these results demonstrate theability to make precise clustering measurements with photometric surveys(abridged).

astro-ph;0606344	panchromatic properties of 99,000 galaxies detected by sdss, and (some  by) rosat, galex, 2mass, iras, gb6, first, nvss and wenss surveys	we discuss the panchromatic properties of 99,088 galaxies selected from thesdss data release 1 spectroscopic sample (a flux-limited sample for 1360deg^2). these galaxies are positionally matched to sources detected by rosat,galex, 2mass, iras, gb6, first, nvss and wenss. we find strong correlationsbetween the detection fraction at other wavelengths and optical properties suchas flux, colors, and emission-line strengths. using galex, sdss, and 2massdata, we construct the uv-ir broad-band spectral energy distributions forvarious types of galaxies, and find that they form a nearly one-parameterfamily. for example, based on sdss u- and r-band data, supplemented withredshift, the k-band 2mass magnitudes can be "predicted" with an rms scatter ofonly 0.2 mag. when a dust content estimate determined from sdss data bykauffmann et al. (2003) is also utilized, this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag. wedemonstrate that this dust content is indeed higher for galaxies detected byiras and that it can be used to "predict" measured iras 60 micron flux densitywithin a factor of two using only sdss data. we also show that the position ofa galaxy in the emission-line-based baldwin-phillips-terlevich diagram iscorrelated with the optical light concentration index and u-r color determinedfrom the sdss broad-band imaging data, and discuss changes in the morphology ofthis diagram induced by requiring detections at other wavelengths. we study their-radio correlation and find evidence that its slope may be different for agnand star-forming galaxies and related to the h_alpha/h_beta line strengthratio.

astro-ph;0606355	the rest-frame optical colors of 99,000 sdss galaxies	we synthesize the rest-frame stroemgren colors using sdss spectra for 99,088galaxies selected from data release 1. this narrow-band ~200 aa photometricsystem (uz, vz, bz, yz), first designed for the determination of effectivetemperature, metallicity and gravity of stars, measures the continuum spectralslope of galaxies in the rest-frame 3200-5800 aa wavelength range. galaxiesform a remarkably narrow locus (~0.03 mag) in the resulting color-colordiagram. the bruzual &amp; charlot population synthesis models suggest that theposition of a galaxy along this locus is controlled by a degenerate combinationof metallicity and age of the dominant stellar population. galaxy distributionalong the locus is bimodal, with the local minimum corresponding to an ~1 gyrold single stellar population. the position perpendicular to the locus isindependent of metallicity and age, and reflects the galaxy's dust content, asimplied by both the models and the statistics of iras detections. a comparisonof this locus with the galaxy locus in the h_delta-d_n(4000) diagram, utilizedby kauffmann et al. (2003) to estimate stellar masses, reveals a tightcorrelation, although the two analyzed spectral ranges barely overlap. overall,the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the entire uv to near-ir range canbe described as a single-parameter family with an accuracy of 0.1 mag, orbetter. this nearly one-dimensional distribution of galaxies in themulti-dimensional space of measured parameters strongly supports the conclusionof yip et al. (2004), based on a principal component analysis, that sdss galaxyspectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra. apparently, thecontributions of stellar populations that dominate the optical emission fromgalaxies are combined in a simple and well-defined way.

astro-ph;0608065	model atmosphere analysis of the weakly magnetic dz white dwarf g165-7	a reanalysis of the strongly metal-blanketed dz white dwarf g165-7 ispresented. an improved grid of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra is usedto analyze bvri, jhk, and ugriz photometric observations as well as a highquality sloan digital sky survey spectrum covering the energy distribution from3600 to 9000 a. the detection of splitting in several lines of ca, na, and fe,suggesting a magnetic field of bs~650 kg, is confirmed by spectropolarimetricobservations that reveal as much as +/- 7.5% circular polarization in many ofthe absorption lines, most notably na, mg, and fe. our combined photometric andspectroscopic fit yields teff = 6440 k, log g=7.99, log h/he=-3.0 and logca/he=-8.1. the other heavy elements have solar ratios with respect to calcium,with the exception of na and cr that had to be reduced by a factor of two andthree, respectively. a crude polarization model based upon the observed localspectral flux gradient yields a longitudinal field of 165 kg, consistent withthe mean surface field inferred from the zeeman splitting. the inclusion ofthis weak magnetic field in our synthetic spectrum calculations, even in anapproximate fashion, is shown to improve our fit significantly.

astro-ph;0608575	the sloan digital sky survey monitor telescope pipeline	the photometric calibration of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) is amulti-step process which involves data from three different telescopes: the1.0-m telescope at the us naval observatory (usno), flagstaff station, arizona(which was used to establish the sdss standard star network); the sdss 0.5-mphotometric telescope (pt) at the apache point observatory (apo), new mexico(which calculates nightly extinctions and calibrates secondary patch transferfields); and the sdss 2.5-m telescope at apo (which obtains the imaging datafor the sdss proper).  in this paper, we describe the monitor telescope pipeline, mtpipe, thesoftware pipeline used in processing the data from the single-ccd telescopesused in the photometric calibration of the sdss (i.e., the usno 1.0-m and thept). we also describe transformation equations that convert photometry on theusno-1.0m u'g'r'i'z' system to photometry the sdss 2.5m ugriz system and theresults of various validation tests of the mtpipe software. further, we discussthe semi-automated pt factory, which runs mtpipe in the day-to-day standardsdss operations at fermilab. finally, we discuss the use of mtpipe in currentsdss-related projects, including the southern u'g'r'i'z' standard star project,the u'g'r'i'z' open star clusters project, and the sdss extension (sdss-ii).

astro-ph;0703758	on the spectral evolution of cool, helium-atmosphere white dwarfs:  detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of dz stars	we present a detailed analysis of a large spectroscopic and photometricsample of dz white dwarfs based on our latest model atmosphere calculations. werevise the atmospheric parameters of the trigonometric parallax sample ofbergeron, leggett, &amp; ruiz (12 stars) and analyze 147 new dz white dwarfsdiscovered in the sloan digital sky survey. the inclusion of metals andhydrogen in our model atmosphere calculations leads to different atmosphericparameters than those derived from pure helium models. calcium abundances arefound in the range from log (ca/he) = -12 to -8. we also find that fits of thecoolest objects show peculiarities, suggesting that our physical models may notcorrectly describe the conditions of high atmospheric pressure encountered inthe coolest dz stars. we find that the mean mass of the 11 dz stars withtrigonometric parallaxes, &lt;m&gt; = 0.63 mo, is significantly lower than thatobtained from pure helium models, &lt;m&gt; = 0.78 mo, and in much better agreementwith the mean mass of other types of white dwarfs. we determine hydrogenabundances for 27% of the dz stars in our sample, while only upper limits areobtained for objects with low signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopic data. weconfirm with a high level of confidence that the accretion rate of hydrogen isat least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of metals (and up to five insome cases) to be compatible with the observations. we find a correlationbetween the hydrogen abundance and the effective temperature, suggesting forthe first time empirical evidence of a lower temperature boundary for thehydrogen screening mechanism. finally, we speculate on the possibility that thedza white dwarfs could be the result of the convective mixing of thinhydrogen-rich atmospheres with the underlying helium convection zone.

astro-ph;9710155	circumstellar shells and mass loss rates: clues to the evolution of s  stars	it is the purpose of this paper to rediscuss the circumstellar properties ofs stars and to put these properties in perspective with our currentunderstanding of the evolutionary status of s stars, in particular theintrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy. accordingly, an extensive data set probing thecircumstellar environment of s stars (iras flux densities, maser emission, corotational lines) has been collected and critically evaluated. this data setcombines new observations (9 stars have been observed in the co j=2-1 line and3 in the co j=3-2 line, with four new detections) with existing material (allco and maser observations of s stars published in the literature). the irasflux densities of s stars have been re-evaluated by co-adding the individualscans, in order to better handle the intrinsic variability of these stars inthe iras bands, and possible contamination by galactic cirrus.  mass loss rates or upper limits have been derived for all s stars observed inthe co rotational lines, and range from &lt; 2 10^{-8} msun y^{-1} for extrinsic sstars to 10^{-5} msun y^{-1}. these mass-loss rates correlate well with the k -[12] color index, which probes the dust loss rate, provided that the mass lossrate be larger than 10^{-8} msun~y^{-1}. small mass-loss rates are found forextrinsic s stars, consistent with their not being so evolved (rgb orearly-agb) as the tc-rich s stars. this result does not support the claim oftenmade in relation with symbiotic stars that binarity strongly enhances themass-loss rate.

astro-ph;9907234	the light curve and evolutionary status of the carbon star v hya	v hya, an evolved carbon star with a complex circumstellar envelope, has twovariability periods, 530d and 6000d (17 years). we analyze recent light curvedata and show that both variations have benn present for at least 100 years andhave been regular over this time. the 530d period and its 1.5 - 2 magnitudeamplitude show that v hya is a mira variable. we suggest that the star is in abinary system (as also suspected from the structure of the circumstellarenvelope) and that the 17-year variation is due to extinction by circumstellardust orbiting with the companion. the properties of the envelope found frommolecular line observations: the fast molecular wind, the relatively small sizeof the dense circumstellar envelope, and the high mass loss rate, all suggestthat v hya has entered its `superwind' phase. however, its spectral type,period, colors, and lack of ionizing radiation show that the star is still onthe agb. these properties add to the evidence that the complex structures ofmany planetary planetary nebulae, including fast stellar winds, originateduring the final phases of mass loss on the agb.

astro-ph;9912496	atomic carbon in the envelopes of carbon-rich post-agb stars	atomic carbon has been detected in the envelopes of three carbon-rich evolvedstars: hd 44179 (=afgl 915, the `red rectangle'); hd 56126; and, tentatively,the carbon star v hya. this brings to seven the number of evolved starenvelopes in which ci has been detected. upper limits were found for severalother stars, including r crb. ci was not detected in several oxygen rich postasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars (oh231.8+4.2, for example), although it isdetected in their carbon-rich analogues. two trends are evident in the data.first, circumstellar envelopes with detectable ci are overwhelmingly carbonrich, suggesting that much of the ci is produced by the dissociation ofmolecules other than co. second, the more evolved the envelope away from theagb, the higher is the ci/co ratio. the oxygen-rich supergiant star alpha oriremains the only oxygen rich star with a wind containing detectable ci. thesedata suggest an evolutionary sequence for the ci/co ratio in cool circumstellarenvelopes. this ratio is small (a few %) while the star is on the agb, and theci is located in the outer envelope and produced by photodissociation. theratio increases to about 0.5 as the star evolves away from the agb because ofthe dissociation of co and other carbon-bearing molecules by shocks caused bythe fast winds which appear at the end of evolution on the agb. finally, theratio becomes &gt;&gt; 1 as the central star becomes hot enough to photodissociateco.
