0908.1977	the 8 micron phase variation of the hot saturn hd 149026b	we monitor the star hd 149026 and its saturn-mass planet at 8.0 micron overslightly more than half an orbit using the infrared array camera (irac) on thespitzer space telescope. we find an increase of 0.0227% +/- 0.0066% (3.4 sigmasignificance) in the combined planet-star flux during this interval. theminimum flux from the planet is 45% +/- 19% of the maximum planet flux,corresponding to a difference in brightness temperature of 480 +/- 140 kbetween the two hemispheres. we derive a new secondary eclipse depth of 0.0411%+/- 0.0076% in this band, corresponding to a dayside brightness temperature of1440 +/- 150 k. our new secondary eclipse depth is half that of a previousmeasurement (3.0 sigma difference) in this same bandpass by harrington et al.(2007). we re-fit the harrington et al. (2007) data and obtain a comparablygood fit with a smaller eclipse depth that is consistent with our new value. incontrast to earlier claims, our new eclipse depth suggests that this planet'sdayside emission spectrum is relatively cool, with an 8 micron brightnesstemperature that is less than the maximum planet-wide equilibrium temperature.we measure the interval between the transit and secondary eclipse and find thatthat the secondary eclipse occurs 20.9 +7.2 / -6.5 minutes earlier (2.9 sigma)than predicted for a circular orbit, a marginally significant result. thiscorresponds to e*cos(omega) = -0.0079 +0.0027 / -0.0025 where e is the planet'sorbital eccentricity and omega is the argument of pericenter.

0911.2218	spitzer irac secondary eclipse photometry of the transiting extrasolar  planet hat-p-1b	we report spitzer/irac photometry of the transiting giant exoplanet hat-p-1bduring its secondary eclipse. this planet lies near the postulated boundarybetween the pm and pl-class of hot jupiters, and is important as a test ofmodels for temperature inversions in hot jupiter atmospheres. we derive eclipsedepths for hat-p-1b, in units of the stellar flux, that are: 0.080% +/-0.008%,[3.6um], 0.135% +/- 0.022%,[4.5um],0.203% +/- 0.031%,[5.8um], and$0.238% +/- 0.040%,[8.0um]. these values are best fit using an atmosphere witha modest temperature inversion, intermediate between the archetype invertedatmosphere (hd209458b) and a model without an inversion. the observations alsosuggest that this planet is radiating a large fraction of the available stellarirradiance on its dayside, with little available for redistribution bycirculation. this planet has sometimes been speculated to be inflated by tidaldissipation, based on its large radius in discovery observations, and on anon-zero orbital eccentricity allowed by the radial velocity data. the timingof the secondary eclipse is very sensitive to orbital eccentricity, and we findthat the central phase of the eclipse is 0.4999 +/- 0.0005. the differencebetween the expected and observed phase indicates that the orbit is close tocircular, with a 3-sigma limit of |e cosw| &lt; 0.002.

0911.3699	planetary formation and evolution revealed with a saturn entry probe:  the importance of noble gases	the determination of saturn's atmospheric noble gas abundances are criticalto understanding the formation and evolution of saturn, and giant planets ingeneral. these measurements can only be performed with an entry probe. a saturnprobe will address whether enhancement in heavy noble gases, as was found injupiter, are a general feature of giant planets, and their ratios will be apowerful constraint on how they form. the helium abundance will show the extentto which helium has phase separated from hydrogen in the planet's deepinterior. jupiter's striking neon depletion may also be tied to its heliumdepletion, and must be confirmed or refuted in saturn. together with jupiter'smeasured atmospheric helium abundance, a consistent evolutionary theory forboth planets, including "helium rain" will be possible. we will then be able tocalibrate the theory of the evolution of all giant planets, includingexoplanets. in addition, high pressure h/he mixtures under giant planetconditions are an important area of condensed matter physics that are beyondthe realm of experiment.

1002.4608	wasp-12b as a prolate, inflated and disrupting planet from tidal  dissipation	the class of exotic jupiter-mass planets that orbit very close to theirparent stars were not explicitly expected before their discovery. the recentlyfound transiting planet wasp-12b has a mass mp = 1.4(+/-0.1) jupiter masses(mj), a mean orbital distance of only 3.1 stellar radii (meaning it is subjectto intense tidal forces), and a period of 1.1 days. its radius 1.79(+/- 0.09)rj is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0.049(+/-0:015) is evenmore surprising as such close orbits are in general quickly circularized. herewe report an analysis of its properties, which reveals that the planet islosing mass to its host star at a rate ~ 10^-7 mj yr^-1. the planets surface isdistorted by the stars gravity and the light curve produced by its prolateshape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet. weconclude that dissipation of the stars tidal perturbation in the planetsconvective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. we predictup to 10mjy co band-head (2.292 micron) emission from a tenuous disk around thehost star, made up of tidally stripped planetary gas. it may also contain adetectable resonant super-earth, as a hypothetical perturber that continuallystirs up wasp-12b's eccentricity.

1004.0836	the thermal emission of the exoplanets wasp-1b and wasp-2b	we present a comparative study of the thermal emission of the transitingexoplanets wasp-1b and wasp-2b using the spitzer space telescope. the twoplanets have very similar masses but suffer different levels of irradiation andare predicted to fall either side of a sharp transition between planets withand without hot stratospheres. wasp-1b is one of the most highly irradiatedplanets studied to date. we measure planet/star contrast ratios in all four ofthe irac bands for both planets (3.6-8.0um), and our results indicate thepresence of a strong temperature inversion in the atmosphere of wasp-1b,particularly apparent at 8um, and no inversion in wasp-2b. in both cases themeasured eclipse depths favor models in which incident energy is notredistributed efficiently from the day side to the night side of the planet. wefit the spitzer light curves simultaneously with the best available radialvelocity curves and transit photometry in order to provide updated measurementsof system parameters. we do not find significant eccentricity in the orbit ofeither planet, suggesting that the inflated radius of wasp-1b is unlikely to bethe result of tidal heating. finally, by plotting ratios of secondary eclipsedepths at 8um and 4.5um against irradiation for all available planets, we findevidence for a sharp transition in the emission spectra of hot jupiters at anirradiation level of 2 x 10^9 erg/s/cm^2. we suggest this transition may be dueto the presence of tio in the upper atmospheres of the most strongly irradiatedhot jupiters.

1005.3027	near-infrared thermal emission from the hot jupiter tres-2b:  ground-based detection of the secondary eclipse	we present near-infrared ks-band photometry bracketing the secondary eclipseof the hot jupiter tres-2b using the wide-field infrared camera on thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. we detect its thermal emission with an eclipsedepth of 0.062 +/- 0.012% (5-sigma). our best-fit secondary eclipse isconsistent with a circular orbit (a 3-sigma upper limit on the eccentricity, e,and argument or periastron, omega, of |ecos(omega)| &lt; 0.0090), in agreementwith mid-infrared detections of the secondary eclipse of this planet. asecondary eclipse of this depth corresponds to a day-side ks-band brightnesstemperature of tb = 1636 +/- 88 k. our thermal emission measurement whencombined with the thermal emission measurements using spitzer/irac fromo'donovan and collaborators suggest that this planet exhibits relativelyefficient day to night-side redistribution of heat and a near isothermaldayside atmospheric temperature structure, with a spectrum that is wellapproximated by a blackbody. it is unclear if the atmosphere of tres-2brequires a temperature inversion; if it does it is likely due to chemicalspecies other than tio/vo as the atmosphere of tres-2b is too cool to allowtio/vo to remain in gaseous form. our secondary eclipse has the smallest depthof any detected from the ground at around 2 micron to date.

1006.0737	near-infrared thermal emission from tres-3b: a ks-band detection and an  h-band upper limit on the depth of the secondary eclipse	we present h and ks-band photometry bracketing the secondary eclipse of thehot jupiter tres-3b using the wide-field infrared camera on thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. we detect the secondary eclipse of tres-3b witha depth of 0.133+/-0.017% in ks-band (8-sigma) - a result in sharp contrast tothe eclipse depth reported by de mooij &amp; snellen. we do not detect its thermalemission in h-band, but place a 3-sigma limit on the depth of the secondaryeclipse in this band of 0.051%. a secondary eclipse of this depth in ksrequires very efficient day-to-nightside redistribution of heat and nearlyisotropic reradiation, conclusion that is in agreement with longer wavelength,mid-infrared spitzer observations. our 3-sigma upper-limit on the depth of ourh-band secondary eclipse also argues for very efficient redistribution of heatand suggests that the atmospheric layer probed by these observations may bewell homogenized. however, our h-band upper limit is so constraining that itsuggests the possibility of a temperature inversion at depth, or an absorbingmolecule, such as methane, that further depresses the emitted flux at thiswavelength. the combination of our near-infrared measurements and thoseobtained with spitzer suggest that tres-3b displays a near isothermal daysideatmospheric temperature structure, whose spectrum is well approximated by ablackbody. we emphasize that our strict h-band limit is in stark disagreementwith the best-fit atmospheric model that results from longer wavelengthobservations only, thus highlighting the importance of near-infraredobservations at multiple wavelengths in addition to those returned by spitzerin the mid-infrared to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the energybudgets of transiting exoplanets.

1007.2942	atmospheric circulation of eccentric hot neptune gj436b	gj436b is a unique member of the transiting extrasolar planet populationbeing one of the smallest and least irradiated and possessing an eccentricorbit. because of its size, mass and density, gj436b could plausibly have anatmospheric metallicity similar to neptune (20-60 times solar abundances),which makes it an ideal target to study the effects of atmospheric metallicityon dynamics and radiative transfer in an extrasolar planetary atmosphere. wepresent three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models that include realisticnon-gray radiative transfer for 1, 3, 10, 30, and 50 times solar atmosphericmetallicity cases of gj436b. low metallicity models (1 and 3 times solar) showlittle day/night temperature variation and strong high-latitude jets. incontrast, higher metallicity models (30 and 50 times solar) exhibit day/nighttemperature variations and a strong equatorial jet. spectra and light curvesproduced from these simulations show strong orbital phase dependencies in the50 times solar case and negligible variations with orbital phase in the 1 timessolar case. comparisons between the predicted planet/star flux ratio from thesemodels and current secondary eclipse measurements support a high metallicityatmosphere (30-50 times solar abundances) with disequilibrium carbon chemistryat play for gj436b. regardless of the actual atmospheric composition of gj436b,our models serve to illuminate how metallicity influences the atmosphericcirculation for a broad range of warm extrasolar planets.

1009.0071	near-infrared thermal emission from wasp-12b: detections of the  secondary eclipse in ks, h &amp; j	we present ks, h &amp; j-band photometry of the very highly irradiated hotjupiter wasp-12b using the wide-field infrared camera on thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. our photometry brackets the secondary eclipseof wasp-12b in the ks and h-bands, and in j-band starts in mid-eclipse andcontinues until well after the end of the eclipse. we detect its thermalemission in all three near-infrared bands. our secondary eclipse depths are0.309 +/- 0.013% in ks-band (24-sigma), 0.176 +/- 0.020% in h-band (9-sigma)and 0.131 +/- 0.028% in j-band (4-sigma). all three secondary eclipses arebest-fit with a consistent phase that is compatible with a circular orbit. bycombining our secondary eclipse times with others published in the literature,as well as the radial velocity and transit timing data for this system, we showthat there is no evidence that wasp-12b is precessing at a detectable rate, andshow that its orbital eccentricity is likely zero. our thermal emissionmeasurements also allow us to constrain the characteristics of the planet'satmosphere; our ks-band eclipse depth argues in favour of inefficient day tonightside redistribution of heat and a low bond albedo for this very highlyirradiated hot jupiter. the j and h-band brightness temperatures are slightlycooler than the ks-band brightness temperature, and thus hint at thepossibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere ofwasp-12b; the high pressure, deep atmospheric layers probed by our j and h-bandobservations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer.lastly, our best-fit ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration thanwould otherwise be expected; this may be tentative evidence for material beingtidally stripped from the planet - as was predicted for this system by li &amp;collaborators, and for which observational confirmation was recently arguablyprovided by fossati &amp; collaborators.

1009.3071	exoplanet albedo spectra and colors as a function of planet phase,  separation, and metallicity	first generation optical coronagraphic telescopes will obtain images of coolgas and ice giant exoplanets around nearby stars. the albedo spectra ofexoplanets at planet-star separations larger than about 1 au are dominated byreflected light to beyond 1 {\mu}m and are punctuated by molecular absorptionfeatures. we consider how exoplanet albedo spectra and colors vary as afunction of planet-star separation, metallicity, mass, and observed phase forjupiter and neptune analogs from 0.35 to 1 {\mu}m. we model jupiter analogswith 1x and 3x the solar abundance of heavy elements, and neptune analogs with10x and 30x. our model planets orbit a solar analog parent star at separationsof 0.8 au, 2 au, 5 au, and 10 au. we use a radiative-convective model tocompute temperature-pressure profiles. the giant exoplanets are cloud-free at0.8 au, have h2o clouds at 2 au, and have both nh3 and h2o clouds at 5 au and10 au. for each model planet we compute moderate resolution spectra as afunction of phase. the presence and structure of clouds strongly influence thespectra. since the planet images will be unresolved, their phase may not beobvious, and multiple observations will be needed to discriminate between theeffects of planet-star separation, metallicity, and phase. we consider therange of these combined effects on spectra and colors. for example, we findthat the spectral influence of clouds depends more on planet-star separationand hence temperature than metallicity, and it is easier to discriminatebetween cloudy 1x and 3x jupiters than between 10x and 30x neptunes. inaddition to alkalis and methane, our jupiter models show h2o absorptionfeatures near 0.94 {\mu}m. we also predict that giant exoplanets receivinggreater insolation than jupiter will exhibit higher equator to pole temperaturegradients than are found on jupiter and thus may have differing atmosphericdynamics.

1010.2451	transmission spectra of transiting planet atmospheres: model validation  and simulations of the hot neptune gj 436b for jwst	we explore the transmission spectrum of the neptune-class exoplanet gj 436b,including the possibility that its atmospheric opacity is dominated by avariety of non- equilibrium chemical products. we also validate ourtransmission code by demonstrating close agreement with analytic models thatuse only rayleigh scattering or water vapor opacity. we find broad disagreementwith radius variations predicted by another published model. for gj 436b, therelative coolness of the planet's atmosphere, along with its implied highmetallicity, may make it dissimilar in character compared to "hot jupiters."some recent observational and modeling efforts suggest low relative abundancesof h2o and ch4 present in gj 436b's atmosphere, compared to calculations fromequilibrium chemistry. we include these characteristics in our models andexamine the effects of absorption from methane-derived higher orderhydrocarbons. significant absorption from hcn and c2h2 are found throughout theinfrared, while c2h4 and c2h6 are less easily seen. we perform detailedsimulations of jwst observations, including all likely noise sources, and findthat we will be able to constrain chemical abundance regimes from this planet'stransmission spectrum. for instance, the width of the features at 1.5, 3.3, and7 microns indicates the amount of hcn versus c2h2 present. the nirspec prismmode will be useful due to its large spectral range and the relatively largenumber of photo-electrons recorded per spectral resolution element. however,extremely bright host stars like gj 436 may be better observed with a higherspectroscopic resolution mode in order to avoid detector saturation. we findthat observations with the miri low resolution spectrograph should also havehigh signal-to-noise in the 5 - 10 micron range due to the brightness of thestar and the relatively low spectral resolution (r ~ 100) of this mode.

(2010). we also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of thesecondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0.0024,which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain thisplanet's inflated radius.

1104.0011	broadband transmission spectroscopy of the super-earth gj 1214b suggests  a low mean molecular weight atmosphere	we used wircam on cfht to observe four transits of the super-earth gj 1214bin the near-infrared. for each transit we observed in two bandsnearly-simultaneously by rapidly switching the wircam filter wheel back andforth for the duration of the observations. by combining all our j-band (~1.25microns) observations we find a transit depth in this band of 1.338\pm0.013% -a value consistent with the optical transit depth reported by charbonneau andcollaborators. however, our best-fit combined ks-band (~2.15 microns) transitdepth is deeper: 1.438\pm0.019%. formally our ks-band transits are deeper thanthe j-band transits observed simultaneously by a factor of 1.072\pm0.018 - a4-sigma discrepancy. the most straightforward explanation for our deeperks-band depth is a spectral absorption feature from the limb of the atmosphereof the planet; for the spectral absorption feature to be this prominent theatmosphere of gj 1214b must have a large scale height and a low mean molecularweight. that is, it would have to be hydrogen/helium dominated and this planetwould be better described as a mini-neptune. however, recently publishedobservations from 0.78 - 1.0 microns, by bean and collaborators, show a lack ofspectral features and transit depths consistent with those obtained bycharbonneau and collaborators. the most likely atmospheric composition for gj1214b that arises from combining all these observations is less clear; if theatmosphere of gj 1214b is hydrogen/helium dominated then it must have either ahaze layer that is obscuring transit depth differences at shorter wavelengths,or significantly different spectral features than current models predict. ourobservations disfavour a water-world composition, but such a composition willremain a possibility until observations reconfirm our deeper ks-band transitdepth or detect features at other wavelengths.

1104.5477	the atmospheric chemistry of gj 1214b: photochemistry and clouds	recent observations of the transiting super-earth gj 1214b reveal that itsatmosphere may be hydrogen-rich or water-rich in nature, with clouds or hazespotentially affecting its transmission spectrum in the optical andvery-near-ir. here we further examine the possibility that gj 1214b does indeedpossess a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, which is the hypothesis that isfavored by models of the bulk composition of the planet. we study the effectsof non-equilibrium chemistry (photochemistry, thermal chemistry, and mixing) onthe planet's transmission spectrum. we furthermore examine the possibility thatclouds could play a significant role in attenuating gj 1214b's transmissionspectrum at short wavelengths. we find that non-equilibrium chemistry can havea large effect on the overall chemical composition of gj 1214b's atmosphere,however these changes mostly take place above the height in the atmosphere thatis probed by transmission spectroscopy. the effects of non-equilibriumchemistry on gj 1214b's transmission spectrum are therefore minimal, with thelargest effects taking place if the planet's atmosphere has super-solarmetallicity and a low rate of vertical mixing. interestingly, we find that thebest fit to the observations of gj 1214b's atmosphere in transmission occur ifthe planet's atmosphere is deficient in ch4, and possesses a cloud layer at apressure of ~200 mbar. this is consistent with a picture of efficient methanephotolysis, accompanied by formation of organic haze that obscures the loweratmosphere of gj 1214b at optical wavelengths. however, for methane to beabsent from gj 1214b's transmission spectrum, uv photolysis of this moleculemust be efficient at pressures of greater than ~1 mbar, whereas we find thatmethane only photolyzes to pressures less than 0.1 mbar, even under the mostoptimistic assumptions.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1107.2106	using star spots to measure the spin-orbit alignment of transiting  planets	spectroscopic follow-up of dozens of transiting planets has revealed thedegree of alignment between the equators of stars and the orbits of the planetsthey host. here we determine a method, applicable to spotted stars, that canreveal the same information from the photometric discovery data, with no needfor follow-up. a spot model fit to the global light curve, parametrized by thespin orientation of the star, predicts when the planet will transit the spots.observing several spot crossings during different transits then leads toconstraints on the spin-orbit alignment. in cases where stellar spots aresmall, the stellar inclination, and hence the true alignment, rather than justthe sky projection, can be obtained. this method has become possible with theadvent of space telescopes such as corot and kepler, which photometricallymonitor transiting planets over a nearly continuous, long time baseline. weapply our method to corot-2, and find the projected spin-orbit alignment angle,lambda= 4.7 deg +/- 12.3 deg, in excellent agreement with a previousdetermination that employed the rossiter-mclaughlin effect. the large spots ofthe parent star, corot-2, limit our precision on the stellar inclination: i_s =84 deg +/- 36 deg, where i_s &lt; 90 deg (&gt; 90 deg) indicates the rotation axis istilted towards (away from) the line of sight.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

0710.2558	a unified theory for the atmospheres of the hot and very hot jupiters:  two classes of irradiated atmospheres	we highlight the importance of gaseous tio and vo opacity on the highlyirradiated close-in giant planets. the atmospheres of these planets naturallyfall into two classes that are somewhat analogous to the m- and l-type dwarfs.those that are warm enough to have appreciable opacity due to tio and vo gaseswe term the ``pm class'' planets, and those that are cooler we term ``plclass'' planets. we calculate model atmospheres for these planets, includingpressure-temperature profiles, spectra, and characteristic radiative timeconstants. we show that pm class planets have hot stratospheres $\sim$2000 kand appear ``anomalously'' bright in the mid infrared secondary eclipse, as wasrecently found for planets hd 149026b and hd 209458b. this class of planetsabsorbs incident flux and emits thermal flux from high in their atmospheres.consequently, they will have large day/night temperature contrasts andnegligible phase shifts between orbital phase and thermal emission lightcurves, because radiative timescales are much shorter than possible dynamicaltimescales. the pl class planets absorb incident flux deeper in the atmospherewhere atmospheric dynamics will more readily redistribute absorbed energy. thiswill lead to cooler day sides, warmer night sides, and larger phase shifts inthermal emission light curves. around a sun-like primary this boundary occursat $\sim$0.04-0.05 au. the eccentric transiting planets hd 147506b and hd17156b alternate between the classes. thermal emission in the optical from pmclass planets is significant red-ward of 400 nm, making these planetsattractive targets for optical detection. the difference in the observedday/night contrast between ups andromeda b (pm class) and hd 189733b (pl class)is naturally explained in this scenario.

1206.4313	neglected clouds in t and y dwarf atmospheres	as brown dwarfs cool, a variety of species condense in their atmospheres,forming clouds. iron and silicate clouds shape the emergent spectra of ldwarfs, but these clouds dissipate at the l/t transition. a variety of othercondensates are expected to form in cooler t dwarf atmospheres. these includecr, mns, na2s, zns, and kcl, but the opacity of these optically thinner cloudshas not been included in previous atmosphere models. here, we examine theireffect on model t and y dwarf atmospheres. the cloud structures and opacitiesare calculated using the ackerman &amp; marley (2001) cloud model, which is coupledto an atmosphere model to produce atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles inradiative-convective equilibrium. we generate a suite of models between teff =400 and 1300 k, log g=4.0 and 5.5, and condensate sedimentation efficienciesfrom fsed=2 to 5. model spectra are compared to two red t dwarfs, ross 458c andugps 0722-05; models that include clouds are found to match observed spectrasignificantly better than cloudless models. the emergence of sulfide clouds incool atmospheres, particularly na2s, may be a more natural explanation for the"cloudy" spectra of these objects, rather than the re-emergence of silicateclouds that wane at the l-to-t transition. we find that sulfide clouds providea mechanism to match the near- and mid-infrared colors of observed t dwarfs.our results indicate that including the opacity of condensates in t dwarfatmospheres is necessary to accurately determine the physical characteristicsof many of the observed objects.

1207.5639	doppler signatures of the atmospheric circulation on hot jupiters	the meteorology of hot jupiters has been characterized primarily with thermalmeasurements, but recent observations suggest the possibility of directlydetecting the winds by observing the doppler shift of spectral lines seenduring transit. motivated by these observations, we show how dopplermeasurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. we show thatthe atmospheric circulation--and doppler signature--of hot jupiters splits intotwo regimes. under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcinggenerates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves withthe mean flow. in this regime, air along the terminator (as seen duringtransit) flows toward earth in some regions and away from earth in others,leading to a doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshiftedcomponents. under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermalforcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generatejets. strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jetformation. as a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated byhigh-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifteddoppler signature during transit. we present state-of-the-art circulationmodels including nongray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift andthe resulting doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets likegj 436b lie in the first regime, hd 189733b is transitional, while planetshotter than hd 209458b lie in the second regime. moreover, we show how theamplitude of the doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag inthe upper atmospheres of hot jupiters. if due to winds, the ~2-km/sec blueshiftinferred on hd 209458b may require drag time constants as short as 10^4-10^6seconds, possibly the result of lorentz-force braking on this planet's hotdayside.

1207.5804	alignment of the stellar spin with the orbits of a three-planet system	the sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, whichis presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseousdisk. for exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is notguaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may bemisaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magneticinteractions or torques from neighbouring stars. indeed, isolated 'hotjupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. here we report ananalysis of transits of planets over starspots on the sun-like star kepler-30,and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellarequator. furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a fewdegrees. this configuration is similar to that of our solar system, andcontrasts with the isolated hot jupiters. the orderly alignment seen in thekepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems thatexperienced disruptive dynamical interactions. should this be corroborated byobservations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-diskmisalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities ofhot jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin ofhot jupiters.

1208.3795	three-dimensional atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters on highly  eccentric orbits	of the over 800 exoplanets detected to date, over half are on non-circularorbits, with eccentricities as high as 0.93. such orbits lead to time-variablestellar heating, which has implications for the planet's atmospheric dynamicalregime. however, little is known about this dynamical regime, and how it mayinfluence observations. therefore, we present a systematic study of hotjupiters on highly eccentric orbits using the sparc/mitgcm, a model whichcouples a three-dimensional general circulation model with a plane-parallel,two-stream, non-grey radiative transfer model. in our study, we vary theeccentricity and orbit-average stellar flux over a wide range. we demonstratethat the eccentric hot jupiter regime is qualitatively similar to that ofplanets on circular orbits; the planets possess a superrotating equatorial jetand exhibit large day-night temperature variations. we show that theseday-night heating variations induce momentum fluxes equatorward to maintain thesuperrotating jet throughout its orbit. as the eccentricity and/or stellar fluxis increased, the superrotating jet strengthens and narrows, due to a smallerrossby deformation radius. for a select number of model integrations, wegenerate full-orbit lightcurves and find that the timing of transit andsecondary eclipse viewed from earth with respect to periapse and apoapse cangreatly affect what we see in infrared (ir) lightcurves; the peak in ir fluxcan lead or lag secondary eclipse depending on the geometry. for those planetsthat have large day-night temperature variations and rapid rotation rates, wefind that the lightcurves exhibit "ringing" as the planet's hottest regionrotates in and out of view from earth. these results can be used to explainfuture observations of eccentric transiting exoplanets.

1302.1141	infrared transmission spectroscopy of the exoplanets hd209458b and xo-1b  using the wide field camera-3 on the hubble space telescope	exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared usinghubble/nicmos is currently ambiguous because different observational groupsclaim different results from the same data, depending on their analysismethodologies. spatial scanning with hubble/wfc3 provides an opportunity toresolve this ambiguity. we here report wfc3 spectroscopy of the giant planetshd209458b and xo-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximumphoton-collecting efficiency. we introduce an analysis technique that derivesthe exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitlydecorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limitedprecision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. ourerrors are within 6-percent (xo-1) and 26-percent (hd209458b) of thephoton-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than0.01-percent per spectral channel. both planets exhibit water absorption ofapproximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. our result for xo-1bcontradicts the much larger absorption derived from nicmos spectroscopy. theweak water absorption we measure for hd209458b is reminiscent of the weaknessof sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanetatmosphere by charbonneau et al. (2002). model atmospheres havinguniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram accountapproximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in thisplanet. our results for hd209458b support the picture advocated by pont et al.(2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmissionspectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.however, the extra opacity needed for hd209458b is grayer than for hd189733b,with a weaker rayleigh component.

1305.0980	deuterium burning in massive giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs  formed by core-nucleated accretion	formation of bodies near the deuterium-burning limit is considered bydetailed numerical simulations according to the core-nucleated giant planetaccretion scenario. the objects, with heavy-element cores in the range 5-30mearth, are assumed to accrete gas up to final masses of 10-15 jupiter masses(mjup). after the formation process, which lasts 1-5 myr and which ends with a'cold-start', low-entropy configuration, the bodies evolve at constant mass upto an age of several gyr. deuterium burning via proton capture is included inthe calculation, and we determined the mass, m50, above which more than 50% ofthe initial deuterium is burned. this often-quoted borderline between giantplanets and brown dwarfs is found to depend only slightly on parameters, suchas core mass, stellar mass, formation location, solid surface density in theprotoplanetary disk, disk viscosity, and dust opacity. the values for m50 fallin the range 11.6-13.6 mjup, in agreement with previous determinations that donot take the formation process into account. for a given opacity law during theformation process, objects with higher core masses form more quickly. theresult is higher entropy in the envelope at the completion of accretion,yielding lower values of m50. for masses above m50, during thedeuterium-burning phase, objects expand and increase in luminosity by 1 to 3orders of magnitude. evolutionary tracks in the luminosity-versus-time diagramare compared with the observed position of the companion to beta pictoris.

1305.4124	quantitatively assessing the role of clouds in the transmission spectrum  of gj 1214b	recent observations of the super-earth gj 1214b show that it has a relativelyfeatureless transmission spectrum. one suggestion is that these observationsindicate that the planet's atmosphere is vertically compact, perhaps due to awater-rich composition that yields a large mean molecular weight. anothersuggestion is that the atmosphere is hydrogen/helium-rich with clouds thatobscure predicted absorption features. previous models that incorporate cloudshave included their effect without a strong physical motivation for theirexistence. here, we present model atmospheres of gj 1214b that includephysically-motivated clouds of two types. we model the clouds that form as aresult of condensation in chemical equilibrium, as they likely do on browndwarfs, which include kcl and zns for this planet. we also include clouds thatform as a result of photochemistry, forming a hydrocarbon haze layer. we use aphotochemical kinetics model to understand the vertical distribution andavailable mass of haze-forming molecules. we model both solar andenhanced-metallicity cloudy models and determine the cloud properties necessaryto match observations. in enhanced-metallicity atmospheres, we find that theequilibrium clouds can match the observations of gj 1214b if they are loftedhigh into the atmosphere and have a low sedimentation efficiency (fsed=0.1). wefind that models with a variety of hydrocarbon haze properties can match theobservations. particle sizes from 0.01 to 0.25 micron can match thetransmission spectrum with haze-forming efficiencies as low as 1-5%.

1306.4329	a framework for characterizing the atmospheres of low-mass low-density  transiting planets	we perform modeling investigations to aid in understanding the atmospheresand composition of small planets of ~2-4 earth radii, which are now known to becommon in our galaxy. gj 1214b is a well studied example whose atmospherictransmission spectrum has been observed by many investigators. here we take astep back from gj 1214b to investigate the role that planetary mass,composition, and temperature play in impacting the transmission spectra ofthese low-mass low-density (lmld) planets. under the assumption that theseplanets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we usepopulation synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of theh/he envelope are high, with metal mass fraction z_env values commonly 0.6 to0.9, or ~100 to 400+ times solar. the high mean molecular weight of suchatmospheres (\mu ~ 5-12) would naturally help to flatten the transmissionspectrum of most lmld planets. the high metal abundance would also providesignificant condensible material for cloud formation. it is known that the h/heabundance in uranus and neptune decreases with depth, and we show thatatmospheric evaporation of lmld planets could expose atmospheric layers withgradually higher z_env. however, values of z_env close to solar composition canalso arise, so diversity should be expected. photochemically produced hazes,potentially due to methane photolysis, are another possibility for obscuringtransmission spectra. such hazes may not form above t_eq of ~800-1100 k, whichis testable if such warm, otherwise low mean molecular weight atmospheres arestable against atmospheric evaporation. we find that available transmissiondata are consistent with relatively high mean molecular weight atmospheres forgj 1214b and "warm neptune" gj 436b. we examine future prospects forcharacterizing gj 1214b with hubble and the james webb space telescope.

1310.6048	a ground-based optical transmission spectrum of wasp-6b	we present a ground based optical transmission spectrum of the inflatedsub-jupiter mass planet wasp-6b. the spectrum was measured in twenty spectralchannels from 480 nm to 860nm using a series of 91 spectra over a completetransit event. the observations were carried out using multi-objectdifferential spectrophotometry with the imacs spectrograph on the baadetelescope at las campanas observatory. we model systematic effects on theobserved light curves using principal component analysis on the comparisonstars, and allow for the presence of short and long memory correlationstructure in our monte carlo markov chain analysis of the transit light curvesfor wasp-6. the measured transmission spectrum presents a general trend ofdecreasing apparent planetary size with wavelength and lacks evidence for broadspectral features of na and k predicted by clear atmosphere models. thespectrum is consistent with that expected for scattering that is more efficientin the blue, as could be caused by hazes or condensates in the atmosphere ofwasp-6b. wasp-6b therefore appears to be yet another massive exoplanet withevidence for a mostly featureless transmission spectrum, underscoring theimportance that hazes and condensates can have in determining the transmissionspectra of exoplanets.

1310.7988	a rocky composition for an earth-sized exoplanet	planets with sizes between that of earth (with radius r$_\oplus$) and neptune(about 4 r$_\oplus$) are now known to be common around sun-like stars. mostsuch planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which theplanet's size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by theplanet as it passes in front of its star. measuring the planet's mass-and henceits density, which is a clue to its composition-is more difficult. planets ofsize 2-4 r$_\oplus$ have proven to have a wide range of densities, implying adiversity of compositions, but these measurements did not extend down toplanets as small as earth. here we report doppler spectroscopic measurements ofthe mass of the earth-sized planet kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every8.5 hours. given a radius of 1.20 $\pm$ 0.09 r$_\oplus$ and mass of 1.69 $\pm$0.41 m$_\oplus$, the planet's mean density of 5.3 $\pm$ 1.8 g cm$^{-3}$ issimilar to the earth's, suggesting a composition of rock and iron.

1311.0329	understanding the mass-radius relation for sub-neptunes: radius as a  proxy for composition	transiting planet surveys like kepler have provided a wealth of informationon the distribution of planetary radii, particularly for the new populations ofsuper-earth and sub-neptune sized planets. in order to aid in the physicalinterpretation of these radii, we compute model radii for low-mass rockyplanets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. we provide model radii for planets 1-20earth masses, with envelope fractions from 0.01-20%, levels of irradiation0.1-1000x earth's, and ages from 100 myr to 10 gyr. in addition we providesimple analytic fits that summarize how radius depends on each of theseparameters. most importantly, we show that at fixed composition, radii showlittle dependence on mass for planets with more than ~1% of their mass in theirenvelope. consequently, planetary radius is to first order a proxy forplanetary composition for neptune and sub-neptune sized planets. we recast theobserved mass-radius relationship as a mass-composition relationship anddiscuss it in light of traditional core accretion theory. we discuss thetransition from rocky super-earths to sub-neptune planets with large volatileenvelopes. we suggest 1.75 earth radii as a physically motivated dividing linebetween these two populations of planets. finally, we discuss these results inlight of the observed radius occurrence distribution found by kepler.

0802.0327	atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters: three-dimensional circulation  models of hd 209458b and hd 189733b with simplified forcing	we present global, three-dimensional numerical simulations of the atmosphericcirculation on hd 209458b and hd 189733b and calculate the infrared spectra andlight curves predicted by these simulations, which we compare with availableobservations. radiative heating/cooling is parameterized with a simplifiednewtonian relaxation scheme. our simulations develop day-night temperaturecontrasts that vary strongly with pressure. at low pressure (&lt;10 mbar), airflows from the substellar point toward the antistellar point, both along theequator and over the poles. at deeper levels, the flow develops an eastwardequatorial jet with speeds of 3-4 km/sec, with weaker westward flows at highlatitudes. this basic flow pattern is robust to variations in model resolution,gravity, radiative time constant, and initial temperature structure. nightsidespectra show deep absorption bands of h2o, co, and/or ch4, whereas on thedayside these absorption bands flatten out or even flip into emission. thisresults from the strong effect of dynamics on the vertical temperature-pressurestructure; the temperature decreases strongly with altitude on the nightsidebut becomes almost isothermal on the dayside. in spitzer bandpasses, ourpredicted planet-to-star flux ratios vary by a factor of 2-10 with orbitalphase, depending on the wavelength and chemistry. for hd 189733b, where adetailed 8-micron light curve has been obtained, we correctly produce theobserved phase offset of the flux maximum, but we do not explain the fluxminimum and we overpredict the total flux variation. this discrepancy likelyresults from the simplifications inherent in the newtonian relaxation schemeand provides motivation for incorporating realistic radiative transfer infuture studies.

1311.6322	a non-grey analytical model for irradiated atmospheres. ii: analytical  vs. numerical solutions	the recent discovery and characterization of the diversity of the atmospheresof exoplanets and brown dwarfs calls for the development of fast and accurateanalytical models. we quantify the accuracy of the analytical solution derivedin paper i for an irradiated, non-grey atmosphere by comparing it to astate-of-the-art radiative transfer model. then, using a grid of numericalmodels, we calibrate the different coefficients of our analytical model forirradiated solar-composition atmospheres of giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs.  we show that the so-called eddington approximation used to solve the angulardependency of the radiation field leads to relative errors of up to 5% on thetemperature profile. we show that for realistic non-grey planetary atmospheres,the presence of a convective zone that extends to optical depths smaller thanunity can lead to changes in the radiative temperature profile on the order of20% or more. when the convective zone is located at deeper levels (such as forstrongly irradiated hot jupiters), its effect on the radiative atmosphere issmaller. we show that the temperature inversion induced by a strong absorber inthe optical, such as tio or vo is mainly due to non-grey thermal effectsreducing the ability of the upper atmosphere to cool down rather than anenhanced absorption of the stellar light as previously thought.  finally, we provide a functional form for the coefficients of our analyticalmodel for solar-composition giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. this leads tofully analytical pressure-temperature profiles for irradiated atmospheres witha relative accuracy better than 10% for gravities between 2.5m/s^2 and 250m/s^2 and effective temperatures between 100 k and 3000 k. this is a greatimprovement over the commonly used eddington boundary condition.

0705.0993	a map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet hd 189733b	"hot jupiter" extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked becausethey are close (&lt;0.05 astronomical units, where 1 au is the average sun-earthdistance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides andnightsides. by observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipseeach other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of thedaysides of these planets. a key question is whether the atmosphere is able totransport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which willdetermine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. here wereport observations of hd 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetarysystems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' ofthe distribution of temperatures. we detected the increase in brightness as thedayside of the planet rotated into view. we estimate a minimum brightnesstemperature of 973 +/- 33 k and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11k at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiateddayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast toa recent claim for another hot jupiter. our data indicate that the peakhemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16$\pm$6 degrees before opposition,corresponding to a hot spot shifted east of the substellar point. the secondaryeclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later thanpredicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.

0802.1705	multi-wavelength constraints on the day-night circulation patterns of hd  189733b	we present new spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot jupiterhd 189733b in the mips 24 micron bandpass, spanning the same part of theplanet's orbit as our previous observations in the irac 8 micron bandpass(knutson et al. 2007). we find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux fromthe planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this correspondsto minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-48 k and 1220 +/- 47 k, respectively. the planet reaches its maximum flux at anorbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30degrees east of the substellar point. because tidally locked hot jupiters wouldhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, thesmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet'satmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the nightside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperaturedifferences. the similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for hd189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in afundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these twowavelengths. one-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8micron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron,although the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. ifthese two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that thetemperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence thatthe atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes.

1401.1499	the atmospheres of earth-like planets after giant impact events	it is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturallyinvolves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well known example.in the aftermath of such collisions the surface of the surviving planet is veryhot and potentially detectable. here we explore the atmospheric chemistry,photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrialplanets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of co2, andh2o. the atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently foratmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting eitherthe bulk silicate earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere andoceans) or earth's continental crust. we account for all major molecular andatomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. we find thatthese atmospheres are dominated by h2o and co2, while the formation of ch4, andnh3 is quenched due to short dynamical timescales. other important constituentsare hf, hcl, nacl, and so2. these are apparent in the emerging spectra, and canbe indicative that an impact has occurred. the use of comprehensive opacitiesresults in spectra that are a factor of 2 lower in surface brightness in thespectral windows than predicted by previous models. the estimated luminositiesshow that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable withnear-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30m-class telescopes. the 1-4umregion will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features andbetter contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. we derivecooling timescales on the order of 10^5-10^6 myrs, based on the modeledeffective temperatures. this leads to the possibility of discovering tens ofsuch planets in future surveys.

1401.1898	the atmospheric circulation of the super earth gj 1214b: dependence on  composition and metallicity	we present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of gj 1214b, a2.7 earth-radius, 6.5 earth-mass super earth detected by the mearth survey.here we explore the planet's circulation as a function of atmosphericmetallicity and atmospheric composition, modeling atmospheres with a lowmean-molecular weight (i.e., h2-dominated) and a high mean-molecular weight(i.e. water- and co2-dominated). we find that atmospheres with a lowmean-molecular weight have strong day-night temperature variations at pressuresabove the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superrotation. for theseatmospheres, the enhancement of atmospheric opacities with increasingmetallicity lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperaturevariations and hence stronger superrotation. in comparison, atmospheres with ahigh mean-molecular weight have larger day-night and equator-to-poletemperature variations than low mean-molecular weight atmospheres, butdifferences in opacity structure and energy budget lead to differences in jetstructure. the circulation of a water-dominated atmosphere is dominated byequatorial superrotation, while the circulation of a co2-dominated atmosphereis instead dominated by high-latitude jets. by comparing emergent flux spectraand lightcurves for 50x solar and water-dominated compositions, we show thatobservations in emission can break the degeneracy in determining theatmospheric composition of gj 1214b. the variation in opacity with wavelengthfor the water-dominated atmosphere leads to large phase variations within waterbands and small phase variations outside of water bands. the 50x solaratmosphere, however, yields small variations within water bands and large phasevariations at other characteristic wavelengths. these observations would bemuch less sensitive to clouds, condensates, and hazes than transitobservations.

1406.3314	titan solar occultation observations reveal transit spectra of a hazy  world	high altitude clouds and hazes are integral to understanding exoplanetobservations, and are proposed to explain observed featureless transit spectra.however, it is difficult to make inferences from these data because of the needto disentangle effects of gas absorption from haze extinction. here, we turn tothe quintessential hazy world -- titan -- to clarify how high altitude hazesinfluence transit spectra. we use solar occultation observations of titan'satmosphere from the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (vims) aboardnasa's cassini spacecraft to generate transit spectra. data span 0.88-5 micronsat a resolution of 12-18 nm, with uncertainties typically smaller than 1%. ourapproach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transitradius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering,refraction, and gas absorption. we use a simple model of haze extinction toexplore how titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. our spectra show strongmethane absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. mostimportantly, the data demonstrate that high altitude hazes can severely limitthe atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations topressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength. unlike the usualassumption made when modeling and interpreting transit observations ofpotentially hazy worlds, the slope set by haze in our spectra is not flat, andcreates a variation in transit height whose magnitude is comparable to thosefrom the strongest gaseous absorption features. these findings have importantconsequences for interpreting future exoplanet observations, including thosefrom nasa's james webb space telescope.

(2008) to include lower pressures, finertemperature resolution, and also the higher metallicities most relevant forgiant planet atmospheres. calculations span 1 microbar to 300 bar, and 75 k to4000 k, in a nearly square grid. opacities at metallicities from solar to 50times solar abundances are calculated. we also provide an analytic fit to therosseland mean opacities over the grid in pressure, temperature, andmetallicity. in addition to computing mean opacities at these localtemperatures, we also calculate them with weighting functions up to 7000 k, tosimulate the mean opacities for incident stellar intensities, rather thanlocally thermally emitted intensities. the chemical equilibrium calculationsaccount for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and areapplicable to cloud-free giant planet and ultracool dwarf atmospheres, but notcircumstellar disks. we provide our extensive opacity tables for public use.

1409.5108	atmospheric circulation of eccentric hot jupiter hat-p-2b	the hot-jupiter hat-p-2b has become a prime target for spitzer spacetelescope observations aimed at understanding the atmospheric response ofexoplanets on highly eccentric orbits. here we present a suite ofthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models for hat-p-2b that investigatethe effects of assumed atmospheric composition and rotation rate on globalscale winds and thermal patterns. we compare and contrast atmospheric modelsfor hat-p-2b, which assume one and five times solar metallicity, both with andwithout tio/vo as atmospheric constituents. additionally we compare models thatassume a rotation period of half, one, and two times the nominalpseudo-synchronous rotation period. we find that changes in assumed atmosphericmetallicity and rotation rate do not significantly affect model predictions ofthe planetary flux as a function of orbital phase. however, models in whichtio/vo are present in the atmosphere develop a transient temperature inversionbetween the transit and secondary eclipse events that results in significantvariations in the timing and magnitude of the peak of the planetary fluxcompared with models in which tio/vo are omitted from the opacity tables. wefind that no one single atmospheric model can reproduce the recently observedfull orbit phase curves at 3.6, 4.5 and 8.0 microns, which is likely due to achemical process not captured by our current atmospheric models for hat-p-2b.further modeling and observational efforts focused on understanding thechemistry of hat-p-2b's atmosphere are needed and could provide key insightsinto the interplay between radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes in awide range of exoplanet atmospheres.

1409.5336	new analysis indicates no thermal inversion in the atmosphere of hd  209458b	an important focus of exoplanet research is the determination of theatmospheric temperature structure of strongly irradiated gas giant planets, orhot jupiters. hd 209458b is the prototypical exoplanet for atmospheric thermalinversions, but this assertion does not take into account recently obtaineddata or newer data reduction techniques. we re-examine this claim byinvestigating all publicly available spitzer space telescope secondary-eclipsephotometric data of hd 209458b and performing a self-consistent analysis. weemploy data reduction techniques that minimize stellar centroid variations,apply sophisticated models to known spitzer systematics, and account fortime-correlated noise in the data. we derive new secondary-eclipse depths of0.119 +/- 0.007%, 0.123 +/- 0.006%, 0.134 +/- 0.035%, and 0.215 +/- 0.008% inthe 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron bandpasses, respectively. we feed theseresults into a bayesian atmospheric retrieval analysis and determine that it isunnecessary to invoke a thermal inversion to explain our secondary-eclipsedepths. the data are well-fitted by a temperature model that decreasesmonotonically between pressure levels of 1 and 0.01 bars. we conclude thatthere is no evidence for a thermal inversion in the atmosphere of hd 209458b.

1410.2255	a precise water abundance measurement for the hot jupiter wasp-43b	the water abundance in a planetary atmosphere provides a key constraint onthe planet's primordial origins because water ice is expected to play animportant role in the core accretion model of planet formation. however, thewater content of the solar system giant planets is not well known because wateris sequestered in clouds deep in their atmospheres. by contrast, short-periodexoplanets have such high temperatures that their atmospheres have water in thegas phase, making it possible to measure the water abundance for these objects.we present a precise determination of the water abundance in the atmosphere ofthe 2 $m_\mathrm{jup}$ short-period exoplanet wasp-43b based on thermalemission and transmission spectroscopy measurements obtained with the hubblespace telescope. we find the water content is consistent with the valueexpected in a solar composition gas at planetary temperatures (0.4-3.5x solarat 1 $\sigma$ confidence). the metallicity of wasp-43b's atmosphere suggestedby this result extends the trend observed in the solar system of lower metalenrichment for higher planet masses.

1410.2382	the atmospheric circulation of the hot jupiter wasp-43b: comparing  three-dimensional models to spectrophotometric data	the hot jupiter wasp-43b has now joined the ranks of transiting hot jupitershd 189733b and hd 209458b as an exoplanet with a large array of observationalconstraints on its atmospheric properties. because wasp-43b receives a similarstellar flux as hd 209458b but has a rotation rate 4 times faster and a muchhigher gravity, studying wasp-43b serves as a test of the effect of rotationrate and gravity on the circulation when stellar irradiation is heldapproximately constant. here we present 3d atmospheric circulation models ofwasp-43b using the sparc/mitgcm, a coupled radiation and circulation model,exploring the effects of composition, metallicity, and frictional drag. we findthat the circulation regime of wasp-43b is not unlike other hot jupiters, withequatorial superrotation that yields an eastward-shifted hotspot and largeday-night temperature variations (~600 k at photospheric pressures). we thencompare our model results to observations from stevenson et al. which utilizehst/wfc3 to collect spectrophotometric phase curve measurements of wasp-43bfrom 1.12-1.65 microns. our results show the 5x solar model lightcurve providesa good match to the data, with a phase offset of peak flux and planet/star fluxratio that is similar to observations; however, the model nightside appears tobe brighter. nevertheless, our 5x solar model provides an excellent match tothe wfc3 dayside emission spectrum. this is a major success, as the result is anatural outcome of the 3d dynamics with no model tuning, and differssignificantly from 1d models that can generally only match observations whenappropriately tuned. in sum, these results demonstrate that 3d circulationmodels can provide important insights in interpreting exoplanet atmosphericobservations, even at high spectral resolution, and highlight the potential forfuture observations with hst, jwst and other next-generation telescopes.

1411.4731	three-dimensional atmospheric circulation of warm and hot jupiters:  effects of orbital distance, rotation period, and non-synchronous rotation	efforts to characterize extrasolar giant planet (egp) atmospheres have so faremphasized planets within 0.05 au of their stars. despite this focus, knownegps populate a continuum of orbital separations from canonical hot jupitervalues (0.03-0.05 au) out to 1 au and beyond. unlike typical hot jupiters,these more distant egps will not in general be synchronously rotating. inanticipation of observations of this population, we here presentthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models exploring the dynamics thatemerge over a broad range of rotation rates and incident stellar fluxesappropriate for warm and hot jupiters. we find that the circulation resides inone of two basic regimes. on typical hot jupiters, the strong day-night heatingcontrast leads to a broad, fast superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet andlarge day-night temperature differences. at faster rotation rates and lowerincident fluxes, however, the day-night heating gradient becomes lessimportant, and baroclinic instabilities emerge as a dominant player, leading toeastward jets in the midlatitudes, minimal temperature variations in longitude,and, in many cases, weak winds at the equator. our most rapidly rotating andleast irradiated models exhibit multiple eastward jets in eachhemisphere--similar to the jets on jupiter and saturn--and illuminate thedynamical continuum between highly irradiated egps and the weakly irradiatedgiant planets of our own solar system. we present infrared (ir) light curvesand spectra of these models, which show that the amplitude and offset of the irphase variation, as well as the shape of the spectra, depend significantly onincident flux and rotation rate. this provides a way to identify the regimetransition in future observations and suggests that, in some cases, ir lightcurves can provide constraints on the rotation rate of non-synchronouslyrotating planets.

1411.7404	spitzer secondary eclipses of the dense, modestly-irradiated, giant  exoplanet hat-p-20b using pixel-level decorrelation	hat-p-20b is a giant exoplanet that orbits a metal-rich star. the planetitself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a highmetallicity in its atmosphere. we analyze two eclipses of the planet in each ofthe 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of warm spitzer. these data exhibit intra-pixeldetector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditionaldecorrelation methods. we have developed a simple, powerful, and radicallydifferent method to correct the intra-pixel effect for warm spitzer data, whichwe call pixel-level decorrelation (pld). pld corrects the intra-pixel effectvery effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - thefluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. we illustrate andvalidate pld using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results toprevious analyses. pld can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise inspitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to beintractable using other methods. our successful pld analysis of four hat-p-20beclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29k, indicatinginefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strongmolecular absorption. we find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength byspitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for jwst spectroscopy. allfour eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating aslightly eccentric orbit. a joint fit of the eclipse and transit times withextant rv data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), andestablishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence.given the existence of a bound stellar companion, hat-p-20b is anotherexcellent candidate for orbital evolution via kozai migration or otherthree-body mechanism.

1412.2996	detection of the secondary eclipse of wasp-10b in the ks-band	wasp-10b, a non-inflated hot jupiter, was discovered around a k-dwarf in anear circular orbit ($\sim $$0.06$). since its discovery in 2009, differentpublished parameters for this system have led to a discussion about the size,density, and eccentricity of this exoplanet. in order to test the hypothesis ofa circular orbit for wasp-10b, we have observed its secondary eclipse in theks-band, where the contribution of planetary light is high enough to bedetected from the ground. observations were performed with the omega2000instrument at the 3.5-meter telescope at calar alto (almer\'ia, spain), instaring mode during 5.4 continuous hours, with the telescope defocused,monitoring the target during the expected secondary eclipse. a relative lightcurve was generated and corrected from systematic effects, using the principalcomponent analysis (pca) technique. the final light curve was fitted using atransit model to find the eclipse depth and a possible phase shift. the bestmodel obtained from the markov chain monte carlo analysis resulted in aneclipse depth of $\delta f$ of $0.137\%^{+0.013\%}_{-0.019\%}$ and a phaseoffset of $\delta \phi $ of $-0.0028^{+0.0005}_{-0.0004}$. the eclipse phaseoffset derived from our modeling has systematic errors that were not taken intoaccount and should not be considered as evidence of an eccentric orbit. theoffset in phase obtained leads to a value for $|e\cos{\omega}|$ of $0.0044$.the derived eccentricity is too small to be of any significance.

1503.03173	low false-positive rate of kepler candidates estimated from a  combination of spitzer and follow-up observations	(abridged) nasa's kepler mission has provided several thousand transitingplanet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fractionof bona fide planets. estimating the rate of false positives of the overallkepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. we present theresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with thespitzer telescope during the the kepler mission. these observations arededicated to estimating the false positive rate (fpr) amongst the keplercandidates. we select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges instellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transitswith spitzer at 4.5 microns. we use these observations to measures thecandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. a bandpass-dependent depthalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the sourceof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. for most of the candidates(85%), the transit depths measured with kepler are consistent with the depthsmeasured with spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that themost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars thatdilute the photometry. the spitzer constraints on their own yield fprs between5-40%, depending on the kois. by considering the population of the kepler fieldstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, wefind that the overall fpr of our sample is low. the measured upper limit on thefpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. this observationalresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that isnot investigated by the kepler observations, provides an independent indicationthat kepler's false positive rate is low.

1504.05586	a detection of water in the transmission spectrum of the hot jupiter  wasp-12b and implications for its atmospheric composition	detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements oftheir atmospheric properties that constrain the planets' origins and evolution.for example, past observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hotjupiter wasp-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a high carbon-to-oxygenratio (c/o $&gt;$ 1), suggesting it had a different formation pathway than iscommonly assumed for giant planets. here we report a precise near-infraredtransmission spectrum for wasp-12b based on six transit observations with thehubble space telescope/wide field camera 3. we bin the data in 13spectrophotometric light curves from 0.84 - 1.67 $\mu$m and measure the transitdepths to a median precision of 51 ppm. we retrieve the atmospheric propertiesusing the transmission spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption(7$\sigma$ confidence). this detection marks the first high-confidence,spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of wasp-12b. theretrieved 1$\sigma$ water volume mixing ratio is between $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$,which is consistent with c/o $&gt;$ 1 to within 2$\sigma$. however, we alsointroduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits for c/o and metallicityunder the assumption of chemical equilibrium. with this approach, we constrainc/o to $0.5^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ at $1\,\sigma$ and rule out a carbon-rich atmospherecomposition (c/o$&gt;1$) at $&gt;3\sigma$ confidence. further observations andmodeling of the planet's global thermal structure and dynamics would aid inresolving the tension between our inferred c/o and previous constraints. ourfindings highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data withmultiple observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on thechemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.

(2007)giant planet thermal evolution models that include formation by coreaccretion-gas capture. these relatively cool "young jupiters" can be 1-6magnitudes fainter than predicted by standard cooling tracks that include atraditional initial condition, which may provide a diagnostic of formation. ifcorrect, this would make true jupiter-like planets much more difficult todetect at young ages than previously thought. since jupiter and saturn are ofdistinctly super-solar composition, we examine emitted spectra for modelplanets at both solar metallicity and a metallicity of 5 times solar. thesemetal-enhanced young jupiters have lower pressure photospheres than field browndwarfs of the same effective temperatures arising from both lower surfacegravities and enhanced atmospheric opacity. we highlight several diagnosticsfor enhanced metallicity. a stronger co absorption band at 4.5 $\mu$m for thewarmest objects is predicted. at all temperatures, enhanced flux in $k$ band isexpected due to reduced collisional induced absorption by h$_2$. this leads tocorrespondingly redder near infrared colors, which are redder than solarmetallicity models with the same surface gravity by up to 0.7 in $j-k$ and 1.5in $h-k$. molecular absorption band depths increase as well, most significantlyfor the coolest objects. we also qualitatively assess the changes to emittedspectra due to nonequilibrium chemistry.

1508.00902	spitzer secondary eclipse observations of five cool gas giant planets  and empirical trends in cool planet emission spectra	in this work we present spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron secondary eclipseobservations of five new cool (&lt;1200 k) transiting gas giant planets:hat-p-19b, wasp-6b, wasp-10b, wasp-39b, and wasp-67b. we compare our measuredeclipse depths to the predictions of a suite of atmosphere models and toeclipse depths for planets with previously published observations in order toconstrain the temperature- and mass-dependent properties of gas giant planetatmospheres. we find that the dayside emission spectra of planets less massivethan jupiter require models with efficient circulation of energy to the nightside and/or increased albedos, while those with masses greater than that ofjupiter are consistently best-matched by models with inefficient circulationand low albedos. at these relatively low temperatures we expect the atmosphericmethane to co ratio to vary as a function of metallicity, and we therefore useour observations of these planets to constrain their atmospheric metallicities.we find that the most massive planets have dayside emission spectra that arebest-matched by solar metallicity atmosphere models, but we are not able toplace strong constraints on metallicities of the smaller planets in our sample.interestingly, we find that the ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron brightnesstemperatures for these cool transiting planets is independent of planettemperature, and instead exhibits a tentative correlation with planet mass. ifthis trend can be confirmed, it would suggest that the shape of these planets'emission spectra depends primarily on their masses, consistent with thehypothesis that lower-mass planets are more likely to have metal-richatmospheres.

1510.00067	re-inflated warm jupiters around red giants	since the discovery of the first transiting hot jupiters, models have soughtto explain the anomalously large radii of highly irradiated gas giants. we nowknow that the size of hot jupiter radius anomalies scales strongly with aplanet's level of irradiation and numerous models like tidal heating, ohmicdissipation, and thermal tides have since been developed to help explain theseinflated radii. in general however, these models can be grouped into two broadcategories: 1) models that directly inflate planetary radii by depositing afraction of the incident irradiation into the interior and 2) models thatsimply slow a planet's radiative cooling allowing it to retain more heat fromformation and thereby delay contraction. here we present a new test todistinguish between these two classes of models. gas giants orbiting atmoderate orbital periods around post main sequence stars will experienceenormous increases their irradiation as their host stars move up the sub-giantand red-giant branches. if hot jupiter inflation works by depositingirradiation into the planet's deep interiors then planetary radii shouldincrease in response to the increased irradiation. this means that otherwisenon-inflated gas giants at moderate orbital periods &gt;10 days can re-inflate astheir host stars evolve. here we explore the circumstances that can lead to thecreation of these "re-inflated" gas giants and examine how the existence orabsence of such planets can be used to place unique constraints of the physicsof the hot jupiter inflation mechanism. finally, we explore the prospects fordetecting this potentially important undiscovered population of planets.

1511.05528	characterizing transiting exoplanet atmospheres with jwst	we explore how well james webb space telescope (jwst) spectra will likelyconstrain bulk atmospheric properties of transiting exoplanets. we start bymodeling the atmospheres of archetypal hot jupiter, warm neptune, warmsub-neptune, and cool super-earth planets with clear, cloudy, or high meanmolecular weight atmospheres. next we simulate the $\lambda = 1 - 11$ $\mu$mtransmission and emission spectra of these systems for several jwst instrumentmodes for single transit and eclipse events. we then perform retrievals todetermine how well temperatures and molecular mixing ratios (ch$_4$, co,co$_2$, h$_2$o, nh$_3$) can be constrained. we find that $\lambda = 1 - 2.5$$\mu$m transmission spectra will often constrain the major molecularconstituents of clear solar composition atmospheres well. cloudy or high meanmolecular weight atmospheres will often require full $1 - 11$ $\mu$m spectrafor good constraints, and emission data may be more useful in cases ofsufficiently high $f_p$ and high $f_p/f_*$. strong temperature inversions inthe solar composition hot jupiter atmosphere should be detectable with $1 -2.5+$ $\mu$m emission spectra, and $1 - 5+$ $\mu$m emission spectra willconstrain the temperature-pressure profiles of warm planets. transmissionspectra over $1 - 5+$ $\mu$m will constrain [fe/h] values to better than 0.5dex for the clear atmospheres of the hot and warm planets studied.carbon-to-oxygen ratios can be constrained to better than a factor of 2 in somesystems. we expect that these results will provide useful predictions of thescientific value of single event jwst spectra until its on-orbit performance isknown.

1512.04341	a continuum from clear to cloudy hot-jupiter exoplanets without  primordial water depletion	thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectralanalysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number ofexoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1to 1.7 {\mu}m). recent studies show that some hot-jupiter exoplanets have muchweaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted.the low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low waterabundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetarydisk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this levelof depletion can actually occur. alternatively, these weak signals could be theresult of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra.here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot jupiters coveringthe wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both theoptical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. ourresults reveal a diverse group of hot jupiters that exhibit a continuum fromclear to cloudy atmospheres. we find that the difference between the planetaryradius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric fordistinguishing different atmosphere types. the difference correlates with thespectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen inclear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with cloudsand hazes. this result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion duringformation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weakerspectral signatures.

1512.07090	neptune's dynamic atmosphere from kepler k2 observations: implications  for brown dwarf light curve analyses	observations of neptune with the kepler space telescope yield a 49-day lightcurve with 98% coverage at a 1-minute cadence. a significant signature in thelight curve comes from discrete cloud features. we compare results extractedfrom the light curve data with contemporaneous disk-resolved imaging of neptunefrom the keck 10-meter telescope at 1.65 microns and hubble space telescopevisible imaging acquired 9 months later. this direct comparison validates thefeature latitudes assigned to the k2 light curve periods based on neptune'szonal wind profile, and confirms observed cloud feature variability. althoughneptune's clouds vary in location and intensity on short and long time scales,a single large discrete storm seen in keck imaging dominates the k2 and hubblelight curves; smaller or fainter clouds likely contribute to short-termbrightness variability. the k2 neptune light curve, in conjunction with ourimaging data, provides context for the interpretation of current and futurebrown dwarf and extrasolar planet variability measurements. in particular wesuggest that the balance between large, relatively stable, atmospheric featuresand smaller, more transient, clouds controls the character of substellaratmospheric variability. atmospheres dominated by a few large spots may showinherently greater light curve stability than those which exhibit a greaternumber of smaller features.

1601.00008	exoplanet exploration program analysis group (exopag) report to paul  hertz regarding large mission concepts to study for the 2020 decadal survey	this is a joint summary of the reports from the three astrophysics programanalysis groups (pags) in response to the "planning for the 2020 decadalsurvey" charge given by the astrophysics division director paul hertz. thisjoint executive summary contains points of consensus across all three pags.additional findings specific to the individual pags are reported separately inthe individual reports. the pags concur that all four large mission conceptsidentified in the white paper as candidates for maturation prior to the 2020decadal survey should be studied in detail. these include the far-ir surveyor,the habitable-exoplanet imaging mission, the uv/optical/ir surveyor, and thex-ray surveyor. this finding is predicated upon assumptions outlined in thewhite paper and subsequent charge, namely that 1) major development of futurelarge flagship missions under consideration are to follow the implementationphases of jwst and wfirst; 2) nasa will partner with the european space agencyon its l3 gravitational wave surveyor; 3) the inflation probe be classified asa probe-class mission to be developed according to the 2010 decadal surveyreport. if these key assumptions were to change, this pag finding would need tobe re-evaluated. the pags find that there is strong community support for thesecond phase of this activity - maturation of the four proposed missionconcepts via science and technology definition teams (stdts). the pags findthat there is strong consensus that all of the stdts contain broad andinterdisciplinary representation of the science community. finally, the pagsfind that there is community support for a line of probe-class missions withinthe astrophysics mission portfolio (condensed).

astro-ph;0301156	measuring the oblateness and rotation of transiting extrasolar giant  planets	we investigate the prospects for characterizing extrasolar giant planets bymeasuring planetary oblateness from transit photometry and inferring planetaryrotational periods. the rotation rates of planets in the solar system varywidely, reflecting the planets' diverse formational and evolutionary histories.a measured oblateness, assumed composition, and equation of state yields arotation rate from the darwin-radau relation. the lightcurve of a transitingoblate planet should differ significantly from that of a spherical one with thesame cross-sectional area under identical stellar and orbital conditions.however, if the stellar and orbital parameters are not known a priori, fittingfor them allows changes in the stellar radius, planetary radius, impactparameter, and stellar limb darkening parameters to mimic the transit signatureof an oblate planet, diminishing the oblateness signature. thus even ifhd209458b had an oblateness of 0.1 instead of our predicted 0.003, it wouldintroduce a detectable departure from a model spherical lightcurve at the levelof only one part in 10^5. planets with nonzero obliquity break this degeneracybecause their ingress lightcurve is asymmetric relative to that from egress,and their best-case detectability is of order 10^{-4}. however, the measuredrotation rate for these objects is non-unique due to degeneracy betweenobliquity and oblateness and the unknown component of obliquity along the lineof sight. detectability of oblateness is maximized for planets transiting nearan impact parameter of 0.7 regardless of obliquity. future measurements ofoblateness will be challenging because the signal is near the photometriclimits of current hardware and inherent stellar noise levels.

astro-ph;0305031	phase separation in giant planets: inhomogeneous evolution of saturn	we present the first models of jupiter and saturn to couple their evolutionto both a radiative-atmosphere grid and to high-pressure phase diagrams ofhydrogen with helium and other admixtures. we find that prior calculated phasediagrams in which saturn's interior reaches a region of predicted heliumimmiscibility do not allow enough energy release to prolong saturn's cooling toits known age and effective temperature. we explore modifications to publishedphase diagrams that would lead to greater energy release, and propose amodified h-he phase diagram that is physically reasonable, leads to the correctextension of saturn's cooling, and predicts an atmospheric helium mass fractiony_atmos = 0.185, in agreement with recent estimates. we also explore thepossibility of internal separation of elements heavier than helium, and findthat, alternatively, such separation could prolong saturn's cooling to itsknown age and effective temperature under a realistic phase diagram and heavyelement abundance (in which case saturn's y_atmos would be solar but heavierelements would be depleted). in none of these scenarios does jupiter's interiorevolve to any region of helium or heavy-element immiscibility: jupiter evolveshomogeneously to the present day. we discuss the implications of ourcalculations for saturn's primordial core mass.

astro-ph;0312386	effects of helium phase separation on the evolution of giant planets	we present the first models of saturn and jupiter to couple their evolutionto both a radiative-atmosphere grid and to high-pressure phase diagrams ofhydrogen with helium. the purpose of these models is to quantify theevolutionary effects of helium phase separation in saturn's deep interior. wefind that prior calculated phase diagrams in which saturn's interior reaches aregion of predicted helium immiscibility do not allow enough energy release toprolong saturn's cooling to its known age and effective temperature. we exploremodifications to published phase diagrams that would lead to greater energyrelease, and find a modified h-he phase diagram that is physically reasonable,leads to the correct extension of saturn's cooling, and predicts an atmospherichelium mass fraction y_atmos in agreement with recent estimates. we then expandour inhomogeneous evolutionary models to show that hypothetical extrasolargiant planets in the 0.15 to 3.0 jupiter mass range may have t_effs 10-15 kgreater than one would predict with models that do not incorporate helium phaseseparation.

astro-ph;0402620	effects of helium phase separation on the evolution of extrasolar giant  planets	we build on recent new evolutionary models of jupiter and saturn and hereextend our calculations to investigate the evolution of extrasolar giantplanets of mass 0.15 to 3.0 m_j. our inhomogeneous thermal history models showthat the possible phase separation of helium from liquid metallic hydrogen inthe deep interiors of these planets can lead to luminosities ~2 times greaterthan have been predicted by homogeneous models. for our chosen phase diagramthis phase separation will begin to affect the planets' evolution at ~700 myrfor a 0.15 m_j object and ~10 gyr for a 3.0 m_j object. we show how phaseseparation affects the luminosity, effective temperature, radii, andatmospheric helium mass fraction as a function of age for planets of variousmasses, with and without heavy element cores, and with and without the effectof modest stellar irradiation. this phase separation process will likely notaffect giant planets within a few au of their parent star, as these planetswill cool to their equilibrium temperatures, determined by stellar heating,before the onset of phase separation. we discuss the detectability of theseobjects and the likelihood that the energy provided by helium phase separationcan change the timescales for formation and settling of ammonia clouds byseveral gyr. we discuss how correctly incorporating stellar irradiation intogiant planet atmosphere and albedo modeling may lead to a consistentevolutionary history for jupiter and saturn.

astro-ph;0409506	transit detectability of ring systems around extrasolar giant planets	we investigate whether rings around extrasolar planets could be detected fromthose planets' transit lightcurves. to this end we develop a basic theoreticalframework for calculating and interpreting the lightcurves of ringed planettransits based on the existing framework used for stellar occultations, atechnique which has been effective for discovering and probing ring systems inthe solar system. we find that the detectability of large, saturn-like ringsystems is largest during ingress and egress, and that reasonable photometricprecisions of $\sim 1-3 \times 10^{-4}$ with 15-minute time resolution shouldbe sufficient to discover such ring systems. for some ring particle sizes,diffraction around individual particles leads to a detectable level offorward-scattering that can be used to measure modal ring particle diameters.an initial census of large ring systems can be carried out using high-precisionfollow-up observations of detected transits and by the upcoming nasa\emph{kepler} mission. the distribution of ring systems as a function ofstellar age and as a function of planetary semimajor axis will provideempirical evidence to help constrain how rings form and how long rings last.

astro-ph;0601092	resolving the surfaces of extrasolar planets with secondary eclipse  light curves	we present a method that employs the secondary eclipse light curves oftransiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their thermalemission. this technique permits an observer to resolve the surface of theplanet without the need to spatially resolve its central star. we evaluate thefeasibility of this technique for the hd 209458 system [..]. we consider tworepresentations of the planetary thermal emission; a simple model parameterizedby a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, as well as the results ofa three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary atmosphere previouslypublished by cooper &amp; showman. we find that observations of the secondaryeclipse light curve are most sensitive to a longitudinal offset in thegeometric and photometric centroids of the hemisphere of the planet visiblenear opposition. to quantify this signal, we define a new parameter, the``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observedsecondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with a uniform surface fluxdistribution. we compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for hd209458 with the precision with which it could be measured with irac. we findthat irac observations at 3.6um a single secondary eclipse should permitsufficient precision to confirm or reject the cooper &amp; showman model of thesurface flux distribution for this planet. we quantify the signal-to-noiseratio for this offset in the remaining irac bands (4.5um, 5.8um, and 8.0um),and find that a modest improvement in photometric precision (as might berealized through observations of several eclipse events) should permit asimilarly robust detection.

astro-ph;0612671	planetary radii across five orders of magnitude in mass and stellar  insolation: application to transits	to aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained throughobservations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we computemodel radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along withvarious mixtures. masses ranging from 0.01 earth masses to 10 jupiter masses atorbital distances of 0.02 to 10 au are considered. for hydrogen-helium richplanets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellarirradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02 to 10 au) through anon-gray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. stellar irradiationretards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simplefunction of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 au contracts as slowly as aplanet at 0.1 au. for hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90% ofthe total planet mass, comparable to those of uranus and neptune. if "hotneptunes" have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of moremassive planets, radii of 0.30-0.45 times jupiter's radius are expected. waterplanets are ~40-50% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. finally, weprovide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and forice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which willallow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or massestimates, given only planetary radii. these results will assist in theinterpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveysas well as upcoming space missions, including corot and kepler.

0809.2089	atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters: coupled radiative-dynamical  general circulation model simulations of hd 189733b and hd 209458b	we present global, three-dimensional numerical simulations of hd 189733b andhd 209458b that couple the atmospheric dynamics to a realistic representationof non-gray cloud-free radiative transfer. the model, which we call thesubstellar and planetary atmospheric radiation and circulation (sparc) model,adopts the mitgcm for the dynamics and uses the radiative model of mckay,marley, fortney, and collaborators for the radiation. like earlier work withsimplified forcing, our simulations develop a broad eastward equatorial jet,mean westward flow at higher latitudes, and substantial flow over the poles atlow pressure. for hd 189733b, our simulations without tio and vo opacity canexplain the broad features of the observed 8 and 24-micron light curves,including the modest day-night flux variation and the fact that the planet/starflux ratio peaks before the secondary eclipse. our simulations also providereasonable matches to the spitzer secondary-eclipse depths at 4.5, 5.8, 8, 16,and 24 microns and the groundbased upper limit at 2.2 microns. however, wesubstantially underpredict the 3.6-micron secondary-eclipse depth, suggestingthat our simulations are too cold in the 0.1-1 bar region. predicted temporalvariability in secondary-eclipse depths is ~1% at spitzer bandpasses,consistent with recent observational upper limits at 8 microns. we also showthat nonsynchronous rotation can significantly alter the jet structure. for hd209458b, we include tio and vo opacity; these simulations develop a hot (&gt;2000k) dayside stratosphere. despite this stratosphere, we do not reproduce currentspitzer photometry of this planet. light curves in spitzer bandpasses showmodest phase variation and satisfy the observational upper limit on day-nightphase variation at 8 microns.
