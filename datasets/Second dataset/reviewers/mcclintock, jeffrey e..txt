0901.0920	a determination of the spin of the black hole primary in lmc x-1	the first extragalactic x-ray binary, lmc x-1, was discovered in 1969. in the1980s, its compact primary was established as the fourth dynamical black-holecandidate. recently, we published accurate values for the mass of the blackhole and the orbital inclination angle of the binary system. building on theseresults, we have analyzed 53 x-ray spectra obtained by rxte and, using aselected sample of 18 of these spectra, we have determined the dimensionlessspin parameter of the black hole to be a* = 0.92(-0.07,+0.05). this resulttakes into account all sources of observational and model-parameteruncertainties. the standard deviation around the mean value of a* for these 18x-ray spectra, which were obtained over a span of several years, is only 0.02.when we consider our complete sample of 53 rxte spectra, we find a somewhathigher value of the spin parameter and a larger standard deviation. finally, weshow that our results based on rxte data are confirmed by our analyses ofselected x-ray spectra obtained by the xmm-newton, bepposax and ginga missions.

0902.3488	measuring the spins of stellar-mass black holes	in astronomy, the problem of black holes is arguably second in importanceonly to the problem of cosmology. a current frontier in black hole research isthe measurement of spin. during the past three years, the spins of severalstellar-mass black holes in x-ray binaries have been measured via twotechniques: fitting the x-ray continuum spectrum and modeling the profile ofthe fe k line. this fledgling enterprise motivates the following decadal goals:(1) firmly establish the continuum-fitting and fe k methods; obtain precisevalues of spin for 10-20 black holes, several using both methods; (2) use thederived masses and spins to test models of jets, grbs, supernovae, black holeformation, black hole binary evolution, etc.; (3) serve the ixo mission bysecuring the fe k methodology, which is currently the only means to measure thespins of supermassive black holes in agn; (4) identify the correct model ofhigh-frequency qpos, thereby opening a third channel for measuring spin; (5)pursue x-ray polarimetry as a means of securing the continuum-fitting and fe kmethods, and also as a possible fourth avenue to spin; and (6) develop and testmhd models of thin disks in strong gravity. achieving these goals requires theestablishment of an rxte follow-on mission dedicated to the study of bright andtransient compact objects, as well as strong support for theoretical work on 3dmhd simulations of accretion flows in the kerr metric of a spinning black hole.

0907.2920	measuring black hole spin via the x-ray continuum fitting method: beyond  the thermal dominant state	all prior work on measuring the spins of stellar-mass black holes via thex-ray continuum-fitting method has relied on the use of weakly-comptonizedspectra obtained in the thermal dominant state. using a self-consistentcomptonization model, we show that one can analyze spectra that exhibit strongpower-law components and obtain values of the inner disk radius, and hencespin, that are consistent with those obtained in the thermal dominant state.specifically, we analyze many rxte spectra of two black hole transients,h1743-322 and xte j1550-564, and we demonstrate that the radius of the inneredge of the accretion disk remains constant to within a few percent as thestrength of the comptonized component increases by an order of magnitude, i.e.,as the fraction of the thermal seed photons that are scattered approaches 25%.we conclude that the continuum-fitting method can be applied to a much widerbody of data than previously thought possible, and to sources that have neverbeen observed to enter the thermal dominant state (e.g., cyg x-1).

1001.0261	the inclination of the soft x-ray transient a0620--00 and the mass of  its black hole	we analyze photometry of the soft x-ray transient a0620-00 spanning nearly 30years, including previously published and previously unpublished data. previousattempts to determine the inclination of a0620 using subsets of these data haveyielded a wide range of measured values of i. differences in the measured valueof i have been due to changes in the shape of the light curve and uncertaintyregarding the contamination from the disk. we give a new technique forestimating the disk fraction and find that disk light is significant in alllight curves, even in the infrared. we also find that all changes in the shapeand normalization of the light curve originate in a variable disk component.after accounting for this disk component, we find that all the data, includinglight curves of significantly different shapes, point to a consistent value ofi. combining results from many separate data sets, we find i=51 plus or minus0.9 degrees, implying m=6.6 plus or minus 0.25 solar masses. using ourdynamical model and zero-disk stellar vih magnitudes, we find d=1.06 plus orminus 0.12 kpc. understanding the disk origin of non-ellipsoidal variabilitymay assist with making reliable determinations of i in other systems, and thefluctuations in disk light may provide a new observational tool forunderstanding the three-dimensional structure of the accretion disk.

1002.2211	the spin of the black hole in the soft x-ray transient a0620--00	during its yearlong outburst in 1975--76, the transient source a0620--00reached an intensity of 50 crab, an all-time record for any x-ray binary. thesource has been quiescent since. we recently determined accurate values for theblack hole mass, orbital inclination angle and distance. building on theseresults, we have measured the radius of the inner edge of the accretion diskaround the black hole primary by fitting its thermal continuum spectrum to ourversion of the relativistic novikov-thorne thin-disk model. we have therebyestimated the spin of the black hole. although our spin estimate depends on asingle high quality spectrum, which was obtained in 1975 by oso-8, we areconfident of our result because of the consistent values of the inner-diskradius that we have obtained for hundreds of observations of other sources:h1743-322, xte j1550-564, and notably lmc x-3. we have determined thedimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a*=0.12+/-0.19, witha*&lt;0.49 and a*&gt;-0.59 at the 3 sigma level of confidence. this result takes intoaccount all sources of observational and model-parameter uncertainties. despitethe low spin, the intensity and properties of the radio counterpart, both inoutburst and quiescence, attest to the presence of a strong jet. if jets aredriven by black hole spin, then current models indicate that jet power shouldbe a steeply increasing function of a*. consequently, the low spin of a0620--00suggests that its jet may be disk-driven.

1003.0966	simulations of magnetized disks around black holes: effects of black  hole spin, disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry	the standard general relativistic model of a razor-thin accretion disk arounda black hole, developed by novikov &amp; thorne (nt) in 1973, assumes the shearstress vanishes at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (isco) andthat, outside the isco, the shear stress is produced by an effective turbulentviscosity. however, astrophysical accretion disks are not razor-thin, it isuncertain whether the shear stress necessarily vanishes at the isco, and themagnetic field, which is thought to drive turbulence in disks, may containlarge-scale structures that do not behave like a simple local scalar viscosity.we describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamicsimulations of accretion disks around black holes with a range of spinparameters, and we use the simulations to assess the validity of the nt model.our fiducial initial magnetic field consists of multiple (alternating polarity)poloidal field loops whose shape is roughly isotropic in the disk in order tomatch the isotropic turbulence expected in the poloidal plane. for a thin diskwith an aspect ratio |h/r| ~ 0.07 around a non-spinning black hole, we find adecrease in the accreted specific angular momentum of 2.9% relative to the ntmodel and an excess luminosity from inside the isco of 3.5%. the deviations inthe case of spinning black holes are of the same order. in addition, thedeviations decrease with decreasing |h/r|. we therefore conclude thatmagnetized thin accretion disks in x-ray binaries in the thermal/high-softspectral state ought to be well-described by the nt model, especially atluminosities below 30% of eddington where we expect a very small disk thickness|h/r| &lt;~ 0.05. we also discuss how the stress and the luminosity inside theisco depend on the assumed initial magnetic field geometry.

1006.2834	the black hole mass distribution in the galaxy	we use dynamical mass measurements of 16 black holes in transient low-massx-ray binaries to infer the stellar black hole mass distribution in the parentpopulation. we find that the observations are best described by a narrow massdistribution at 7.8 +/- 1.2 msolar. we identify a selection effect related tothe choice of targets for optical follow-ups that results in a flux-limitedsample. we demonstrate, however, that this selection effect does not introducea bias in the observed distribution and cannot explain the absence of blackholes in the 2-5 solar mass range. on the high mass end, we argue that therapid decline in the inferred distribution may be the result of the particularevolutionary channel followed by low-mass x-ray binaries. this is consistentwith the presence of high-mass black holes in the persistent, high-mass x-raybinary sources. if the paucity of low-mass black holes is caused by a suddendecrease of the supernova explosion energy with increasing progenitor mass,this would have observable implications for ongoing transient surveys thattarget core-collapse supernovae. our results also have significant implicationsfor the calculation of event rates from the coalescence of black hole binariesfor gravitational wave detectors.

1007.3637	variable o vi and n v emission from the x-ray binary lmc x-3: heating of  the black hole companion	based on high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with fuse and cos,we present new detections of o vi and n v emission from the black-hole x-raybinary (xrb) system lmc x-3. we also update the ephemeris of the xrb usingrecent radial velocity measurements obtained with the echelle spectrograph onthe magellan-clay telescope. we observe significant velocity variability of theuv emission, and we find that the o vi and n v emission velocities follow theoptical velocity curve of the xrb. moreover, the o vi and n v intensitiesregularly decrease between binary phase = 0.5 and 1.0, which suggests that thesource of the uv emission is increasingly occulted as the b star in the xrbmoves from superior to inferior conjunction. these trends suggest thatillumination of the b-star atmosphere by the intense x-ray emission from theaccreting black hole creates a hot spot on one side of the b star, and this hotspot is the origin of the o vi and n v emission. however, the velocitysemiamplitude of the ultraviolet emission, k_{uv}~180 km/s, is lower than theoptical semiamplitude; this difference could be due to rotation of the b star.if our hypothesis about the origin of the highly ionized emission is correct,then careful analysis of the emission occultation could, in principle,constrain the inclination of the xrb and the mass of the black hole.

1010.1013	the spin of the black hole microquasar xte j1550-564 via the  continuum-fitting and fe-line methods	we measure the spin of xte j1550-564 in two ways: by modelling the thermalcontinuum spectrum of the accretion disc, and independently by modeling thebroad red wing of the reflection fluorescence fe-k line. we find that the spinmeasurements conducted independently using both leading methods are inagreement with one another. for the continuum-fitting analysis, we use a datasample consisting of several dozen rxte spectra, and for the fe-k analysis, weuse a pair of asca spectra from a single epoch. our spin estimate for the blackhole primary using the continuum-fitting method is -0.11 &lt; a* &lt; 0.71 (90 percent confidence), with a most likely spin of a* = 0.34. in obtaining thisresult, we have thoroughly explored the dependence of the spin value on a widerange of model-dependent systematic errors and observational errors; ourprecision is limited by uncertainties in the distance and orbital inclinationof the system. for the fe-line method, our estimate of spin is a* =0.55(+0.15,-0.22). combining these results, we conclude that the spin of thisblack hole is moderate, a* = 0.49(+0.13,-0.20), which suggests that the jet ofthis microquasar is powered largely by its accretion disc rather than by thespin energy of the black hole.

1101.2465	refined neutron-star mass determinations for six eclipsing x-ray pulsar  binaries	we present an improved method for determining the mass of neutron stars ineclipsing x-ray pulsar binaries and apply the method to six systems, namelyvela x-1, 4u 1538-52, smc x-1, lmc x-4, cen x-3, and her x-1. in previousstudies to determine neutron star mass, the x-ray eclipse duration has beenapproximated analytically by assuming the companion star is spherical with aneffective roche lobe radius. we use a numerical code based on roche geometrywith various optimizers to analyze the published data for these systems, whichwe supplement with new spectroscopic and photometric data for 4u 1538-52. thisallows us to model the eclipse duration more accurately and thus calculate animproved value for the neutron star mass. the derived neutron star mass alsodepends on the assumed roche lobe filling factor beta of the companion star,where beta = 1 indicates a completely filled roche lobe. in previous work arange of beta between 0.9 and 1.0 was usually adopted. we use opticalellipsoidal lightcurve data to constrain beta. we find neutron star masses of1.77 +/- 0.08 m_{sun} for vela x-1, 0.87 +/- 0.07 m_{sun} for 4u 1538-52(eccentric orbit), 1.00 +/- 0.10 m_{sun} for 4u 1538-52 (circular orbit), 1.04+/- 0.09 m_{sun} for smc x-1, 1.29 +/- 0.05 m_{sun} for lmc x-4, 1.49 +/- 0.08m_{sun} for cen x-3, and 1.07 +/- 0.36 m_{sun} for her x-1. we discuss thelimits of the approximations that were used to derive the earlier massdeterminations, and we comment on the implications our new masses have forobservationally refining the upper and lower bounds of the neutron star massdistribution.

1102.0010	measuring black hole spin by the continuum-fitting method: effect of  deviations from the novikov-thorne disc model	the x-ray spectra of accretion discs of eight stellar-mass black holes havebeen analyzed to date using the thermal continuum fitting method, and thespectral fits have been used to estimate the spin parameters of the blackholes. however, the underlying model used in this method of estimating spin isthe general relativistic thin-disc model of novikov &amp; thorne, which is onlyvalid for razor-thin discs. we therefore expect errors in the measured valuesof spin due to inadequacies in the theoretical model. we investigate this issueby computing spectra of numerically calculated models of thin accretion discsaround black holes, obtained via three-dimensional general relativisticmagnetohydrodynamic (grmhd) simulations. we apply the continuum fitting methodto these computed spectra to estimate the black hole spins and check howclosely the values match the actual spin used in the grmhd simulations. we findthat the error in the dimensionless spin parameter is up to about 0.2 for anon-spinning black hole, depending on the inclination. for black holes withspins of 0.7, 0.9 and 0.98, the errors are up to about 0.1, 0.03 and 0.01respectively. these errors are comparable to or smaller than those arising fromcurrent levels of observational uncertainty. furthermore, we estimate that thegrmhd simulated discs from which these error estimates are obtained correspondto effective disc luminosities of about 0.4-0.7 eddington, and that the errorswill be smaller for discs with luminosities of 0.3 eddington or less, which areused in the continuum-fitting method. we thus conclude that use of thenovikov-thorne thin-disc model does not presently limit the accuracy of thecontinuum-fitting method of measuring black hole spin.

1202.1530	the eye of the storm: light from the inner plunging region of black hole  accretion discs	it is generally thought that the light coming from the inner plunging regionof black hole accretion discs contributes negligibly to the disc's overallspectrum, i.e. the plunging fluid is swallowed by the black hole before it hastime to radiate. in the standard disc model used to fit x-ray observations ofaccretion discs, the plunging region is assumed to be perfectly dark. however,numerical simulations that include the full physics of the magnetized flowpredict that a small fraction of the disc's total luminosity emanates from theplunging region. we investigate the observational consequences of thisneglected inner light. we compute radiative transfer based disc spectra thatcorrespond to 3d general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulated discs(which produce light inside their plunging regions). in the context of blackhole spin estimation, we find that the neglected inner light only has a modesteffect (this bias is less than typical observational systematic errors). forrapidly spinning black holes, we find that the combined emission from theplunging region produces a weak power-law tail at high energies. this indicatesthat infalling matter is the origin for some of the `coronal' emission observedin the thermal dominant and steep power-law states of x-ray binaries.

1402.0085	the mass of the black hole in lmc x-3	we analyze a large set of new and archival photometric and spectroscopicobservations of lmc x-3 to arrive at a self-consistent dynamical model for thesystem. using echelle spectra obtained with the mike instrument on the 6.5mmagellan clay telescope and the uves instrument on the second 8.2m very largetelescope we find a velocity semiamplitude for the secondary star of$k_2=241.1\pm 6.2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the uncertainty includes an estimate ofthe systematic error caused by x-ray heating. using the spectra, we also find aprojected rotational velocity of $v_{\rm rot}\sin i=118.5\pm 6.6$ km s$^{-1}$.from an analysis of archival $b$ and $v$ light curves as well as new $b$ and$v$ light curves from the smarts 1.3m telescope, we find an inclination of$i=69.84\pm 0.37^{\circ}$ for models that do not include x-ray heating and aninclination of $i=69.24\pm 0.72^{\circ}$ for models that incorporate x-rayheating. adopting the latter inclination measurement, we find masses of$3.63\pm 0.57\,m_{\odot}$ and $6.98\pm 0.56\,m_{\odot}$ for the companion starand the black hole, respectively. we briefly compare our results with earlierwork and discuss some of their implications.

0803.0322	advection-dominated accretion and the black hole event horizon	as the luminosity of an accreting black hole drops to a few percent ofeddington, the spectrum switches from the familiar soft state to a hard statethat is well-described by a distended and tenuous advection-dominated accretionflow (adaf). an adaf is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach10^{12} k near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with theirtemperature typically capped at ~10^{9-11} k. the foundational papers predictedthat the large thermal energy in an adaf would drive strong winds and jets, aslater observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. of chief interest,however, is the accreting gas that races inward. it carries the bulk of theaccretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace asthe gas passes through the hole's event horizon. one thus expects black holesin the adaf regime to be unusually faint. indeed, this is confirmed by acomparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, whichreside in very similar transient x-ray binary systems. the black holes are onaverage observed to be fainter by a factor of ~100-1000. the naturalexplanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energyfrom its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its eventhorizon. the case for an event horizon in sagittarius a*, which is immune tocaveats on jet outflows and is furthermore independent of the adaf model, isespecially compelling. these two lines of evidence for event horizons areimpervious to counterarguments that invoke strong gravity or exotic stars.

0803.1835	constraints on the size of extra dimensions from the orbital evolution  of black-hole x-ray binaries	one of the plausible unification schemes in physics considers the observableuniverse to be a 4-dimensional surface (the "brane") embedded in ahigher-dimensional curved spacetime (the "bulk"). in such braneworld gravitymodels with infinitely large extra dimensions, black holes evaporate fastthrough the emission of the additional gravitational degrees of freedom,resulting in lifetimes of stellar-mass black holes that are significantlysmaller than the hubble time. we show that the predicted evaporation rate leadsto a change in the orbital period of x-ray binaries harboring black holes thatis observable with current instruments. we obtain an upper limit on the rate ofchange of the orbital period of the binary a0620-00 and use it to constrain theasymptotic curvature radius of the extra dimension to a value comparable to theone obtained by table-top experiments. furthermore we argue that anymeasurement of a period increase for low-mass x-ray binaries with a high massratio is evidence for new physics beyond general relativity and the standardmodel.

1408.2661	the origin of black hole spin in galactic low-mass x-ray binaries	galactic field black hole (bh) low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) are believedto form in situ via the evolution of isolated binaries. in the standardformation channel, these systems survived a common envelope phase, after whichthe remaining helium core of the primary star and the subsequently formed bhare not expected to be highly spinning. however, the measured spins of bhs inlmxbs cover the whole range of spin parameters. we propose here that the bhspin in lmxbs is acquired through accretion onto the bh after its formation. inorder to test this hypothesis, we calculated extensive grids of detailed binarymass-transfer sequences. for each sequence, we examined whether, at any pointin time, the calculated binary properties are in agreement with theirobservationally inferred counterparts of 16 galactic lmxbs. the "successful"sequences give estimates of the mass that the bh has accreted since the onsetof roche-lobe overflow. we find that in all galactic lmxbs with measured bhspin, the origin of the spin can be accounted for by the accreted matter, andwe make predictions about the maximum bh spin in lmxbs where no measurement isyet available. furthermore, we derive limits on the maximum spin that any bhcan have depending on current properties of the binary it resides in. finallywe discuss the implication that our findings have on the bh birth-massdistribution, which is shifted by ~1.5 msolar towards lower masses, compared tothe currently observed one.

0705.2244	viscous torque and dissipation in the inner region of a thin accretion  disk: implications for measuring black hole spin	we consider a simple newtonian model of a steady accretion disk around ablack hole. the model is based on height-integrated hydrodynamic equations,alpha-viscosity, and a pseudo-newtonian potential that results in an innermoststable circular orbit (isco) that closely approximates the one predicted by gr.we find that the hydrodynamic models exhibit increasing deviations from thestandard disk model of shakura &amp; sunyaev as disk thickness h/r or the value ofalpha increases. the latter is an analytical model in which the viscous torqueis assumed to vanish at the isco. we consider the implications of the resultsfor attempts to estimate black hole spin by using the standard disk model tofit continuum spectra of black hole accretion disks. we find that the error inthe spin estimate is quite modest so long as h/r &lt; 0.1 and alpha &lt; 0.2. atworst the error in the estimated value of the spin parameter is 0.1 for anon-spinning black hole; the error is much less for a rapidly spinning hole. wealso consider the density and disk thickness contrast between the gas in thedisk and that inside the isco. the contrast needs to be large if black holespin is to be successfully estimated by fitting the relativistically-broadenedx-ray line profile of fluorescent iron emission from reflection off anaccretion disk. in our hydrodynamic models, the contrast in density andthickness is low when h/r&gt;0.1, sugesting that the iron line technique may bemost reliable in extemely thin disks. we caution that these results have beenobtained with a viscous hydrodynamic model and need to be confirmed with mhdsimulations of radiatively cooled thin disks.

(1999, 2000).during the first 60 days of the observed optical re-flare, we find nocorrespondence between the thermal component of the x-rays often associatedwith a disk and the optical flux -- the former remains essentially flat whereasthe latter declines exponentially and exhibits three substantial dips. however,the power law flux is anti-correlated with the optical dips, suggesting thatthe optical flux may by up-scattered into the x-ray by the hot corona. periodicmodulations were discovered during the final stage of the outburst (may tojune), with p=1.546+/-0.038 days, and during quiescence (july and august), withp=1.540+/-0.008 days. the analysis of the combined data set reveals a strongsignal for a unique period at p=1.541+/-0.009 days, which we believe to be theorbital period.

astro-ph;0010430	the quiescent emission spectrum of cen x-4 and other x-ray transients  containing neutron stars	we use the observed optical-uv and x-ray emission spectrum of cen x-4 duringquiescence to constrain models for the accretion flow in this system. we arguethat the optical-uv emission is not due to an optically-thick quiescentaccretion disk, nor due to synchrotron emission from an advection-dominatedaccretion flow (adaf). emission from the bright spot could account for theobserved optical-uv component if the mass transfer rate in cen x-4 is &gt;~2.10^16 g/s. although the presence of an adaf around the neutron star leads tocompton upscattering of the soft x-ray photons radiated from the stellarsurface, we find that this process alone cannot account for the power lawcomponent seen in the quiescent x-ray spectrum of cen x-4 and other x-raytransients containing neutron stars; this result is independent of whether thesource of soft photons is incandescent thermal emission or accretion-poweredemission. we conclude that, in models which invoke the presence of an adaf anda propeller effect for the quiescence of x-ray transients containing neutronstars, the intrinsic emission from the adaf must contribute very little to theoptical-uv and x-ray emission observed. if these adaf+propeller models arecorrect, the x-ray power law component observed must arise from regions wherethe gas impacts the neutron star surface. variability studies could greatlyhelp clarify the role of the various emission mechanisms involved.

astro-ph;0107387	x-ray novae and the evidence for black hole event horizons	we discuss new observations of x-ray novae which provide strong evidence thatblack holes have event horizons. optical observations of 13 x-ray novaeindicate that these binary stars contain collapsed objects too heavy to bestable neutron stars. the objects have been identified as black holecandidates. x-ray observations of several of these x-ray novae in quiescencewith the chandra x-ray observatory show that the systems are approximately 100times fainter than nearly identical x-ray novae containing neutron stars. theadvection-dominated accretion flow model provides a natural explanation for thedifference. in this model, the accreting gas reaches the accretor at the centerwith a large amount of thermal energy. if the accretor is a black hole, thethermal energy will disappear through the event horizon, and the object will bevery dim. if the accretor is a neutron star or any other object with a surface,the energy will be radiated from the surface, and the object will be bright. wediscuss alternate interpretations of the data that eliminate the need foradvection-dominated accretion. most of these alternatives still require anevent horizon to explain the unusually low x-ray luminosities of the black holecandidates. some of the alternatives are also inconsistent with observations.

astro-ph;0306213	black hole binaries	we review the properties of 40 x-ray binaries that contain either a confirmedblack hole or a black hole candidate. after discussing briefly the significanceof these galactic black holes to both astronomy and physics, we present basicdata for all 40 systems, review the physics of mass accretion onto black holes,and then show seven-year light curves of 20 systems. the second half of thiswork is a far-reaching review of the canonical emission states of black holebinaries, which is based on x-ray, radio and gamma-ray data. for severalselected black holes, we show 33 pairs of x-ray energy and power densityspectra and use these spectra as a basis for introducing modified definitionsof the canonical x-ray emission states of an accreting black hole. we highlightthe physical structures and some of the emission mechanisms associated witheach emission state. in the final pages we examine both low- and high-frequencyquasi-periodic oscillations. a recurring theme of the review is the importanceof these black holes as potential sites for tests of general relativity.accordingly, we stress phenomena that originate in strong gravity, such asrelativistic fe emission lines and thermal continuum emission, both of whicharise in the inner accretion disk. especially important in this regard are thehigh-frequency (40-450 hz) quasi-periodic oscillations observed for seven blackholes, three of which show evidence for commensurate (3:2) pairs offrequencies.

astro-ph;0402012	the importance of discovering a 3:2 twin-peak qpo in a ulx or how to  solve the puzzle of intermediate mass black holes	recently, twin-peak qpos have been observed in a 3:2 ratio for three galacticblack-hole microquasars with frequencies that have been shown to scale as 1/m,as expected for general relativisitic motion near a black hole. it may bepossible to extend this result to distinguish between the following twodisparate models that have been proposed for the puzzling ultraluminous x-raysources (ulxs): (1) an intermediate-mass black hole m ~1000 solar mass)radiating very near the eddington limit and (2) a conventional black hole (m ~10 solar mass) accreting at a highly super-eddington rate with its emissionbeamed along the rotation axis. we suggest that it may be possible todistinguish between these models by detecting the counterpart of a galactictwin-peak qpo in a ulx: the expected frequency for the intermediate-mass blackhole model is only about 1 hz, whereas, for the conventional black hole modelthe expected frequency would be the ~100 hz value observed for the galacticmicroquasars.

astro-ph;0403251	on the lack of thermal emission from the quiescent black hole xte  j1118+480: evidence for the event horizon	a soft component of thermal emission is very commonly observed from thesurfaces of quiescent, accreting neutron stars. we searched with chandra forsuch a surface component of emission from the dynamical black-hole candidatexte j1118+480 (= j1118), which has a primary mass of about 8 solar masses. nonewas found, as one would expect if the compact x-ray source is a bona fide blackhole that possesses an event horizon. the x-ray spectrum of j1118 iswell-fitted by a simple power-law model. in our search for a thermal component,we fitted our chandra data to a power-law model (with slope and column densityfixed) plus a series of nine hydrogen-atmosphere models with radii ranging from9/8 to 2.8 schwarzschild radii. for the more compact models, we included theimportant effect of self-irradiation of the atmosphere. because of theextremely low column density to j1118, we obtained very strong limits on ahypothetical thermal source: kt(infinity) &lt; 0.011 kev and l(infinity) &lt; 9.4e30erg/s (99% confidence level). in analogy with neutron stars, we examine twopossible sources of thermal radiation from a hypothetical surface of j1118:deep crustal heating and accretion in quiescence. we conclude that if j1118possesses a surface composed of normal nuclear matter, we would have detectedthermal radiation from this surface. the absence of thermal radiation indicatesthat j1118 is a true black hole with an event horizon.

astro-ph;0407025	the x-ray outburst of h1743-322: high-frequency qpos with a 3:2  frequency ratio	we observed the 2003 x-ray outburst of h1743-322 in a series of 130 pointedobservation with rxte. we searched individual observations for high-frequencyqpos (hfqpos) and found only weak or marginal detections near 240 and 160 hz.we next grouped the observations in several different ways and computed theaverage power-density spectra (pds) in a search for further evidence of hfqpos.this effort yielded two significant results for those observations defined bythe presence of low-frequency qpos (0.1-20 hz) and an absence of``band-limited'' power continua: (1) the 9 time intervals with the highest 7-35kev count rates yielded an average pds with a qpo at $166 \pm 5$ hz. ($4.1\sigma$; 3--35 kev); and (2) a second group with lower 7-35 kev count rates (26intervals) produced an average pds with a qpo at $242 \pm 3$ hz ($6.0 \sigma$;7--35 kev). the ratio of these two frequencies is $1.46 \pm 0.05$. this findingis consistent with results obtained for three other black hole systems thatexhibit commensurate hfqpos in a 3:2 ratio. furthermore, the occurrence ofh1743-322's slower hfqpo at times of higher x-ray luminosity closely resemblesthe behavior of xte j1550-564 and gro j1655-40. we discuss our results in termsof a resonance model that invokes frequencies set by general relativity fororbital motions near a black-hole event horizon.

astro-ph;0410556	inclination effects and beaming in black hole x-ray binaries	we investigate the dependence of observational properties of black hole x-raybinaries on the inclination angle i of their orbits. we find the following: (1)transient black hole binaries show no trend in their quiescent x-rayluminosities as a function of i, suggesting that the radiation is notsignificantly beamed. this is consistent with emission from an accretion disk.if the x-rays are from a jet, then the lorentz factor gamma of the jet is lessthan 1.24 at the 90% confidence level. (2) the x-ray binary 4u1543-47 with i oforder 21 degrees has a surprisingly strong fluorescent iron line in the highsoft state. quantifying an earlier argument by park et al. (2004), we concludethat if the continuum x-ray emission in this source is from a jet, then gamma &lt;1.04. (3) none of the known binaries has cos i &lt; 0.25 or i &gt; 75 degrees. thisfact, plus the lack of eclipses among the 20 black hole binaries in our sample,strongly suggests at the 99.5% confidence level that systems with largeinclination angles are hidden from view. the obscuration could be the result ofdisk flaring, as suggested by milgrom (1978) for neutron star x-ray binaries.(4) transient black hole binaries with i ~ 70-75 degrees have significantlymore complex x-ray light curves than systems with i &lt; 65 degrees. this may bethe result of variable obscuration and/or variable height above the disk of theradiating gas.

astro-ph;0411583	multi-temperature blackbody spectrum of a thin accretion disk around a  kerr black hole: model computations and comparison with observations	we use a ray-tracing technique to compute the observed spectrum of a thinaccretion disk around a kerr black hole. we include all relativistic effectssuch as frame-dragging, doppler boost, gravitational redshift, and bending oflight by the gravity of the black hole. we also include self-irradiation of thedisk as a result of light deflection. assuming that the disk emission islocally blackbody, we show how the observed spectrum depends on the spin of theblack hole, the inclination of the disk, and the torque at the inner edge ofthe disk. we find that the effect of a nonzero torque on the spectrum can, to agood approximation, be absorbed into a zero-torque model by adjusting the massaccretion rate and the normalization. we describe a computer model, calledkerrbb, which we have developed for fitting the spectra of black hole x-raybinaries. using kerrbb within the x-ray data reduction package xspec, andassuming a spectral hardening factor f_col = 1.7, we analyze the spectra ofthree black hole x-ray binaries: 4u1543-47, xte j1550-564, and gro j1655-40. weestimate the spin parameters of the black holes in 4u1543-47 and gro j1655-40to be a/m ~ 0.6 and ~ 0.6-0.7, respectively. if f_col ~ 1.5-1.6, as in a recentstudy, then we find a/m ~ 0.7-0.8 and ~ 0.8-0.9, respectively. these estimatesare subject to additional uncertainties in the assumed black hole masses,distances and disk inclinations.

0809.0866	inferring the inclination of a black hole accretion disk from  observations of its polarized continuum radiation	spin parameters of stellar-mass black holes in x-ray binaries are currentlybeing estimated by fitting the x-ray continuum spectra of their accretion diskemission. for this method, it is necessary to know the inclination of thex-ray-producing inner region of the disk. since the inner disk is expected tobe oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of the hole, the usual practice isto assume that the black hole spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentumvector of the binary, and to estimate the inclination of the latter fromellipsoidal modulations in the light curve of the secondary star. we show thatthe inclination of the disk can be inferred directly if we have both spectraland polarization information on the disk radiation. the predicted degree ofpolarization varies from 0% to 5% as the disk inclination changes from face-onto edge-on. with current x-ray polarimetric techniques the polarization degreeof a typical bright x-ray binary could be measured to an accuracy of 0.1% byobserving the source for about 10 days. such a measurement would constrain thedisk inclination to within a degree or two and would significantly improve thereliability of black hole spin estimates. in addition, it would provide newinformation on the tilt between the black hole spin axis and the orbitalrotation axis of the binary, which would constrain any velocity kicksexperienced by stellar-mass black holes during their formation.

astro-ph;9809195	rxte spectral observations of the 1996-97 outburst of the microquasar  gro j1655-40	excellent coverage of the entire 16-month 1996-97 outburst cycle of groj1655-40 was provided by rxte. we present a full spectral analysis of thesedata, which includes 52 pca spectra from 2.5-20 kev and hexte spectra above 20kev. we also include a nearly continuous asm light curve with several intensitymeasurements per day. the data are interpreted in the context of the multicolorblackbody disk/power-law model. the source is observed in the very high,high/soft, and low/hard outburst states. during the very high state, the sourceexhibits intense hard flares on time scales of hours to days which arecorrelated with changes in both the fitted temperature and radius of the inneraccretion disk. during the high/soft state, the spectrum is dominated by thesoft thermal emission from the accretion disk with spectral parameters thatsuggest approximately constant inner disk radius and temperature. we find thata tight relationship exists between the observed inner radius of the disk andthe flux in the power-law component. during intense hard flares, the inner diskradius is observed to decrease by as much as a factor of three on a time scaleof days. the apparent decrease of the inner disk radius observed during theflares may be due to the failure of the multicolor disk model caused by asteepening of the radial temperature profile in the disk coupled with increasedspectral hardening and not physical changes of the inner disk radius. assumingthat our spectral model is valid during periods of weak power-law emission, ourmost likely value for the inner disk radius implies a* &lt; 0.7. such a low valuefor the black hole angular momentum is inconsistent with the relativistic framedragging and the `diskoseismic' models as interpretations for the 300 hz x-rayqpo seen during some of these rxte observations.

astro-ph;9911197	optical lightcurves of the black hole binaries grs 1124-68 and a0620-00  in outburst: the importance of irradiation	we test whether the model proposed by esin et al. to explain x-rayobservations of the black hole soft x-ray transient grs 1124-68 in outburst canalso explain the optical lightcurves of a similar object a0620-00. we show thatto reproduce the observed x-ray to optical flux ratio in a0620-00, we need toassume x-ray irradiation of the outer disk that is significantly in excess ofwhat is expected for a standard planar disk. with enhanced irradiation, theesin et al. model can reproduce the optical evolution of a0620-00 in outburstvery well. though we find that optical observations of grs 1124-68 also implyenhanced x-ray heating of the outer disk, the irradiation appears to be afactor of roughly 3 weaker in this system than in a0620-00. this is surprising,since grs 1124-68 has a larger disk. we speculate that enhanced irradiation maybe due to disk warping, and that the degree of warping differs between the twobinaries.

0810.1758	a simple comptonization model	we present an empirical model of comptonization for fitting the spectra ofx-ray binaries. this model, "simpl", has been developed as a packageimplemented in xspec. with only two free parameters, simpl is competitive asthe simplest empirical model of compton scattering. unlike other empiricalmodels, such as the standard power-law model, simpl incorporates the basicphysics of compton scattering of soft photons by energetic coronal electrons.using a simulated spectrum, we demonstrate that simpl closely matches thebehavior of physical comptonization models which consider the effects ofoptical depth, coronal electron temperature, and geometry. we present fits torxte spectra of the black-hole transient h1743-322 and a bepposax spectrum oflmc x-3 using both simpl and the standard power-law model. a comparison of theresults shows that simpl gives equally good fits and a comparable spectralindex, while eliminating the troublesome divergence of the standard power-lawmodel at low energies. importantly, simpl is completely flexible and can beused self-consistently with any seed spectrum of photons. we show that simpl -unlike the standard power law - teamed up with diskbb (the standard model ofdisk accretion) gives results for the inner-disk radius that are unaffected bystrong comptonization, a result of great importance for the determination ofblack hole spin via the continuum-fitting method.

0810.3447	a new dynamical model for the black hole binary lmc x-1	we present a dynamical model of the high mass x-ray binary lmc x-1 based onhigh-resolution optical spectroscopy and extensive optical and near-infraredphotometry. from our new optical data we find an orbital period of p=3.90917+/- 0.00005 days. we present a refined analysis of the all sky monitor datafrom rxte and find an x-ray period of p=3.9094 +/- 0.0008 days, which isconsistent with the optical period. a simple model of thomson scattering in thestellar wind can account for the modulation seen in the x-ray light curves. thev-k color of the star (1.17 +/- 0.05) implies a_v = 2.28 +/- 0.06, which ismuch larger than previously assumed. for the secondary star, we measure aradius of r_2 = 17.0 +/- 0.8 solar radii and a projected rotational velocity ofv_rot*sin(i) = 129.9 +/- 2.2 km/s. using these measured properties to constrainthe dynamical model, we find an inclination of i = 36.38 +/- 1.92 deg, asecondary star mass of m_2 = 31.79 +/- 3.48 solar masses, and a black hole massof 10.91 +/- 1.41 solar masses. the present location of the secondary star in atemperature-luminosity diagram is consistent with that of a star with aninitial mass of 35 solar masses that is 5 myr past the zero-age main sequence.the star nearly fills its roche lobe (~90% or more), and owing to the rapidchange in radius with time in its present evolutionary state, it will encounterits roche lobe and begin rapid and possibly unstable mass transfer on atimescale of a few hundred thousand years.
