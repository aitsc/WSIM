0903.3527	multiwavelength photometry in the globular cluster m2	we present a multiwavelength photometric analysis of the globular cluster m2.the data-set has been obtained by combining high-resolution (hst/wfpc2 and acs)and wide-field (galex) space observations and ground based (megacam-cfht,emmi-ntt) images. the photometric sample covers the entire cluster extensionfrom the very central regions up to the tidal radius and beyond. it allows anaccurate determination of the cluster center of gravity and other structuralparameters derived from the star count density profile. moreover we study thebss population and its radial distribution. a total of 123 bss has beenselected, and their radial distribution has been found to be bimodal (highlypeaked in the center, decreasing at intermediate radii and rising outward), asalready found in a number of other clusters. the radial position of the minimumof the bss distribution is consistent with the radius of avoidance caused bythe dynamical friction of massive objects over the cluster age. we alsosearched for gradients in the red giant branch (rgb) and the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) populations. at the $2\sigma$ level we found an overabundance ofagb stars within the core radius and confirmed the result of sohn et al.(1996)that the central region of m2 is bluer than the outer part. we show that thelatter is due to a deficit of very luminous rgb stars in the central region.

0704.1393	a panchromatic study of the globular cluster ngc 1904. i: the blue  straggler population	by combining high-resolution (hst-wfpc2) and wide-field ground based (2.2meso-wfi) and space (galex) observations, we have collected a multi-wavelengthphotometric data base (ranging from the far uv to the near infrared) of thegalactic globular cluster ngc1904 (m79). the sample covers the entire clusterextension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. in the presentpaper such a data set is used to study the bss population and its radialdistribution. a total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) bss has beendetected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.no significant upturn in the bss frequency has been observed in the outskirtsof ngc 1904, in contrast to other clusters (m 3, 47 tuc, ngc 6752, m 5) studiedwith the same technique. such evidences, coupled with the large radius ofavoidance estimated for ngc 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate thatthe vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to thecore. accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that bss formed bymass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in thecluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overallpopulation.

0912.0192	the cluster terzan 5 as a remnant of a primordial building block of the  galactic bulge	globular star clusters are compact and massive stellar systems old enough tohave witnessed the entire history of our galaxy, the milky way. although recentresults suggest that their formation may have been more complex than previouslythought, they still are the best approximation to a stellar population formedover a relatively short time scale (less than 1 gyr) and with virtually nodispersion in the iron content. indeed, only one cluster-like system (omegacentauri) in the galactic halo is known to have multiple stellar populationswith a significant spread in iron abundance and age4,5. similar findings in thegalactic bulge have been hampered by the obscuration arising from thick andvarying layers of interstellar dust. here we report that terzan 5, aglobular-cluster-like system in the galactic bulge, has two stellar populationswith different iron content and ages. terzan 5 could be the surviving remnantof one of the primordial building blocks that are thought to merge and formgalaxy bulges.

1012.2047	spectroscopy unveils the complex nature of terzan 5	we present the chemical abundance analysis of 33 red giant stars belonging tothe complex stellar system terzan 5. we confirm the discovery of two stellarpopulations (ferraro et al. 2009, nature, 462,483) with distinct ironabundances: a relatively metal-poor component with [fe/h]=-0.25 +/- 0.07r.m.s., and another component with [fe/h]=+0.27 +/- 0.04 r.m.s., exceeding inmetallicity any known galactic globular cluster. the two populations also showdifferent [alpha/fe] abundance ratios. the metal-poor component has an average[alpha/fe]=+0.34 +/- 0.06 r.m.s., consistent with the canonical scenario forrapid enrichment by core collapse supernovae (sne). the metal-rich componenthas [alpha/fe]=+0.03 +/-i 0.04 r.m.s., suggesting that the gas from which itformed was polluted by both type ii and type ia sne on a longer timescale.neither of the two populations shows evidence of the [al/fe] over [o/fe]anti-correlation, that is typically observed in galactic globular clusters.because these chemical abundance patterns are unique, we propose that terzan 5is not a true globular cluster, but a stellar system with a much more complexhistory of star formation and chemical enrichment.

1201.3715	blood ties: the real nature of the lmc binary globular clusters ngc 2136  and ngc 2137	we have used a sample of high-resolution spectra obtained with themulti-fiber facility flames at the very large telescope of the europeansouthern observatory, to derive the kinematical and chemical properties of thetwo young large magellanic cloud globular clusters ngc 2136 and ngc 2137. thesetwo clusters represent a typical example of lmc cluster pair suspected to bebound in a binary system: indeed the cluster centers of gravity have an angularseparation of less than 1.4 arcmin in the sky. the spectral analysis of sevengiants in ngc 2136 and four in ngc 2137 reveals that the two clusters sharevery similar systemic radial velocities, namely vrad=271.5\pm0.4 km/s(sigma=1.0 km/s) and vrad=270.6\pm0.5 km/s (sigma=0.9 km/s) for ngc 2136 andngc 2137, respectively, and they have also indistinguishable abundancepatterns. the iron content is [fe/h]=-0.40\pm0.01 dex (sigma=0.03 dex) for ngc2136 and -0.39\pm0.01 dex (sigma=0.01 dex) for ngc 2137, while the [alpha/fe]ratios are roughly solar in both clusters. these findings suggest that the twoclusters are gravitationally bound and that they formed from the fragmentationof the same molecular cloud that was chemically homogeneous. this is the firstfirm confirmation of the binary nature of a lmc cluster pair. the most likelyfate of this system is to merge into a single structure in a time-scalecomparable with its orbital period.

1201.4959	the unimodal distribution of blue straggler stars in m75 (ngc 6864)	we have used a combination of multiband high-resolution and wide-fieldground-based observations to image the galactic globular cluster m75 (ngc6864). the extensive photometric sample covers the entire cluster extension,from the very central regions out to the tidal radius, allowing us to determinethe center of gravity and to construct the most extended star density profileever published for this cluster. we also present the first detailed star countsin the very inner regions. the star density profile is well re-produced by astandard king model with core radius r_c ~ 5.4" and intermediate-highconcentration c ~ 1.75. the present paper presents a detailed study of the bsspopulation and its radial distribution. a total number of 62 bright bsss (withm_f255w &lt; 21, corresponding to m_f555w &lt; 20) has been identified, and they havebeen found to be highly segregated in the cluster core. no significant upturnin the bss frequency has been observed in the outskirts of m75, in contrast toseveral other clusters studied with the same technique. this observational factis quite similar to what has been found in m79 (ngc 1904) by lanzoni et al.(2007a). indeed the bss radial distributions in the two clusters isqualitatively very similar, even if in m75 the relative bss frequency seems todecrease significantly faster than in m79: indeed it decreases by a factor of 5(from 3.4 to 0.7) within 1 r_c. such evidence indicate that the vast majorityof the cluster heavy stars (binaries) have already sunk to the core.

1205.5561	chemical and kinematical properties of bsss and hb stars in ngc 6397	we used three sets of high-resolution spectra acquired with the multifiberfacility flames at the very large telescope of the european southernobservatory to investigate the chemical and kinematical properties of a sampleof 42 horizontal branch (hb) stars, 18 blue straggler stars (bsss) and 86 mainsequence turn-off and sub-giant branch stars in the nearby globular cluster ngc6397. we measured rotational velocities and fe, o and mg abundances. all theunevolved stars in our sample turn out to have low rotational velocites (v sini&lt; 10\kms), while hb stars and bsss show a broad distribution, with valuesranging from 0 to 70 \kms. for hb stars with t&lt;10500 k there is a cleartemperature-oxygen anti-correlation, that can be understood if the starposition along the hb is mainly determined by the he content. the hottest bsssand hb stars (with temperatures t&gt;8200 k and t&gt; 10500 k, respectively) alsoshow significant deviations in their iron abundance with respect to the clustermetallicity (as traced by the unevolved stars, [fe/h]=-2.12). while similarchemical patterns have been already observed in other hot hb stars, this is thefirst evidence ever collected for bsss. we interprete these abundance anomaliesas due to the metal radiative levitation, occurring in stars with shallow or noconvective envelopes.

1206.6515	the identification of the optical companion to the binary millisecond  pulsar j0610-2100 in the galactic field	we have used deep v and r images acquired at the eso very large telescope toidentify the optical companion to the binary pulsar psr j0610-2100, one of theblack-widow millisecond pulsars recently detected by the fermi gamma-raytelescope in the galactic plane. we found a faint star (v~26.7) nearlycoincident (\delta r ~0".28) with the pulsar nominal position. this star isvisible only in half of the available images, while it disappears in thedeepest ones (those acquired under the best seeing conditions), thus indicatingthat it is variable. although our observations do not sample the entire orbitalperiod (p=0.28 d) of the pulsar, we found that the optical modulation of thevariable star nicely correlates with the pulsar orbital period and describes awell defined peak (r~25.6) at \phi=0.75, suggesting a modulation due to thepulsar heating. we tentatively conclude that the companion to psr j0610-2100 isa heavily ablated very low mass star (~ 0.02msun) that completely filled itsroche lobe.

1212.5071	dynamical age differences among coeval star clusters as revealed by blue  stragglers	globular star clusters that formed at the same cosmic time may have evolvedrather differently from a dynamical point of view (because that evolutiondepends on the internal environment) through a variety of processes that tendprogressively to segregate stars more massive than the average towards thecluster centre. therefore clusters with the same chronological age may havereached quite different stages of their dynamical history (that is, they mayhave different dynamical ages). blue straggler stars have masses greater thanthose at the turn-off point on the main sequence and therefore must be theresult of either a collision or a mass-transfer event. because they are amongthe most massive and luminous objects in old clusters, they can be used as testparticles with which to probe dynamical evolution. here we report that globularclusters can be grouped into a few distinct families on the basis of the radialdistribution of blue stragglers. this grouping corresponds well to an effectiveranking of the dynamical stage reached by stellar systems, thereby permitting adirect measure of the cluster dynamical age purely from observed properties.

0712.4272	blue straggler stars in the unusual globular cluster ngc 6388	we have used multi-band high resolution hst wfpc2 and acs observationscombined with wide field ground-based observations to study the blue stragglerstar (bss) population in the galactic globular cluster ngc 6388. as in severalother clusters we have studied, the bss distribution is found to be bimodal:highly peaked in the cluster center, rapidly decreasing at intermediate radii,and rising again at larger radii. in other clusters the sparsely populatedintermediate-radius region (or ``zone of avoidance'') corresponds well to thatpart of the cluster where dynamical friction would have caused the more massivebss or their binary progenitors to settle to the cluster center. instead, inngc 6388, bss still populate a region that should have been cleaned out bydynamical friction effects, thus suggesting that dynamical friction is somehowless efficient than expected. as by-product of these observations, the peculiarmorphology of the horizontal branch (hb) is also confirmed. in particular,within the (very extended) blue portion of the hb we are able to clearlycharacterize three sub-populations: ordinary blue hb stars, extreme hb stars,and blue hook stars. each of these populations has a radial distribution whichis indistinguishable from normal cluster stars.

1304.2953	the velocity dispersion profile of ngc 6388 from resolved-star  spectroscopy: no evidence of a central cusp and new constraints on the black  hole mass	by combining high spatial resolution and wide-field spectroscopy performed,respectively, with sinfoni and flames at the eso/vlt we measured the radialvelocities of more than 600 stars in the direction of ngc 6388, a galacticglobular cluster which is suspected to host an intermediate-mass black hole.approximately 55% of the observed targets turned out to be cluster members. thecluster velocity dispersion has been derived from the radial velocity ofindividual stars: 52 measurements in the innermost 2", and 276 stars locatedbetween 18" and 600". the velocity dispersion profile shows a central value of~13 km/s, a flat behavior out to ~60" and a decreasing trend outwards. thecomparison with spherical and isotropic models shows that the observed densityand velocity dispersion profiles are inconsistent with the presence of acentral black hole more massive than ~2000 msol. these findings are at oddswith recent results obtained from integrated light spectra, showing a velocitydispersion profile with a steep central cusp of 23-25 km/s at r&lt;2" andsuggesting the presence of a black hole with a mass of 17,000 msol (lutzgendorfet al. 2011). we also found some evidence of systemic rotation with amplitudearot ~8 km/s in the innermost 2" (0.13 pc), decreasing to arot= 3.2 km/s at18"&lt;r&lt;160".

1306.0839	flames and xshooter spectroscopy along the two bss sequences of m30	we present spectroscopic observations acquired with flames and xshooter atthe very large telescope for a sample of 15 blue straggler stars (bsss) in theglobular cluster (gc) m30. the targets have been selected to sample the two bsssequences discovered, with 7 bsss along the blue sequence and 8 along the redone. no difference in the kinematical properties of the two groups of bsss hasbeen found. in particular, almost all the observed bsss have projectedrotational velocity lower than ~30 km/s, with only one (blue) fast rotating bss(&gt;90 km/s), identified as a w uma binary. this rotational velocity distributionis similar to those obtained in 47 tucanae and ngc 6397, while m4 remains theonly gc studied so far harboring a large fraction of fast rotating bsss. allstars hotter than ~7800 k (regardless of the parent bss sequence) show ironabundances larger than those measured from normal cluster stars, with aclearcut trend with the effective temperature. this behaviour suggests thatparticle trasport mechanisms driven by radiative levitation occur in thephotosphere of these stars, as already observed for the bsss in ngc 6397.finally, 4 bsss belonging to the red sequence (not affected by radiativelevitation) show a strong depletion of [o/fe], with respect to the abundancemeasured in red giant branch and horizontal branch stars. this o-depletion iscompatible with the chemical signature expected in bsss formed by mass transferprocesses in binary systems, in agreement with the mechanism proposed for theformation of bsss in the red sequence.

1307.6035	star count density profiles and structural parameters of 26 galactic  globular clusters	we used a proper combination of high-resolution hst observations andwide-field ground based data to derive the radial star density profile of 26galactic globular clusters from resolved star counts (which can be all freelydownloaded on-line). with respect to surface brightness (sb) profiles (whichcan be biased by the presence of sparse, bright stars), star counts areconsidered to be the most robust and reliable tool to derive cluster structuralparameters. for each system a detailed comparison with both king and wilsonmodels has been performed and the most relevant best-fit parameters have beenobtained. this is the largest homogeneous catalog collected so far of starcount profiles and structural parameters derived therefrom. the analysis of thedata of our catalog has shown that: (1) the presence of the central cuspspreviously detected in the sb profiles of ngc 1851, m13 and m62 is notconfirmed; (2) the majority of clusters in our sample are fitted equally wellby the king and the wilson models; (3) we confirm the known relationshipbetween cluster size (as measured by the effective radius) and galactocentricdistances; (4) the ratio between the core and the effective radii shows abimodal distribution, with a peak at ~ 0.3 for about 80% of the clusters, and asecondary peak at ~ 0.6 for the remaining 20%. interestingly, the main peakturns out to be in agreement with what expected from simulations of clusterdynamical evolution and the ratio between these two radii well correlates withan empirical dynamical age indicator recently defined from the observed shapeof blue straggler star radial distribution, thus suggesting that no exoticmechanisms of energy generation are needed in the cores of the analyzedclusters.

1308.5810	deep multi-telescope photometry of ngc 5466. i. blue stragglers and  binary systems	we present a detailed investigation of the radial distribution of bluestraggler star and binary populations in the galactic globular cluster ngc5466, over the entire extension of the system. we used a combination of dataacquired with the acs on board the hubble space telescope, the lbc-blue mountedon the large binocular telescope, and megacam on the canadian-france-hawaiitelescope. blue straggler stars show a bimodal distribution with a mild centralpeak and a quite internal minimum. this feature is interpreted in terms of arelatively young dynamical age in the framework of the "dynamical clock"concept proposed by ferraro et al. (2012). the estimated fraction of binariesis 6-7% in the central region (r&lt;90") and slightly lower (5.5%) in theoutskirts, at r&gt;200". quite interestingly, the comparison with the results ofmilone et al. (2012) suggests that also binary systems may display a bimodalradial distribution, with the position of the minimum consistent with that ofblue straggler stars. if confirmed, this feature would give additional supportto the scenario where the radial distribution of objects more massive than theaverage cluster stars is primarily shaped by the effect of dynamical friction.moreover, this would also be consistent with the idea that the unperturbedevolution of primordial binaries could be the dominant bss formation process inlow-density environments.

1407.0047	chemical and kinematical properties of galactic bulge stars surrounding  the stellar system terzan 5	as part of a study aimed at determining the kinematical and chemicalproperties of terzan 5, we present the first characterization of the bulgestars surrounding this puzzling stellar system. we observed 615 targets locatedwell beyond the tidal radius of terzan 5 and we found that their radialvelocity distribution is well described by a gaussian function peaked at&lt;v_rad&gt;=+21.0\pm4.6 km/s and with dispersion sigma_v=113.0\pm2.7 km/s. this isthe one of the few high-precision spectroscopic survey of radial velocities fora large sample of bulge stars in such a low and positive latitude environment(b=+1.7{\deg}). we found no evidence for the peak at &lt;v_rad&gt;\sim+200 km/s foundin nidever et al. 2012. the strong contamination of many observed spectra bytio bands prevented us from deriving the iron abundance for the entirespectroscopic sample, introducing a selection bias. the metallicitydistribution was finally derived for a sub-sample of 112 stars in a magnituderange where the effect of the selection bias is negligible. the distribution isquite broad and roughly peaked at solar metallicity ([fe/h]\simeq+0.05 dex)with a similar number of stars in the super-solar and in the sub-solar ranges.the population number ratios in different metallicity ranges agree well withthose observed in other low-latitude bulge fields suggesting (i) the possiblepresence of a plateau for |b|&lt;4{\deg} for the ratio between stars in thesuper-solar (0&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0.5 dex) and sub-solar (-0.5&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0 dex) metallicityranges; (ii) a severe drop of the metal-poor component ([fe/h]&lt;-0.5) as afunction of galactic latitude.

1410.2275	spinning like a blue straggler: the population of fast rotating blue  straggler stars in omega centauri	by using high-resolution spectra acquired with flames-giraffe at the eso/vlt,we measured radial and rotational velocities for 110 blue straggler stars(bsss) in omega centauri, the globular cluster-like stellar system harboringthe largest known bss population. according to their radial velocities, 109bsss are members of the system. the rotational velocity distribution is verybroad, with the bulk of bsss spinning at less than ~40 km/s (in agreement withthe majority of such stars observed in other globular clusters) and a long tailreaching ~200 km/s. about 40% of the sample has vsini &gt;40 km/s and about 20%has vsini &gt;70 km/s. such a large fraction is very similar to the percentage ofof fast rotating bsss observed in m4. thus, omega centauri is the secondstellar cluster, beyond m4, with a surprisingly high population of fastspinning bsss. we found a hint of a radial behaviour of the fraction of fastrotating bsss, with a mild peak within one core radius, and a possibile rise inthe external regions (beyond four core radii). this may suggest that recentformation episodes of mass transfer bsss occurred preferentially in theoutskirts of omega centauri, or that braking mechanisms able to slow down thesestars are least efficient in lowest density environments.

1411.2161	probing the role of dynamical friction in shaping the bss radial  distribution. i - semi-analytical models and preliminary n-body simulations	we present semi-analytical models and simplified $n$-body simulations with$10^4$ and $10^5$ particles aimed at probing the role of dynamical friction(df) in determining the radial distribution of blue straggler stars (bsss) inglobular clusters. the semi-analytical models show that df (which is the onlyevolutionary mechanism at work) is responsible for the formation of a bimodaldistribution with a dip progressively moving toward the external regions of thecluster. however, these models fail to reproduce the formation of thelong-lived central peak observed in all dynamically evolved clusters. theresults of $n$-body simulations confirm the formation of a sharp central peak,which remains as a stable feature over the time regardless of the initialconcentration of the system. in spite of a noisy behavior, a bimodaldistribution forms in many cases, with the size of the dip increasing as afunction of time. in the most advanced stages the distribution becomesmonotonic. these results are in agreement with the observations. also the shapeof the peak and the location of the minimum (which in most of the cases iswithin 10 core radii) turn out to be consistent with observational results. fora more detailed and close comparison with observations, including a propercalibration of the timescales of the dynamical processes driving the evolutionof the bss spatial distribution, more realistic simulations will be necessary.

1501.01358	the binary mass transfer origin of the red blue straggler sequence in  m30	two separated sequences of blue straggler stars (bsss) have been revealed byferraro et al. (2009) in the color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of the milky wayglobular cluster m30. their presence has been suggested to be related to thetwo bss formation channels (namely, collisions and mass-transfer in closebinaries) operating within the same stellar system. the blue sequence wasindeed found to be well reproduced by collisional bss models. in contrast, nospecific models for mass transfer bsss were available for an old stellar systemlike m30. here we present binary evolution models, including case-b masstransfer and binary merging, specifically calculated for this cluster. wediscuss in detail the evolutionary track of a $0.9+0.5 m_\odot$ binary, whichspends approximately 4 gyr in the bss region of the cmd of a 13 gyr oldcluster. we also run monte-carlo simulations to study the distribution of masstransfer bsss in the cmd and to compare it with the observational data. ourresults show that: (1) the color and magnitude distribution of synthetic masstransfer bsss defines a strip in the cmd that nicely matches the observed redbss sequence, thus providing strong support to the mass transfer origin forthese stars; (2) the cmd distribution of synthetic bsss never attains theobserved location of the blue bss sequence, thus reinforcing the hypothesisthat the latter formed through a different channel (likely collisions); (3)most ($\sim 60\%$) of the synthetic bsss are produced by mass-transfer models,while the remaining $&lt; 40\%$ requires the contribution from merger models.

1501.01968	the origin of the spurious iron spread in the globular cluster ngc 3201	ngc 3201 is a globular cluster suspected to have an intrinsic spread in theiron content. we re-analysed a sample of 21 cluster stars observed withuves-flames at the very large telescope and for which simmerer et al. found a0.4 dex wide [fe/h] distribution with a metal-poor tail. we confirmed that whenspectroscopic gravities are adopted, the derived [fe/h] distribution spans ~0.4dex. on the other hand, when photometric gravities are used, the metallicitydistribution from fe i lines remains large, while that derived from fe ii linesis narrow and compatible with no iron spread. we demonstrate that themetal-poor component claimed by simmerer et al. is composed by asymptotic giantbranch stars that could be affected by non local thermodynamical equilibriumeffects driven by iron overionization. this leads to a decrease of the fe iabundance, while leaving the fe ii abundance unaltered. a similar finding hasbeen already found in asymptotic giant branch stars of the globular clusters m5and 47 tucanae. we conclude that ngc 3201 is a normal cluster, with no evidenceof intrinsic iron spread.

1512.00649	weighing stars: the identification of an evolved blue straggler star in  the globular cluster 47 tucanae	globular clusters are known to host peculiar objects, named blue stragglerstars (bsss), significantly heavier than the normal stellar population. whilethese stars can be easily identified during their core hydrogen-burning phase,they are photometrically indistinguishable from their low-mass sisters inadvanced stages of the subsequent evolution. a clear-cut identification ofthese objects would require the direct measurement of the stellar mass. we usedthe detailed comparison between chemical abundances derived from neutral andfrom ionized spectral lines as a powerful stellar "weighing device" to measurestellar mass and to identify an evolved bss in 47 tucanae. in particular,high-resolution spectra of three bright stars located slightly above the levelof the "canonical" horizontal branch sequence in the color-magnitude diagram of47 tucanae, have been obtained with uves spectrograph. the measurements of ironand titanium abundances performed separately from neutral and ionized linesreveal that two targets have stellar parameters fully consistent with thoseexpected for low-mass post-horizontal branch objects, while for the othertarget the elemental ionization balance is obtained only by assuming a mass of~1.4msol, which is significantly larger than the main sequence turn-off mass ofthe cluster (~0.85 msol). the comparison with theoretical stellar trackssuggests that this is a bss descendant possibly experiencing its corehelium-burning phase. the large applicability of the proposed method to most ofthe globular clusters in our galaxy opens the possibility to initiatesystematic searches for evolved bsss, thus giving access to still unexploredphases of their evolution.

astro-ph;0009474	energy, entropy and mass scaling relations for elliptical galaxies.  towards a physical understanding of their photometric properties	in the present paper, we show that elliptical galaxies (es) obey a scalingrelation between potential energy and mass. since they are relaxed systems in apost violent-relaxation stage, they are quasi-equilibrium gravitational systemsand therefore they also have a quasi-constant specific entropy.  assuming that light traces mass, these two laws imply that in the spacedefined by the three s\'ersic law parameters (intensity sigma_0, scale a andshape nu), elliptical galaxies are distributed on two intersecting 2-manifolds:the entropic surface and the energy-mass surface.  using a sample of 132 galaxies belonging to three nearby clusters, we haveverified that ellipticals indeed follow these laws. this also implies that theyare distributed along the intersection line (the energy-entropy line), thusthey constitute a one-parameter family.  these two physical laws (separately or combined), allow to find thetheoretical origin of several observed photometrical relations, such as thecorrelation between absolute magnitude and effective surface brightness, andthe fact that ellipticals are located on a surface in the [log r_eff, -2.5 logsigma_0, log nu] space. the fact that elliptical galaxies are a one-parameterfamily has important implications for cosmology and galaxy formation andevolution models. moreover, the energy-entropy line could be used as a distanceindicator.

astro-ph;0307141	the scaling relations of galaxy clusters and their dark matter halos	like early-type galaxies, also nearby galaxy clusters define a fundamentalplane, a luminosity-radius, and a luminosity-velocity dispersion relations,whose physical origin is still unclear. by means of high resolution n--bodysimulations of massive dark matter halos in a lambda-cdm cosmology, we findthat scaling relations similar to those observed for galaxy clusters arealready defined by their dark matter hosts. the slopes however are not thesame, and among the various possibilities in principle able to bring thesimulated and the observed scaling relations in mutual agreement, we show thatthe preferred solution is a luminosity dependent mass-to-light ratio (m/l ~l^0.3), that well corresponds to what inferred observationally. we then showthat at galactic scales there is a conflict between the cosmologicalpredictions of structure formation, the observed trend of the mass-to-lightratio in ellipticals, and the slope of their luminosity-velocity dispersionrelation (that significantly differs from the analogous one followed byclusters). the conclusion is that the scaling laws of elliptical galaxies mightbe the combined result of the cosmological collapse of density fluctuations atthe epoch when galactic scales became non-linear, plus important modificationsafterward due to early-time dissipative merging. finally, we briefly discussthe possible evolution of the cluster scaling relations with redshift.

astro-ph;0502490	galics -- vi. modelling hierarchical galaxy formation in clusters	high-resolution n-body re-simulations of 15 massive (10^{14}-10^{15} msun)dark matter haloes have been combined with the hybrid galaxy formation modelgalics (hatton et al. 2003), to study the formation and evolution of galaxiesin clusters, within the framework of the hierarchical merging scenario. newfeatures in galics include a better description of galaxy positioning withindark matter haloes, a more reliable computation of the temperature of theinter-galactic medium as a function of redshift, and a description of the rampressure stripping process. we focus on the luminosity functions, morphologicalfractions and colour distributions of galaxies in clusters and in clusteroutskirts, at z=0. no systematic dependency on cluster richness is found eitherfor the galaxy luminosity functions, morphological mixes, or colourdistributions. moving from higher density (cluster cores), to lower densityenvironments (cluster outskirts), we detect a progressive flattening of theluminosity functions, an increase of the fraction of spirals and a decrease ofthat of ellipticals and s0s, and the progressive emergence of a bluer tail inthe distributions of galaxy colours, especially for spirals. as compared tocluster spirals, early-type galaxies show a flatter luminosity function, andmore homogeneous and redder colours. an overall good agreement is found betweenour results and the observations, particularly in terms of the clusterluminosity functions and morphological mixes. however, some discrepancies arealso apparent, with too faint magnitudes of the brightest cluster members,especially in the b band, and galaxy colours tendentially too red (or not blueenough) in the model, with respect to the observations. finally, ram pressurestripping appears to affect very little our results.

astro-ph;0608545	comparing dynamical and photometric-stellar masses of early-type  galaxies at z ~ 1	the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between galaxystellar masses, based on multiwavelength photometry spectral template fittingand dynamical masses based on published velocity dispersion measurements, for asample of 48 early-type galaxies at z ~ 1 with hst/acs morphologicalinformation. we determine photometric-stellar masses and perform a quantitativemorphological analysis of cluster and field galaxies at redshift 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.2,using ground- and space-based multiwavelegth data available on the goods-sfield and on the field around the x-ray luminous cluster rdcs1252.9-2927 at z =1.24. we use multi-band photometry over 0.4-8um from hst/acs, vlt/isaac andspitzer/irac to estimate photometric-stellar masses using composite stellarpopulation (csp) templates computed with pegase.2 models. we compare stellarmasses with those obtained using csps built with bruzual &amp; charlot and marastonmodels. we then compare photometric-stellar mass and dynamical mass estimatesas a function of morphological parameters obtained from hst/acs imaging. basedon our sample, which spans the mass range log(mphot)=[10, 11.5], we find that1) pegase.2, bc03, m05 yield consistent photometric-stellar masses forearly-type galaxies at z ~ 1 with a small scatter (0.15 dex rms); 2) adopting akroupa imf, photometric-stellar masses match dynamical mass estimates forearly-type galaxies with an average offset of 0.27 dex; 3) assuming a costantimf, increasing dark matter fraction with the increasing galaxy mass canexplain the observed trend.

astro-ph;0609220	the radial distribution of blue straggler stars and the nature of their  progenitors	the origin of blue straggler stars (bss) in globular clusters (gcs) is stillnot fully understood: they can form from stellar collisions, or through masstransfer in isolated, primordial binaries (pbs). in this paper we use theradial distribution of bss observed in four gcs (m3, 47tuc, ngc6752 and omegacen) to investigate which formation process prevails. we find that bothchannels co-exist in all the considered gcs. the fraction of mass-transfer(collisional) bss with respect to the total number of bss is around ~0.4-0.5(~0.5-0.6) in m3, 47tuc, and ngc6752. the case of omega cen is peculiar with anunderproduction of collisional bss. the relative lack of collisional bss inomega cen can be understood if mass segregation has not yet driven to the corea sizeable number of pbs, which dominate stellar collisions through three- andfour-body processes. the spatial distribution of bss provides strong hints totheir origin: the bss in the cluster outskirts form almost exclusively frommass transfer in pbs, whereas the bss found close to the cluster core mostlikely have a collisional origin.

astro-ph;9601100	the tilt of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies: i. dynamical  and structural effects	in this paper we explore several structural and dynamical effects on theprojected velocity dispersion as possible causes of the fundamental plane (fp)tilt of elliptical galaxies. specifically, we determine the size of thesystematic trend along the fp in the orbital radial anisotropy, in the darkmatter (dm) content and distribution relative to the bright matter, and in theshape of the light profile that would be needed to produce the tilt, under theassumption of a constant stellar mass to light ratio. spherical, non rotating,two--components models are constructed, where the light profiles resemble the$r^{1/4}$ law. for the investigated models anisotropy cannot play a major rolein causing the tilt, while a systematic increase in the dm content and/orconcentration may formally produce it. also a suitable variation of the shapeof the light profile can produce the desired effect, and there may be someobservational hints supporting this possibility. however, fine tuning is alwaysrequired in order to produce the tilt, while preserving the {\it tightness} ofthe galaxies distribution about the fp.

astro-ph;9610251	stellar systems following the r^{1/m} luminosity law. ii anisotropy,  velocity profiles, and the fp of elliptical galaxies	we study the dynamical properties of spherical galaxies with surfaceluminosity profile described by the r^{1/m}-law, in which a variable degree oforbital anisotropy is allowed. the parameter m for the present models coversthe range [1,10]. for these models we study the self-consistently generatedphase-space distribution function (df), and we derive - as a function of m -the minimum value of the anisotropy radius for the model consistency (i.e., inorder to have a nowhere negative df). then we study the region in the parameterspace where the r^{1/m} models are likely to be stable against radial-orbitinstability, and we compare its size with that of the larger regioncorresponding to the consistency requirement. for stable anisotropic models thespatial and projected velocity dispersion profiles are obtained solving thejeans equation, and compared to those of the globally isotropic case, alreadydiscussed in paper i. the relevance of the results in connection with thefundamental plane (fp) of elliptical galaxies is pointed out: the effect on theprojected velocity dispersion due to the maximum orbital anisotropy allowed bythe stability requirement is well within the fp thickness, and so nofine-tuning for anisotropy is required. finally, the velocity profiles areconstructed as function of the projected radius and for various degrees ofanisotropy, and their deviations from a gaussian discussed.
