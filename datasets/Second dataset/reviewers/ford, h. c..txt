0903.3988	bright strongly lensed galaxies at redshift z~ 6-7 behind the clusters  abell 1703 and cl0024+161	we report on the discovery of three bright, strongly-lensed objects behindabell 1703 and cl0024+16 from a dropout search over 25 square arcminutes ofdeep nicmos data, with deep acs optical coverage. they are undetected in thedeep acs images below 8500 a and have clear detections in the j and h bands.fits to the acs, nicmos and irac data yield robust photometric redshifts in therange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshiftinterlopers. all three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of brightknots. the bright i-band dropout in abell 1703 has an h-band ab magnitude of23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z&gt;5.5. ourmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with amass of ~ 1e10 solar mass. the dropout galaxy candidates behind cl0024+16 areseparated by 2.5" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have h-band ab magnitudesof 25.0 and 25.6. lensing models of cl0024+16 suggest that the objects havecomparable intrinsic magnitudes of ab ~ 27.3, approximately one magnitudefainter than l* at z~6.5. their similar redshifts, spectral energydistribution, and luminosities, coupled with their very close proximity on thesky, suggest that they are spatially associated, and plausibly are physicallybound. combining this sample with two previously reported, similarly magnifiedgalaxy candidates at z~6-8, we find that complex systems with dual nuclei maybe a common feature of high-redshift galaxies.

0908.3897	hubble space telescope weak-lensing study of the galaxy cluster xmmu  j2235.3-2557 at z=1.4: a surprisingly massive galaxy cluster when the  universe is one-third of its current age	we present a weak-lensing analysis of the z=1.4 galaxy cluster xmmuj2235.3-2557, based on deep advanced camera for surveys images. despite theobservational challenge set by the high redshift of the lens, we detect asubstantial lensing signal at the &gt;~ 8 sigma level. this clear detection isenabled in part by the high mass of the cluster, which is verified by our bothparametric and non-parametric estimation of the cluster mass. assuming that thecluster follows a navarro-frenk-white mass profile, we estimate that theprojected mass of the cluster within r=1 mpc is (8.5+-1.7) x 10^14 solar mass,where the error bar includes the statistical uncertainty of the shear profile,the effect of possible interloping background structures, the scatter inconcentration parameter, and the error in our estimation of the mean redshiftof the background galaxies. the high x-ray temperature 8.6_{-1.2}^{+1.3} kev ofthe cluster recently measured with chandra is consistent with this high lensingmass. when we adopt the 1-sigma lower limit as a mass threshold and use thecosmological parameters favored by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe5-year (wmap5) result, the expected number of similarly massive clusters at z&gt;~ 1.4 in the 11 square degree survey is n ~ 0.005. therefore, the discovery ofthe cluster within the survey volume is a rare event with a probability &lt; 1%,and may open new scenarios in our current understanding of cluster formationwithin the standard cosmological model.

0910.1352	local lyman break galaxy analogs: the impact of massive star-forming  clumps on the interstellar medium and the global structure of young, forming  galaxies	we present hst uv/optical imaging, spitzer mid-ir photometry, and opticalspectroscopy of a sample of 30 low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) galaxies chosen fromsdss/galex to be accurate local analogs of the high-z lyman break galaxies. thelyman break analogs (lbas) are similar in mass, metallicity, dust, sfr, sizeand gas velocity dispersion, thus enabling a detailed investigation ofprocesses that are important at high-z. the optical emission line properties oflbas are also similar to those of lbgs, indicating comparable conditions intheir ism. in the uv, lbas are characterized by complexes of massivestar-forming "clumps", while in the optical they most often show evidence for(post-)mergers/interactions. in 6 cases, we find an extremely massive (&gt;10^9msun) compact (r~100 pc) dominant central object (dco). the dcos arepreferentially found in lbas with the highest mid-ir luminosities andcorrespondingly high sfrs (15-100 msun/yr). we show that the massive sf clumps(including the dcos) have masses much larger than the nuclear super starclusters seen in normal late type galaxies. however, the dcos have masses,sizes, and densities similar to the excess-light/central-cusps seen in typicalelliptical galaxies with masses similar to the lba galaxies. we suggest thatthe dcos form in present-day examples of the dissipative mergers at highredshift that are believed to have produced the central-cusps in localellipticals. more generally, the properties of the lbas are consistent with theidea that instabilities in a gas-rich disk lead to very massive star-formingclumps that eventually coalesce to form a spheroid. we speculate that the dcosare too young at present to be growing a supermassive black hole because theyare still in a supernova-dominated outflow phase.

0704.1507	hst/acs coronagraphic observations of the dust surrounding hd 100546	we present acs/hst coronagraphic observations of hd 100546, a b9.5 star, 103pc away from the sun, taken in the f435w, f606w, and f814w bands. scatteredlight is detected up to 14'' from the star. the observations are consistentwith the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination asthe inner disk. the well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and theytrail the rotating disk material. weaker arms never before reported are alsoseen. the inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become moreneutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with modelsthat assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. along the majordisk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \delta(f435w-f606w) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \delta (f435w-f814w)~0.5--1 mags. to explainthese colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, andlarge minimum sizes on ism-like grains. we conclude each of these hypotheses byitself cannot explain the colors. the disk colors are similar to those derivedfor kuiper belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible fortheir colors may be at work here. we argue that we are observing only thegeometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the opticallythick disk responsible for the far-ir emission is undetected. the observedspiral arms are then structures on this envelope. the colors indicate that theextended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocesseddisk material.

0707.2787	the evolution of the field and cluster morphology-density relation for  mass-selected samples of galaxies	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and photometric/spectroscopic surveys inthe goods-south field (the chandra deep field-south, cdfs) are used toconstruct volume-limited, stellar mass-selected samples of galaxies atredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. the cdfs sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 contains 207 galaxies completedown to m=4x10^10 msol (for a ``diet'' salpeter imf), corresponding to aluminosity limit for red galaxies of m_b=-20.1. the sdss sample at0.020&lt;z&lt;0.045 contains 2003 galaxies down to the same mass limit, whichcorresponds to m_b=-19.3 for red galaxies. morphologies are determined with anautomated method, using the sersic parameter n and a measure of the residualfrom the model fits, called ``bumpiness'', to distinguish differentmorphologies. these classifications are verified with visual classifications.in agreement with previous studies, 65-70% of the galaxies are located on thered sequence, both at z~0.03 and at z~0.8. similarly, 65-70% of the galaxieshave n&gt;2.5. the fraction of e+s0 galaxies is 43+/-3%$ at z~0.03 and 48+/-7% atz~0.8, i.e., it has not changed significantly since z~0.8. when combined withrecent results for cluster galaxies in the same redshift range, we find thatthe morphology-density relation for galaxies more massive than 0.5m* hasremained constant since at least z~0.8. this implies that galaxies evolve inmass, morphology and density such that the morphology-density relation does notchange. in particular, the decline of star formation activity and theaccompanying increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies since z~1must happen without large changes in the early-type galaxy fraction in a givenenvironment.

1009.3986	star formation histories in a cluster environment at z~0.84	we present a spectrophotometric analysis of galaxies belonging to thedynamically young, massive cluster rx j0152.7-1357 at z~0.84, aimed atunderstanding the effects of the cluster environment on the star formationhistory (sfh) of cluster galaxies and the assembly of the red-sequence (rs). weuse vlt/fors spectroscopy, acs/wfc optical and ntt/sofi near-ir data tocharacterize sfhs as a function of color, luminosity, morphology, stellar mass,and local environment from a sample of 134 spectroscopic members. in order toincrease the signal-to-noise, individual galaxy spectra are stacked accordingto these properties. moreover, the d4000, balmer, cn3883, fe4383 and c4668indices are also quantified. the sfh analysis shows that galaxies in the bluefaint-end of the rs have on average younger stars (delta t ~ 2 gyr) than thosein the red bright-end. we also found, for a given luminosity range, differencesin age (delta t ~ 0.5 - 1.3 gyr) as a function of color, indicating that theintrinsic scatter of the rs may be due to age variations. passive galaxies inthe blue faint-end of the rs are preferentially located in the low densityareas of the cluster, likely being objects entering the rs from the "bluecloud". it is likely that the quenching of the star formation of these rsgalaxies is due to interaction with the intracluster medium. furthermore, thesfh of galaxies in the rs as a function of stellar mass reveals signatures of"downsizing" in the overall cluster.

1103.0265	early-type galaxies at z ~ 1.3. iii. on the dependence of formation  epochs and star formation histories on stellar mass and environment	we study the environmental dependence of stellar population properties at z ~1.3. we derive galaxy properties (stellar masses, ages and star formationhistories) for samples of massive, red, passive early-type galaxies in twohigh-redshift clusters, rxj0849+4452 and rxj0848+4453 (with redshifts of z =1.26 and 1.27, respectively), and compare them with those measured for therdcs1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 and with those measured for a similarlymass-selected sample of field contemporaries drawn from the goods-south field.robust estimates of the aforementioned parameters have been obtained bycomparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with extensive8-10 band photometric coverage, from the rest-frame far-ultraviolet to theinfrared. we find no variations of the overall stellar population propertiesamong the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. however, whencomparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, evenif the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxymass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their finalmass. we find that, approximately 1 gyr after the onset of star formation, themajority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (&gt; 80%) of theirfinal mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field etgs have. thus weconclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, theenvironment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories.

1105.3186	scaling relations and overabundance of massive clusters at z&gt;~1 from  weak-lensing studies with hst	we present weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 high-redshift (z &gt;~1)clusters based on hubble space telescope images. most clusters in our sampleprovide significant lensing signals and are well detected in theirreconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. combining the current results and ourprevious weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we comparegravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. werevisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in oursample is in tension with the current lambdacdm structure formation paradigm.we find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gastemperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperaturerelation at z &gt;~ 1. for the power law slope of the m-tx relation (m proptot^{\alpha}), we obtain \alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. this is consistent with thetheoretical self-similar prediction \alpha=3/2 and with the results previouslyreported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. however, ournormalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that thenormalization in the m-tx relation might evolve. after correcting for eddingtonbias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we findthat the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides atension with the current lambda cdm model. the combined probability of findingthe four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization overcurrent cosmological parameters is less than 1%.

0710.5560	principal component analysis of the time- and position-dependent point  spread function of the advanced camera for surveys	we describe the time- and position-dependent point spread function (psf)variation of the wide field channel (wfc) of the advanced camera for surveys(acs) with the principal component analysis (pca) technique. the time-dependentchange is caused by the temporal variation of the $hst$ focus whereas theposition-dependent psf variation in acs/wfc at a given focus is mainly theresult of changes in aberrations and charge diffusion across the detector,which appear as position-dependent changes in elongation of the astigmatic coreand blurring of the psf, respectively. using &gt;400 archival images of starcluster fields, we construct a acs psf library covering diverse environments ofthe $hst$ observations (e.g., focus values). we find that interpolation of asmall number ($\sim20$) of principal components or ``eigen-psfs'' per exposurecan robustly reproduce the observed variation of the ellipticity and size ofthe psf. our primary interest in this investigation is the application of thispsf library to precision weak-lensing analyses, where accurate knowledge of theinstrument's psf is crucial. however, the high-fidelity of the model judgedfrom the nice agreement with observed psfs suggests that the model ispotentially also useful in other applications such as crowded field stellarphotometry, galaxy profile fitting, agn studies, etc., which similarly demand afair knowledge of the psfs at objects' locations. our psf models, applicable toany wfc image rectified with the lanczos3 kernel, are publicly available.

0802.2506	discovery of a very bright strongly-lensed galaxy candidate at z ~ 7.6	using hst and spitzer irac imaging, we report the discovery of a very brightstrongly lensed lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidate at z~7.6 in the field of themassive galaxy cluster abell 1689. the galaxy candidate, which we refer to asa1689-zd1, shows a strong z-j break of at least 2.2 mag and is completelyundetected (&lt;1 sigma) in hst/acs g, r, i, and z-band data. these properties,combined with the very blue j-h and h-[4.5] colors, are exactly the propertiesof an z~7.6 lbg and can only be reasonably fit by a star-forming galaxy atz=7.6 +/- 0.4. attempts to reproduce these properties with a model galaxy atz&lt;4 yield particularly poor fits. a1689-zd1 has an observed (lensed) magnitudeof 24.7 ab (8 sigma) in the nicmos h band and is ~1.3 mag brighter than thebrightest-known z-dropout galaxy. when corrected for the cluster magnificationof 9.3 at z~7.6, the candidate has an intrinsic magnitude of h=27.1 ab, orabout an l* galaxy at z~7.6. the source-plane deprojection shows that the starformation is occurring in compact knots of size ~&lt;300 pc. the best-fit stellarpopulation synthesis models yield a median redshift of 7.6, stellar masses(1.6-3.9) x 10^9 m_sun, stellar ages 45-320 myr, star-formation rates ~&lt;7.6m_sun/yr, and low reddening with a_v &lt;= 0.3. these properties are generallysimilar to those of lbgs found at z~5-6. the inferred stellar ages suggest aformation redshift of z~8-10 (t~&lt;0.63 gyr). a1689-zd1 is the brightestobserved, highly reliable z&gt;7.0 galaxy candidate found to date.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

0806.4604	formation epochs, star formation histories and sizes of massive  early-type galaxies in cluster and field environments at z=1.2: insights from  the rest-frame uv	we derive stellar masses, ages and star formation histories of massiveearly-type galaxies in the z=1.237 rdcs1252.9-2927 cluster and compare themwith those measured in a similarly mass-selected sample of field contemporariesdrawn from the goods south field. robust estimates of these parameters areobtained by comparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with8-9 band photometry in the rest-frame nuv, optical and ir, thus sampling theentire relevant domain of emission of the different stellar populations.additionally, we present new, deep $u$-band photometry of both fields, givingaccess to the critical fuv rest-frame, in order to constrain empirically thedependence on the environment of the most recent star formation processes. wefind that early-type galaxies, both in the cluster and in the field, showanalogous optical morphologies, follow comparable mass vs. size relation, havecongruent average surface stellar mass densities and lie on the same kormendyrelation. we also that a fraction of early-type galaxies in the field employlonger timescales, $\tau$, to assemble their mass than their clustercontemporaries. hence we conclude that, while the formation epoch of early-typeonly depends on their mass, the environment does regulate the timescales oftheir star formation histories. our deep $u$-band imaging strongly supportsthis conclusions. it shows that cluster galaxies are at least 0.5 mag fainterthan their field contemporaries of similar mass and optical-to-infrared colors,implying that the last episode of star formation must have happened morerecently in the field than in the cluster.

astro-ph;0001156	discovery of 9 ly alpha emitters at redshift z~3.1 using narrow-band  imaging and vlt spectroscopy	narrow-band imaging surveys aimed at detecting the faint emission from the5007 [o iii] line of intracluster planetary nebulae in virgo also probe highredshift z=3.1 ly alpha emitters. here we report on the spectroscopicidentification of 9 ly alpha emitters at z=3.13, obtained with the forsspectrograph at unit 1 of the eso very large telescope (vlt ut1). the spectraof these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated ly alpha emission withvery faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalentwidth. no other features are visible in our spectra. our ly alpha emitters arequite similar to those found by hu (1998), cowie &amp; hu (1998) and hu et al.(1998). using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that thesesources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearlyoptically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain thehigh observed ly alpha equivalent widths. for the cosmological and starformation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem tocorrespond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhapsdestined to merge. the implied star formation density in our sampled comovingvolume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude asthe star formation density at z=3 derived by other authors from lyman-breakgalaxy surveys. this result agrees with the expectation that the ly alphaemitters are a low-metallicity (or low-dust) tail in a distribution of starforming regions at high redshifts. finally, the ly alpha emitters maycontribute as many h-ionizing photons as qsos at z=3.

astro-ph;0102292	dusty nuclear disks and filaments in early type galaxies	we examine the dust properties of a nearby distance-limited sample of earlytype galaxies using the wfpc2 of the hubble space telescope. dust is detectedin 29 out of 67 galaxies (43%), including 12 with small nuclear dusty disks. ina separate sample of 40 galaxies biased for the detection of dust by virtue oftheir detection in the iras 100 micron band, dust is found in ~78% of thegalaxies, 15 of which contain dusty disks. in those galaxies with detectabledust, the apparent mass of the dust correlates with radio and far infraredluminosity, becoming more significant for systems with filamentary dust. amajority of iras and radio detections are also associated with dusty galaxiesrather than dustless galaxies. this indicates that thermal emission fromclumpy, filamentary dust is the main source of the far-ir radiation in earlytype galaxies. dust in small disk-like morphology tends to be well aligned withthe major axis of the host galaxies, while filamentary dust appears to be morerandomly distributed with no preference for alignment with any major galacticstructure. this suggests that, if the dusty disks and filaments have a commonorigin, the dust originates externally and requires time to dynamically relaxand settle in the galaxy potential in the form of compact disks. more galaxieswith visible dust than without dust display emission lines, indicative ofionized gas, although such nuclear activity does not show a preference fordusty disk over filamentary dust. there appears to be a weak relationshipbetween the mass of the dusty disks and central velocity dispersion of thegalaxy, suggesting a connection with a similar recently recognized relationshipbetween the latter and the black hole mass.

astro-ph;0309036	advanced camera for surveys photometry of the cluster rdcs1252.9-2927:  the color-magnitude relation at z=1.24	we investigate the color-magnitude (cm) relation of galaxies in the distantx-ray selected cluster rdcs1252.9-2927 at z=1.24 using images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope in the f775wand f850lp bandpasses. we select galaxies based on morphologicalclassifications extending about 3.5 mag down the galaxy luminosity function,augmented by spectroscopic membership information. at the core of the clusteris an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair ofgalaxies that show signs of dynamical interaction. the early-type populationdefines a tight sequence in the cm diagram, with an intrinsic scatter inobserved (i-z) of $0.029\pm0.007$ mag based on 52 galaxies, or $0.024\pm0.008$mag for $\sim30$ ellipticals. simulations using the latest stellar populationmodels indicate an age scatter for the ellipticals of about 34%, with a meanage $\taul\gta2.6$ gyr (corresponding to $z_l\gta2.7$), and the last starformation occurring at $z_{end}\gta1.5$. transforming to rest-frame $(u-b)$, weconclude that the slope and scatter in the cm relation for morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies show little or no evidence for evolution out to$z\approx1.2$. thus, elliptical galaxies were already well established in x-rayluminous clusters when the universe was a third of its present age.

astro-ph;0311323	discovery of globular clusters in the proto-spiral ngc2915: implications  for hierarchical galaxy evolution	we have discovered three globular clusters beyond the holmberg radius inhubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys images of the gas-rich darkmatter dominated blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc2915. the clusters, all of whichstart to resolve into stars, have m_{v606} = -8.9 to -9.8 mag, significantlybrighter than the peak of the luminosity function of milky way globularclusters. their colors suggest a metallicity [fe/h] ~ -1.9 dex, typical ofmetal-poor galactic globular clusters. the specific frequency of clusters is ata minimum normal, compared to spiral galaxies. however, since only a smallportion of the system has been surveyed it is more likely that the luminosityand mass normalized cluster content is higher, like that seen in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters. this suggests that ngc2915 resembles a key phasein the early hierarchical assembly of galaxies - the epoch when much of the oldstellar population has formed, but little of the stellar disk. depending on thesubsequent interaction history, such systems could go on to build-up largerelliptical galaxies, evolve into normal spirals, or in rare circumstancesremain suspended in their development to become systems like ngc2915.

astro-ph;0409304	weak lensing analysis of the z~0.8 cluster cl 0152-1357 with the  advanced camera for surveys	we present a weak lensing analysis of the x-ray luminous cluster cl 0152-1357at z~0.84 using hst/acs observations. the unparalleled resolution andsensitivity of acs enable us to measure weakly distorted, faint backgroundgalaxies to the extent that the number density reaches ~175 arcmin^-2. the psfof acs has a complicated shape that also varies across the field. we constructa psf model for acs from an extensive investigation of 47 tuc stars in amodestly crowded region. we show that this model psf excellently describes thepsf variation pattern in the cluster observation when a slight adjustment ofellipticity is applied. the high number density of source galaxies and theaccurate removal of the psf effect through moment-based deconvolution allow usto restore the dark matter distribution of the cluster in great detail. thedirect comparison of the mass map with the x-ray morphology from chandraobservations shows that the two peaks of intracluster medium traced by x-rayemission are lagging behind the corresponding dark matter clumps, indicative ofan on-going merger. the overall mass profile of the cluster can be welldescribed by an nfw profile with a scale radius of r_s =309+-45 kpc and aconcentration parameter of c=3.7+-0.5. the mass estimates from the lensinganalysis are consistent with those from x-ray and sunyaev-zeldovich analyses.the predicted velocity dispersion is also in good agreement with thespectroscopic measurement from vlt observations. in the adopted wmap cosmology,the total projected mass and the mass-to-light ratio within 1 mpc are estimatedto be 4.92+-0.44 10^14 solar mass and 95+-8 solar mass/solar luminosity,respectively.

astro-ph;0411422	a resolved debris disk around the g2v star hd 107146	we present resolved scattered-light images of the debris disk around hd107146, a g2 star 28.5 pc from the sun. this is the first debris disk to beresolved in scattered light around a solar-type star. we observed it with thehst/acs coronagraph, using a 1.8'' occulting spot and the f606w (broad v) andf814w (broad i) filters. within 2'' from the star, the image is dominated bypsf subtraction residuals. outside this limit, the disk looks featurelessexcept for a northeast-southwest brightness asymmetry that we attribute toforward scattering. the disk has scattered-light fractional luminosities of$(l_{sca}/l_*)_{f606w}=6.8 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{-5}$ and$(l_{sca}/l_*)_{f814w}=10 \pm 1 \times 10^{-5}$ and it is detected up to 6.5''away from the star. to map the surface density of the disk, we deproject it by$25^\circ \pm 5^\circ$, divide by the dust scattering phase ($g_{f606w} = 0.3\pm 0.1$, $g_{f814w} = 0.2 \pm 0.1$) and correct for the geometric dilution ofstarlight. within the errors, the surface density has the same shape in eachbandpass, and it appears to be a broad (85 au) ring with most of the opacityconcentrated at 130 au. the ratio of the relative luminosity in f814w to thatin f606w has the constant value of $1.3\pm0.3$, with the error dominated byuncertainties in the value of $g$ in each filter. an examination of farinfrared and submillimeter measurements suggests the presence of small grains.the colors and the derived values of $g$ are consistent with the presence ofdust particles smaller than the radiation pressure limit. the dust generated bythe creation of a small planet or the scattering and circularization of a largeone, are possible scenarios that may explain the shape of the surface densityprofile.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.

astro-ph;0509650	imprints of environment on cluster and field late-type galaxies at z~1	we present a comparison of late-type galaxies (sa and later) in intermediateredshift clusters and the field using acs imaging of four cluster fields:cl0152-1357, cl1056-0337 (ms1054), cl1604+4304, and cl1604+4321. concentration,asymmetry, and clumpiness parameters are calculated for each galaxy in blue(f606w or f625w) and red (f775w or f814w) filters. galaxy half-light radii,disk scale lengths, color gradients, and overall color are compared. we findmarginally significant differences in the asymmetry distributions of spiral andirregular galaxies in the x-ray luminous and x-ray faint clusters. the massiveclusters contain fewer galaxies with large asymmetries. the physical sizes ofthe cluster and field populations are similar; no significant differences arefound in half-light radii or disk scale lengths. the most significantdifference is in rest-frame $u-b$ color. late-type cluster galaxies aresignificantly redder, $\sim 0.3$ magnitudes at rest-frame $u-b$, than theirfield counterparts. moreover, the intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies tendto have blue inward color gradients, in contrast to the field galaxies, butsimilar to late-type galaxies in low redshift clusters. these blue inward colorgradients are likely to be the result of enhanced nuclear star formation ratesrelative to the outer disk. based on the significant rest-frame colordifference, we conclude that late-type cluster members at $z\sim0.9$ are not apristine infalling field population; some difference in past and/or currentstar formation history is already present. this points to high redshift``groups'', or filaments with densities similar to present-day groups, as thesites where the first major effects of environment are imprinted.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.

astro-ph;0603058	clusters at half hubble time: galaxy structure and colors in  rxj0152.7-1357 and ms1054-03	we study the photometric and structural properties of spectroscopicallyconfirmed members in the two massive x-ray--selected z=0.83 galaxy clustersms1054-03 and rxj0152-1357 using three-band mosaic imaging with the hubblespace telescope advanced camera for surveys. the samples include 105 and 140members of ms1054-03 and rxj0152-1357, respectively, with acs f775w magnitude &lt;24.0. we develop a promising new structural classification method, based on acombination of the best-fit sersic indices and the normalized root-mean-squareresiduals from the fits; the resulting classes agree well with the visual ones,but are less affected by galaxy orientation. we examine the color--magnituderelations in detail and find that the color residuals correlate with the localmass density measured from our weak lensing maps; we identify a thresholddensity of $\sigma \approx 0.1$, in units of the critical density, above whichthe star formation appears to cease. for rxj0152-1357, we also find a trend inthe color residuals with velocity, resulting from an offset of about 980 km/sin the mean redshifts of the early- and late-type galaxies. analysis of thecolor--color diagrams indicates that a range of star formation time-scales areneeded to reproduce the loci of the galaxy colors. we also identify somecluster galaxies whose colors can only be explained by large amounts, $a_v\approx 1$ mag, of internal dust extinction.

astro-ph;0604390	the formation epoch of early-type galaxies in the z ~ 0.9 cl1604  supercluster	we analyse the cluster color-magnitude relation (cmr) for early-type galaxiesin two of the richer clusters in the z ~ 0.9 supercluster system to deriveaverage ages and formation redshifts for the early-type galaxy population. bothclusters were observed with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the {\ithubble space telescope} through the f606w and f814w filters, which brackets therest-frame 4000 \aa break at the cluster redshifts of z\sim 0.9. we fit thezeropoint and slope of the red cluster sequence, and model the scatter aboutthis relation to estimate average galaxy ages and formation redshifts. we findintrinsic scatters of 0.038-0.053 mag in ($v_{606}-i_{814}$) for the e and e+s0populations, corresponding to average ages of 3.5-3.7 gyr and formationredshifts z_{f}=2.4-2.6. we find at least one significant difference betweenthe cl1604+4304 and cl1604+4321 early-type cmrs. cl1604+4321, the less x-rayluminous and massive of the two, lacks bright l^* ellipticals. we combine thegalaxy samples to fit a composite cmr down to 0.15l^*, and find that the slopeof the combined cluster cmr is significantly steeper than for rx j0152.7-1357but consistent with ms 1054-03, both at similar redshift. the slope of thecl1604 cmr at the bright end (l &gt; 0.5l^*) is flatter and consistent with thecmr slopes found for other high redshift clusters. we find evidence forincreasing scatter with increasing magnitude along the early-type cmr,consistent with a 'downsizing' scenario, indicating younger mean ages withdecreasing galaxy mass.

astro-ph;0610909	the spiderweb galaxy: a forming massive cluster galaxy at z~2	we present a deep image of the radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 taken with thehubble space telescope (hst) at a redshift of z = 2.2. the galaxy is known tohave properties of a cd galaxy progenitor and be surrounded by a 3 mpc-sizedstructure, identified with a protocluster. the morphology shown on the new deephst/acs image is reminiscent of a spider's web. more than 10 individual clumpyfeatures are observed, apparently star-forming satellite galaxies in theprocess of merging with the progenitor of a dominant cluster galaxy 11 gyr ago.there is an extended emission component, implying that star formation wasoccurring over a 50 times 40 kpc region at a rate of more than 100 m_sun/yr. astriking feature of the newly named ``spiderweb galaxy'' is the presence ofseveral faint linear galaxies within the merging structure. the denseenvironments and fast galaxy motions at the centres of protoclusters maystimulate the formation of these structures, which dominate the faint resolvedgalaxy populations in the hubble ultra deep field. the new image provides aunique testbed for simulations of forming dominant cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;0703153	vlt and acs observations of rdcs j1252.9-2927: dynamical structure and  galaxy populations in a massive cluster at z=1.237	we present results from an extensive spectroscopic survey, carried out withvlt fors, and from an extensive multiwavelength imaging data set from the hstadvanced camera for surveys and ground based facilities, of the cluster ofgalaxies rdcs j1252.9-2927. we have spectroscopically confirmed 38 clustermembers in the redshift range 1.22 &lt; z &lt; 1.25. a cluster median redshift ofz=1.237 and a rest-frame velocity dispersion of 747^{+74}_{-84} km/s areobtained. using the 38 confirmed redshifts, we were able to resolve, for thefirst time at z &gt; 1, kinematic structure. the velocity distribution, which isnot gaussian at the 95% confidence level, is consistent with two groups thatare also responsible for the projected east-west elongation of the cluster. thegroups are composed of 26 and 12 galaxies with velocity dispersions of486^{+47}_{-85} km/s and 426^{+57}_{-105} km/s, respectively. the elongation isalso seen in the intracluster gas and the dark matter distribution. this leadsus to conclude that rdcs j1252.9-2927 has not yet reached a final virial state.we extend the analysis of the color-magnitude diagram of spectroscopic membersto more than 1 mpc from the cluster center. the scatter and slope ofnon-[oii]-emitting cluster members in the near-ir red sequence is similar tothat seen in clusters at lower redshift. furthermore, most of the galaxies withluminosities greater than ~ k_s*+1.5 do not show any [oii], indicating thatthese more luminous, redder galaxies have stopped forming stars earlier thanthe fainter, bluer galaxies. our observations provide detailed dynamical andspectrophotometric information on galaxies in this exceptional high-redshiftcluster, delivering an in-depth view of structure formation at this epoch only5 gyr after the big bang.

astro-ph;0703288	automated selection and characterization of emission-line sources in acs  wfc grism data	we present complimentary techniques to find emission-line targets and measuretheir properties in a semi-automated fashion from grism observations obtainedwith the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubble space telescope. thefirst technique is to find all likely sources in a direct image, extract theirspectra and search them for emission lines. the second method is to look foremission-line sources as compact structures in an unsharp masked version of thegrism image. using these methods we identify 46 emission-line targets in thehubble deep field north using a modest (3 orbit) expenditure of hst observingtime. grism spectroscopy is a powerful tool for efficiently identifyinginteresting low luminosity, moderate redshift emission-line field galaxies. thesources found here have a median i band flux 1.5 mag fainter than thespectroscopic redshift catalog of cohen et al. they have redshift z &lt;= 1.42,high equivalent widths (typically ew &gt; 100{\aa}), and are usually less luminousthan the characteristic luminosity at the same redshift. the chief obstacle ininterpreting the results is line identification, since the majority of sourceshave a single emission line and the spectral resolution is low. photometricredshifts are useful for providing a first guess redshift. however, even at thedepth of the state-of-the-art data used here, photometric errors can result inuncertainties in line identifications, especially for sources with i &gt; ~24.5abmag. reliable line identification for the faintest emission-line galaxiesrequires additional ground-based spectroscopy for confirmation. of particularconcern are the faint high ew [oii] emitters which could represent a stronglyevolving galaxy population if the possibility that they are mis-identifiedlower redshift interlopers can be ruled out.

astro-ph;9711299	hst detections of massive black holes in the centers of galaxies	after correcting spherical aberration in the hubble space telescope in 1993,the central masses of galaxies can be measured with a resolution 5 to 10 timesbetter than can be achieved at the best terrestrial sites. this improvement inresolution is decisive for detecting the gravitational signature of massiveblack holes in galaxy nuclei. the discovery of small (r ~ 100-200 pc) rotatinggaseous and stellar disks in the centers of many early-type galaxies provides anew and efficient means for measuring the central potentials of galaxies.concomitantly, vlbi observations of water masers in the nuclei of ngc 4258 andngc 1068 revealed exquisite keplerian rotation curves around massive blackholes at radii as small as 0.1 pc. recent terrestrial k-band measurements ofthe proper motions of stars in the cluster at the center of the galaxy provideirrefutable evidence for a black hole with a mass of 2.7e+6 m_sun. at the timeof this symposium, the presence of central massive black holes has beenestablished in 12 galaxies. the evidence suggests that there are massive blackholes in the centers of all agns and in most, if not all, nucleated galaxies.the present data show at best a weak correlation between black hole mass andbulge luminosity.

astro-ph;9801037	the nuclear spectrum of m87	the nuclear spectrum of m87 covering the ly_a-h_a wavelength range wasobtained with the hst faint object spectrograph (fos) trough a 0.21 arcsecaperture. contrary to some previous claims, a single power law (f(nu)~nu^(-a))can not reproduce the observed continuum shape and at least a broken power lawis require for a good fit (a = 1.75 and 1.41 shortward and longward of thebreak at ~4500 a). we detect a set of broad (fwhm ~ 400 km/s) absorption linesarising in the gas associated with m87. these are only lines from neutral andvery low ionization species blueshifted by ~150 km/s relative to the m87systemic velocity, indicating a net gas outflow and turbulence. the excitationsensitive emission line ratios suggest that shocks may be the dominant energysupplier.  the nuclear source in m87 is significantly variable. from the fos targetacquisition data, we have established that the flux from the optical nucleusvaries by a factor ~2 on time scales of ~2.5 months and by as much as 25% over3 weeks, and remains unchanged (&lt;2.5%) on time scales of ~1 day. thesetimescales limit the physical size of the emitting region to a few hundredgravitational radii. the variability, combined with other observed spectralproperties, strongly suggest that m87 is intrinsically of bl lac type but isviewed at an angle too large to reveal the classical bl lac properties.

astro-ph;9803178	morphology of the nuclear disk in m87	a deep, fuly sampled diffraction limited (fwhm ~ 70 mas) narrow-band image ofthe central region in m87 was obtained with the wide filed and planetary camera2 of the hubble space telescope using the dithering technique. theh-alpha+[nii] continuum subtracted image reveals a wealth of details in thegaseous disk structure described earlier by ford et al. (1994). the diskmorphology is dominated by a well defined three-arm spiral pattern. inaddition, the major spiral arms contain a large number of small "arclets"covering a range of sizes (0.1-0.3 arcsec = 10-30 pc). the overall surfacebrightness profile inside a radius ~1.5" (100 pc) is well represented by apower-law i(mu) ~ mu^(-1.75), but when the central ~40 pc are excluded it canbe equally well fit by an exponential disk. the major axis position angleremains constant at about pa_disk ~ 6 deg for the innermost ~1", implying thedisk is oriented nearly perpendicular to the synchrotron jet (pa_jet ~ 291deg). at larger radial distances the isophotes twist, reflecting the gasdistribution in the filaments connecting to the disk outskirts. the ellipticitywithin the same radial range is e = 0.2-0.4, which implies an inclination angleof i~35 deg. the sense of rotation combined with the dust obscuration patternindicate that the spiral arms are trailing.
