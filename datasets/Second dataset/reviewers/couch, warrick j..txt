0901.0548	the mass-metallicity gradient relation of early-type galaxies	we present a newly observed relation between galaxy mass and radialmetallicity gradients of early-type galaxies. our sample of 51 early-typegalaxies encompasses a comprehensive mass range from dwarf to brightest clustergalaxies. the metallicity gradients are measured out to one effective radius bycomparing nearly all of the lick absorption-line indices to recent models ofsingle stellar populations. the relation shows very different behaviour at lowand high masses, with a sharp transition being seen at a mass of ~ 3.5 x 10^10m_sun (velocity dispersion of ~140 km/s, m_b ~ -19). low-mass galaxies form atight relation with mass, such that metallicity gradients become shallower withdecreasing mass and positive at the very low-mass end. above the masstransition point several massive galaxies have steeper gradients, but a cleardownturn is visible marked by a broad scatter. the results are interpreted incomparison with competing model predictions. we find that an early star-formingcollapse could have acted as the main mechanism for the formation of low-massgalaxies, with star formation efficiency increasing with galactic mass. thehigh-mass downturn could be a consequence of merging and the observed largerscatter a natural result of different merger properties. these results suggestthat galaxies above the mass threshold of ~ 3.5 x 10^10 m_sun might have formedinitially by mergers of gas-rich disc galaxies and then subsequently evolvedvia dry merger events. the varying efficiency of the dissipative merger-inducedstarburst and feedback processes have shaped the radial metallicity gradientsin these high-mass systems.

0903.0504	the evolution of spiral, s0 and elliptical galaxies in clusters	we quantify the evolution of the spiral, s0 and elliptical fractions ingalaxy clusters as a function of cluster velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) andx-ray luminosity ($l_x$) using a new database of 72 nearby clusters from thewide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey (wings) combined with literature dataat $z=0.5-1.2$. most wings clusters have $\sigma$ between 500 and 1100 $\rm kms^{-1}$, and $l_x$ between 0.2 and $5 \times 10^{44} \rm erg/s$. the s0fraction in clusters is known to increase with time at the expense of thespiral population. we find that the spiral and s0 fractions have evolved morestrongly in lower $\sigma$, less massive clusters, while we confirm that theproportion of ellipticals has remained unchanged. our results demonstrate thatmorphological evolution since $z=1$ is not confined to massive clusters, but isactually more pronounced in low mass clusters, and therefore must originateeither from secular (intrinsic) evolution and/or from environmental mechanismsthat act preferentially in low-mass environments, or both in low- and high-masssystems. we also find that the evolution of the spiral fraction perfectlymirrors the evolution of the fraction of star-forming galaxies. interestingly,at low-z the spiral fraction anticorrelates with $l_x$. conversely, nocorrelation is observed with $\sigma$. given that both $\sigma$ and $l_x$ aretracers of the cluster mass, these results pose a challenge for currentscenarios of morphological evolution in clusters.

0909.2645	a high fidelity sample of cold front clusters from the chandra archive	this paper presents a sample of "cold front" clusters selected from thechandra archive. the clusters are selected based purely on the existence ofsurface brightness edges in their chandra images which are modeled as densityjumps. a combination of the derived density and temperature jumps across thefronts is used to select nine robust examples of cold front clusters:1es0657-558, abell 1201, abell 1758n, ms1455.0+2232, abell 2069, abell 2142,abell 2163, rxj1720.1+2638, and abell 3667. this sample is the subject of anongoing study aimed at relating cold fronts to cluster merger activity, andunderstanding how the merging environment affects the cluster constituents.here, temperature maps are presented along with the chandra x-ray images. adichotomy is found in the sample in that there exists a subsample of cold frontclusters which are clearly mergers based on their x-ray morphologies, and asecond subsample which harbor cold fronts, but have surprisingly relaxed x-raymorphologies, and minimal evidence for merger activity at other wavelengths.for this second subsample, the existence of a cold front provides the soleevidence for merger activity at x-ray wavelengths. we discuss how cold frontscan provide additional information which may be used to constrain mergerhistories, and also the possibility of using cold fronts to distinguish majorand minor mergers.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

1006.1698	early-type galaxies at large galactocentric radii - ii. metallicity  gradients, and the [z/h]--mass, [alpha/fe]--mass relations	we present the results of a study of stellar population properties at largegalactocentric radii of 14 low-mass early-type galaxies in the fornax and virgoclusters. we derive radial profiles of age, total metallicity [z/h], and[alpha/fe] abundance ratios out to 1 - 3 effective radii by using nearly all ofthe lick/ids absorption-line indices in comparison to recent single stellarpopulation models. we extend our study to higher galaxy mass via a novelliterature compilation of 37 early-type galaxies, which provides stellarpopulation properties out to one effective radius. we find that metallicitygradients correlate with galactic mass, and the relationship shows a sharpchange in slope at a dynamical mass of 3.5 10^10 m_{sun}. the central and meanvalues of the stellar population parameters (measured in r &lt; r_e/8, and at r =r_e, respectively) define positive mass trends. we suggest that the lowmetallicities, almost solar [alpha/fe] ratios and the tight mass-metallicitygradient relation displayed by the low-mass galaxies are indicative of an earlystar-forming collapse with extended (i.e., &gt; 1 gyr), low efficiency starformation, and mass-dependent galactic outflows of metal-enriched gas. theflattening of metallicity gradients in high-mass galaxies, and the broadscatter of the relationship are attributed to merger events. the highmetallicities and supersolar abundances shown by these galaxies imply a rapid,high efficiency star formation. the observed [z/h]--mass and [alpha/fe]--massrelationships can be interpreted as a natural outcome of an early star-formingcollapse. however, we find that hierarchical galaxy formation modelsimplementing mass-dependent star formation efficiency, varying imf, energyfeedback via agn, and the effects due to merger-induced starbursts can alsoreproduce both our observed relationships.

1007.0599	early-type galaxies at large galactocentric radii - i. stellar  kinematics and photometric properties	we present the results of a combined analysis of the kinematic andphotometric properties at large galactocentric radii of a sample of 14low-luminosity early-type galaxies in the fornax and virgo clusters. fromgemini south gmos long-slit spectroscopic data we measure radial profiles ofthe kinematic parameters v_{rot}, sigma, h_{3}, and h_{4} out to ~ 1 - 3effective radii. multi-band imaging data from the hst/acs are employed toevaluate surface brightness profiles and isophotal shape parameters ofellipticity, position angle and discyness/boxiness. the galaxies are found tohost a cold and old stellar component which extend to the largest observedradii and that is the dominant source of their dynamical support. theprevalence of discy-shaped isophotes and the radial variation of theirellipticity are signatures of a gradual gas dissipation. an early star-formingcollapse appears to be the main mechanism acting in the formation of theseobjects. major mergers are unlikely to have occurred in these galaxies. we cannot rule out a minor merging origin for these galaxies, but a comparison of ourresults with model predictions of different merger categories places someconstraints on the possible merger progenitors. these merger events arerequired to happen at high-redshift (i.e., z &gt; 1), between progenitors ofdifferent mass ratio (at least 3:1) and containing a significant amount of gas(i.e., &gt; 10 percent). a further scenario is that the low-luminosity galaxieswere originally late-type galaxies, whose star formation has been truncated byremoval of gas and subsequently the disc has been dynamically heated by highspeed encounters in the cluster environment.

1007.2263	spatially resolved spectroscopy of starburst and post-starburst galaxies  in the rich z~0.55 cluster cl0016+16	we have used the low resolution imaging spectrograph (lris) on the w.m. kecki telescope to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy of a small sample of sixpost-starburst and three dusty-starburst galaxies in the rich cluster cl0016+16at z=0.55. we use this to measure radial profiles of the hdelta and oii3727lines which are diagnostic probes of the mechanisms that give rise to theabrupt changes in star-formation rates in these galaxies. in the post-starburstsample we are unable to detect any radial gradients in the hdelta lineequivalent width - although one galaxy exhibits a gradient from one side of thegalaxy to the other. the absence of hdelta gradients in these galaxies isconsistent with their production via interaction with the intra-cluster medium,however, our limited spatial sampling prevents us from drawing robustconclusions. all members of the sample have early type morphologies, typical ofpost-starburst galaxies in general, but lack the high incidence of tidal tailsand disturbances seen in local field samples. this argues against a mergerorigin and adds weight to a scenario where truncation by the intra-clustermedium is at work. the post-starburst spectral signature is consistent over theradial extent probed with no evidence of oii3727 emission and strong hdeltaabsorption at all radii i.e. the post-starburst classification is not anaperture effect. in contrast the dusty-starburst sample shows a tendency for acentral concentration of oii3727 emission. this is most straightforwardlyinterpreted as the consequence of a central starburst. however, otherpossibilities exist such as a non-uniform dust distribution (which is expectedin such galaxies) and/or a non-uniform starburst age distribution. the sampleexhibit late type and irregular morphologies.

1007.2532	origin of optically passive spiral galaxies with dusty star-forming  regions: outside-in truncation of star formation?	recent observations have revealed that red, optically--passive spiralgalaxies with little or no optical emission lines, harbour significant amountsof dust-obscured star formation. we propose that these observational resultscan be explained if the spatial distributions of the cold gas and star-formingregions in these spiral galaxies are significantly more compact than those inblue star-forming spirals. our numerical simulations show that if the sizes ofstar-forming regions in spiral galaxies with disk sizes of r_d are ~ 0.3r_d,such galaxies appear to have lower star formation rates as well as higherdegrees of dust extinction. this is mainly because star formation in thesespirals occurs only in the inner regions where both the gas densities andmetallicities are higher, and hence the dust extinction is also significantlyhigher. we discuss whether star formation occurring preferentially in the innerregions of spirals is closely associated with the stripping of halo and diskgas via some sort of environmental effect. we suggest that the "outside-intruncation of star formation" is the key to a better understanding ofapparently optically--passive spirals with dusty star-forming regions.

1012.1315	the dissection of abell 2744: a rich cluster growing through major and  minor mergers	new chandra x-ray data and extensive optical spectroscopy, obtained withaaomega on the 3.9 m anglo-australian telescope, are used to study the complexmerger taking place in the galaxy cluster abell 2744. combining our spectrawith data from the literature provides a catalog of 1237 redshifts forextragalactic objects lying within 15' of the cluster center. from these, weconfirm 343 cluster members projected within 3 mpc of the cluster center.combining positions and velocities, we identify two major substructures,corresponding to the remnants of two major subclusters. the new data areconsistent with a post core passage, major merger taking place along an axisthat is tilted well out of the plane of the sky, together with an interlopingminor merger. supporting this interpretation, the new x-ray data revealenriched, low entropy gas from the core of the approaching, major subcluster,lying ~2' north of the cluster center, and a shock front to the southeast ofthe previously known bright, compact core associated with the recedingsubcluster. the x-ray morphology of the compact core is consistent with abullet-like cluster viewed from within ~45 degrees of the merger axis. an x-raypeak ~3' northwest of the cluster center, with an associated cold front to thenortheast and a trail of low entropy gas to the south, is interpreted as theremnant of an interloping minor merger taking place roughly in the plane of thesky. we infer approximate paths for the three merging components.

1104.1239	spatial kinematics of brightest cluster galaxies and their close  companions from integral field unit spectroscopy	we present integral field unit (ifu) spectroscopy of four brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) at z~0.1. three of the bcgs have close companions within aprojected radius of 20 kpc and one has no companion within that radius. wecalculate the dynamical masses of the bcgs and their companions to be1.4x10^11&lt;m_dyn (m_solar)&lt;1.5x10^12. we estimate the probability that thecompanions of the bcgs are bound using the observed masses and velocityoffsets. we show that the lowest mass companion (1:4) is not bound while thetwo nearly equal mass (1:1.45 and 1:1.25) companions are likely to merge withtheir host bcgs in 0.35 gyr in major, dry mergers. we conclude that some bcgscontinue to grow from major merging even at z~0. we analyse the stellarkinematics of these systems using the \lambda_r parameter developed by thesauron team. this offers a new and unique means to measure the stellar angularmomentum of bcgs and make a direct comparison to other early-type galaxies. thebcgs and their companions have similar ellipticities to those of otherearly-type galaxies but are more massive. we find that not all these massivegalaxies have low \lambda_r_e as one might expect. one of the four bcgs and thetwo massive companions are found to be fast-rotating galaxies with high angularmomentum, thereby providing a new test for models of galaxy evolution and theformation of intra-cluster light.

1105.0531	transformation from spirals into s0s with bulge growth in groups of  galaxies	recent observations have revealed that the time evolution of the s0 numberfraction at intermediate and high redshifts (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8) is more dramatic ingroups of galaxies than in clusters. in order to understand the origin of s0sin groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation ofspirals into s0s through group-related physical processes. our chemodynamicalsimulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influencedby repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those withthin disks and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into s0s withthick disks and without prominent spiral arm structure. such tidal interactionscan also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals andconsequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. owing to rapidconsumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the s0s canbecome gas-poor. the s0s transformed from spirals in this way have young andmetal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. thesimulated s0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radialline-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitorspirals. the formation processes of s0s due to tidal interactions depend notonly on the masses and orbits of the progenitor spirals, but also on groupmass. a significant fraction (10-30%) of stars and gas can be stripped duringthis spiral to s0 morphological transformation so that intragroup stars and gascan be formed. based on these results, we discuss structures, kinematics,chemical properties, and the tully-fisher relation of s0s in groups.

1109.5692	minor merger-induced cold fronts in abell 2142 and rxj1720.1+2638	we present evidence for the existence of substructure in the "relaxedappearing" cold front clusters abell 2142 and rxj1720.1+2638. the detection ofthese substructures was made possible by comprehensive multi-object opticalspectroscopy obtained with the hectospec and deep imaging multi-objectspectrograph instruments on the 6.5m mmt and 10m keck ii telescope,respectively. these observations produced 956 and 400 spectroscopicallyconfirmed cluster members within a projected radius of 3mpc from the centers ofabell 2142 and rxj1720.1+2638, respectively. the substructure manifests itselfas local peaks in the spatial distribution of member galaxies and also asregions of localized velocity substructure. for both abell 2142 andrxj1720.1+2638, we identify group-scale substructures which, when consideringthe morphology of the cold fronts and the time since pericentric passage of aperturber estimated from the cold front radii, could plausibly have perturbedthe cluster cores and generated the cold fronts observed in chandra images. theresults presented here are consistent with cold fronts being the result ofmerger activity and with cold fronts in relaxed appearing clusters being due tominor merger activity.

1303.4307	the cold gas content of post-starburst galaxies	post-starburst galaxies, or e+a galaxies, are characterized by opticalspectra showing strong balmer absorption lines, indicating a young stellarpopulation, and little or no emission lines, implying no active star formation.these galaxies are interpreted as a transitional population betweenstar-forming, disk-dominated galaxies and spheroidal quiescent, non-starforming galaxies. here, we present single dish hi 21-cm emission linemeasurements of a sample of eleven of these galaxies at redshifts z&lt;0.05. wedetect h i emission in six of the e+a galaxies. in combination with earlierstudies, the total number of e+a galaxies with measured cold gas components isnow eleven. roughly half of the e+as studied so far have detectable hi. the gasfractions of these galaxies, measured with respect to their stellar mass, arebetween 1 and 10 percent and are at the high end of the gas fractions measuredin gas-bearing early type galaxies and typically lower than seen in late-typegalaxies with comparable stellar masses. this finding is consistent with theidea that e+as are currently evolving from the blue cloud to the red sequence.however, the question of why the star formation has ceased in these galaxieswhile a significant gas reservoir is still present can only be answered byhigher spatial resolution observations of the cold gas.

1503.01465	the accretion histories of brightest cluster galaxies from their stellar  population gradients	we analyse the spatially-resolved stellar populations of 9 local ($z&lt;0.1$)brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) observed with vimos in ifu mode. our sampleis composed of 7 slow-rotating and 2 fast-rotating bcgs. we do not find aconnection between stellar kinematics and stellar populations in this smallsample. the bcgs have shallow metallicity gradients (median $\delta$[fe/h] $=-0.11\pm0.1$), high central metallicities (median $[$fe/h]$_{[\alpha/fe]=0} =0.13\pm0.07$), and a wide range of central ages (from 5 to 15 gyr). we proposethat the reason for this is diverse evolutionary paths in bcgs. 67 per cent ofthe sample (6/9) show $\sim 7$ gyr old central ages, which reflects an activeaccretion history, and 33 per cent of the sample (3/9) have central ages olderthan 11 gyr, which suggest no star formation since $z=2$. the bcgs show similarcentral stellar populations and stellar population gradients to early-typegalaxies of similar mass (m$_{dyn}&gt; 10^{11.3}$m$_{\odot}$) from theatlas$^{3d}$ survey (median [z/h] $= 0.04\pm0.07$, $\delta$[z/h] $=-0.19\pm0.1$). however, massive early-type galaxies from atlas$^{3d}$ haveconsistently old ages (median age $=12.0\pm3.8$gyr). we also analyse the closemassive companion galaxies of two of the bcgs. these galaxies have similarstellar populations to their respective bcgs.

astro-ph;0012366	formation and evolution of e+a galaxies in dusty starburst galaxies	the formation and evolution of the ``e+a'' (also named ``k+a'' and ``a+k''types by dressler et al. 1999) galaxies found in significant numbers in thecores of intermediate redshift clusters has been extensively discussed by manyauthors. in this paper, we model the spectral, dynamical and morphologicalevolution of a prime candidate for producing this spectral signature: a dustystarburst associated with a major galaxy merger. we show that as this systemevolves dynamically, its spectral type changes from and ``e(a)'' type(exhibiting strong h$\delta$ absorption and modest [oii] emission -- theidentifying features of local dusty starburst galaxies) to a k+a type and thenfinally to a passive ``k'' type. this result shows that galaxies with an e(a)spectral type can be precursors to the k+a systems and that dynamical evolutiongreatly controls the spectral evolution in these merger cases. our simulationsalso show that a merger with very high infrared luminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$ $&gt;$$10^{11}$ $l_{\odot}$) is more likely to show an e(a) spectrum, which impliesthat spectral types can be correlated with infrared fluxes in dusty starburstgalaxies. based on these results, we discuss the origin of the evolution ofk+a/a+k galaxies in distant clusters and the role merging is likely to have.

astro-ph;0106401	tidal truncation of gas replenishment and global suppression of galactic  star formation in distant clusters	recent spectroscopic observations of galaxies in distant clusters haverevealed that the rate of star formation in star-forming galaxies issignificantly suppressed with respect to their counterparts in the field at asimilar redshift. it is, however, highly uncertain which physical processes areresponsible for this suppression. we present the results of a numericalinvestigation of how the global tidal field of a cluster dynamically influencesthe reservoir of halo gas surrounding a disk galaxy as it falls into thecluster from the surrounding field. we find that the tidal field of the clusterefficiently removes the halo gas from the galaxy, thereby halting its accretiononto the disk, and thus the fueling of star formation within. this effectivelytruncates the galaxy's star formation. we also find that this tidal truncationdoes not depend very strongly on the orbit of the disk with respect to thecenter of the cluster.  these results suggest that the global tidal field of clusters is capable ofcausing a widespread and uniform suppression of star formation in galaxiesaccreted by the cluster. in light of these results, we discuss the importanceof this tidal truncation of the gas supply in the formation of s0 galaxies inclusters.

astro-ph;0106402	galaxy threshing and the formation of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	recent spectroscopic and morphological observational studies of galaxiesaround ngc 1399 in the fornax cluster (drinkwater et al. 2000b) have discoveredseveral `ultra-compact dwarf' galaxies with intrinsic sizes of $\sim$ 100 pcand absolute $b$ band magnitudes ranging from -13 to -11 mag. in order toelucidate the origin of these enigmatic objects, we perform numericalsimulations on the dynamical evolution of nucleated dwarf galaxies orbiting ngc1399 and suffering from its strong tidal gravitational field. adopting aplausible scaling relation for dwarf galaxies, we find that the outer stellarcomponents of a nucleated dwarf are totally removed. this is due to them beingtidally stripped over the course of several passages past the central region ofngc 1399. the nucleus, however, manages to survive. we also find that the sizeand luminosity of the remnant are similar to those observed for ultra-compactdwarf galaxies, if the simulated precursor nucleated dwarf has a mass of $\sim$$10^8$ $m_{\odot}$. these results suggest that ultra-compact dwarf galaxiescould have previously been more luminous dwarf spheroidal or ellipticalgalaxies with rather compact nuclei.

astro-ph;0106403	spectroscopic evolution of dusty starburst galaxies	by using a one-zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model of a diskgalaxy undergoing a dusty starburst, we investigate, numerically, the opticalspectroscopic properties in order to explore galaxy evolution in distantclusters. we adopt an assumption that the degree of dust extinction(represented by $a_v$) depends on the ages of starburst populations in such away that younger stars have larger $a_v$ (originally referred to as selectivedust extinction by poggianti &amp; wu 2000). in particular, we investigate how thetime evolution of the equivalent widths of [oii]$\lambda$3727 and h$\delta$ iscontrolled by the adopted age dependence. this leads to three main results: (1)if a young stellar population (with the age of $\sim$ $10^6$ yr) is moreheavily obscured by dust than an old one ($&gt;$ $10^8$ yr), the galaxy can showan ``e(a)'' spectrum characterized by strong h$\delta$ absorption andrelatively modest [oii] emission. (2) a dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a)spectrum can evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k (or k+a) spectrum0.2 gyr after the starburst and then into a passive one with a k-type spectrum1 gyr after the starburst. this result clearly demonstrates an evolutionarylink between galaxies with different spectral classes (i.e., e(b), e(a), a+k,k+a, and k). (3) a dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum evenin the dusty starburst phase if the age-dependence of dust extinction is ratherweak, i.e., if young starburst populations with different ages ($\le$ $10^7$yr) are uniformly obscured by dust.

astro-ph;0107117	a new formation model for m32: a threshed early-type spiral?	the origin of the closest compact elliptical galaxy (ce) m32 is alongstanding problem of galaxy formation in the local group. our n-body/sphsimulations suggest a new scenario in which the strong tidal field of m31 cantransform a spiral galaxy into a compact elliptical. as a low luminosity spiralgalaxy plunges into the central region of m31, most of the outer stellar andgaseous components of its disk are dramatically stripped due to m31's tidalfield the central bulge component, on the other hand, is just weakly influencedby the tidal field owing to its compact configuration, and retains itsmorphology. m31's strong tidal field also induces rapid gas transfer to thecentral region, triggers a nuclear starburst, and consequently forms thecentral high density and more metal-rich stellar populations with relativelyyoung ages. thus, in this scenario, m32 was previously the bulge of a spiraltidally interacting with m31 several gyr ago. furthermore, we suggest ces likem32 are rare, the result of both the rather narrow parameter space for tidalinteractions which morphologically transform spirals into ces and the veryshort time scale ($&lt;$ a few $10^9$ yr) for ces to be swallowed.

astro-ph;0202291	spectrophotometric evolution of spiral galaxies with truncated star  formation: an evolutionary link between spirals and s0s in distant clusters	a one-zone chemo-spectro-photometric model is used to investigate the timeevolution of disk galaxies whose star formation is truncated, and to determinethe dependence of this evolution on the previous star formation history and thetruncation epoch. truncated spirals show red colors $\sim 1$ gyr aftertruncation, and evolve spectrally from an e(b) type, down through the e(a),a+k, and k+a classes, to finally become a k type. the exact behavior in thisphase depends on the truncation epoch and the star formation history prior totruncation. for example, earlier type disks show redder colors and do not showa+k-type spectra after truncation of star formation. we also discuss a possibleevolutionary link between the k-type galaxies with spiral morphology found indistant clusters, and present-day s0s, by investigating whether truncatedspirals reproduce the infrared color-magnitude relation of coma galaxies. wesuggest that only less luminous, later-type disk galaxies whose star formationis truncated at intermediate and high redshifts can reproduce the red $i-k$colors observed for s0s in the coma cluster.

astro-ph;0206207	passive spiral formation from halo gas starvation: gradual  transformation into s0s	recent spectroscopic and high resolution $hst$-imaging observations haverevealed significant numbers of ``passive'' spiral galaxies in distantclusters, with all the morphological hallmarks of a spiral galaxy (inparticular, spiral arm structure), but with weak or absent star formation.exactly how such spiral galaxies formed and whether they are the progenitors ofpresent-day s0 galaxies is unclear. based on analytic arguments and numericalsimulations of the hydrodynamical evolution of a spiral galaxy's halo gas(which is a likely candidate for the source of gas replenishment for starformation in spirals), we show that the origin of passive spirals may well beassociated with halo gas stripping. such stripping results mainly from thehydrodynamical interaction between the halo gas and the hot intracluster gas.our numerical simulations demonstrate that even if a spiral orbits a clusterwith a pericenter distance $\sim$ 3 times larger than the cluster core radius,$\sim$ 80 % of the halo gas is stripped within a few gyr and, accordingly,cannot be accreted by the spiral. furthermore, our study demonstrates that thisdramatic decline in the gaseous infall rate leads to a steady increase in the$q$ parameter for the disk, with the spiral arm structure, although persisting,becoming less pronounced as the star formation rate gradually decreases. theseresults suggest that passive spirals formed in this way, gradually evolve intored cluster s0s.

astro-ph;0308264	starbursts from strong compression of galactic molecular clouds due to  the high pressure of the intracluster medium	we demonstrate that the high pressure of the hot intracluster medium (icm)can trigger the collapse of molecular clouds in a spiral galaxy, leading to aburst of star formation in the clouds. our hydrodynamical simulations show thatthe high gaseous (ram pressure and static thermal) pressure of the icm stronglycompresses a self-gravitating gas cloud within a short time scale ($\sim$$10^{7}$ yr), dramatically increasing the central gas density, and consequentlycausing efficient star formation within the cloud. the stars developed in thecloud form a compact, gravitationally bound, star cluster. the star formationefficiency within such a cloud is found to depend on the temperature and thedensity of the icm and the relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to it.based on these results, we discuss the origin of starburst/poststarburstpopulations observed in distant clusters, the enhancement of star formation forgalaxies in merging clusters, and the isolated compact hii regions recentlydiscovered in the virgo cluster.

astro-ph;0406442	cluster cannibalism and scaling relations of galactic stellar nuclei	recently, very massive compact stellar systems have been discovered in theintracluster regions of galaxy clusters and in the nuclear regions of late-typedisk galaxies. it is unclear how these compact stellar systems -- known as``ultra-compact dwarf'' (ucd) galaxies or ``nuclear clusters'' (ncs) -- formand evolve. by adopting a formation scenario where these stellar systems arethe product of multiple merging of star clusters in the central regions ofgalaxies, we investigate, numerically, their physical properties. we find thatphysical correlations between velocity dispersion, luminosity, effectiveradius, and average surface brightness in the stellar merger remnants are quitedifferent from those observed in globular clusters. we also find that theremnants have triaxial shapes with or without figure rotation, and these shapesand their kinematics depend strongly on the initial number and distribution ofthe progenitor clusters. these specific predictions can be compared with thecorresponding results of ongoing and future observations of ucds and ncs,thereby providing a better understanding of the origin of these enigmaticobjects.

astro-ph;9503063	hst observations of giant arcs: high resolution imaging of distant field  galaxies.	we present hst imaging of eight spectroscopically-confirmed giant arcs, pairsand arclets. these objects have all been extensively studied from the groundand we demonstrate the unique advantages of hst imaging in the study of suchfeatures by a critical comparison of our data with the previous observations.in particular we present new estimates of the core radii of two clusters(cl0024+16, a370) determined from lensed features which are identifiable in ourhst images. although our hst observations include both pre- andpost-refurbishment images, the depth of the exposures guarantees that themajority of the arcs are detected with diffraction-limited resolution. a numberof the objects in our sample are multiply-imaged and we illustrate the ease ofidentification of such features when working at high resolution. we discuss themorphological and scale information on these distant field galaxies in thelight of hst studies of lower redshift samples. we conclude that the dominantpopulation of star-forming galaxies at z=1 is a factor of 1.5-2 times smallerthan the similar group in the local field. this implies either a considerableevolution in the sizes of star-forming galaxies within the last $\sim$10 gyrsor a shift in the relative space densities of massive and dwarf star-formingsystems over the same timescale.

astro-ph;9605048	the inferred redshift distribution of the faint blue excess	we infer the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxy excess (fbe) atb=23.5 by subtracting the predicted distribution of giant/normal galaxies fromthe observed n(z) distribution for all types. this is possible because of therecent deep {\it hubble space telescope} (hst) wfpc2 morphological numbercounts which have convincingly demonstrated that little evolution of the giantpopulation is seen to b=26.0. the mean redshift of the fbe at b=23.5 is foundto be &lt;z&gt;_{fbe}=0.40 +/- 0.07 with upper and lower quartiles defined byz_{0.75}=0.58 +/- 0.05 and z_{0.25}=0.28 +/- 0.05, respectively.  we compare this inferred fbe n(z) distribution to the predictions from threegeneric faint galaxy models: dwarf dominated (no evolution), pure luminosityevolution, and evolving dwarfs. the inferred fbe n(z) distribution stronglysupports a hybrid evolving dwarf--rich model wherein a large population ofdwarfs present at z=0.5 has subsequently faded to obscurity. the totalintegrated number density of dwarfs (down to m_{b}=-11) is estimated to be afactor of 20 times greater than that of e---sc galaxies and the estimatedfading to be 1.0 &lt; \delta m &lt; 1.4 mags. thus, the dwarf population is estimatedto be responsible for ~30% of the luminosity density locally, rising to ~57% atz=0.5.

astro-ph;9607154	the homogeneity of spheroidal populations in distant clusters	the small scatter observed for the u-v colors of spheroidal galaxies innearby clusters of galaxies provides a powerful constraint on the history ofstar formation in dense environments. however, with local data alone, it is notpossible to separate models where galaxies assembled synchronously overredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 from ones where galaxies formed stochastically at much earliertimes. here we attempt to resolve this ambiguity via high precision rest-frameuv-optical photometry of a large sample of morphologically-selected spheroidalgalaxies in three z~0.54 clusters which have been observed with hst. wedemonstrate the robustness of using hst to conduct the morphological separationof spheroidal and disk galaxies at this redshift and use our new data to repeatthe analysis conducted locally at a significant look-back time. we find a smallscatter (&lt; 0.1 mag rms) for galaxies classed as es and e/s0s, both internallywithin each of the three clusters and externally from cluster to cluster. we donot find any trend for the scatter to increase with decreasing luminosity downto l = l*+3, other than can be accounted for by observational error. neither isthere evidence for a distinction between the scatter observed for galaxiesclassified as ellipticals and s0. our result provides a new constraint on thestar formation history of cluster spheroidals prior to z=0.5 confirming andconsiderably strengthening the earlier conclusions. most of the star formationin the elliptical galaxies in dense clusters was completed before z~3 inconventional cosmologies. although we cannot rule out the continued productionof some ellipticals, our results do indicate an era of initial star formationconsistent with the population of star-forming galaxies recently detectedbeyond z~3.

astro-ph;9610199	the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function in moderate redshift  clusters	we present deep two-colour photometry of two rich clusters at z=0.18, a665and a1689. we use these data to construct number counts as a function ofmagnitude in the two fields. by combining these counts with similarobservations from a large area field survey we subtract the field contaminationstatistically to produce luminosity functions for the two clusters. great carehas been taken to achieve agreement between the photometry of these twosamples. the cluster data are complete to a limiting magnitude of i=22.5 or anabsolute magnitude in the cluster of i= -18.0 ($m^\star+5$). the luminosityfunctions of both clusters are well described by a gaussian function for thebright galaxies, combined with a schechter function at the faint end, similarto that required to fit the luminosity function in local clusters. the slope atthe faint end of the schechter function in both clusters is extremely steep inv, alpha ~ -2. a shallower slope is seen to the limit of the i data, indicatingthat the cluster population is rapidly blueing as we reach fainter. theexcellent agreement between the form of the luminosity function in our twodistant clusters, as well as agreement with the luminosity function given bydriver et al (1994) for a single z=0.21 cluster, indicates that this faint bluepopulation is a general constituent of distant clusters. we compare our resultswith those from studies of local clusters. depending upon the degree of fading(or disruption) of these faint blue galaxies,we tentatively identify theirremnants with the low surface brightness dwarf galaxies which are the dominantpopulation in local clusters. we discuss the possible role of this populationas the source of most of the x-ray gas in rich clusters.

astro-ph;9610270	a comparison of direct and indirect mass estimates for distant clusters  of galaxies	we present weak lensing results for 12 distant clusters determined fromimages obtained with the refurbished hst. we detect the signature ofgravitational lensing in 11 of the 12 clusters; the clusters span nearly anorder of magnitude in lensing strength. the sample thus provides an excellentdatabase for correlating direct mass estimates from lensing with indirect oneswhich rely on baryonic tracers. we examine the correlation between the clusterx-ray luminosities and the mean gravitational shear strengths and develop amodel which predicts the relationship expected from the properties of localclusters. after allowing for various observational effects, we find that thepredicted correlation is a reasonable match to the available data, indicatingthat there has been little evolution in the x-ray luminosity-central massrelationship between z=0.4 and now. we discuss the implications of this resultin the context of the evolution of the x-ray luminosity function found byearlier workers. the comparison between shear amplitudes and velocitydispersions, estimated from a modest sample of members, reveals a discrepancyin the sense that these velocity dispersions are typically over-estimated byfactors of ~50%. this supports earlier suggestions that high dispersionsmeasured for distant clusters may be seriously affected by both unidentifiedsubstructure and outliers. combining our lensing masses withmorphologically-based luminosity estimates, we determine mass/light ratios insolar units of m/l_v=180+/-160 h for the entire population and 620+/-250 h forthe spheroidal galaxies where the evolutionary effects can be best treated. weargue that this provides an upper bound to the local cluster m/l correspondingto omega~0.4.

astro-ph;9705099	a dynamical study of optically selected distant clusters	we present a programme of spectroscopic observations of galaxies in a sampleof optically-selected clusters taken from the catalogue of couch et al (1991).previous rosat observations of these clusters have shown them to have lowerx-ray luminosities, given their optical richness, than might be expected on thebasis of local samples. in the present paper we extend this work by determiningvelocity dispersions of a subsample of the clusters. we confirm the dynamicalreality of all but one of the original sample, and find velocity dispersionscomparable with present-day clusters of equivalent comoving space density.thus, in the context of the $l_x-\sigma$ relation for present-day clusters,there is evidence for a higher velocity dispersion at fixed x-ray luminosity.  a key question is whether the high velocity dispersions are indicative of thegravitational potential. if they are, the x-ray luminosities measured in boweret al., 1994 (paper i), would then imply an implausibly low efficiency of x-raygeneration. alternatively, the discrepancy could be explained if the clusterswere systems of lower virial temperature, in which the apparent velocitydispersion is inflated by an infalling, unrelaxed halo. this might resulteither from an increase with redshift in the infall rate for clusters, or fromthe preferential selection of clusters embedded in filaments oriented along theline of sight. since clusters with similar properties can be found in localoptically selected catalogues, we suggest that the latter explanation is morelikely.

astro-ph;9707232	evolution since z = 0.5 of the morphology-density relation for clusters  of galaxies	using traditional morphological classifications of galaxies in 10intermediate-redshift (z~0.5) clusters observed with wfpc-2 on the hubble spacetelescope, we derive relations between morphology and local galaxy densitysimilar to that found by dressler for low-redshift clusters. takencollectively, the `morphology-density' relationship, m-d, for these moredistant, presumably younger clusters is qualitatively similar to that found forthe local sample, but a detailed comparison shows two substantial differences:(1) for the clusters in our sample, the m-d relation is strong in centrallyconcentrated ``regular'' clusters, those with a strong correlation of radiusand surface density, but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentratedand irregular, in contrast to the situation for low redshift clusters where astrong relation has been found for both. (2) in every cluster the fraction ofelliptical galaxies is as large or larger than in low-redshift clusters, butthe s0 fraction is 2-3 times smaller, with a proportional increase of thespiral fraction. straightforward, though probably not unique, interpretationsof these observations are (1) morphological segregation proceedshierarchically, affecting richer, denser groups of galaxies earlier, and (2)the formation of elliptical galaxies predates the formation of rich clusters,and occurs instead in the loose-group phase or even earlier, but s0's aregenerated in large numbers only after cluster virialization.

astro-ph;9809190	luminosity distributions within rich clusters - ii: demonstration and  verification via simulation	we present detailed simulations of long exposure ccd images. the simulationsare used to explore the validity of the statistical method for reconstructingthe luminosity distribution of galaxies within a rich cluster i.e. by thesubtraction of field number-counts from those of a sight-line through thecluster. in particular we use the simulations to establish the reliability ofour observational data presented in paper 3. based on our intended ccdfield-of-view (6.5 by 6.5 arcmins) and a 1-sigma detection limit of 26 mags persq arcsecond, we conclude that the luminosity distribution can be robustlydetermined over a wide range of absolute magnitude (-23 &lt; m_{r} &lt; -16)provided:  (a) the cluster has an abell richness 1.5 or greater,  (b) the cluster's redshift lies in the range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3,  (c) the seeing is better than fwhm 1.25'' and  (d) the photometric zero points are accurate to within delta m = \pm 0.12.  if these conditions are not met then the recovered luminosity distribution isunreliable and potentially grossly miss-leading. finally although the methodclearly has limitations, within these limitations the technique represents anextremely promising probe of galaxy evolution and environmental dependencies.

astro-ph;9809206	luminosity distributions within rich clusters - iii: a comparative study  of seven abell/aco clusters	we recover the luminosity distributions over a wide range of absolutemagnitude (-24.5 &lt; m_{r} &lt; -16.5) for a sample of seven rich southern galaxyclusters. we find a large variation in the ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies,dgr: 0.8\le $ dgr $\le 3.1. this variation is shown to be inconsistent with aubiquitous cluster luminosity function. the dgr shows a smaller variation fromcluster to cluster in the inner regions (r \ls 0.56 mpc). outside these regionswe find the dgr to be strongly anti-correlated with the mean local projectedgalaxy density with the dgr increasing towards lower densities. in addition thedgr in the outer regions shows some correlation with bautz-morgan type. radialanalysis of the clusters indicate that the dwarf galaxies are less centrallyclustered than the giants and form a significant halo around clusters. weconclude that measurements of the total cluster luminosity distribution basedon the inner core alone are likely to be severe underestimates of the dwarfcomponent, the integrated cluster luminosity and the contribution of galaxymasses to the cluster's total mass. further work is required to quantify this.the observational evidence that the unrelaxed, lower density outer regions ofclusters are dwarf-rich, adds credence to the recent evidence and conjecturethat the field is a predominantly dwarf rich environment and that the dwarfgalaxies are under-represented in measures of the local field luminosityfunction.

astro-ph;9907423	constraints on the evolution of s0 galaxies in rich clusters at moderate  redshifts	we combine morphological classifications from deep hst imaging of a sample of3 clusters at z=0.31 and a further 9 clusters at z=0.37-0.56 with existingspectroscopic observations of their e and s0 populations, to study the relativespectral properties of these two galaxy types. we have also used similar datafor the coma cluster as a present day bench-mark with which to compare our dataat higher redshift. the data span the range where strong evolution is claimedin the proportion of s0 galaxies within rich clusters. techniques have beenrecently developed to analyse the strengths of absorption lines in the spectraof local, passive galaxies to separate the effects of age &amp; metallicity andhence date the ages of the most recent, substantial star formation episode inthese galaxies. we have applied these techniques to the co-added spectra of thedistant cluster galaxies to determine the relative ages of the e and s0populations. we find no statistically significant difference between theluminosity-weighted ages of the e and s0 galaxies in these clusters. theprecision of this measurement would indicate that any recent star formation inthe cluster s0s at z=0.31 could have involved bursts of no more than ~11% (bymass) in strength in no more than half of these galaxies. our results, inconjunction with other work, suggest that the progenitors of s0 galaxies inrich clusters are mostly early-type spirals who, through interactions with thecluster environment, have had their star formation truncated. this indicates arelatively unspectacular origin for the missing s0 population at high redshift.

0810.4650	abell 1201: the anatomy of a cold front cluster from combined optical  and x-ray data	we present a combined x-ray and optical analysis of the cold front clusterabell 1201 using archival chandra, data and multi-object spectroscopy takenwith the 3.9m anglo australian and 6.5m multiple mirror telescopes. this paperrepresents the first in a series presenting a study of a sample of cold frontclusters selected from the chandra, archives with the aim of relating coldfronts to merger activity, understanding the dynamics of mergers and theireffect on the cluster constituents. the chandra x-ray imagery of abell 1201reveals two conspicuous surface brightness discontinuities, which are shown tobe cold fronts, and a remnant core structure. temperature maps reveal a complexmulti-phase temperature structure with regions of hot gas interspersed withfingers of cold gas. our optical analysis is based on a sample of 321 confirmedmembers, whose mean redshift is z=0.1673 +/- 0.0002 and velocity dispersion is778 +/- 36 km/s. we search for dynamical substructure and find clear evidencefor multiple localized velocity substructures coincident with over-densities inthe galaxy surface density. most notably, we find structure coincident with theremnant x-ray core. despite the clear evidence for dynamical activity, we findthe peculiar velocity distribution does not deviate significantly fromgaussian. we apply two-body dynamical analyses in order to assess which of thesubstructures are bound, and thus dynamically important in terms of the clustermerger history. we propose that the cold fronts in abell 1201 are a consequenceof its merger with a smaller subunit, which has induced gas motions that gaverise to `sloshing' cold fronts. abell 1201 illustrates the value of combiningmulti-wavelength data and multiple substructure detection techniques whenattempting to ascertain the dynamical state of a cluster.

0811.3031	substructure in the cold front cluster abell 3667	we present evidence for the existence of significant substructure in the coldfront cluster abell 3667 based on multi-object spectroscopy taken with the 3.9manglo australian telescope. this paper is the second in a series analyzing therelationship between cold fronts observed in chandra x-ray images and mergeractivity observed at optical wavelengths. we have obtained 910 galaxy redshiftsin the field of abell 3667 out to 3.5 mpc, of which 550 are confirmed clustermembers, more than doubling the number of spectroscopically confirmed memberspreviously available and probing some 3 mag down the luminosity function. fromthis sample, we derive a cluster redshift of z=0.0553 +/-0.0002 and velocitydispersion of 1056 +/- 38 km/s and use a number of statistical tests to searchfor substructure. we find significant evidence for substructure in the spatialdistribution of member galaxies and also in the localized velocitydistributions and, in spite of this evidence, find the global velocitydistribution does not deviate significantly from a gaussian. using combinedspatial and velocity information, we find the cluster can be separated into twomajor structures, with roughly equal velocity dispersions, but offset inpeculiar velocity from each other by ~500 km/s, and a number of minorsubstructures. we propose two scenarios which explain the radio and x-rayobservations. our data show the cold front is directly related to clustermerger activity, and also highlights the extent of optical data required tounambiguously detect the presence of substructure.
