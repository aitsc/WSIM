0901.3597	a statistical study of gamma-ray burst afterglows measured by the swift  ultra-violet optical telescope	we present the first statistical analysis of 27 uvot optical/ultra-violetlightcurves of grb afterglows. we have found, through analysis of thelightcurves in the observer's frame, that a significant fraction rise in thefirst 500s after the grb trigger, that all lightcurves decay after 500s,typically as a power-law with a relatively narrow distribution of decayindices, and that the brightest optical afterglows tend to decay the quickest.we find that the rise could either be produced physically by the start of theforward shock, when the jet begins to plough into the external medium, orgeometrically where an off-axis observer sees a rising lightcurve as anincreasing amount of emission enters the observers line of sight, which occursas the jet slows. we find that at 99.8% confidence, there is a correlation, inthe observed frame, between the apparent magnitude of the lightcurves at 400sand the rate of decay after 500s. however, in the rest frame a spearman ranktest shows only a weak correlation of low statistical significance betweenluminosity and decay rate. a correlation should be expected if the afterglowswere produced by off-axis jets, suggesting that the jet is viewed from withinthe half-opening angle theta or within a core of uniform energy densitytheta_c. we also produced logarithmic luminosity distributions for three restframe epochs. we find no evidence for bimodality in any of the distributions.finally, we compare our sample of uvot lightcurves with the xrt lightcurvecanonical model. the range in decay indices seen in uvot lightcurves at anyepoch is most similar to the range in decay of the shallow decay segment of thexrt canonical model. however, in the xrt canonical model there is no indicationof the rising behaviour observed in the uvot lightcurves.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

0910.2590	dust and metal column densities in gamma-ray burst host galaxies	in this paper we present the results from the analysis of a sample of 28gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectral energy distributions, spanning thex-ray through to near-infrared wavelengths. this is the largest sample of grbafterglow spectral energy distributions thus far studied, providing a stronghandle on the optical depth distribution of soft x-ray absorption anddust-extinction systems in grb host galaxies. we detect an absorption systemwithin the grb host galaxy in 79% of the sample, and an extinction system in71% of the sample, and find the small magellanic cloud (smc) extinction law toprovide an acceptable fit to the host galaxy extinction profile for themajority of cases, consistent with previous findings. the range in the softx-ray absorption to dust-extinction ratio, n_{h,x}/av, in grb host galaxiesspans almost two orders of magnitude, and the typical ratios are significantlylarger than those of the magellanic clouds or milky way. although dustdestruction could be a cause, at least in part, for the large n_{h,x}/avratios, the good fit provided by the smc extinction law for the majority of oursample suggests that there is an abundance of small dust grains in the grbenvironment, which we would expect to have been destroyed if dust destructionwere responsible for the large n_{h,x}/av ratios. instead, our analysissuggests that the distribution of n_{h,x}/av in grb host galaxies may be mostlyintrinsic to these galaxies, and this is further substantiated by evidence fora strong negative correlation between n_{h,x}/av and metallicity for asubsample of grb hosts with known metallicity. furthermore, we find then_{h,x}/av ratio and metallicity for this subsample of grbs to be comparable tothe relation found in other more metal-rich galaxies.

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1002.0581	grb 081008: from burst to afterglow and the transition phase in between	we present a multi-wavelength study of grb 081008, at redshift 1.967, byswift, rotse-iii and grond. compared to other swift grbs, grb 081008 has atypical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during theprompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. theearly x-ray emission seen by the swift/xrt was dominated by the softening tailof the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after theswift/bat detections. optical observations that started shortly after the firstactive phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. we interpretthe first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the earlyburst activities. a second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-raypulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve andthus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. wesuggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injectioninto the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch ofburst activities. these early observations thus provide a potential probe forthe transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. the later lightcurve of grb081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and x-ray. thetemporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral breakwithin optical. however, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.we discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

1004.2857	suzaku observations of luminous quasars: revealing the nature of  high-energy blazar emission in quiescent states	we present the results from the suzaku x-ray observations of fiveflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), namely pks0208-512, q0827+243,pks1127-145, pks1510-089 and 3c 454.3. all these sources were additionallymonitored simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously by the fermi satellite ingamma-rays and the swift uvot in the uv and optical bands, respectively. weconstructed their broad-band spectra covering the frequency range from 10^14 hzup to 10^25 hz, and those reveal the nature of high-energy emission of luminousblazars in their low-activity states. the analyzed x-ray spectra are wellfitted by a power-law model with photoelectric absorption. in the case ofpks0208-512, pks1127-145, and 3c 454.3, the x-ray continuum showed indicationof hard-ening at low-energies. moreover, when compared with the previous x-rayobservations, we see a significantly increasing contribution of low-energyphotons to the total x-ray fluxes when the sources are getting fainter. thesame behavior can be noted in the suzaku data alone. a likely explanationinvolves a variable, flat-spectrum component produced via inverse-compton (ic)emission, plus an additional, possibly steady soft x-ray component prominentwhen the source gets fainter. this soft x-ray excess is represented either by asteep powerlaw (photon indices gamma ~ 3 - 5) or a blackbody-type emission withtemperatures kt ~ 0.1-0.2 kev. we model the broad-band spectra spectra of thefive observed fsrqs using synchrotron self-compton (ssc) and/orexternal-compton radiation (ecr) models. our modeling suggests that thedifference between the low and high-activity states in luminous blazars is dueto the different total kinetic power of the jet, most likely related to varyingbulk lorentz factor of the outflow within the blazar emission zone.

1004.3261	a very metal poor damped lyman-alpha system revealed through the most  energetic grb 090926a	we present vlt/fors2 spectroscopy and grond optical/near-ir photometry of theafterglow of the bright fermi/lat grb 090926a. the spectrum shows prominentlyman-alpha absorption with n_hi = 10^(21.73 +/- 0.07) cm^-2 and a multitude ofmetal lines at a common redshift of z=2.1062 +/- 0.0004, which we associatewith the redshift of the grb. the metallicity derived from sii is log(z/z_sun)~ -1.9, one of the lowest values ever found in a grb damped lyman-alpha (dla)system. this confirms that the spread of metallicity in grb-dlas at z~2 is atleast two orders of magnitude. we argue that this spread in metallicity doesnot require a similar range in abundances of the grb progenitors, since theneutral interstellar medium probed by the dla is expected to be at asignificant distance from the explosion site. the hydrogen column densityderived from swift/xrt afterglow spectrum (assuming log(z/z_sun) ~ -1.9) isapprox. 100 times higher than the n_hi obtained from the lyman-alphaabsorptions. this suggests either a large column density of ionized gas or ahigher metallicity of the circum-burst medium compared to the gas traced by thedla. we also discuss the afterglow light curve evolution and energetics. theabsence of a clear jet-break like steeping until at least 21 days post-burstsuggests a beaming corrected energy release of e_gamma&gt;3.5x10^52erg, indicatingthat grb090926a may have been one of the most energetic bursts ever detected.

1007.0383	the swift/fermi grb 080928 from 1 ev to 150 kev	we present the results of a comprehensive study of the gamma-ray burst 080928and of its afterglow. grb 080928 was a long burst detected by swift/bat andfermi/gbm. it is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission hadalready been detected when the grb itself was still radiating in the gamma-rayband. for nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, x-ray and gamma-ray dataprovide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient sourcefrom about 1 ev to 150 kev. in particular, we show that the sed during the mainprompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. we constructed theoptical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based onswift/uvot, rotse-iiia (australia), and grond (la silla) data and compared itto the x-ray light curve retrieved from the swift/xrt repository. we show thatits bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forwardshock.furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolutionof the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early x-ray lightcurve can be explained by large-angle emission (lae). we find that anonstandard lae model is required to explain the observations. finally, wereport on the results of our search for the grb host galaxy, for which only adeep upper limit can be provided.

1010.2034	the missing gas problem in grb host galaxies: evidence for a highly  ionised component	there is considerable discrepancy between the amount of x-ray absorption andthat inferred from optical (rest frame uv) as measured along gamma-ray burst(grb) sight lines, with the former being typically an order of magnitude higherthan what would be expected from the measurement of neutral element species viaoptical absorption line spectroscopy. we explore this "missing gas problem" byusing x-ray and optical measurements in a sample of 29 z=0.7-6.3 grbs from bothspectroscopic data and the afterglow broadband spectral energy distributions.the low ionisation species detected in the uv are associated with the neutralinterstellar medium in the grb host galaxy, while soft x-ray absorption, whichis weakly dependent on the ionisation state of the gas, provides a probe of thetotal column of gas along the sight line. after careful consideration of anysystematic effects, we find that the neutral gas consists of less than ~10% ofthe total gas, and this limit decreases with the more ionised that the x-rayabsorbing gas is, which in our spectral fits is assumed to be neutral. only avery small fraction of this ionised gas, however, is detected in uv absorptionlines with ionisation potentials up to ~200ev (i.e. siiv, civ, nv, ovi), whichleaves us to postulate that the x-ray excess is due to ultra-highly-ionised,dense gas in the grb vicinity.

1010.6212	a statistical comparison of the optical/uv and x-ray afterglows of  gamma-ray bursts using the swift ultra-violet optical and x-ray telescopes	we present the systematic analysis of the uvot and xrt light curves for asample of 26 swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs). by comparing the optical/uv andx-ray light curves, we found that they are remarkably different during thefirst 500s after the bat trigger, while they become more similar during themiddle phase of the afterglow, i.e. between 2000s and 20000s. if we takeliterally the average properties of the sample, we find that the mean temporalindices observed in the optical/uv and x-rays after 500s are consistent with aforward-shock scenario, under the assumptions that electrons are in the slowcooling regime, the external medium is of constant density and the synchrotroncooling frequency is situated between the optical/uv and x-ray observing bands.while this scenario describes well the averaged observed properties, someindividual grb afterglows require different or additional assumptions, such asthe presence of late energy injection. we show that a chromatic break (a breakin the x-ray light curve that is not seen in the optical) is present in theafterglows of 3 grbs and demonstrate evidence for chromatic breaks in a further4 grbs. the average properties of these breaks cannot be explained in terms ofthe passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the observed bands,nor a simple change in the external density. it is difficult to reconcilechromatic breaks in terms of a single component outflow and instead, morecomplex jet structure or additional emission components are required.

1011.0618	the nature of "dark" gamma-ray bursts	context: thirteen years after the discovery of the first afterglows, thenature of dark gamma-ray bursts (grb) still eludes explanation: while eachng-duration grb typically has an x-ray afterglow, optical/nir emission is onlyseen for 40-60% of them. aim: here we use the afterglow detection statistics ofthe systematic follow-up observations performed with grond since mid-2007 inorder to derive the fraction of "dark bursts" according to different methods,and to distinguish between various scenarios for "dark bursts". method:observations were performed with the 7-channel "gamma-ray optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpi/eso telescope. we used theafterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between grb and thefirst grond exposure. results: for long-duration swift bursts with a detectedx-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/nirafterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240\,min afterthe burst. complementing our grond data with swift/xrt spectra we constructbroad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. edetect 25-40% "dark bursts", depending on the definition used. the faintoptical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is mainly due to a combination oftwo contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderateredshifts, and (ii) about 22% of "dark" bursts at redshift $&gt;$5.

1011.1205	photometric redshifts for grb afterglows from grond and swift/uvot	we present a framework to obtain photometric redshifts (photo-zs) forgamma-ray burst afterglows. using multi-band photometry from grond andswift/uvot, photo-zs are derived for five grbs for which spectroscopicredshifts are not available. we use uv/optical/nir data and syntheticphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometricredshifts of grbs and their accuracy. taking into account the afterglowsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometryto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. themeasurement of photo-zs for grb afterglows provides a quick, robust andreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly inthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/nir range cannot beobtained. given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, therelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and betterthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. we detail the approach on 5 sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts observed with uvot on-board swift and/or grond. thedistance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for grb 080825b, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for grb080906, $z=3.44^{+0.15}_{-0.32}$ for grb 081228, $z=2.03^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ forgrb 081230 and $z=1.28^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for grb 090530. combining the responsefrom uvot with ground-based observatories and in particular grond operating inthe optical/nir wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z ~1.0 out to z ~ 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorablecases, provided that these grbs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficientlybright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.

1105.1312	grb 090426: discovery of a jet break in a short burst afterglow	context: the link between the duration of grbs and the nature of theirprogenitors remains disputed. short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)are less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, andexhibit significantly fainter afterglows. aims: it is of critical importance toestablish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different grbpopulation models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. the swift grb090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. its duration(t_90=1.28 s) places grb 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while thehigh redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectralcharacteristics are more similar to those of long-duration grbs. methods: onthe basis of data obtained with the tautenburg 2m telescope (germany) and the7-channel imager grond (la silla, chile), we compiled the most finely sampledlight curve available for a short burst optical/nir afterglow. the light curvewas then analysed in a standard fashion. grond and xrt data were used todetermine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow acrossmore than three orders of magnitude. results: our data show that a light curvebreak exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. this light curvedecay is achromatic in the optical/nir bands, and interpreted as a post-jetbreak phase. the x-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.conclusions: the half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as theluminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that grb 090426is probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger oftwo compact objects.

1108.0674	the seds and host galaxies of the dustiest grb afterglows	(abridged) until recently the information inferred from gamma-ray burstfollow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows,biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amountsof dust. here, we present grb afterglow and host observations for a sample ofbursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visualextinction along the sight-line. this facilitates an investigation of theproperties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of thesepoorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts fromoptically-selected samples. the hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse intheir properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than thehosts of optically-bright events. we hence probe a different galaxy population,suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,chemically-evolved and metal-rich members. this also indicates that the dustalong the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probablylocated in the diffuse ism or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate grbenvironment. some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young or of smallstellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxiespossess very dusty sight-lines due to a patchy dust distribution. the presentedobservations establish a population of luminous, massive and correspondinglychemically-evolved grb hosts. this suggests that grbs trace the globalstar-formation rate better than studies based on optically-selected hostsamples indicate, and the previously-claimed deficiency of high-mass hostgalaxies was at least partially a selection effect.

1110.3218	the dust extinction curves of gamma-ray burst host galaxies	the composition and amount of interstellar dust within gamma-ray burst (grb)host galaxies is of key importance when addressing selection effects in the grbredshift distribution, and when studying the properties of their host galaxies.as well as the implications for grb research, probing the dust within thehigh-z hosts of grbs also contributes to our understanding of the conditions ofthe interstellar medium and star-formation in the distant universe.nevertheless, the physical properties of dust within grb host galaxiescontinues to be a highly contended issue. in this paper we explore the meanextinction properties of dust within the host galaxies of a sample of 17 grbswith total host galaxy visual extinction av&lt;1 (&lt;av&gt;=0.4), covering a redshiftrange z=0.7-3.1. we find the average host extinction curve to have anultraviolet slope comparable to that of the lmc, but with little evidence of a2175angs dust extinction feature as observed along milky way and lmcsightlines. we cannot at present rule out the presence of a 2175angs feature,and both the standard smc and lmc extinction curves also provide good fits toour data. however, we can reject an extinction curve that has a uv slope asflat as the mean milky way extinction curve, whilst also having a 2175angsfeature as prominent as seen in the mean milky way extinction curve. this is incontrast to the clear detection of a 2175angs bump and the flatter extinctioncurves of some more heavily extinguished grbs (av&gt;1), which may be indicativeof there being a dependence between dust abundance and the wavelengthdependence of dust extinction, as has been previously speculated.

1201.3885	the late-time afterglow of the extremely energetic short burst grb  090510 revisited	the discovery of the short grb 090510 has raised considerable attentionmainly because it had a bright optical afterglow and it is among the mostenergetic events detected so far within the entire grb population. theafterglow was observed with swift/uvot and swift/xrt and evidence of a jetbreak around 1.5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature,implying that after this break the optical and x-ray light curve should fadewith the same decay slope. as noted by several authors, the post-break decayslope seen in the uvot data is much shallower than the steep decay in the x-rayband, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times. we reduced andanalyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imagergrond. based on the densely sampled data set obtained with grond, we find thatthe optical afterglow of grb 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phasestarting around 22 ks after the burst. during this time the grond optical lightcurve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the x-ray data.in combination with the uvot data this implies that a second break must haveoccurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however,has no obvious counterpart in the x-ray band, contradicting the interpretationthat this could be another jet break. the grond data provide the missing pieceof evidence that the optical afterglow of grb 090510 did follow a post-jetbreak evolution at late times.

1202.1225	the long gamma-ray burst rate and the correlation with host galaxy  properties	to answer questions on the start and duration of the epoch of reionisation,periods of galaxy mergers and properties of other cosmological encounters, thecosmic star formation history (csfh), is of fundamental importance. using theassociation of long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) with the death of massive starsand their ultra-luminous nature, the csfh can be probed to higher redshiftsthan current conventional methods. unfortunately, no consensus has been reachedon the manner in which the lgrb rate (lgrbr) traces the csfh, leaving many ofthe questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. observations by thegrb nir detector (grond) over the past 4 years have, for the first time,acquired highly complete lgrb samples. driven by these completeness levels andnew evidence of lgrbs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxiesthan previously thought, the possible biases of the lgrbr-csfh connection areinvestigated over a large range of galaxy properties. the csfh is modelledusing empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formationrates. biasing the csfh by metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and otherunknown redshift dependencies, a lgrbr is generated and compared to the highlycomplete grond sample. it is found that there is no strong preference for ametallicity cut or fixed galaxy mass boundaries and that there are no unknownredshift effects, in contrast to previous work which suggest values ofz/z_sun~0.1-0.3. from the best-fit models, we predict that ~1.2% of the lgrbburst sample exists above z=6. the linear relationship between the lgrbr andthe csfh suggested by our results implies that redshift biases present inprevious lgrb samples significantly affect the inferred dependencies of lgrbson their host galaxy properties. such biases can lead to, e.g., aninterpretation of metallicity limitations and evolving lgrb luminosityfunctions.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1209.0479	pks 2123-463: a confirmed gamma-ray blazar at high redshift	the flat spectrum radio quasar (fsrq) pks 2123-463 was associated in thefirst fermi-lat source catalog with the gamma-ray source 1fgl j2126.1-4603, butwhen considering the full first two years of fermi observations, no gamma-raysource at a position consistent with this fsrq was detected, and thus pks2123-463 was not reported in the second fermi-lat source catalog. on 2011december 14 a gamma-ray source positionally consistent with pks 2123-463 wasdetected in flaring activity by fermi-lat. this activity triggeredradio-to-x-ray observations by the swift, grond, atca, ceduna, and kat-7observatories. results of the localization of the gamma-ray source over 41months of fermi-lat operation are reported here in conjunction with the resultsof the analysis of radio, optical, uv and x-ray data collected soon after thegamma-ray flare.  the strict spatial association with the lower energy counterpart togetherwith a simultaneous increase of the activity in optical, uv, x-ray andgamma-ray bands led to a firm identification of the gamma-ray source with pks2123-463. a new photometric redshift has been estimated as z = 1.46+/-0.05using grond and swift/uvot observations, in rough agreement with the disputedspectroscopic redshift of z = 1.67. we fit the broadband spectral energydistribution with a synchrotron/external compton model. we find that a thermaldisk component is necessary to explain the optical/uv emission detected byswift/uvot. this disk has a luminosity of about 1.8x10^46 erg/s, and a fit tothe disk emission assuming a schwarzschild (i.e., nonrotating) black hole givesa mass of about 2x10^9 solar masses. this is the first black hole mass estimatefor this source.

1302.6362	clustering of galaxies around grb sight-lines	there is evidence of an overdensity of strong intervening mgii absorptionline systems distributed along the lines of sight towards grb afterglowsrelative to quasar sight-lines. if this excess is real, one should also expectan overdensity of field galaxies around grb sight-lines, as strong mgii tendsto trace these sources. in this work, we test this expectation by calculatingthe two point angular correlation function of galaxies within120$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim470~h_{71}^{-1}~\mathrm{kpc}$ at $\langle z\rangle\sim0.4$) of grb afterglows. we compare the gamma-ray burst optical andnear-infrared detector (grond) grb afterglow sample -- one of the largest andmost homogeneous samples of grb fields -- with galaxies and agn found in thecosmos-30 photometric catalog. we find no significant signal of anomalousclustering of galaxies at an estimated median redshift of $z\sim0.3$ around grbsight-lines, down to $k_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;19.3$. this result is contrary to theexpectations from the mgii excess derived from grb afterglow spectroscopy,although many confirmed galaxy counterparts to mgii absorbers may be too faintto detect in our sample -- especially those at $z&gt;1$. we note that the additionof higher sensitivity spitzer irac or hst wfc3 data for even a subset of oursample would increase this survey's depth by several orders of magnitude,simultaneously increasing statistics and enabling the investigation of a muchlarger redshift space.}

1303.6951	blazar candidates beyond redshift 4 observed with grond	the search for extremely massive high redshift blazars is essential to putstrong constraints on the supermassive black holes formation theories. up tonow, the few blazars known to have a redshift larger than 4 have beendiscovered serendipitously. we try a more systematic approach. assumingradio-loudness as a proxy for the jet orientation, we select a sample ofextremely radio-loud quasars. we measure their black hole masses with a methodbased on fitting the thermal emission from the accretion disc. we achieve aprecision of a factor of two for our measures, thanks to the observationsperformed with the gamma-ray burst optical near-infrared detector (grond). theinfrared to optical grond data allow us to observe directly the peak of thedisc emission, thus constraining the overall disc luminosity. we obtain a smallrange of masses, that peaks at 10^{9.3}msun. if some of our candidates will beconfirmed as blazars, these results would introduce interesting constraints onthe mass function of extremely massive black holes at very high redshift.moreover, all our blazar candidates have high accretion rates. this result,along with the high masses, opens an interesting view on the need of a fastgrowth of the heaviest black holes at very high redshift.

1312.4547	prompt emission of grb 121217a from gamma-rays to the nir	the mechanism that causes the prompt-emission episode of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) is still widely debated despite there being thousands of promptdetections. the favoured internal shock model relates this emission tosynchrotron radiation. however, it does not always explain the spectral indicesof the shape of the spectrum, often fit with empirical functions.multi-wavelength observations are therefore required to help investigate thepossible underlying mechanisms that causes the prompt emission. we present grb121217a, for which we were able to observe its near-infrared (nir) emissionduring a secondary prompt-emission episode with the gamma-ray burst opticalnear-infrared detector (grond) in combination with the swift and fermisatellites, covering an energy range of 0.001 kev to 100 kev. we determine aphotometric redshift of z=3.1+/-0.1 with a line-of-sight extinction of a_v~0mag, utilising the optical/nir sed. from the afterglow, we determine a bulklorentz factor of gamma~250 and an emission radius of r&lt;10^18 cm. theprompt-emission broadband spectral energy distribution is well fit with abroken power law with b1=-0.3+/-0.1, b2=0.6+/-0.1 that has a break ate=6.6+/-0.9 kev, which can be interpreted as the maximum injection frequency.self-absorption by the electron population below energies of e_a&lt;6 kev suggesta magnetic field strength of b~10^5 g. however, all the best fit modelsunderpredict the flux observed in the nir wavelengths, which also onlyrebrightens by a factor of ~2 during the second prompt emission episode, instark contrast to the x-ray emission, which rebrightens by a factor of ~100,suggesting an afterglow component is dominating the emission. we present grb121217a one of the few grbs for which there are multi-wavelength observationsof the prompt-emission period and show that it can be understood with asynchrotron radiation model.

1312.5099	simultaneous optical/gamma-ray observations of grb 121217's prompt  emission	since the advent of the swift satellite it has been possible to obtainprecise localisations of grb positions of sub-arcsec accuracy within seconds,facilitating ground-based robotic telescopes to automatically slew to thetarget within seconds. this has yielded a plethora of observational data forthe afterglow phase of the grb, but the quantity of data (&lt;2 kev) covering theinitial prompt emission still remains small. only in a handful of cases has itbeen possible obtain simultaneous coverage of the prompt emission in amulti-wavelength regime (gamma-ray to optical), as a result of: observing thefield by chance prior to the grb (e.g. 080319b/naked-eye burst), long-promptemission (e.g., 080928, 110205a) or triggered on a pre-cursor (e.g., 041219a,050820a, 061121). this small selection of bursts have shown both correlated anduncorrelated gamma-ray and optical light curve behaviour, and themulti-wavelength emission mechanism remains far from resolved (i.e. singlepopulation synchrotron self-component, electron distributions, additionalneutron components or residual collisions). such multi-wavelength observationsduring the grb prompt phase are pivotal in providing further insight on thepoorly understood prompt emission mechanism. we add to this small sample theswift burst 121217a that had two distinct periods of prompt emission separatedby ~700 s, observed by swift/bat, swift/xrt and fermi/gbm. as a result of thetime delay of the second emission, it enabled optical imaging (from 3 to 7bands) to be taken with the grond instrument to a resolution as fine as 10s.this multi-wavelength data will hopefully allow us to shed more light on thecurrent picture of prompt emission physics.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

1405.7396	grb 120711a: an intense integral burst with long-lasting soft gamma-ray  emission and a powerful optical flash	a long and intense gamma-ray burst (grb) was detected by integral on july 112012 with a duration of ~115s and fluence of 2.8x10^-4 erg cm^-2 in the 20kev-8 mev energy range. grb 120711a was at z~1.405 and produced soft gamma-rayemission (&gt;20 kev) for at least ~10 ks after the trigger. the grb was observedby several ground-based telescopes that detected a powerful optical flashpeaking at an r-band brightness of ~11.5 mag at ~126 s after the trigger. wepresent a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-lasting softgamma-ray emission detected in the 20-200 kev band with integral, the fermi/latpost-grb detection above 100 mev, the soft x-ray afterglow from xmm-newton,chandra, and swift and the optical/nir detections from watcher, skynet, grond,and rem. we modelled the long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission using thestandard afterglow scenario, which indicates a forward shock origin. thecombination of data extending from the nir to gev energies suggest that theemission is produced by a broken power-law spectrum consistent with synchrotronradiation. the afterglow is well modelled using a stratified wind-likeenvironment with a density profile k~1.2, suggesting a massive star progenitor(i.e. wolf-rayet). the analysis of the reverse and forward shock emissionreveals an initial lorentz factor of ~120-340, a jet half-opening angle of~2deg-5deg, and a baryon load of ~10^-5-10^-6 msun consistent with theexpectations of the fireball model when the emission is highly relativistic.long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission from other integral grbs with high peakfluxes, such as grb 041219a, was not detected, suggesting that a combination ofhigh lorentz factor, emission above 100 mev, and possibly a powerful reverseshock are required. similar long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission has recentlybeen observed from the nearby and extremely bright fermi/lat burst grb 130427a.

1408.5076	herschel observations of gamma-ray burst host galaxies: implications for  the topology of the dusty interstellar medium	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are indisputably related to starformation, and their vast luminosity in gamma rays pin-points regions of starformation independent of galaxy mass. as such, grbs provide a unique tool forstudying star forming galaxies out to high-z independent of luminosity. most ofour understanding of the properties of grb hosts (grbhs) comes from optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up observations, and we therefore have relativelylittle knowledge of the fraction of dust-enshrouded star formation that resideswithin grbhs. currently ~20% of grbs show evidence of significant amounts ofdust along the line of sight to the afterglow through the host galaxy, andthese grbs tend to reside within redder and more massive galaxies than grbswith optically bright afterglows. in this paper we present herschelobservations of five grbhs with evidence of being dust-rich, targeted tounderstand the dust attenuation properties within grbs better. despite thesensitivity of our herschel observations, only one galaxy in our sample wasdetected (grbh 070306), for which we measure a total star formation rate (sfr)of ~100mstar/yr, and which had a relatively high stellar mass(log[mstar]=10.34+0.09/-0.04). nevertheless, when considering a larger sampleof grbhs observed with herschel, it is clear that stellar mass is not the onlyfactor contributing to a herschel detection, and significant dust extinctionalong the grb sightline (a_{v,grb}&gt;1.5~mag) appears to be a considerably bettertracer of grbhs with high dust mass. this suggests that the extinguishing dustalong the grb line of sight lies predominantly within the host galaxy ism, andthus those grbs with a_{v,grb}&gt;1~mag but with no host galaxy herscheldetections are likely to have been predominantly extinguished by dust within anintervening dense cloud.

1410.0489	circular polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 121024a	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are most probably powered by collimated relativisticoutflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. brightafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, whenmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet andthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. high values ofoptical polarization detected minutes after burst in grb 120308a indicate thepresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the centralengine (the power source of the grb). theoretical models predict low degrees oflinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, whenthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient mediumand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. here we report thedetection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of grb121024a, measured 0.15 days after the burst. we show that the circularpolarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dustscattering or plasma propagation effects. a possible explanation is to invokeanisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angledistributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce thecomplex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

0804.1727	multiwavelength analysis of the intriguing grb 061126: the reverse shock  scenario and magnetization	we present a detailed study of the prompt and afterglow emission from swiftgrb 061126 using bat, xrt, uvot data and multi-color optical imaging from tenground-based telescopes. grb 061126 was a long burst (t_90=191 s) with fouroverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. the x-ray afterglow, observedfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay withalpha_x=1.290 \pm 0.008. optical observations presented here cover the timerange from 258 s (faulkes telescope north) to 15 days (gemini north) after theburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallowtransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \pm 0.03) approximately13 min after the burst. we suggest the early, steep component is due to areverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,expressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times largerthan in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. the ejecta might beendowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. the opticallight curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, whilethere is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the x-ray light curve. wemodel the broad band emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (thesteeper decay in x-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to x-ray)are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. thismight imply that the x-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process,such as late time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shockemission. the possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would givesupport to the additional emission scenario.

1505.04415	super-solar metallicity at the position of the ultra-long grb130925a	over the last decade there has been immense progress in the follow-up ofshort and long grbs, resulting in a significant rise in the detection rate ofx-ray and optical afterglows, in the determination of grb redshifts, and of theidentification of the underlying host galaxies. nevertheless, our theoreticalunderstanding on the progenitors and central engines powering these vastexplosions is lagging behind, and a newly identified class of `ultra-long' grbshas fuelled speculation on the existence of a new channel of grb formation. inthis paper we present high signal-to-noise x-shooter observations of the hostgalaxy of grb130925a, which is the fourth unambiguously identified ultra-longgrb, with prompt gamma-ray emission detected for ~20ks. the grb line of sightwas close to the host galaxy nucleus, and our spectroscopic observations coverboth this region along the bulge/disk of the galaxy, in addition to a brightstar-forming region within the outskirts of the galaxy. from our broadwavelength coverage we obtain accurate metallicity and dust-extinctionmeasurements at both the galaxy nucleus, and an outer star-forming region, andmeasure a super-solar metallicity at both locations, placing this galaxy withinthe 10-20% most metal-rich grb host galaxies. such a high metal enrichment hasimplications on the progenitor models of both long and ultra-long grbs,although the edge-on orientation of the host galaxy does not allow us to ruleout a large metallicity variation along our line of sight. the spatiallyresolved spectroscopic data presented in this paper offer important insightinto variations in the metal and dust abundance within grb host galaxies. theyalso illustrate the need for ifu observations on a larger sample of grb hostgalaxies at varies metallicities to provide a more quantitative view on therelation between the grb circumburst and the galaxy-whole properties.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

1511.00667	high metallicity lgrb hosts	we present our imaging and spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies oftwo dark long bursts with anomalously high metallicities, lgrb 051022 and lgrb020819b, which in conjunction with another lgrb event with an optical afterglowcomprise the three lgrbs with high metallicity host galaxies in the graham &amp;fruchter (2013) sample. in graham &amp; fruchter (2013), we showed that lgrbsexhibit a strong and apparently intrinsic preference for low metallicityenvironments (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.4 in the kk04 scale) in spite of these threecases with abundances of about solar and above. these exceptions however areconsistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparablebrightness &amp; redshift. this is surprising: even among a preselected sample ofhigh metallicity lgrbs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for theseobjects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typicalmetallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift. therefore wededuce that it is possible to form an lgrb in a high metallicity environmentalthough with greater rarity.  from this we conclude that there are three possible explanations for thepresence of the lgrbs observed in high metallicity hosts as seen to date: (1)lgrbs do not occur in high metallicity environments and those seen in highmetallicity hosts are in fact occurring in low metallicity environments thathave become associated with otherwise high metallicity hosts but remainunenriched. (2) the lgrb formation mechanism while preferring low metallicityenvironments does not strictly require it resulting in a gradual decline inburst formation with increasing metallicity. (3) the typical low metallicitylgrbs and the few high metallicity cases are the result of physically differentburst formation pathways with only the former affected by the metallicity andthe later occurring much more infrequently.

1511.01466	the absolute rate of lgrb formation	we estimate the lgrb progenitor rate using our recent work on the effects ofenvironmental metallically on lgrb formation in concert with sne statistics viaan approach patterned loosely off the drake equation. beginning with the cosmicstar-formation history, we consider the expected number of broad-line type icevents (the sne type associated with lgrbs) that are in low metallicity hostenvironments adjusted by the contribution of high metallicity host environmentsat a much reduced rate. we then compare this estimate to the observed lgrb ratecorrected for instrumental selection effects to provide a combined estimate ofthe efficiency fraction of these progenitors to produce lgrbs and the fractionof which are beamed in our direction. from this we estimate that an alignedlgrb occurs for approximately every 4000 low metallically broad-lined type icsupernovae. therefore if one assumes a semi-nominal beaming factor of 100 thenonly about one such supernova out of 40 produce an lgrb. finally we propose anoff-axis lgrb search strategy of targeting for radio observation broad-linetype ic events that occur in low metallicity hosts.

astro-ph;0507515	swift panchromatic observations of the bright gamma-ray burst grb050525a	the bright gamma-ray burst grb050525a has been detected with the swiftobservatory, providing unique multiwavelength coverage from the very earliestphases of the burst. the x-ray and optical/uv afterglow decay light curves bothexhibit a steeper slope ~0.15 days after the burst, indicative of a jet break.this jet break time combined with the total gamma-ray energy of the burstconstrains the opening angle of the jet to be 3.2 degrees. we derive anempirical `time-lag' redshift from the bat data of z_hat = 0.69 +/- 0.02, ingood agreement with the spectroscopic redshift of 0.61.  prior to the jet break, the x-ray data can be modelled by a simple power lawwith index alpha = -1.2. however after 300 s the x-ray flux brightens by about30% compared to the power-law fit. the optical/uv data have a more complexdecay, with evidence of a rapidly falling reverse shock component thatdominates in the first minute or so, giving way to a flatter forward shockcomponent at later times.  the multiwavelength x-ray/uv/optical spectrum of the afterglow shows evidencefor migration of the electron cooling frequency through the optical rangewithin 25000 s. the measured temporal decay and spectral indices in the x-rayand optical/uv regimes compare favourably with the standard fireball model forgamma-ray bursts assuming expansion into a constant density interstellarmedium.

astro-ph;0509060	swift-uvot detection of grb 050318	we present observations of grb 050318 by the ultra-violet and opticaltelescope (uvot) on-board the swift observatory. the data are the firstdetections of a gamma ray burst (grb) afterglow decay by the uvot instrument,launched specifically to open a new window on these transient sources. weshowcase uvots ability to provide multi-color photometry and the advantages ofcombining uvot data with simultaneous and contemporaneous observations from thehigh-energy detectors on the swift spacecraft. multiple filters covering1,800-6,000 angstroms reveal a red source with spectral slope steeper than thesimultaneous x-ray continuum. spectral fits indicate that the uvot colors areconsistent with dust extinction by systems at z = 1.2037 and z = 1.4436,redshifts where absorption systems have been pre-identified. however, the datacan be most-easily reproduced with models containing a foreground system ofneutral gas redshifted by z = 2.8 +/- 0.3. for both of the above scenarios,spectral and decay slopes are, for the most part, consistent with fireballexpansion into a uniform medium, provided a cooling break occurs between theenergy ranges of the uvot and swifts x-ray instrumentation.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0510776	multiwavelength xmm-newton observations of the laor et al. sample of pg  quasars	we present xmm-newton/epic spectra for the laor et al. sample of palomargreen quasars. we find that a power-law provides a reasonable fit to the 2-5kev region of the spectra. excess soft x-ray emission below 2 kev is presentfor all objects, with the exception of those known to contain a warm absorber.a single power-law is, however, a poor fit to the 0.3-10.0 kev spectrum andinstead we find that a simple model, consisting of a broken power-law (plus aniron line), provides a reasonable fit in most cases. the equivalent width ofthe emission line is constrained in just twelve objects but with low (&lt;2 sigma)significance in most cases. for the sources whose spectra are well-fit by thebroken power-law model, we find that various optical and x-ray line andcontinuum parameters are well-correlated; in particular, the power-law photonindex is well-correlated with the fwhm of the hbeta line and the photon indicesof the low and high energy components of the broken power-law arewell-correlated with each other. these results suggest that the 0.3-10 kevx-ray emission shares a common (presumably non-thermal) origin, as opposed tosuggestions that the soft excess is directly produced by thermal disc emissionor via an additional spectral component. we present xmm-newton/om data which wecombine with the x-ray spectra so as to produce broad-band spectral energydistributions, free from uncertainties due to long-term variability innon-simultaneous data. fitting these optical-uv spectra with a comptonized discmodel indicates that the soft x-ray excess is independent of the accretiondisc, confirming our interpretation of the tight correlation between the hardand soft x-ray spectra.

astro-ph;0601182	swift-uvot observations of the x-ray flash 050406	we present swift-uvot data on the optical afterglow of the x-ray flash of2005 april 6 (xrf 050406) from 88s to \sim 10^5s after the initial promptgamma-ray emission. our observations in the v, b and u bands are the earliestthat have been taken of an xrf optical counterpart. combining the early -timeoptical temporal and spectral properties with \gamma- and simultaneous x-raydata taken with the bat and xrt telescopes on-board swift, we are able toconstrain possible origins of the xrf. the prompt emission had a fred profile(fast-rise, exponential decay) with a duration of t_90 = 5.7\pm 0.2s, puttingit at the short end of the long-burst duration distribution. the absence ofphotoelectric absorption red-ward of 4000 \aa in the uv/optical spectrumprovides a firm upper limit of z\leq 3.1 on the redshift, thus excluding a highredshift as the sole reason for the soft spectrum. the optical light curve isconsistent with a power-law decay with slope alpha = -0.75\pm 0.26(f_{\nu}\propto t^{\alpha}), and a maximum occurring in the first 200s afterthe initial gamma-ray emission. the softness of the prompt emission is welldescribed by an off-axis structured jet model, which is able to account for theearly peak flux and shallow decay observed in the optical and x-ray bands.

astro-ph;0604316	optical, infrared, and ultraviolet observations of the x-ray flash grb  050416a	we present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared photometry of the afterglow ofthe x-ray flash xrf 050416a taken between approximately 100 seconds and 36 daysafter the burst. we find an intrinsic spectral slope between 1930 and 22,200angstrom of beta = -1.14 +/- 0.20 and a decay rate of alpha = -0.86 +/- 0.15.there is no evidence for a change in the decay rate between approximately 0.7and 4.7 days after the burst. our data implies that there is no spectral breakbetween the optical and x-ray bands between 0.7 and 4.7 days after the burst,and is consistent with the cooling break being redward of the k_s band (22,200angstrom) at 0.7 days. the combined ultraviolet/optical/infrared spectralenergy distribution shows no evidence for a significant amount of extinction inthe host galaxy along the line of sight to xrf 050416a. our data suggest thatthe extragalactic extinction along the line of sight to the burst is onlyapproximately a_v = 0.2 mag, which is significantly less than the extinctionexpected from the hydrogen column density inferred from $x$-ray observations ofxrf 050416a assuming a dust-to-gas ratio similar to what is found for the milkyway. the observed extinction, however, is consistent with the dust-to-gas ratioseen in the small magellanic cloud. we suggest that xrf 050416a may have atwo-component jet similar to what has been proposed for grb 030329. if this isthe case the lack of an observed jet break between 0.7 and 42 days is anillusion due to emission from the wide jet dominating the afterglow afterapproximately 1.5 days.

astro-ph;0610635	swift detects a remarkable gamma-ray burst, grb 060614, that introduces  a new classification scheme	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are known to come in two duration classes, separatedat ~2 s. long bursts originate from star forming regions in galaxies, haveaccompanying supernovae (sne) when near enough to observe and are likely causedby massive-star collapsars. recent observations show that short burstsoriginate in regions within their host galaxies with lower star formation ratesconsistent with binary neutron star (ns) or ns - black hole (bh) mergers.moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no sne havebeen so far associated with short grbs. we report here on the bright, nearbygrb 060614 that does not fit in either class. its ~102 s duration groups itwith long grbs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely withinthe short grb subclass. moreover, very deep optical observations exclude anaccompanying supernova, similar to short grbs. this combination of a longduration event without accompanying sn poses a challenge to both a collapsarand merging ns interpretation and opens the door on a new grb classificationscheme that straddles both long and short bursts.

astro-ph;0611081	extreme properties of grb061007: a highly energetic or a highly  collimated burst?	grb061007 is the brightest gamma-ray burst (grb) to be detected by swift andis accompanied by an exceptionally luminous afterglow that had a v-bandmagnitude &lt;11.1 at 80s after the prompt emission. from the start of the swiftobservations the afterglow decayed as a power law with a slope of\alpha_x=1.66+/-0.01 in the x-ray and \alpha_{opt}=1.64+/-0.01 in theuv/optical, up to the point that it was no longer detected above background inthe optical or x-ray bands. the brightness of this grb and the similarity inthe decay rate of the x-ray, optical and gamma-ray emission from 100s after thetrigger distinguish this burst from others and present a challenge to thefireball model. the lack of a cooling or jet break in the afterglow up to\~10^5s constrains any model that can produce the large luminosity observed ingrb061007, which we found to require either an excessively large kinetic energyor highly collimated outflow. analysis of the multi-wavelength spectral andhigh-resolution temporal data taken with swift suggest an early time jet-breakto be a more plausible scenario. this must have occurred within 80s of theprompt emission, which places an upper limit on the jet opening angle of\theta_j=0.8deg. such a highly collimated outflow resolves the energy budgetproblem presented in a spherical emission model, reducing the isotropicequivalent energy of this burst to e_{\gamma}^{corr}=10^{50} ergs; consistentwith other grbs.

astro-ph;0702122	dust and gas in the local environments of gamma-ray bursts	using a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows detected by both the x-rayand the uv/optical telescopes (xrt and uvot) on swift, we modelled the spectralenergy distributions (seds) to determine gas column densities and dustextinction in the grb local environment. in six out of seven cases we find anx-ray absorber associated with the grb host galaxy with column density(assuming solar abundances) ranging from (0.8 - 7.7)x10^{21}cm^{-2}. wedetermine the rest-frame visual extinction a_v using the smc, lmc and galacticextinction curves to model the dust in the grb host galaxy, and this rangesfrom a_v = 0.12\pm 0.04 to a_v = 0.65^{+0.08}_{-0.07}. the afterglow seds weretypically best fit by a model with an smc extinction curve. in only one casewas the grb afterglow better modelled by a galactic extinction curve, which hasa prominent absorption feature at 2175angstrom. we investigate the selectioneffects present in our sample and how these might distort the true distributionof a_v in grb host galaxies. we estimate that grbs with no afterglow detectedblueward of 5500angstrom have average rest-frame visual extinctions almosteight times those observed in the optically bright population of grbs. this mayhelp account for the ~1/3 of grbs observed by swift that have no afterglowdetected by uvot.

astro-ph;0702220	swift observations of grb 070110: an extraordinary x-ray afterglow  powered by the central engine	we present a detailed analysis of swift multi-wavelength observations of grb070110 and its remarkable afterglow. the early x-ray light curve, interpretedas the tail of the prompt emission, displays a spectral evolution already seenin other gamma-ray bursts. the optical afterglow shows a shallow decay up to ~2d after the burst, which is not consistent with standard afterglow models. themost intriguing feature is a very steep decay in the x-ray flux at ~20 ks afterthe burst, ending an apparent plateau. the abrupt drop of the x-ray light curverules out an external shock as the origin of the plateau in this burst andimplies long-lasting activity of the central engine. the temporal and spectralproperties of the plateau phase point towards a continuous central engineemission rather than the episodic emission of x-ray flares. we suggest that theobserved x-ray plateau is powered by a spinning down central engine, possibly amillisecond pulsar, which dissipates energy at an internal radius beforedepositing energy into the external shock.

0809.4193	the first swift ultra-violet/optical telescope grb afterglow catalog	we present the first swift ultra-violet/optical telescope (uvot) gamma-rayburst (grb) afterglow catalog. the catalog contains data from over 64,000independent uvot image observations of 229 grbs first detected by swift, thehigh energy transient explorer 2 (hete2), the international gamma-rayastrophysics laboratory (integral), and the interplanetary network (ipn). thecatalog covers grbs occurring during the period from 2005 jan 17 to 2007 jun 16and includes ~86% of the bursts detected by the swift burst alert telescope(bat). the catalog provides detailed burst positional, temporal, andphotometric information extracted from each of the uvot images. positions forbursts detected at the 3-sigma-level are provided with a nominal accuracy,relative to the usno-b1 catalog, of ~0.25 arcseconds. photometry for each burstis given in three uv bands, three optical bands, and a 'white' or open filter.upper limits for magnitudes are reported for sources detected below 3-sigma.general properties of the burst sample and light curves, including thefilter-dependent temporal slopes, are also provided. the majority of the uvotlight curves, for bursts detected at the 3-sigma-level, can be fit by a singlepower-law, with a median temporal slope (alpha) of 0.96, beginning severalhundred seconds after the burst trigger and ending at ~1x10^5 s. the medianuvot v-band (~5500 angstroms) magnitude at 2000 s for a sample of "well"detected bursts is 18.02. the uvot flux interpolated to 2000 s after the burst,shows relatively strong correlations with both the prompt swift bat fluence,and the swift x-ray flux at 11 hours after the trigger.

0809.4688	jet breaks at the end of the slow decline phase of swift grb lightcurves	the swift mission has discovered an intriguing feature of gamma-ray burst(grbs) afterglows, a phase of shallow decline of the flux in the x-ray andoptical lightcurves. this behaviour is typically attributed to energy injectioninto the burst ejecta. at some point this phase ends, resulting in a break inthe lightcurve, which is commonly interpreted as the cessation of the energyinjection. in a few cases, however, while breaks in the x-ray lightcurve areobserved, optical emission continues its slow flux decline. this behavioursuggests a more complex scenario. in this paper, we present a model thatinvokes a double component outflow, in which narrowly collimated ejecta areresponsible for the x-ray emission while a broad outflow is responsible for theoptical emission. the narrow component can produce a jet break in the x-raylightcurve at relatively early times, while the optical emission does not breakdue to its lower degree of collimation. in our model both components aresubject to energy injection for the whole duration of the follow-upobservations. we apply this model to grbs with chromatic breaks, and we showhow it might change the interpretation of the grbs canonical lightcurve. wealso study our model from a theoretical point of view, investigating thepossible configurations of frequencies and the values of grb physicalparameters allowed in our model.

0706.0669	the two-component afterglow of swift grb 050802	this paper investigates grb 050802, one of the best examples of a it swiftgamma-ray burst afterglow that shows a break in the x-ray lightcurve, while theoptical counterpart decays as a single power-law. this burst has an opticallybright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectralrange of the uvot on-board swift. observations began with the xrt and uvottelescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. thex-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. theoptical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_o = 0.82 +/- 0.03throughout the observation. the x-ray data on their own are consistent with thebreak at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. modelling the opticalto x-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow cannot be produced by the same component as the x-ray emission at late times,ruling out a single component afterglow. we therefore considered two-componentjet models and find that the x-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by amodel in which both components are energy injected for the duration of theobserved afterglow and the x-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in thenarrow component. this bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide forinterpreting the surprising finding of swift that bursts seldom displayachromatic jet breaks.
