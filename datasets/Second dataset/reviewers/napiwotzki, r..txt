0901.2325	the age of white dwarf companions	we carried out a spectroscopic investigation of single lined white dwarfs(wds) in double degenerate (dd) systems and discuss their binary evolution.simulated spectra of the halpha region are used to derive upper limits on thetemperature of the invisible component and thus lower limits on the coolingage. this is done for a range of hypothetical secondary masses and a minimumcooling age deduced. results are compared with the well known parameters of thevisible primary, which allows us to determine a lower limit for the cooling agedifference of both wds. most of the ten systems in our sample have a minimumage difference of not larger than 0.5gyr and their small orbital separation ishighly suggestive of at least one unstable mass transfer phase. however, astable first mass transfer phase is feasible as the age difference is less then1gyr. the results imply that unstable mass transfer is the most likely finalcontact binary scenario to have occurred in dd systems but the first masstransfer phase is not constrained.

0901.4464	high resolution optical spectroscopy of praesepe white dwarfs	we present the results of a high resolution optical spectroscopic study ofnine white dwarf candidate members of praesepe undertaken with the vlt anduves. we find, contrary to a number of previous studies, that wd0836+201(lb390, eg59) and wd0837+199 (lb393, eg61) are magnetic and non-magnetic whitedwarfs respectively. subsequently, we determine the radial velocities for theeight non-magnetic degenerates and provide compelling evidence that wd0837+185is a radial velocity variable and possibly a double-degenerate system. we alsofind that our result for wd0837+218, in conjunction with its projected spatiallocation and position in initial mass-final mass space, argues it is morelikely to be a field star than a cluster member. after eliminating these twowhite dwarfs, and wd0836+199 which has no clean sdss photometry, we use theremaining 5 stars to substantiate modern theoretical mass-radius relations forwhite dwarfs. in light of our new results we re-examine the white dwarf membersof praesepe and use them to further constrain the initial mass-final massrelation. we find a a near monotonic ifmr, which can still be adequatelyrepresented by simple linear function with only one outlier which may haveformed from a blue straggler star.

0902.4259	a new detailed examination of white dwarfs in ngc3532 and ngc2287	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic study of the whitedwarf candidate members of the intermediate age open clusters ngc3532 andngc2287. of the nine objects investigated, it is determined that six areprobable members of the clusters, four in ngc3532 and two in ngc2287. for thesesix white dwarfs we use our estimates of their cooling times together with thecluster ages to constrain the lifetimes and masses of their progenitor stars.we examine the location of these objects in initial mass-final mass space andfind that they now provide no evidence for substantial scatter in initialmass-final mass relation as suggested by previous investigations. instead, wedemonstrate that, when combined with current data from other solar metalicityopen clusters and the sirius binary system, they hint at an ifmr that issteeper in the initial mass range 3m$_{\odot}$$\simless$m$_{\rminit}$$\simless$4m$_{\odot}$ than at progenitor masses immediately lower andhigher than this. this form is generally consistent with the predictions ofstellar evolutionary models and can aid population synthesis models inreproducing the relatively sharp drop observed at the high mass end of the mainpeak in the mass distribution of white dwarfs.

0911.4019	the chemical composition of ts 01, the most oxygen-deficient planetary  nebula. agb nucleosynthesis in a metal-poor binary star	the planetary nebula ts 01 (also called pn g 135.9+55.9 or sbs 1150+599a),with its record-holding low oxygen abundance and its double degenerate closebinary core (period 3.9 h), is an exceptional object located in the galactichalo. we have secured observational data in a complete wavelength range inorder to pin down the abundances of half a dozen elements in the nebula. theabundances are obtained via detailed photoionization modelling taking intoaccount all the observational constraints (including geometry and apertureeffects) using the pseudo-3d photoionization code cloudy_3d. the spectralenergy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate modelatmospheres. both stellar components contribute to the ionization: the ``cool''one provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization, and the ``hot'' one isresponsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions, which explainswhy previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties. the nebularabundances of c, n, o, and ne are found to be respectively, 1/3.5, 1/4.2, 1/70,and 1/11 of the solar value, with uncertainties of a factor 2. thus the extremeo deficiency of this object is confirmed. the abundances of s and ar are lessthan 1/30 of solar. standard models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesiscannot explain the abundance pattern observed in the nebula. to obtain anextreme oxygen deficiency in a star whose progenitor has an initial mass ofabout 1 msun requires an additional mixing process, which can be induced bystellar rotation and/or by the presence of the close companion. we havecomputed a stellar model with initial mass of 1 msun, appropriate metallicity,and initial rotation of 100 kms, and find that rotation greatly improves theagreement between the predicted and observed abundances.

1008.2960	discovery of a t dwarf + white dwarf binary system	we present the discovery of the first t dwarf + white dwarf binary systemlspm 1459+0857ab, confirmed through common proper motion and spectroscopy. thewhite dwarf is a high proper motion object from the lspm catalogue that weconfirm spectroscopically to be a relatively cool (teff=5535+\-45k) andmagnetic (b~2mg) hydrogen-rich white dwarf, with an age of at least 4.8gyrs.the t dwarf is a recent discovery from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ulas1459+0857), and has a spectral type of t4.5+\-0.5 and a distance in the range43-69pc. with an age constraint (inferred from the white dwarf) of &gt;4.8gyrs weestimate teff=1200-1500k and logg=5.4-5.5 for ulas 1459+0857, making it abenchmark t dwarf with well constrained surface gravity. we also compare the tdwarf spectra with the latest lyon group atmospheric model predictions, whichdespite some shortcomings are in general agreement with the observed propertiesof ulas 1459+0857. the separation of the binary components (16,500-26,500au, or365 arcseconds on the sky) is consistent with an evolved version of the morecommon brown dwarf + main-sequence binary systems now known, and although thesystem has a wide separation, it is shown to be statistically robust as a nonspurious association. the observed colours of the t dwarf show that it isrelatively bright in the z band compared to other t dwarfs of similar type, andfurther investigation is warranted to explore the possibility that this couldbe a more generic indicator of older t dwarfs. future observations of thisbinary system will provide even stronger constraints on the t dwarf properties,and additional systems will combine to give a more comprehensively robust testof the model atmospheres in this temperature regime.

1010.3651	ejection velocities of high galactic latitude runaway stars	we estimate the distribution of ejection velocities for the known populationof high galactic latitude runaway stars. the initial sample is a collection of174 early-type stars selected from the literature. the stars are firstclassified according to their evolutionary status in order to obtain ahomogeneous sample of 96 genuine main sequence stars. their present velocitiesand flight times are then estimated using proper motion data from variousastrometric catalogues (including tycho-2, ucac2, and usno-b) and the ejectionvelocities are computed by tracing their orbits back in time, based on agalactic potential. the potential used is constructed from a mass density modelchosen to fit the most recent observational constraints. we find evidence fortwo different populations of runaway stars: a "high" velocity population, witha maximum ejection velocity of about 400 - 500 km/s, and a "low" velocitypopulation, with a maximum ejection velocity of about 300 km/s. we argue thatthe observed limit of 500 km/s and the bimodality of the observed ejectionvelocity distribution are natural consequences of the so-called binary ejectionmechanism. we discuss the connection between the "high" velocity population andthe so-called hypervelocity stars, showing how previously studied hypervelocitystars are consistent with the results obtained. we also find that some starsthat were once thought to be best explained as being formed in the halo arecompatible with a runaway hypothesis once proper motions are included in theanalysis. however, three stars in the selected sample appear to be inconsistentwith ejection from the galactic disc. possible scenarios are discussed,including a possible formation in the galactic halo.

1210.0446	wd0837+185:the formation and evolution of an extreme mass ratio white  dwarf-brown dwarf binary in praesepe	there is a striking and unexplained dearth of brown dwarf companions in closeorbits (&lt; 3au) around stars more massive than the sun, in stark contrast to thefrequency of stellar and planetary companions. although rare and relativelyshort-lived, these systems leave detectable evolutionary end points in the formof white dwarf - brown dwarf binaries and these remnants can offer uniqueinsights into the births and deaths of their parent systems. we present thediscovery of a close (orbital separation ~ 0.006 au) substellar companion to amassive white dwarf member of the praesepe star cluster. using the cluster ageand the mass of the white dwarf we constrain the mass of the white dwarfprogenitor star to lie in the range 3.5 - 3.7 msun (b9). the high mass of thewhite dwarf means the substellar companion must have been engulfed by the bstar's envelope while it was on the late asymptotic giant branch (agb). hence,the initial separation of the system was ~2 au, with common envelope evolutionreducing the separation to its current value. the initial and final orbitalseparations allow us to constrain the combination of the common envelopeefficiency (alpha) and binding energy parameters (lambda) for the agb star toalpha lambda ~3. we examine the various formation scenarios and conclude thatthe substellar object was most likely to have been captured by the white dwarfprogenitor early in the life of the cluster, rather than forming in situ.

1212.2899	nltt5306: the shortest period detached white dwarf + brown dwarf binary	we have spectroscopically confirmed a brown dwarf mass companion to thehydrogen atmosphere white dwarf nltt5306. the white dwarf's atmosphericparameters were measured using sloan digital sky survey and x-shooterspectroscopy as t_eff=7756+/-35k and log(g)=7.68+/-0.08, giving a mass for theprimary of m_wd=0.44+/-0.04 m_sun, at a distance of 71+/-4 pc with a coolingage of 710+/-50 myr. the existence of the brown dwarf secondary was confirmedthrough the near-infrared arm of the x-shooter data and a spectral type ofdl4-dl7 was estimated using standard spectral indices. combined radial velocitymeasurements from the sloan digital sky survey, x-shooter and the hobby-eberlytelescope's high resolution spectrograph of the white dwarf gives a minimummass of 56+/-3 m_jup for the secondary, confirming the substellar nature. theperiod of the binary was measured as 101.88+/-0.02 mins using both the radialvelocity data and i'-band variability detected with the int. this variabilityindicates 'day' side heating of the brown dwarf companion. we also observeh{\alpha} emission in our higher resolution data in phase with the white dwarfradial velocity, indicating this system is in a low level of accretion, mostlikely via a stellar wind. this system represents the shortest period whitedwarf + brown dwarf binary and the secondary has survived a stage of commonenvelope evolution, much like its longer period counterpart, wd0137-349. bothsystems likely represent bona-fide progenitors of cataclysmic variables with alow mass white dwarf and a brown dwarf donor.

1304.4452	a progenitor binary and an ejected mass donor remnant of faint type ia  supernovae	type ia supernovae (sn ia) are the most important standard candles formeasuring the expansion history of the universe. the thermonuclear explosion ofa white dwarf can explain their observed properties, but neither the progenitorsystems nor any stellar remnants have been conclusively identified.underluminous sn ia have been proposed to originate from a so-calleddouble-detonation of a white dwarf. after a critical amount of helium isdeposited on the surface through accretion from a close companion, the heliumis ignited causing a detonation wave that triggers the explosion of the whitedwarf itself. we have discovered both shallow transits and eclipses in thetight binary system cd-30 11223 composed of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf and ahot helium star, allowing us to determine its component masses and fundamentalparameters. in the future the system will transfer mass from the helium star tothe white dwarf. modelling this process we find that the detonation in theaccreted helium layer is sufficiently strong to trigger the explosion of thecore. the helium star will then be ejected at so large a velocity that it willescape the galaxy. the predicted properties of this remnant are an excellentmatch to the so-called hypervelocity star us 708, a hot, helium-rich starmoving at more than 750 km/s, sufficient to leave the galaxy. theidentification of both progenitor and remnant provides a consistent picture ofthe formation and evolution of underluminous type ia supernovae.

0801.4456	lmc origin of the hyper-velocity star he 0437-5439. beyond the  supermassive black hole paradigm	context: hyper-velocity stars move so fast that only a supermassive blackhole (smbh) seems to be capable to accelerate them. hence the galactic centre(gc) is their only suggested place of origin. edelmann et al. (2005) found theearly b-star he0437-5439 to be too short-lived to have reached its currentposition in the galactic halo if ejected from the gc, except if being a bluestraggler. its proximity to the lmc suggested an origin from this galaxy. aims:the chemical signatures of stars at the gc are significantly different fromthose in the lmc. hence, an accurate measurement of the abundance pattern ofhe0437-5439 will yield a new tight constraint on the place of birth of thisstar. methods: high-resolution spectra obtained with uves on the vlt areanalysed using state-of-the-art non-lte modelling techniques. results: wemeasured abundances of individual elements to very high accuracy in he0437-5439as well as in two reference stars, from the lmc and the solar neighbourhood.the abundance pattern is not consistent at all with that observed in stars nearthe gc, ruling our an origin from the gc. however, there is a high degree ofconsistency with the lmc abundance pattern. our abundance results cannot ruleout an origin in the outskirts of the galactic disk. however, we find the lifetime of he0437-5439 to be more than 3 times shorter than the time of flight tothe edge of the disk, rendering a galactic origin unlikely. conclusions: onlyone smbh is known to be present in galaxy and none in the lmc. hence theexclusion of an gc origin challenges the smbh paradigm. we conclude that theremust be other mechanism(s) to accelerate stars to hyper-velocity speed than thesmbh. we draw attention to dynamical ejection from dense massive clusters, thathas recently been proposed by gvaramadze et al.

0804.1282	binary sdb stars with massive compact companions	the masses of compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars and blackholes are fundamental to astrophysics, but very difficult to measure. wepresent the results of an analysis of subluminous b (sdb) stars in close binarysystems with unseen compact companions to derive their masses and clarify theirnature. radial velocity curves were obtained from time resolved spectroscopy.the atmospheric parameters were determined in a quantitative spectral analysis.based on high resolution spectra we were able to measure the projectedrotational velocity of the stars with high accuracy. in the distribution ofprojected rotational velocities signs of tidal locking with the companions arevisible. by detecting ellipsoidal variations in the lightcurve of an sdb binarywe were able to show that subdwarf binaries with orbital periods up to 0.6 dare most likely synchronized. in this case, the inclination angles andcompanion masses of the binaries can be tightly constrained. five invisiblecompanions have masses that are compatible with that of normal white dwarfs orlate type main sequence stars. however, four sdbs have compact companionsmassive enough to be heavy white dwarfs (&gt;1 msun), neutron stars or even blackholes. such a high fraction of massive compact companions is not expected fromcurrent models of binary evolution.

0804.1287	metal abundances of subdwarf b stars from spy - a pattern emerges	the formation of sdbs is still puzzling, as is the chemical composition oftheir atmospheres. while helium and other light elements are depleted relativeto solar values, heavy elements are highly enriched. diffusion processes in thehot, radiative atmosphere of these stars are the most likely explanation.although several attempts were made, it was not yet possible to model all theobserved features of sdb atmospheres. a setback of most prior studies was thesmall sample size. we present a detailed abundance analysis of 68 sdbs. fromhigh resolution spectra obtained with the vlt/uves instrument in the course ofthe eso supernova progenitor survey (spy) we measured elemental abundances ofup to 24 different ions per star. a general trend of enrichment was found withincreasing temperature for most of the heavier elements. the lighter elementslike carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are depleted irrespective of the temperature.although there is considerable scatter from one star to another, the generalabundance patterns in most sdbs are similar. an interplay between gravitationalsettling, radiative levitation and weak winds is most likely responsible. about6 % of the analysed stars show an enrichment in carbon and helium which cannotbe explained in the framework of diffusion alone. nuclear processed materialmust have been transported to the surface. the late hot-flasher scenario mayprovide a possible explanation for this effect.

astro-ph;0410230	the mass of the sdb primary of the binary hs 2333+3927	short period sdb binaries with cool companions are crucial to understandpre-cv evolution, because they will evolve into cataclysmic variables, when thesdb will have left the extended horizontal branch. recently we discovered thesixth such system, hs 2333+3927, consisting of an sdb star and an m dwarf(period: 0.172 d) with a very strong reflection effect, but no eclipses. thereflection is stronger than in any of the other similar systems which renders aquantitative spectral analysis very difficult because the balmer line profilesmay be disturbed by the reflected light. a spectroscopic analysis results inteff = 36500 k, log g = 5.70, and log (n_he/n_h) = -2.15. mass-radius relationswere derived from the results of the analysis of light and radial-velocitycurves. comparison with the mass-radius relation derived from the surfacegravity of the sdb star favours a rather low mass of 0.38 msun for the primary.the mass of the companion is 0.29 m_sun. hs 2333+3927 is the only known sdb+dmsystem with a period above the cv period gap.

astro-ph;0608671	on the origin of the ultramassive white dwarf gd50	we argue on the basis of astrometric and spectroscopic data that theultramassive white dwarf gd50 is associated with the star formation event thatcreated the pleiades and is possibly a former member of this cluster. itscooling age (~60myrs) is consistent with it having evolved essentially as asingle star from a progenitor with a mass m&gt;6msun so we find no need to invokea white dwarf-white dwarf binary merger scenario to account for its existence.this result may represent the first direct observational evidence that singlestar evolution can produce white dwarfs with m&gt;1.1msun, as predicted by somestellar evolutionary theories. on the basis of its tangential velocity we alsoprovisionally identify the ultramassive (m~1.2msun) white dwarf pg0136+251 asbeing related to the pleiades. these findings may help to alleviate thedifficulties in reconciling the observed number of hot nearby ultramassivewhite dwarfs with the smaller number predicted by binary evolution models underthe assumption that they are the products of white dwarf mergers.

0810.2547	high spatial resolution galactic 3d extinction mapping with iphas	we present an algorithm ({\scshape mead}, for `mapping extinction againstdistance') which will determine intrinsic ($r' - i'$) colour, extinction, anddistance for early-a to k4 stars extracted from the iphas $r'/i'/\halpha$photometric database. these data can be binned up to map extinction in threedimensions across the northern galactic plane. the large size of the iphasdatabase ($\sim 200$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digitalphotometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude ($r' \sim 20$) allowextinction to be mapped with fine angular ($ \sim 10 $ arcmin) and distance($\sim 0.1$ ~kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the solarcircle. high reddening within the solar circle on occasion brings this rangedown to $\sim 2$ kpc. the resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatlyexceeds that of previous empirical 3d extinction maps, enabling the structureof the galactic plane to be studied in increased detail. {\scshape mead}accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors,unresolved ism substructure, and binarity. the impact of metallicityvariations, within the range typical of the galactic disc is small. theaccuracy and reliability of {\scshape mead} are tested through the use ofsimulated photometry created with monte-carlo sampling techniques. the successof this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results arecompared to the literature.
