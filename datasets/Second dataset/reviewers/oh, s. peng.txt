0901.1888	the equation of state of the intergalactic medium after hydrogen  reionization	we use an analytic model to study how inhomogeneous hydrogen reionizationaffects the temperature distribution of the intergalactic medium (igm). duringthis process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in theigm as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 k; subsequentexpansion of the universe then cools the gas. because reionization most likelyproceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, haveless time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gasimmediately after reionization is complete (an "inverted" equation of state).  from this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly andeventually returns to a more normal equation of state. the rapidly evolvingtemperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizingbackground at z~6. for example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, sothat the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6than typically claimed. this degeneracy is difficult to disentangle, becausethe lyman-alpha forest probes only a narrow range in densities (over which thegas is nearly isothermal). however, higher lyman-series transitions probe widerdensity ranges, sampling different effective temperatures, and offer a new wayto measure the igm equation of state that should work where nearly saturatedabsorption precludes other methods. this will help to separate evolution intemperature from that in the ionizing background. while more detailed studywith hydrodynamic simulations is needed, we show that such measurements couldpotentially distinguish early and late reionization using only a handful oflines of sight.

0901.3966	the evolution of the lyman-alpha forest effective optical depth  following heii reionisation	three independent observational studies have now detected a narrow (\delta z~ 0.5) dip centred at z=3.2 in the otherwise smooth redshift evolution of thelya forest effective optical depth. this feature has previously beeninterpreted as an indirect signature of rapid photo-heating in the igm duringthe epoch of heii reionisation. we examine this interpretation using asemi-analytic model of inhomogeneous heii reionisation and high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of the lya forest. we instead find that a rapid(\delta z ~ 0.2) boost to the igm temperature (\delta t ~ 10^4 k) beginning atz=3.4 produces a well understood and generic evolution in the lya effectiveoptical depth, where a sudden reduction in the opacity is followed by agradual, monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the lowdensity igm. this behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow feature in theobservational data. if photo-heating during heii reionisation is insteadextended over several redshift units, as recent theoretical studies suggest,then the lya opacity will evolve smoothly with redshift. we conclude that thesharp dip observed in the lya forest effective optical depth is instead mostlikely due to a narrow peak in the hydrogen photo-ionisation rate around z=3.2,and suggest that it may arise from the modulation of either reprocessedradiation during heii reionisation, or the opacity of lyman limit systems.

0902.1018	the 21cm signature of early relic \hii regions	we calculate the spin temperature and 21 cm brightness of early \hii regionsaround the first stars. we use outputs from cosmologicalradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the formation and evolution of early\hii regions. in the pre-reionization era, \hii regions around massiveprimordial stars have diameters of a few kpc. the gas within the \hii regionsis almost fully ionized, but begins recombining after the central stars dieoff. the relic \hii regions are then seen as bright {\it emission} sources inhydrogen 21 cm. we make brightness temperature maps of the \hii regions,accounting for radiative coupling with lyman-$\alpha$ photons in a simplifiedmanner. the spin temperature in the relic \hii region is close to the gaskinetic temperature, generally several hundred to several thousand degrees. weshow that the relic \hii region can be as bright as $\delta t_{\rm b} \sim 100$mk in differential temperature against the cosmic microwave background for anangular resolution of sub-arcseconds. while individual early \hii patches willnot be identified by currently planned radio telescopes, the collectivefluctuations from early \hii regions might imprint signatures in the 21 cmbackground.

0911.5198	shaken and stirred: conduction and turbulence in clusters of galaxies	(abridged) uninhibited radiative cooling in clusters of galaxies would leadto excessive mass accretion rates contrary to observations. one of the keyproposals to offset radiative energy losses is thermal conduction from outer,hotter layers of cool core clusters to their centers. however, conduction issensitive to magnetic field topology. in cool-core clusters the heat buoyancyinstability (hbi) leads to b-fields ordered preferentially in the directionperpendicular to that of gravity, which significantly reduces the level ofconduction below the classical spitzer-braginskii value. however, the clustercool cores are rarely in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. sloshing motions dueto minor mergers, galaxy motions or agn can significantly perturb the gas andaffect the level of thermal conduction. we perform 3d amr mhd simulations ofthe effect of turbulence on the properties of the anisotropic thermalconduction in cool core clusters. we show that very weak subsonic motions, wellwithin observational constraints, can randomize the magnetic field andsignificantly boost effective thermal conduction beyond the saturated valuesexpected in the pure unperturbed hbi case. we find that the turbulent motionscan essentially restore the conductive heat flow to the cool core to levelcomparable to the theoretical maximum of 1/3 spitzer for a highly tangledfield. runs with radiative cooling show that the cooling catastrophe can beaverted and the cluster core stabilized. above a critical froude number, thesesame turbulent motions also eliminate the tangential bias in the velocity andmagnetic field that is otherwise induced by the trapped g-modes. our resultscan be tested with future radio polarization measurements, and haveimplications for efficient metal dispersal in clusters.

0911.5554	agn feedback and bimodality in cluster core entropy	we investigate a series of steady-state models of galaxy clusters, in whichthe hot intracluster gas is efficiently heated by active galactic nucleus (agn)feedback and thermal conduction, and in which the mass accretion rates arehighly reduced compared to those predicted by the standard cooling flow models.we perform a global lagrangian stability analysis. we show for the first timethat the global radial instability in cool core clusters can be suppressed bythe agn feedback mechanism, provided that the feedback efficiency exceeds acritical lower limit. furthermore, our analysis naturally shows that theclusters can exist in two distinct forms. globally stable clusters are expectedto have either: 1) cool cores stabilized by both agn feedback and conduction,or 2) non-cool cores stabilized primarily by conduction. intermediate centraltemperatures typically lead to globally unstable solutions. this bimodality isconsistent with the recently observed anticorrelation between the flatness ofthe temperature profiles and the agn activity (dunn &amp; fabian 2008) and theobservation by rafferty et al. (2008) that the shorter central cooling timestend to correspond to significantly younger agn x-ray cavities.

1004.2081	a gravitational lensing explanation for the excess of strong mg-ii  absorbers in grb afterglow spectra	grb afterglows offer a probe of the intergalactic medium out to high redshiftwhich complements observations along more abundant quasar lines-of-sight.although both quasars and grb afterglows should provide a-priori randomsight-lines through the intervening igm, it has been observed that strong mg-iiabsorbers are twice as likely to be found along sight-lines toward grbs.several proposals to reconcile this discrepancy have been put forward, but nonehas been found sufficient to explain the magnitude of the effect. in this paperwe estimate the effect of gravitational lensing by galaxies and theirsurrounding mass distributions on the statistics of mg-ii absorption. we findthat the multi-band magnification bias could be very strong in thespectroscopic grb afterglow population and that gravitational lensing canexplain the discrepancy in density of absorbers, for plausibly steep luminosityfunctions. the model makes the prediction that approximately 20%-60% of thespectroscopic afterglow sample (i.e. ~ 5-15 of 26 sources) would have beenmultiply imaged, and hence result in repeating bursts. we show that despitethis large lensing fraction it is likely that none would yet have beenidentified by chance owing to the finite sky coverage of grb searches. wepredict that continued optical monitoring of the bright grb afterglow locationsin the months and years following the initial decay would lead toidentification of lensed grb afterglows. a confirmation of the lensinghypothesis would allow us to constrain the grb luminosity function down tootherwise inaccessibly faint levels, with potential consequences for grbmodels.

1008.5016	galaxy motions, turbulence and conduction in clusters of galaxies	unopposed radiative cooling in clusters of galaxies results in excessive massdeposition rates. however, the cool cores of galaxy clusters are continuouslyheated by thermal conduction and turbulent heat diffusion due to minor mergersor the galaxies orbiting the cluster center. these processes can either reducethe energy requirements for agn heating of cool cores, or they can preventovercooling altogether. we perform 3d mhd simulations including field-alignedthermal conduction and self-gravitating particles to model this in detail.turbulence is not confined to the wakes of galaxies but is insteadvolume-filling, due to the excitation of large-scale g-modes. we systematicallyprobe the parameter space of galaxy masses and numbers. for a wide range ofobservationally motivated galaxy parameters, the magnetic field is randomizedby stirring motions, restoring the conductive heat flow to the core. thecooling catastrophe either does not occur or it is sufficiently delayed toallow the cluster to experience a major merger that could reset conditions inthe intracluster medium. whilst dissipation of turbulent motions is negligibleas a heat source, turbulent heat diffusion is extremely important; itpredominates in the cluster center. however, thermal conduction becomesimportant at larger radii, and simulations without thermal conduction suffer acooling catastrophe. conduction is important both as a heat source and toreduce stabilizing buoyancy forces, enabling more efficient diffusion.turbulence enables conduction, and conduction enables turbulence. in thesesimulations, the gas vorticity---which is a good indicator of trappedg-modes--increases with time. the vorticity growth is approximately mirrored bythe growth of the magnetic field, which is amplified by turbulence.

1010.2277	cosmological mhd simulations of cluster formation with anisotropic  thermal conduction	(abridged) the icm has been suggested to be buoyantly unstable in thepresence of magnetic field and anisotropic thermal conduction. we perform firstcosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation that simultaneouslyinclude magnetic fields, radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction.in isolated and idealized cluster models, the magnetothermal instability (mti)tends to reorient the magnetic fields radially. using cosmological simulationsof the santa barbara cluster we detect radial bias in the velocity and magneticfields. such radial bias is consistent with either the inhomogeneous radial gasflows due to substructures or residual mti-driven field rearangements that areexpected even in the presence of turbulence. although disentangling the twoscenarios is challenging, we do not detect excess bias in the runs that includeanisotropic thermal conduction. the anisotropy effect is potentially detectablevia radio polarization measurements with lofar and ska and future x-rayspectroscopic studies with the ixo. we demonstrate that radiative coolingboosts the amplification of the magnetic field by about two orders of magnitudebeyond what is expected in the non-radiative cases. at z=0 the field isamplified by a factor of about 10^6 compared to the uniform magnetic fieldevolved due to the universal expansion alone. interestingly, the runs thatinclude both radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction exhibitstronger magnetic field amplification than purely radiative runs at theoff-center locations. in these runs, shallow temperature gradients away fromthe cluster center make the icm neutrally buoyant. the icm is more easily mixedin these regions and the winding up of the frozen-in magnetic field is moreefficient resulting in stronger magnetic field amplification.

1010.4109	systematic effects of foreground removal in 21cm surveys of reionization	it is well-known that foreground subtraction in 21cm surveys removes largescale power. we investigate associated systematic biases. we show that removingline-of-sight fluctuations on large scales aliases into suppression of the 3dpower spectrum across a broad range of scales. this bias can be eliminated bymarginalizing over small k in the 1d power spectrum; however, the unbiasedestimator will have unavoidably larger variance. we also show that gaussianrealizations of the power spectrum permit accurate and extremely rapidmonte-carlo simulations for error analysis; repeated realizations of the fullynon-gaussian field are unnecessary. we perform monte-carlo maximum-likelihoodsimulations of foreground removal which yield unbiased, minimum varianceestimates of the power spectrum in agreement with fisher matrix estimates.foreground removal also distorts the 21cm pdf, reducing the contrast betweenneutral and ionized regions. we show that it is the subtraction of large-scalesmodes which is responsible for this distortion, and that it is less severe inthe earlier stages of reionization. it can be reduced by using largerbandwidths for foreground removal. in the late stages of reionization, thelargest ionized regions (which consist of foreground emission only) providescalibration points which potentially allow recovery of large-scale modes.finally, we also show that: (i) the broad frequency response of synchrotron andfree-free emission will smear out any features in the electron momentumdistribution and ensure spectrally smooth foregrounds; (ii) extragalactic radiorecombination lines should be negligible foregrounds.

1101.1964	on lyman-limit systems and the evolution of the intergalactic ionizing  background	we study the properties of self-shielding intergalactic absorption systemsand their implications for the ionizing background. we find that cosmologicalsimulations post-processed with detailed radiative transfer calculationsgenerally are able to reproduce the observed abundance of lyman-limit systems,and we highlight possible discrepancies between the observations andsimulations. this comparison tests cosmological simulations at overdensities of~100. furthermore, we show that the properties of lyman-limit systems in thesesimulations, in simple semi-analytic arguments, and as suggested by recentobservations indicate that a small change in the ionizing emissivity of thesources would have resulted in a much larger change in the amplitude of theintergalactic hi-ionizing background (with this scaling strengthening withincreasing redshift). this strong scaling could explain the rapid evolution inthe lyman-alpha forest transmission observed at z = 6. our calculations agreewith the suggestion of simpler models that the comoving ionizing emissivity wasconstant or even increasing from z = 3 to 6. our calculations also provide amore rigorous estimate than in previous studies for the clumping factor ofintergalactic gas after reionization, which we estimate was 2 - 3 at z = 6.

1104.4800	intensity mapping with carbon monoxide emission lines and the redshifted  21 cm line	we quantify the prospects for using emission lines from rotationaltransitions of the co molecule to perform an `intensity mapping' observation athigh redshift during the epoch of reionization (eor). the aim of co intensitymapping is to observe the combined co emission from many unresolved galaxies,to measure the spatial fluctuations in this emission, and use this as a tracerof large scale structure at very early times in the history of our universe.this measurement would help determine the properties of molecular clouds -- thesites of star formation -- in the very galaxies that reionize the universe. wefurther consider the possibility of cross-correlating co intensity maps withfuture observations of the redshifted 21 cm line. the cross spectrum is lesssensitive to foreground contamination than the auto power spectra, and cantherefore help confirm the high redshift origin of each signal. furthermore,the cross spectrum measurement would help extract key information about theeor, especially regarding the size distribution of ionized regions. we discussuncertainties in predicting the co signal at high redshift, and discussstrategies for improving these predictions. under favorable assumptions, andfeasible specifications for a co survey mapping the co(2-1) and co(1-0) lines,the power spectrum of co emission fluctuations and its cross spectrum withfuture 21 cm measurements from the mwa are detectable at high significance.

1109.1522	improved models for cosmic infrared background anisotropies: new  constraints on the ir galaxy population	the power spectrum of cosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies issensitive to the connection between star formation and dark matter halos overthe entire cosmic star formation history. here we develop a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos. themodel is based on a parameterized relation between the dust-processed infraredluminosity and (sub)halo mass. by adjusting 3 free parameters, we attempt tosimultaneously fit the 4 frequency bands of the planck measurement of the cibanisotropy power spectrum. to fit the data, we find that the star-formationefficiency must peak on a halo mass scale of ~ 5x10^12 solar mass and theinfrared luminosity per unit mass must increase rapidly with redshift. bycomparing our predictions with a well-calibrated phenomenological model forshot noise, and with a direct observation of source counts, we show that themean duty cycle of the underlying infrared sources must be near unity,indicating that the cib is dominated by long-lived quiescent star formation,rather than intermittent short "star bursts". despite the improved flexibilityof our model, the best simultaneous fit to all four planck channels remainsrelatively poor. we discuss possible further extensions to alleviate theremaining tension with the data. our model presents a theoretical framework fora future joint analysis of both background anisotropy and source countmeasurements.

1110.0834	the fermi bubbles. ii. the potential roles of viscosity and cosmic ray  diffusion in jet models	the origin of the fermi bubbles recently detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope in the inner galaxy is mysterious. in the companion paper guo &amp;mathews (paper i), we use hydrodynamic simulations to show that they could beproduced by a recent powerful agn jet event. here we further explore thisscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (cr)diffusion on the morphology and cr distribution of the bubbles. we show thateven a relatively low level of viscosity (\mu_{visc} &gt;~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or~0.1% - 1% of braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppressthe development of kelvin-helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,resulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. furthermore, viscosity reducescirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix thecr-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. thusviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored cr distribution, an importantingredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightnessdistribution. generically, such a cr distribution often produces alimb-brightened gamma-ray intensity distribution. however, we show that byincorporating cr diffusion which is strongly suppressed across the bubblesurface (as inferred from sharp bubble edges) but is close to canonical valuesin the bubble interior, we obtain a reasonably flat gamma-ray intensityprofile. the similarity of the resulting cr bubble with the observed fermibubbles strengthens our previous result in paper i that the fermi bubbles wereproduced by a recent agn jet event. studies of the nearby fermi bubbles mayprovide a unique opportunity to study the potential roles of plasma viscosityand cr diffusion on the evolution of agn jets and bubbles.

0711.0751	inhomogeneous helium reionization and the equation of state of the  intergalactic medium	the temperature of the intergalactic medium (igm) is set by the competitionbetween photoheating and adiabatic cooling, which are usually assumed to definea tight equation of state in which the temperature increases monotonically withdensity. we use a semi-analytic model, accurate at low to moderate igmdensities (&lt;5 times the mean), to show that inhomogeneous reionization cansubstantially modify these expectations. because reionization is driven bybiased sources, dense pockets of the igm are likely to be ionized first. as aresult, voids initially remain cool while dense regions are heatedsubstantially. however, near the end of reionization, dense regions havealready cooled from their initially large temperature while voids have onlyjust been heated. thus, near the end of helium reionization the equation ofstate can invert itself, with the hottest gas inside voids. the degree to whichthis happens depends on the magnitude of the density bias during reionization:if rare, bright sources dominate reionization, so that each ionized regioncontains a typical volume of the igm, the equation of state will remainmonotonic. we also show that the distribution of temperatures at a fixeddensity has significant scatter and evolves rapidly throughout and even afterreionization. finally, we show that the observed temperature jump at z ~3.2 isconsistent with the behavior at the end of helium reionization, although itrequires a somewhat larger temperature increase than expected.

1204.6058	probing gas motions in the intra-cluster medium: a mixture model  approach	upcoming high spectral resolution telescopes, particularly astro-h, areexpected to finally deliver firm quantitative constraints on turbulence in theintra-cluster medium (icm). we develop a new spectral analysis technique whichexploits not just the line width but the entire line shape, and show how theexcellent spectral resolution of astro-h can overcome its relatively poorspatial resolution in making detailed infer- ences about the velocity field.the spectrum is decomposed into distinct components, which can bequantitatively analyzed using gaussian mixture models. for instance, bulk flowsand sloshing produce components with offset means, while partial volume-filling turbulence from agn or galaxy stirring leads to components withdifferent widths. the offset between components allows us to measure gas bulkmotions and separate them from small-scale turbulence, while componentfractions and widths con- strain the emission weighted volume and turbulentenergy density in each component. we apply mixture modeling to a series ofanalytic toy models as well as numerical simu- lations of clusters with coldfronts and agn feedback respectively. from markov chain monte carlo and fishermatrix estimates which include line blending and continuum contamination, weshow that the mixture parameters can be accurately constrained with astro-hspectra: at a \sim 10% level when components differ significantly in width, anda \sim 1% level when they differ significantly in mean value. we also studyerror scalings and use information criteria to determine when a mixture modelis preferred. mixture modeling of spectra is a powerful technique which ispotentially applicable to other astrophysical scenarios.

0711.1542	the history and morphology of helium reionization	a variety of observations now indicate that intergalactic helium was fullyionized by z~3. the most recent measurements of the high-redshift quasarluminosity function imply that these sources had produced ~2.5 ionizing photonsper helium atom by that time, consistent with a picture in which the knownquasar population drives heii reionization. here we describe the distributionof ionized and neutral helium gas during this era. because the sources wererare and bright (with the photon budget dominated by quasars with luminositiesl&gt;l_\star), random fluctuations in the quasar population determined themorphology of ionized gas when the global ionized fraction x_i was small, withthe typical radius r_c of a heiii bubble ~15-20 comoving mpc. only when x_i&gt;0.5did the large-scale clustering of the quasars drive the characteristic size ofionized regions above this value. still later, when x_i&gt;0.75, most ionizingphotons were consumed by dense, recombining systems before they reached theedge of their source's ionized surroundings, halting the bubble growth whenr_c~35-40 mpc. these phases are qualitatively similar to those in hydrogenreionization, but the rarity of the sources makes the early stochastic phasemuch more important. moreover, the well-known characteristics of the z=3intergalactic medium allow a much more robust description of the late phase inwhich recombinations dominate.

1209.2489	gas clumping in self-consistent reionisation models	we use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations including aself-consistent treatment for inhomogeneous reionisation to study the impact ofgalactic outflows and photoionisation heating on the volume-averagedrecombination rate of the intergalactic medium (igm). by incorporating anevolving ionising escape fraction and a treatment for self-shielding withinlyman limit systems, we have run the first simulations of "photon-starved"reionisation scenarios that simultaneously reproduce observations of theabundance of galaxies, the optical depth to electron scattering of cosmicmicrowave background photons \tau, and the effective optical depth tolyman\alpha absorption at z=5. we confirm that an ionising background reducesthe clumping factor c by more than 50% by smoothing moderately-overdense(\delta=1--100) regions. meanwhile, outflows increase clumping only modestly.the clumping factor of ionised gas is much lower than the overall baryonicclumping factor because the most overdense gas is self-shielded.photoionisation heating further suppresses recombinations if reionisation heatsgas above the canonical 10,000 k. accounting for both effects within our mostrealistic simulation, c rises from &lt;1 at z&gt;10 to 3.3 at z=6. we show thatincorporating temperature- and ionisation-corrected clumping factors into ananalytical reionisation model reproduces the numerical simulation's \tau towithin 10%. finally, we explore how many ionising photons are absorbed duringthe process of heating filaments by considering the overall photon cost ofreionisation in analytical models that assume that the igm is heated atdifferent redshifts. for reionisation redshifts of 9--10, cold filaments boostthe reionisation photon budget by ~1 photon per hydrogen atom.

1211.2375	disentangling resonant scattering and gas motions in galaxy cluster  emission line profiles	future high spectral resolution telescopes will enable us to place tightconstraints on turbulence in the intra-cluster medium through the line widthsof strong emission lines. at the same time, these bright lines are the mostprone to be optically thick. this requires us to separate the effects ofresonant scattering from turbulence, both of which could broaden the lines. howthis can be achieved has yet not been quantitatively addressed. in this paper,we propose a flexible new parametrization for the line profile, which allowsthese effects to be distinguished. the model has only 3 free parameters, whichwe calibrate with monte-carlo radiative transfer simulations. we providefitting functions and tables that allow the results of these calculations to beeasily incorporated into a fast spectral fitting package. in a mock spectralfit, we explicitly show that this parameterization allows us to correctlyestimate the turbulent amplitude and metallicity of a cluster such as perseus,which would otherwise give significantly biased results. we also show how thephysical origin of the line shape can be understood analytically.

1301.3130	chaotic cold accretion onto black holes	using 3d amr simulations, linking the 50 kpc to the sub-pc scales over thecourse of 40 myr, we systematically relax the classic bondi assumptions in atypical galaxy hosting a smbh. in the realistic scenario, where the hot gas iscooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate isboosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with the bondi prediction. thecause is the nonlinear growth of thermal instabilities, leading to thecondensation of cold clouds and filaments when t_cool/t_ff &lt; 10. subsonicturbulence of just over 100 km/s (m &gt; 0.2) induces the formation of thermalinstabilities, even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regimeturbulent dissipation inhibits their growth (t_turb/t_cool &lt; 1). when heatingrestores global thermodynamic balance, the formation of the multiphase mediumis violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. the recurrentcollisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpytorus promote angular momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. onsub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel. a goodapproximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which can be used assubgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required bycosmological simulations, while accounting for fluctuations. chaotic coldaccretion may be common in many systems, such as hot galactic halos, groups,and clusters, generating high-velocity clouds and strong variations of the agnluminosity and jet orientation. in this mode, the black hole can quickly reactto the state of the entire host galaxy, leading to efficient self-regulated agnfeedback and the symbiotic magorrian relation. during phases of overheating,the hot mode becomes the single channel of accretion (with a different cuspytemperature profile), though strongly suppressed by turbulence.

1301.5644	giant radio relics in galaxy clusters: reacceleration of fossil  relativistic electrons?	many bright radio relics in the outskirts of galaxy clusters have lowinferred mach numbers, defying expectations from shock acceleration theory andheliospheric observations that the injection efficiency of relativisticparticles plummets at low mach numbers. with a suite of cosmologicalsimulations, we follow the diffusive shock acceleration as well as radiativeand coulomb cooling of cosmic ray electrons during the assembly of a cluster.we find a substantial population of fossil electrons. when reaccelerated at ashock (through diffusive shock acceleration), they are competitive with directinjection at strong shocks and overwhelmingly dominate by many orders ofmagnitude at weak shocks, mach &lt; 3, which are the vast majority at the clusterperiphery. their relative importance depends on cooling physics and is robustto the shock acceleration model used. while the abundance of fossils can varyby a factor of ~10, the typical reaccelerated fossil population has radiobrightness in excellent agreement with observations. fossil electrons with 1 &lt;gamma &lt; 100 (10 &lt; gamma &lt; 10^4) provide the main seeds for reacceleration atstrong (weak) shocks; we show that these are well-resolved by our simulation.we construct a simple self-similar analytic model which assumes steady recentinjection and cooling. it agrees well with our simulations, allowing rapidestimates and physical insight into the shape of the distribution function. wepredict that lofar should find many more bright steep-spectrum radio relics,which are inconsistent with direct injection. a failure to take fossil cosmicray electrons into account will lead to erroneous conclusions about the natureof particle acceleration at weak shocks; they arise from well-understoodphysical processes and cannot be ignored.

1305.4768	the host halos of oi absorbers in the reionization epoch	we use a radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the hydrogen reionization epochto study oi absorbers at z~6. the intergalactic medium (igm) is reionizedbefore it is enriched, hence oi absorption originates within dark matter halos.the predicted abundance of oi absorbers is in reasonable agreement withobservations. at z=10, roughly 70% of sightlines through atomically-cooledhalos encounter a visible (n_oi &gt; 10^14 cm^-2) column. reionization ionizes andremoves gas from halos less massive than 10^8.4 m_0, but 20% of sightlinesthrough more massive halos encounter visible columns even at z=5. the massscale of absorber host halos is 10-100 times smaller than the halos of lymanbreak galaxies and lyman-alpha emitters, hence absorption probes the dominantionizing sources more directly. oi absorbers have neutral hydrogen columns of10^19-10^21 cm^-2, suggesting a close resemblance between objects selected inoi and hi absorption. finally, the absorption in the foreground of the z=7.085quasar ulasj1120+0641 cannot originate in a dark matter halo because halo gasat the observed hi column density is enriched enough to violate the upperlimits on the oi column. by contrast, gas at less than one third the cosmicmean density satisfies the constraints. hence the foreground absorption likelyoriginates in the igm.

0803.3454	fossil ionized bubbles around dead quasars during reionization	one of the most dramatic signatures of the reionization era may be theenormous ionized bubbles around luminous quasars (with radii reaching ~40comoving mpc), which may survive as "fossil'' ionized regions long after theirsource shuts off. here we study how the inhomogeneous intergalactic medium(igm) evolves inside such fossils. the average recombination rate declinesrapidly with time, and the brief quasar episode significantly increases themean free path inside the fossil bubbles. as a result, even a weak ionizingbackground generated by galaxies inside the fossil can maintain it in arelatively highly and uniformly ionized state. for example, galaxies that wouldionize 20-30% of hydrogen in a random patch of the igm can maintain 80-90%ionization inside the fossil, for a duration much longer than the averagerecombination time in the igm. quasar fossils at z&lt;10 thus retain theiridentity for nearly a hubble time, and will appear "gray,'' distinct from boththe average igm (which has a "swiss-cheese" ionization topology and a lowermean ionized fraction), and from fully-ionized bubbles around active quasars.more distant fossils, at z&gt;10 have a weaker galaxy-generated ionizingbackground and a higher gas density, so they can attain a swiss-cheese topologysimilar to the rest of the igm, but with a smaller contrast between the ionizedbubbles and the partially neutral regions separating them. analogousheiii-fossils should exist around the epoch of heii/heiii reionization at z~3,although rapid recombinations inside the heiii-fossils will be more common. ourmodel of inhomogeneous recombination also applies to "double reionization''models and shows that a non-monotonic reionization history is even moreunlikely than previously thought.

1410.2249	the flatness and sudden evolution of the intergalactic ionizing  background	the ionizing background of cosmic hydrogen is an important probe of thesources and absorbers of ionizing radiation in the post-reionization universe.previous studies show that the ionization rate should be very sensitive tochanges in the source population: as the emissivity rises, absorbers shrink insize, increasing the ionizing mean free path and, hence, the ionizingbackground. by contrast, observations of the ionizing background find a veryflat evolution from z~2-5, before falling precipitously at z~6. we resolve thispuzzling discrepancy by pointing out that, at z~2-5, optically thick absorbersare associated with the same collapsed halos that host ionizing sources. thus,an increasing abundance of galaxies is compensated for by a correspondingincrease in the absorber population, which moderates the instability in theionizing background. however, by z~5-6, gas outside of halos dominates theabsorption, the coupling between sources and absorbers is lost, and theionizing background evolves rapidly. our halo based model reproducesobservations of the ionizing background, its flatness and sudden decline, aswell as the redshift evolution of the ionizing mean free path. our worksuggests that, through much of their history, both star formation andphotoelectric opacity in the universe track halo growth.

1412.3845	constraining very high mass population iii stars through he ii emission  in galaxy bdf-521 at z = 7.01	numerous theoretical models have long proposed that a strong he ii 1640emission line is the most prominent and unique feature of massive populationiii (pop iii) stars in high redshift galaxies. the he ii 1640 line strength canconstrain the mass and imf of pop iii stars. we use f132n narrowband filter onthe hubble space telescope's (hst) wide field camera 3 (wfc3) to look forstrong he ii lambda 1640 emission in the galaxy bdf-521 at z=7.01, one of themost distant spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies to date. using deep f132nnarrowband imaging, together with our broadband imaging with f125w and f160wfilters, we do not detect he ii emission from this galaxy, but place a 2-sigmaupper limit on the flux of 5.3x10^-19 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. this measurementcorresponds to a 2-sigma upper limit on the pop iii star formation rate(sfr_popiii) of ~ 0.2 m_solar yr^-1, assuming a salpeter imf with 50&lt; m/m_solar&lt; 1000. from the high signal-to-noise broadband measurements in f125w andf160w, we fit the uv continuum for bdf-521. the spectral flux density is ~ 3.6x10^-11 lambda^-2.32 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 a^-1, which corresponds to an overallunobscured sfr of ~ 5 m_solar yr^-1. our upper limit on sfr_popiii suggeststhat massive pop iii stars represent &lt; 4% of the total star formation. further,the hst high resolution imaging suggests that bdf-521 is an extremely compactgalaxy, with a half-light radius of 0.6 kpc.

0804.3823	a global stability analysis of clusters of galaxies with conduction and  agn feedback heating	we investigate a series of steady-state models of galaxy clusters, in whichthe hot intracluster gas is efficiently heated by active galactic nucleus (agn)feedback and thermal conduction, and in which the mass accretion rates arehighly reduced compared to those predicted by the standard cooling flow models.we perform a global lagrangian stability analysis. we show for the first timethat the global radial instability in cool core clusters can be suppressed bythe agn feedback mechanism, provided that the feedback efficiency exceeds acritical lower limit. furthermore, our analysis naturally shows that theclusters can exist in two distinct forms. globally stable clusters are expectedto have either: 1) cool cores stabilized by both agn feedback and conduction,or 2) non-cool cores stabilized primarily by conduction. intermediate centraltemperatures typically lead to globally unstable solutions. this bimodality isconsistent with the recently observed anticorrelation between the flatness ofthe temperature profiles and the agn activity (dunn &amp; fabian 2008) and theobservation by rafferty et al.

1503.07870	turbulence and particle acceleration in giant radio halos: the origin of  seed electrons	about 1/3 of x-ray-luminous clusters show smooth, unpolarized radio emissionon ~mpc scales, known as giant radio halos. one promising model for radio halosis fermi-ii acceleration of seed relativistic electrons by turbulence of theintracluster medium (icm); coulomb losses prohibit acceleration from thethermal pool. however, the origin of seed electrons has never been fullyexplored. here, we integrate the fokker-planck equation of the cosmic ray (cr)electron and proton distributions in a cosmological simulations of clusterformation. for standard assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seedelectron population which produces too centrally concentrated radio emission.instead, we present three realistic scenarios that each can reproduce thespatially flat radio emission observed in the coma cluster: (1) the ratio ofinjected turbulent energy density to thermal energy density increasesignificantly with radius, as seen in cosmological simulations. this generatesa flat radio profile even if the seed population of crs is steep with radius.(2) self-confinement of energetic cr protons can be inefficient, and cr protonsmay stream at the alfven speed to the cluster outskirts when the icm isrelatively quiescent. a spatially flat cr proton distribution develops andproduces the required population of secondary seed electrons. (3) the cr protonto electron acceleration efficiency k_ep ~ 0.1 is assumed to be larger than inour galaxy (k_ep ~ 0.01), due to the magnetic geometry at the shock. theresulting primary electron population dominates. due to their weaker densitydependence compared to secondary electrons, these primaries can also reproduceradio observations. these competing non-trivial solutions provide incisiveprobes of non thermal processes in the high-beta icm.

1510.00397	the [cii] deficit in lirgs and ulirgs is due to high-temperature  saturation	current predictions for the line ratios from photo-dissociative regions(pdrs) in galaxies adopt theoretical models that consider only individualparcels of pdr gas each characterized by the local density and far-uv radiationfield. however, these quantities are not measured directly from unresolvedgalaxies, making the connection between theory and observation ambiguous. wedevelop a model that uses galaxy-averaged, observable inputs to explain andpredict measurements of the [cii] fine structure line in luminous andultra-luminous infrared galaxies. we find that the [cii] deficit observed inthe highest ir surface-brightness systems is a natural consequence ofsaturating the upper fine-structure transition state at gas temperatures above91 k. to reproduce the measured amplitude of the [cii]/fir ratio in deficitgalaxies, we require that [cii] trace approximately 10-17% of all gas in thesesystems, roughly independent of ir surface brightness and consistent withobserved [cii] to co(1--0) line ratios. calculating the value of this fractionis a challenge for theoretical models. the difficulty may reside in properlytreating the topology of molecular and dissociated gas, different descriptionsfor which may be observationally distinguished by the [oi]63 micron line inyet-to-be-probed regions of parameter space, allowing pdr emission lines fromto probe not only the effects of star formation but also the state andconfiguration of interstellar gas.

1511.01506	the distribution of bubble sizes during reionization	a key physical quantity during reionization is the size of hii regions.previous studies found a characteristic bubble size which increases rapidlyduring reionization, with apparent agreement between simulations and analyticexcursion set theory. using four different methods, we critically examine thisclaim. in particular, we introduce the use of the watershed algorithm -- widelyused for void finding in galaxy surveys -- which we show to be an unbiasedmethod with the lowest dispersion and best performance on monte-carlorealizations of a known bubble size pdf. we find that a friends-of-friendsalgorithm declares most of the ionized volume to be occupied by a network ofvolume-filling regions connected by narrow tunnels. for methods tuned to detectthose volume-filling regions, previous apparent agreement between simulationsand theory is spurious, and due to a failure to correctly account for thewindow function of measurement schemes. the discrepancy is already obvious fromvisual inspection. instead, hii regions in simulations are significantly larger(by factors of 10-1000 in volume) than analytic predictions. the size pdf isnarrower, and evolves more slowly with time, than predicted. it becomes moresharply peaked as reionization progresses. these effects are likely caused bybubble mergers, which are inadequately modeled by analytic theory. our resultshave important consequences for high-redshift 21cm observations, the mean freepath of ionizing photons, and the visibility of ly-alpha emitters, and point toa fundamental failure in our understanding of the characteristic scales of thereionization process.

0807.2447	photo-heating and the fate of hard photons during the reionisation of  heii by quasars	we use a combination of analytic and numerical arguments to consider theimpact of quasar photo-heating during heii reionisation on the thermalevolution of the intergalactic medium (igm). we demonstrate that rapid (\deltaz&lt; 0.1-0.2), strong (\delta t &gt; 10^4 k) photo-heating is difficult to achieveacross the entire igm unless quasar spectra are significantly harder thanimplied by current observational constraints. although filtering of intrinsicquasar radiation through dense regions in the igm does increase the mean excessenergy per heii photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity andlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervalsshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. moreover, the hard photonsresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energyinside dense clumps. the abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain andmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heatingrates. nevertheless, although some of the igm may be exposed to a hardened andweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the igm must instead bereionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modestheating rates (\delta t &lt; 10^4 k). the repeated ionisation of fossil quasarheiii regions does not increase the net heating because the recombination timesin these regions typically exceed the igm cooling times and the average timelag between successive rounds of quasar activity. detailed line-of-sightradiative transfer simulations confirm these expectations and predict a richthermal structure in the igm during heii reionisation.

astro-ph;0005262	reionization by hard photons: i. x-rays from the first star clusters	observations of the ly-alpha forest at z~3 reveal an average metallicityz~0.01 z_solar. the high-redshift supernovae that polluted the igm alsoaccelerated relativistic electrons. since the energy density of the cmb scalesas (1+z)^4, at high redshift these electrons cool via inverse comptonscattering. thus, the first star clusters emit x-rays. unlike stellar uvionizing photons, these x-rays can escape easily from their host galaxies. thishas a number of important physical consequences: (i) due to their large meanfree path, these x-rays can quickly establish a universal ionizing backgroundand partially reionize the universe in a gradual, homogeneous fashion. ifx-rays formed the dominant ionizing background, the universe would have moreclosely resembled a single-phase medium, rather than a two-phase medium. (ii)x-rays can reheat the universe to higher temperatures than possible with uvradiation. (iii) x-rays counter the tendency of uv radiation tophoto-dissociate h2, an important coolant in the early universe, by promotinggas phase h2 formation. the x-ray production efficiency is calibrated to localobservations of starburst galaxies, which imply that ~10% of the supernovaenergy is converted to x-rays. while direct detection of sources in x-rayemission is difficult, the presence of relativistic electrons at high redshiftand thus a minimal level of x-ray emission may be inferred by synchrotronemission observations with the square kilometer array. these sources mayconstitute a significant fraction of the unresolved hard x-ray background, andcan account for both the shape and amplitude of the gamma-ray background. thispaper discusses the existence and observability of high-redshift x-ray sources,while a companion paper models the detailed reionization physics and chemistry.

astro-ph;0005263	probing high redshift radiation fields with gamma-ray absorption	the next generation of gamma-ray telescopes may be able to observe gamma-rayblazars at high redshift, possibly out to the epoch of reionization. thespectrum of such sources should exhibit an absorption edge due topair-production against uv photons along the line of sight. one expects a sharpdrop in the number density of uv photons at the lyman edge e_{l}. this impliesthat the universe becomes transparent after gamma-ray photons redshift below e(m_{e}c^2)^{2}/e_{l} 18 gev. thus, there is only a limited redshift intervalover which gev photons can pair produce. this implies that any observedabsorption will probe radiation fields in the very early universe, regardlessof the subsequent star formation history of the universe. furthermore,measurements of differential absorption between blazars at different redshiftscan cleanly isolate the opacity due to uv emissivity at high redshift. anobservable absorption edge should be present for most reasonable radiationfields with sufficient energy to reionize the universe. ly-alpha photons mayprovide an important component of the pair-production opacity. observations ofa number of blazars at different redshifts will thus allow us to probe the risein comoving uv emissivity with time.

astro-ph;0108071	second-generation objects in the universe: radiative cooling and  collapse of halos with virial temperatures above 10^4 kelvin	the first generation of protogalaxies likely formed out of primordial gas viah2-cooling in cosmological minihalos with virial temperatures of a few 1000k.however, their abundance is likely to have been severely limited by feedbackprocesses which suppressed h2 formation. the formation of the protogalaxiesresponsible for reionization and metal-enrichment of the intergalactic medium,then had to await the collapse of larger halos. here we investigate theradiative cooling and collapse of gas in halos with virial temperatures tvir &gt;10^4k. in these halos, efficient atomic line radiation allows rapid cooling ofthe gas to 8000 k; subsequently the gas can contract nearly isothermally atthis temperature. without an additional coolant, the gas would likely settleinto a locally gravitationally stable disk; only disks with unusually low spinwould be unstable. however, we find that the initial atomic line cooling leavesa large, out-of-equilibrium residual free electron fraction. this allows themolecular fraction to build up to a universal value of about x(h2) = 10^-3,almost independently of initial density and temperature. we show that this is anon--equilibrium freezeout value that can be understood in terms of timescalearguments. furthermore, unlike in less massive halos, h2 formation is largelyimpervious to feedback from external uv fields, due to the high initialdensities achieved by atomic cooling. the h2 molecules cool the gas further toabout 100k, and allow the gas to fragment on scales of a few 100 msun. weinvestigate the importance of various feedback effects such ash2-photodissociation from internal uv fields and radiation pressure due toly-alpha photon trapping, which are likely to regulate the efficiency of starformation.

astro-ph;0201517	probing the dark ages with metal absorption lines	recent observations of high redshift quasars at z~6 have finally revealedcomplete gunn-peterson absorption. however, this at best constrains thevolume-weighted and mass-weighted hydrogen neutral fractions to be greater than10^-3 and 10^-2 respectively; stronger constraints are not possible due to thehigh optical depth for hydrogen lyman transitions. here i suggest certain metallines as tracers of the hydrogen neutral fraction. these lines should causeunsaturated absorption when the igm is almost fully neutral, if it is pollutedto metallicities z ~ 10^-3.5--10^-2.5 z_solar. such a minimal level of metalpollution is inevitable in the middle to late stages of reionization unlessquasars rather than stars are the dominant source of ionizing photons. the oiline at 1302 angstroms is particularly promising: the oi and h ionizationpotentials are almost identical, and oi should be in very tight charge exchangeequilibrium with h. the siii 1260 angstrom transition might also be observable.at high redshift, overdense regions are the first to be polluted to highmetallicity but the last to remain permanently ionized, due to the shortrecombination times. such regions should produce a fluctuating oi and siiiforest which, if observed, would indicate large quantities of neutral hydrogen.the oi forest may already be detectable in the sdss z=6.28 quasar. if seen infuture high-redshift quasars, the oi and siii forests will probe the topologyof reionization and metal pollution in the early universe. if in additional thehi optical depth can be measured from the damping wing of a high-redshiftgamma-ray burst, they will yield a very robust measure of the metallicity ofthe high-redshift universe.

astro-ph;0212309	entropy injection as a global feedback mechanism	both preheating of the intergalactic medium and radiative cooling of lowentropy gas have been proposed to explain the deviation from self-similarity inthe cluster l_x-t_x relation and the observed entropy floor in these systems.however, severe overcooling of gas in groups is necessary for radiative coolingalone to explain the observations. non-gravitational entropy injection musttherefore still be important in these systems. we point out that on scales ofgroups and below, gas heated to the required entropy floor cannot cool in ahubble time, regardless of its subsequent adiabatic compression. preheatingtherefore shuts off the gas supply to galaxies, and should be an importantglobal feedback mechanism for galaxy formation. constraints on global gascooling can be placed from the joint evolution of the comoving star formationrate and neutral gas density. preheating at high redshift can be ruled out;however the data does not rule out passive gas consumption without inflow sincez~2. since for preheated gas t_cool &gt; t_dyn, we speculate that preheating couldplay a role in determining the hubble sequence: at a given mass scale, highsigma peaks in the density field collapse early to form ellipticals, while lowsigma peaks collapse late and quiescently accrete preheated gas to formspirals. the entropy produced by large scale shock-heating of the intergalaticmedium is significant only at late times, z&lt;1, and cannot produce theseeffects.

astro-ph;0307135	fossil hii regions: self-limiting star formation at high redshift	recent results by the wmap satellite suggest that the intergalactic mediumwas significantly reionized at redshifts as high as z~17. at this early epoch,the first ionizing sources likely appeared in the shallow potential wells ofmini-halos with virial temperatures t &lt; 10^4 k. once such an ionizing sourceturns off, its surrounding hii region compton cools and recombines.nonetheless, we show that the ``fossil'' hii regions left behind remain at highadiabats, prohibiting gas accretion and cooling in subsequent generations ofmini-halos. thus, early star formation is self-limiting. we quantify thiseffect to show that star formation in mini-halos cannot account for the bulk ofthe electron scattering opacity measured by wmap, which must be due to moremassive objects. we argue that gas entropy, rather than igm metallicity,regulates the evolution of the global ionizing emissivity, and impedes fullreionization until lower redshifts. we discuss several important consequencesof this early entropy floor for reionization. it reduces gas clumping,curtailing the required photon budget for reionization. an entropy floor alsoprevents h2 formation and cooling, due to reduced gas densities: it greatlyenhances feedback from uv photodissociation of h2. an early x-ray backgroundwould also furnish an entropy floor to the entire igm; thus, x-rays impederather than enhance h2 formation. future 21cm observations may probe thetopology of fossil hii regions.

astro-ph;0505065	taxing the rich: recombinations and bubble growth during reionization	reionization is inhomogeneous for two reasons: the clumpiness of theintergalactic medium (igm) and clustering of the discrete ionizing sources.while numerical simulations can in principle take both into account, they areat present limited by small box sizes. on the other hand, analytic models haveonly examined the limiting cases of a clumpy igm (with uniform ionizingemissivity) and clustered sources (embedded in a uniform igm). here, we presentan analytic model for the evolving topology of reionization that includes bothfactors. at first, recombinations can be ignored and ionized bubbles growprimarily through major mergers. as a result, reionization resembles"punctuated equilibrium," with a series of well-separated sharp jumps in theionizing background. these features are local effects and do not reflectsimilar jumps in the global ionized fraction. we then combine our bubble modelwith a simple description of recombinations in the igm. we show that thebubbles stop growing when recombinations balance ionizations. if the igmdensity structure is similar to that at moderate redshifts, this limits thebubble radii to ~20 comoving mpc; however, it may be much smaller if the igm issignificantly clumpier at higher redshifts. once a bubble reaches saturation,that region of the universe has for all intents and purposes entered the"post-overlap" stage, so the overlap epoch actually has a finite width. thispicture naturally explains the substantial large-scale variation inlyman-series opacity along the lines of sight to the known z&gt;6 quasars. morequasar spectra will shed light on the transition between the "bubble-dominated"topology characteristic of reionization and the "web-dominated" topologycharacteristic of the later universe.

astro-ph;0512427	have we detected patchy reionization in quasar spectra?	the lyman-alpha forest at z &gt;~ 5.5 shows strong scatter in the meantransmission even when smoothed over very large spatial scales, &gt;~ 50 mpc/h.this has been interpreted as a signature of strongly fluctuating radiationfields, or patchy reionization. to test this claim, we calculate the scatterarising solely from density fluctuations, with a uniform ionizing background,using analytic arguments and simulations. this scatter alone is comparable tothat observed. it rises steeply with redshift and is of order unity by z ~ 6,even on ~ 50 mpc/h scales. this arises because: i) at z ~ 6, transmissionspectra, which are sensitive mainly to rare voids, are highly biased (with alinear bias factor b &gt;~ 4-5) tracers of underlying density fluctuations, andii) projected power from small-scale transverse modes is aliased to longwavelength line-of-sight modes. inferring patchy reionization from quasarspectra is therefore subtle and requires much more detailed modeling.similarly, we expect order unity transmission fluctuations in the z ~ 3 heiilyman-alpha forest from density fluctuations alone, on the scales over whichthese measurements are typically made.

astro-ph;0601527	model atmospheres for irradiated giant stars: implications for the  galactic center	irradiation of a stellar atmosphere by an external source (e.g. an agn)changes its structure and therefore its spectrum. using a state-of-the-artstellar atmosphere code, we calculate the infrared spectra of such irradiatedand transformed stars. we show that the original spectrum of the star, which isdominated by molecular bands, changes dramatically when irradiated even by alow-luminosity agn ($l_{\rm x} = 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$), becoming dominated byatomic lines in absorption. we study the changes in the spectrum of low-masscarbon- and oxygen-rich giant stars as they are irradiated by a modest agn,similar to the one at the galactic center (gc). the resulting spectra aresimilar to those of the faintest s-cluster stars observed in the gc. thespectrum of a star irradiated by a much brighter agn, like that powered by atidally disrupted star, is very different from that of any star currentlyobserved near the gc. for the first time we have discovered that the structureof the atmosphere of an irradiated giant changes dramatically and induces adouble inversion layer. we show that irradiation at the current level canexplain the observed trend of co band intensities decreasing as a function ofincreasing proximity to sg $a^{*}$. this may indicate that (contrary toprevious claims) there is no paucity of old giants in the gc, which coexistsimultaneously with young massive stars.

0809.1271	the impact of hi in galaxies on 21-cm intensity fluctuations during the  reionisation epoch	we investigate the impact of neutral hydrogen (hi) in galaxies on thestatistics of 21-cm fluctuations using analytic and semi-numerical modelling.following the reionisation of hydrogen the hi content of the universe isdominated by damped absorption systems (dlas), with a cosmic density in hi thatis observed to be constant at a level equal to ~2% of the cosmic baryon densityfrom z~1 to z~5. we show that extrapolation of this constant fraction into thereionisation epoch results in a reduction of 10-20% in the amplitude of 21-cmfluctuations over a range of spatial scales. the assumption of a differentpercentage during the reionisation era results in a proportional change in the21-cm fluctuation amplitude. we find that consideration of hi in galaxies/dlasreduces the prominence of the hii region induced shoulder in the 21-cm powerspectrum (ps), and hence modifies the scale dependence of 21-cm fluctuations.we also estimate the 21cm-galaxy cross ps, and show that the cross ps changessign on scales corresponding to the hii regions. from consideration of thesensitivity for forthcoming low-frequency arrays we find that the effects of hiin galaxies/dlas on the statistics of 21-cm fluctuations will be significantwith respect to the precision of a ps or cross ps measurement. in addition,since overdense regions are reionised first we demonstrate that thecross-correlation between galaxies and 21-cm emission changes sign at the endof the reionisation era, providing an alternative avenue to pinpoint the end ofreionisation. the sum of our analysis indicates that the hi content of thegalaxies that reionise the universe will need to be considered in detailedmodelling of the 21-cm intensity ps in order to correctly interpretmeasurements from forthcoming low-frequency arrays.

astro-ph;0604080	redshifted 21 centimeter emission from minihalos before reionization	before reionization, the intergalactic medium (igm) may have beensufficiently cold for low-mass "minihalos" to condense out of the gas andsubsequently affect reionization. previous work has shown that minihalosgenerate reasonably large 21 cm fluctuations. here we consider this signal inits proper cosmological context and show that isolating minihalos from the restof the igm is extremely difficult. using the well-known halo model, we computethe power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations from minihalos and show that thesignal decreases rapidly as feedback increases the jeans mass. we then showthat even a small lyman-alpha background increases the 21 cm fluctuations ofthe diffuse igm well beyond those of the minihalos; because the mass fractionin the igm is much larger, minihalos will lie buried within the igm signal. thedistinctive signatures of non-linear bias and minihalo structure emerge only atmuch smaller scales, well beyond the resolution of any upcoming instruments.using simple, but representative, reionization histories, we then show that therequired lyman-alpha background level is most likely achieved at z&gt;15, whileminihalos are still rare, so that they are almost always degenerate with thediffuse igm.

astro-ph;0604218	feedback from clustered sources during reionization	the reionization history of the intergalactic medium (igm) at high redshift(z &gt; 6) was likely strongly shaped by several global feedback processes.because the earliest ionizing sources formed at the locations of the raredensity peaks, their spatial distribution was strongly clustered. here wedemonstrate that this clustering significantly boosts the impact of feedbackprocesses operating at high redshift. we build a semi-analytical model toinclude feedback and clustering simultaneously, and apply this model to thesuppression of star-formation in minihalos due to photoionization. the model isbuilt on the excursion-set-based formalism of furlanetto, zaldarriaga andhernquist (2004), which incorporates the clustering of ionizing sources, andwhich we here extend to include suppression of star formation in minihalos. wefind that clustering increases the mean hii bubble size by a factor of several,and it dramatically increases the fraction of minihalos that are suppressed, bya factor of up to 60 relative to a randomly distributed population. thisenhanced suppression can significantly reduce the electron scattering opticaldepth, as required by the three-year data from the wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe (wmap). we argue that source clustering is likely to similarlyboost the importance of a variety of other feedback mechanisms.

astro-ph;0608032	cosmology at low frequencies: the 21 cm transition and the high-redshift  universe	observations of the high-redshift universe with the 21 cm hyperfine line ofneutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely new window onto the early phasesof cosmic structure formation. here we review the physics of the 21 cmtransition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe theinsights to be gained from such observations. these include measuring thematter power spectrum at z~50, observing the formation of the cosmic web andthe first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalacticmedium. the epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large hiiregions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. we alsodiscuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with anemphasis on the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. these increase rapidlytoward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshiftapplications. assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift universe,complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensionalview of structure formation from z~200 to z~6.

astro-ph;0608385	the effects of dark matter decay and annihilation on the high-redshift  21 cm background	the radiation background produced by the 21 cm spin-flip transition ofneutral hydrogen at high redshifts can be a pristine probe of fundamentalphysics and cosmology. at z~30-300, the intergalactic medium (igm) is visiblein 21 cm absorption against the cosmic microwave background (cmb), with astrength that depends on the thermal (and ionization) history of the igm. herewe examine the constraints this background can place on dark matter decay andannihilation, which could heat and ionize the igm through the production ofhigh-energy particles. using a simple model for dark matter decay, we showthat, if the decay energy is immediately injected into the igm, the 21 cmbackground can detect energy injection rates &gt;10^{-24} ev cm^{-3} sec^{-1}. ifall the dark matter is subject to decay, this allows us to constrain darkmatter lifetimes &lt;10^{27} sec. such energy injection rates are much smallerthan those typically probed by the cmb power spectra. the expected brightnesstemperature fluctuations at z~50 are a fraction of a mk and can vary from thestandard calculation by up to an order of magnitude, although the differencecan be significantly smaller if some of the decay products free stream to lowerredshifts. for self-annihilating dark matter, the fluctuation amplitude candiffer by a factor &lt;2 from the standard calculation at z~50. note also that, incontrast to the cmb, the 21 cm probe is sensitive to both the ionizationfraction and the igm temperature, in principle allowing better constraints onthe decay process and heating history. we also show that strong igm heating andionization can lead to an enhanced h_2 abundance, which may affect the earliestgenerations of stars and galaxies.

astro-ph;0610819	early cosmological hii/heiii regions and their impact on  second-generation star formation	(abridged) we present the results of three-dimensionalradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the formation and evolution of earlyhii/heiii regions around the first stars. cooling (by h2 and hd) and recollapseof the gas in the relic hii region is also followed in a full cosmologicalcontext, until second-generation stars are formed. a large hii region with afew kiloparsec diameter is formed, within which a smaller heiii region isembedded. radiative feedback effect quenches further star-formation within thehalo for a hundred million years. accretion onto remnant blackholes will beinefficient. recombination radiation within the hii region is weak, butpersists for 50 million years. we also follow the thermal and chemicalevolution of the photo-ionized gas in the relic hii region. the gas cools by hdline cooling down to a few tens kelvin. at high redshifts (z&gt;10), the minimumgas temperature is limited by t_cmb. because of its low temperature, thecharacteristic mass of a jeans-unstable gas clump is ~ 40 msun, and issignificantly smaller than a typical clump mass for early primordial gasclouds. we find no evidence of fragmentation by this epoch. together with thesmall cloud mass, this result indicates that massive, rather than very massive,primordial stars may form in the relic hii region. such stars might beresponsible for early metal-enrichment of the interstellar medium from whichrecently discovered hyper metal-poor stars were born.

0809.2404	accretion onto seed black holes in the first galaxies	the validity of the hypothesis that the massive black holes in high redshiftquasars grew from stellar-sized "seeds" is contingent on a seed's ability todouble its mass every few ten million years. this requires that the seedaccrete at approximately the eddington-limited rate. in the specific case ofradiatively efficient quasiradial accretion in a metal-poor protogalacticmedium, for which the bondi accretion rate is often prescribed in cosmologicalsimulations of massive black hole formation, we examine the effects of theradiation emitted near the black hole's event horizon on the structure of thesurrounding gas flow. we find that the radiation pressure from photoionizationsignificantly reduces the steady-state accretion rate and renders thequasiradial accretion flow unsteady and inefficient. the time-averagedaccretion rates are a small fraction of the eddington-limited accretion ratefor thomson scattering. the pressure of ly-alpha photons trapped near the hiiregion surrounding the black hole may further attenuate the inflow. theseresults suggest that an alternative to quasiradial, radiatively efficientbondi-like accretion should be sought to explain the rapid growth ofquasar-progenitor seed black holes.

0706.1274	feedback heating by cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies	recent observations show that the cooling flows in the central regions ofgalaxy clusters are highly suppressed. observed agn-induced cavities/bubblesare a leading candidate for suppressing cooling, usually via some form ofmechanical heating. at the same time, observed x-ray cavities and synchrotronemission point toward a significant non-thermal particle population. previousstudies have focused on the dynamical effects of cosmic-ray pressure support,but none have built successful models in which cosmic-ray heating issignificant. here we investigate a new model of agn heating, in which theintracluster medium is efficiently heated by cosmic-rays, which are injectedinto the icm through diffusion or the shredding of the bubbles byrayleigh-taylor or kelvin-helmholtz instabilities. we include thermalconduction as well. using numerical simulations, we show that the coolingcatastrophe is efficiently suppressed. the cluster quickly relaxes to aquasi-equilibrium state with a highly reduced accretion rate and temperatureand density profiles which match observations. unlike the conduction-only case,no fine-tuning of the spitzer conduction suppression factor f is needed. thecosmic ray pressure, p_c/p_g &lt;~ 0.1 and dp_c/dr &lt;~ 0.1 \rho g, is well withinobservational bounds. cosmic ray heating is a very attractive alternative tomechanical heating, and may become particularly compelling if glast detects thegamma-ray signature of cosmic-rays in clusters.
