0905.2695	hydrodynamical simulations of convection-related stellar  micro-variability. ii. the enigmatic granulation background of the corot  target hd49933	local-box hydrodynamical model atmospheres provide statistical informationabout a star's emergent radiation field which allows one to predict the levelof its granulation-related micro-variability. space-based photometry is nowsufficiently accurate to test model predictions. we aim to model thephotometric granulation background of hd49933 as well as the sun, and comparethe predictions to the measurements obtained by the corot and soho satellitemissions. we construct hydrodynamical model atmospheres representing hd49933and the sun, and use a previously developed scaling technique to obtain theobservable disk-integrated brightness fluctuations. we further performedexploratory magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of smallscale magnetic fields on the synthetic light-curves. we find that thegranulation-related brightness fluctuations depend on metallicity. we obtain asatisfactory correspondence between prediction and observation for the sun,validating our approach. for hd49933, we arrive at a significantover-estimation by a factor of two to three in total power. locally generatedmagnetic fields are unlikely to be responsible, otherwise existing fields wouldneed to be rather strong to sufficiently suppress the granulation signal.presently suggested updates on the fundamental stellar parameters do notimprove the correspondence; however, an ad-hoc increase of the hd49933 surfacegravity by about 0.2dex would eliminate most of the discrepancy. we diagnose apuzzling discrepancy between the predicted and observed granulation backgroundin hd49933, with only rather ad-hoc ideas for remedies at hand.

0906.2628	hd 50844: the new look of delta sct stars from corot space photometry	it has also been suggested that the detection of a wealth of very lowamplitude modes in delta sct stars was only a matter of signal--to--noiseratio. access to this treasure, impossible from the ground, is one of thescientific aims of the space mission corot, a space mission developed andoperated by cnes. this work presents the results obtained on hd 50844: the140,016 datapoints were analysed using independent approaches and severalchecks performed. a level of 10^{-5} mag was reached in the amplitude spectraof the corot timeseries. the frequency analysis of the corot timeseriesrevealed hundreds of terms in the frequency range 0--30 d^{-1}. all thecross--checks confirmed this new result. the initial guess that delta sct starshave a very rich frequency content is confirmed. the spectroscopic modeidentification gives theoretical support since very high--degree modes (up toell=14) are identified. we also prove that cancellation effects are notsufficient in removing the flux variations associated to these modes at thenoise level of the corot measurements. the ground--based observations indicatethat hd 50844 is an evolved star that is slightly underabundant in heavyelements, located on the terminal age main sequence. probably due to thisunfavourable evolutionary status, no clear regular distribution is observed inthe frequency set. the predominant term (f_1=6.92 d^{-1}) has been identifiedas the fundamental radial mode combining ground-based photometric andspectroscopic data. this work is also based on observations made with esotelescopes under the eso large programme lp178.d-0361 and on data collected atthe observatorio de sierra nevada, at the observatorio astronomico nacional sanpedro martir, and at the piszkesteto mountain station of konkoly observatory.

0906.5002	characteristics of solar-like oscillations in red giants observed in the  corot exoplanet field	observations during the first long run (~150 days) in the exo-planet field ofcorot increase the number of g-k giant stars for which solar-like oscillationsare observed by a factor of 100. this opens the possibility to study thecharacteristics of their oscillations in a statistical sense. we aim tounderstand the statistical distribution of the frequencies of maximumoscillation power (nu_max) in red giants and to search for a possiblecorrelation between nu_max and the large separation (delta_nu). the nu_maxdistribution shows a pronounced peak between 20 - 40 microhz. for about half ofthe stars we obtain delta_nu with at least two methods. the correlation betweennu_max and delta_nu follows the same scaling relation as inferred forsolar-like stars. the shape of the nu_max distribution can partly be explainedby granulation at low frequencies and by white noise at high frequencies, butthe population density of the observed stars turns out to be also an importantfactor. from the fact that the correlation between delta_nu and nu_max for redgiants follows the same scaling relation as obtained for sun-like stars, weconclude that the sound travel time over the pressure scale height of theatmosphere scales with the sound travel time through the whole starirrespective of evolution.

0910.0848	the quest for the solar g modes	solar gravity modes (or g modes) -- oscillations of the solar interior forwhich buoyancy acts as the restoring force -- have the potential to provideunprecedented inference on the structure and dynamics of the solar core,inference that is not possible with the well observed acoustic modes (or pmodes). the high amplitude of the g-mode eigenfunctions in the core and theevanesence of the modes in the convection zone make the modes particularlysensitive to the physical and dynamical conditions in the core. owing to theexistence of the convection zone, the g modes have very low amplitudes atphotospheric levels, which makes the modes extremely hard to detect. in thispaper, we review the current state of play regarding attempts to detect gmodes. we review the theory of g modes, including theoretical estimation of theg-mode frequencies, amplitudes and damping rates. then we go on to discuss thetechniques that have been used to try to detect g modes. we review results inthe literature, and finish by looking to the future, and the potential advancesthat can be made -- from both data and data-analysis perspectives -- to giveunambiguous detections of individual g modes. the review ends by concludingthat, at the time of writing, there is indeed a consensus amongst the authorsthat there is currently no undisputed detection of solar g modes.

0910.3513	hd 174884: a strongly eccentric, short-period early-type binary system  discovered by corot	accurate photometric corot space observations of a secondary seismologicaltarget, hd 174884, led to the discovery that this star is an astrophysicallyimportant double-lined eclipsing spectroscopic binary in an eccentric orbit (eof about 0.3), unusual for its short (3.65705d) orbital period. the higheccentricity, coupled with the orientation of the binary orbit in space,explains the very unusual observed light curve with strongly unequal primaryand secondary eclipses having the depth ratio of 1-to-100 in the corot 'seismo'passband. without the high accuracy of the corot photometry, the secondaryeclipse, 1.5 mmag deep, would have gone unnoticed. a spectroscopic follow-upprogram provided 45 high dispersion spectra. the analysis of the corot lightcurve was performed with an adapted version of phoebe that supports corotpassbands. the final solution was obtained by simultaneous fitting of the lightand the radial velocity curves. individual star spectra were derived byspectrum disentangling. the uncertainties of the fit were derived by bootstrapresampling and the solution uniqueness was tested by heuristic scanning. theresults provide a consistent picture of the system composed of two late bstars. the fourier analysis of the light curve fit residuals yields twocomponents, with orbital frequency multiples and an amplitude of about 0.1mmag, which are tentatively interpreted as tidally induced pulsations. anextensive comparison with theoretical models is carried out by means of thelevenberg-marquardt minimization technique and the discrepancy between modelsand the derived parameters is discussed. the best fitting models yield a youngsystem age of 125 million years which is consistent with the eccentric orbitand synchronous component rotation at periastron.

1010.2682	turbulent eddy-time-correlation in the solar convective zone	theoretical modeling of the driving processes of solar-like oscillations is apowerful way of understanding the properties of the convective zones ofsolar-type stars. in this framework, the description of the temporalcorrelation between turbulent eddies is an essential ingredient to model modeamplitudes. however, there is a debate between a gaussian or lorentziandescription of the eddy-time correlation function (samadi et al. 2003, chaplinet al. 2005). indeed, a gaussian description reproduces the low-frequency shapeof the mode amplitude for the sun, but is unsatisfactory from a theoreticalpoint of view (houdek, 2009) and leads to other disagreements with observations(samadi et al., 2007). these are solved by using a lorentzian description, butthere the low-frequency shape of the solar observations is not correctlyreproduced. we reconcile the two descriptions by adopting the sweepingapproximation, which consists in assuming that the eddy-time-correlationfunction is dominated by the advection of eddies, in the inertial range, byenergy-bearing eddies. using a lorentzian function together with a cut-offfrequency derived from the sweeping assumption allows us to reproduce thelow-frequency shape of the observations. this result also constitutes avalidation of the sweeping assumption for highly turbulent flows as in thesolar case.

1101.3162	an asteroseismic study of the o9v star hd 46202 from corot space-based  photometry	the o9v star hd 46202, which is a member of the young open cluster ngc 2244,was observed by the corot satellite in october/november 2008 during a short runof 34 days. from the very high-precision light curve, we clearly detect betacep-like pulsation frequencies with amplitudes of ~0.1 mmag and below. acomparison with stellar models was performed using a chi^2 as a measure for thegoodness-of-fit between the observed and theoretically computed frequencies.the physical parameters of our best-fitting models are compatible with the onesdeduced spectroscopically. a core overshooting parameter alpha_ov = 0.10 +-0.05 pressure scale height is required. none of the observed frequencies aretheoretically excited with the input physics used in our study. moretheoretical work is thus needed to overcome this shortcoming in how weunderstand the excitation mechanism of pulsation modes in such a massive star.a similar excitation problem has also been encountered for certain pulsationmodes in beta cep stars recently modelled asteroseismically.

1104.0630	the underlying physical meaning of the $\nu_{\rm max}-\nu_{\rm c}$  relation	asteroseismology of stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations are enjoying agrowing interest with the wealth of observational results obtained with thecorot and kepler missions. in this framework, scaling laws betweenasteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools tostudy a rich variety of stars. however, the physical underlying mechanisms ofthose scaling laws are still poorly known. our objective is to provide atheoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in thepower spectrum ($\nu_{\rm max}$) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-offfrequency ($\nu_{\rm c}$). using the soho golf observations together withtheoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height inoscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called \emph{plateau} of thedamping rates. the physical origin of the plateau can be traced to thedestabilizing effect of the lagrangian perturbation of entropy in theupper-most layers which becomes important when the modal period and the localthermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. based on this analysis, we thenfind a linear relation between $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\nu_{\rm c}$, with acoefficient that depends on the ratio of the mach number of the excitingturbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.

1104.2185	a quantitative analysis of stellar activity based on corot photometric  data	the corot satellite has made available high precision photometricobservations of a large number of stars of different spectral types. continuousphotometric time series allow the characterization of stellar microvariabilityin a systematic way. we determine an index indicating the level of activity,derived from photometric data, for a large sample of stars with different colortemperatures. we also assess to what extent this index can be related to anestimated rossby number for stars whose rotation period can be estimated. wealso estimate a characteristic lifetime of the surface heterogeneities. ourwork is based on the fourier analysis of stellar light curves. we analyzed thefourier power spectra of 430 selected light curves obtained by corot duringthree observation runs. the low-frequency contribution of the stellarvariability is modelled by a "generalized semi-lorentzian" profile. an activityindex is derived from the fitted amplitude and width of the semi-lorentzianmodel. some of the fourier spectra exhibit a rotational modulation whichenables the determination of the rotation period. in addition, a convectiveturnover time is derived from a grid of stellar models, so that a rossby numbercan be estimated. a characteristic lifetime of the phenomena causing theobserved power at low frequency is assessed from the fitted model of the powerspectrum and is compared to the rotation period. higher values of themicrovariability index are observed among the coolest stars from our sample. 28light curves show a clear rotational modulation. the estimated rossby number ofmost of the observed stars with a rotational modulation is less than 1. theactivity index decreases with increasing rossby number. the quality of thecorot data enables the determination of the characteristic lifetime of activestructures. it is shown to increase with the rotation period.

1203.1737	damping rates of solar-like oscillations across the hr diagram.  theoretical calculations confronted to corot and kepler observations	space-borne missions corot and {\it kepler} are providing a rich harvest ofhigh-quality constraints on solar-like pulsators. among the seismic parameters,mode damping rates remains poorly understood and thus barely used to inferphysical properties of stars. nevertheless, thanks to corot and {\it kepler}space-crafts it is now possible to measure damping rates for hundreds ofmain-sequence and thousands of red-giant stars with an unprecedented precision.  by using a non-adiabatic pulsation code including a time-dependent convectiontreatment, we compute damping rates for stellar models representative forsolar-like pulsators from the main-sequence to the red-giant phase. this allowsus to reproduce the observations of both corot and {\it kepler}, whichvalidates our modeling of mode damping rates and thus the underlying physicalmechanisms included in the modeling. actually, by considering the perturbationsof turbulent pressure and entropy (including perturbation of the dissipationrate of turbulent energy into heat) by the oscillation in our computation, wesucceed in reproducing the observed relation between damping rates andeffective temperature.  moreover, we discuss the physical reasons for mode damping rates to scalewith effective temperature, as observationally exhibited. finally, this opensthe way for the use of mode damping rates to probe turbulent convection insolar-like stars.

1205.4846	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in red-giant stars: evidences for  non-adiabatic effects using corot observations	a growing number of solar-like oscillations has been detected in red giantstars thanks to corot and kepler space-crafts. the seismic data gathered bycorot on red giant stars allow us to test mode driving theory in physicalconditions different from main-sequence stars. using a set of 3d hydrodynamicalmodels representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars, wecomputed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (pmax). assuming adiabaticpulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surfacestratification comes from the 3d hydrodynamical models, we computed the modeamplitude in terms of surface velocity. this was converted into intensityfluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or anon-adiabatic one. from l and m (the luminosity and mass), the energy supplyrate pmax is found to scale as (l/m)^2.6 for both main-sequence and red giantstars, extending previous results. the theoretical amplitudes in velocityunder-estimate the doppler velocity measurements obtained so far from theground for red giant stars by about 30%. in terms of intensity, the theoreticalscaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation resultsin an under-estimation by a factor of about 2.5 with respect to the corotseismic measurements. on the other hand, using the non-adiabaticintensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with thecorot data. the theoretical amplitudes remain 40% below, however, the corotmeasurements. our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannotbe simply extended from main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensityon the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giantstars are important and cannot be neglected. we discuss possible reasons forthe remaining differences.

1309.2009	differential asteroseismic study of seismic twins observed by corot;  comparison of hd 175272 with hd 181420	the corot short asteroseismic runs give us the opportunity to observe a largevariety of late-type stars through their solar-like oscillations. we report theobservation and modeling of the f5v star hd 175272. our aim is to define amethod for extracting as much information as possible from a noisy oscillationspectrum. we followed a differential approach that consists of using awell-known star as a reference to characterize another star. we used classicaltools such as the envelope autocorrelation function to derive the globalseismic parameters of the star. we compared hd 175272 with hd 181420 through alinear approach, because they appear to be asteroseismic twins. the comparisonwith the reference star enables us to substantially enhance the scientificoutput for hd 175272. first, we determined its global characteristics through adetailed seismic analysis of hd 181420. second, with our differential approach,we measured the difference of mass, radius and age between hd 175272 and hd181420. we have developed a general method able to derive asteroseismicconstraints on a star even in case of low-quality data. %this method is basedon the comparison to a star with common seismic and classical properties.seismic data allow accurate measurements of radii and masses differencesbetween the two stars. this method can be applied to stars with interestingproperties but low signal-to-noise ratio oscillation spectrum, such as starshosting an exoplanet or members of a binary system.

1310.0696	the plato 2.0 mission	plato 2.0 has recently been selected for esa's m3 launch opportunity(2022/24). providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density andage) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: how doplanetary systems form and evolve? are there other systems with planets likeours, including potentially habitable planets? the plato 2.0 instrumentconsists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 sec readout cadence and 2with 2.5 sec candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg2) and a largephotometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). it focusses on bright (4-11 mag) starsin wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to earth-size byphotometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-basedradial-velocity follow-up measurements. asteroseismology will be performed forthese bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, includingmasses and ages. the combination of bright targets and asteroseismology resultsin high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2%, 4-10% and 10% for planetradii, masses and ages, respectively. the planned baseline observing strategyincludes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planetsreaching into the habitable zone (hz) of solar-like stars and an additionalstep-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50% of the sky. plato 2.0 willobserve up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of smallplanets, and thousands of planets in the neptune to gas giant regime out to thehz. it will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulkcharacterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages.this catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbitaldistances, where surface temperatures are moderate. coverage of this parameterrange with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to plato2.0.

1503.06990	young [$\alpha$/fe]-enhanced stars discovered by corot and apogee: what  is their origin?	we report the discovery of a group of apparently young corot red-giant starsexhibiting enhanced [alpha/fe] abundance ratios (as determined from apogeespectra) with respect to solar values. their existence is not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the milky way, and shows that thechemical-enrichment history of the galactic disc is more complex. we findsimilar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could berobustly obtained, although in smaller relative numbers, which could explainwhy these stars have not received prior attention. the young [alpha/fe]-richstars are much more numerous in the corot-apogee (corogee) inner-field samplethan in any other high-resolution sample available at present, as only corogeecan explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. thekinematic properties of the young [$\alpha$/fe]-rich stars are not clearlythick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the galacticmid-plane. our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguingobservations in the milky way is that these stars were formed close to the endof the galactic bar, near corotation -- a region where gas can be kept inertfor longer times, compared to other regions shocked more frequently by thepassage of spiral arms. moreover, that is where the mass return from olderinner-disc stellar generations should be maximal (according to an inside-outdisc-formation scenario), further diluting the in-situ gas. other possibilitiesto explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are alsodiscussed.

0807.0989	solarflag hare and hounds: estimation of p-mode frequencies from  sun-as-star helioseismology data	we report on the results of the latest solarflag hare-and-hounds exercise,which was concerned with testing methods for extraction of frequencies oflow-degree solar p modes from data collected by sun-as-a-star observations. wehave used the new solarflag simulator, which includes the effects of correlatedmode excitation and correlations with background noise, to make artificialtimeseries data that mimic doppler velocity observations of the sun as a star.the correlations give rise to asymmetry of mode peaks in the frequency powerspectrum. ten members of the group (the hounds) applied their ``peak bagging''codes to a 3456-day dataset, and the estimated mode frequencies were returnedto the hare (who was wjc) for comparison. analysis of the results reveals asystematic bias in the estimated frequencies of modes above approximately 1.8mhz. the bias is negative, meaning the estimated frequencies systematicallyunderestimate the input frequencies.  we identify two sources that are the dominant contributions to the frequencybias. both sources involve failure to model accurately subtle aspects of theobserved power spectral density in the part (window) of the frequency powerspectrum that is being fitted. one source of bias arises from a failure toaccount for the power spectral density coming from all those modes whosefrequencies lie outside the fitting windows. the other source arises from afailure to account for the power spectral density of the weak l=4 and 5 modes,which are often ignored in sun-as-a-star analysis. the sun-as-a-starpeak-bagging codes need to allow for both sources, otherwise the frequenciesare likely to be biased.

astro-ph;0210036	seismic diagnostics on stellar convection treatment from oscillation  amplitudes of p-modes	the excitation rate p of solar p-modes is computed with a model of stochaticexcitation which involves constraints on the averaged properties of the solarturbulence. these constraints are obtained from a 3d simulation. resultingvalues for p are found ~9 times larger than when the calculation assumesproperties of turbulent convection which are derived from an 1d solar modelbased on gough (1977)'s formulation of the mixing-length theory (gmlt). thisdifference is mainly due to the assumed values for the mean anisotropy of thevelocity field in each case.calculations based on 3d constraints bring the pmaximum closer to the observational one.we also compute p for several models ofintermediate mass stars (1mo &lt; m &lt; 2mo). differences in the values of p_maxbetween models computed with the classical mixing-length theory and gmlt modelsare found large enough for main sequence stars to suggest that measurements ofp in this mass range will be able to discriminate between different models ofturbulent convection.

astro-ph;0607570	a closure model with plumes ii. application to the stochastic excitation  of stellar p modes	our goal is to improve the theoretical modelling of stochastic excitation ofp modes by turbulent convection. with the help of the closure model with plume(cmp) developed in a companion paper, we refine the theoretical description ofthe excitation by the turbulent reynolds stress term. the cmp is generalizedfor two-point correlation products so as to apply it to the formalism developedby samadi &amp; goupil (2001). the excitation source terms are then computed withthis improvement, and a comparison with solar data from the golf instrument isperformed. the present model provides a significant improvement when comparingabsolute values of theoretical ampplitudes with observational data. it givesrise to a frequency dependence of the power supplied to solar p modes, whichagrees with golf observations. it is shown that the asymmetry of the turbulentconvection zone (up- and downflows) plays a major role in the excitationprocesses. despite an increase in the reynolds stress term contribution due toour improved description, an additional source of excitation, identified as theentropy source term, is still necessary for reproducing the observational data.theoretical excitation rates in the frequency range [2.5 mhz, 4 mhz] now are inagreement with the observational data from the golf instrument. however, atlower frequencies, it exhibits small discrepancies at the maximum level of afew per cent. improvements are likely to come from a better physicaldescription of the excitation by entropy fluctuations in the superadiabaticzone.

0810.0602	stochastic excitation of nonradial modes ii. are solar asymptotic  gravity modes detectable?	detection of solar gravity modes remains a major challenge to ourunderstanding of the innerparts of the sun. their frequencies would enable thederivation of constraints on the core physical properties while theiramplitudes can put severe constraints on the properties of the inner convectiveregion. our purpose is to determine accurate theoretical amplitudes of solar gmodes and estimate the soho observation duration for an unambiguous detection.we investigate the stochastic excitation of modes by turbulent convection aswell as their damping. input from a 3d global simulation of the solarconvective zone is used for the kinetic turbulent energy spectrum. damping iscomputed using a parametric description of the nonlocal time-dependentconvection-pulsation interaction. we then provide a theoretical estimation ofthe intrinsic, as well as apparent, surface velocity. asymptotic g-modevelocity amplitudes are found to be orders of magnitude higher than previousworks. using a 3d numerical simulation, from the ash code, we attribute this tothe temporal-correlation between the modes and the turbulent eddies which isfound to follow a lorentzian law rather than a gaussian one as previously used.we also find that damping rates of asymptotic gravity modes are dominated byradiative losses, with a typical life-time of $3 \times 10^5$ years for the$\ell=1$ mode at $\nu=60 \mu$hz. the maximum velocity in the consideredfrequency range (10-100 $\mu$hz) is obtained for the $\ell=1$ mode at $\nu=60\mu$hz and for the $\ell=2$ at $\nu=100 \mu$hz. due to uncertainties in themodeling, amplitudes at maximum i.e. for $\ell=1$ at 60 $\mu$hz can range from3 to 6 mm s$^{-1}$.
