0903.2297	cosmological studies with a large-area x-ray telescope	a moderate investment of observing time with the international x-rayobservatory to study high-redshift galaxy clusters detected in futurelarge-scale surveys, will provide cosmological measurements of fundamentalimportance. ixo observations, combined with lensing follow-up, will measure theperturbation growth factor from z=0-2 with an accuracy comparable to, orpossibly better than, that expected from observations of cosmic shear withjdem, and redshift-space distortions with euclid. the growth of structure dataderived from clusters will significantly improve our knowledge of the darkenergy equation of state and will aid in constraining non-gr models for cosmicacceleration. ixo observations of the largest, dynamically relaxed clusterswill provide a powerful, independent measurement of the cosmological expansionhistory using the apparent f_gas(z) trend. systematic and statistical errorsfrom this technique are competitive with snia and bao studies, making the testextremely useful for improving the accuracy and reliability of the geometriccosmological measurements planned for lsst and jdem. only by employing a rangeof powerful, independent approaches, including those discussed here, can robustanswers to puzzles as profound as the origin of cosmic acceleration beexpected.

0904.0254	constraints on turbulent pressure in the x-ray halos of giant elliptical  galaxies from resonant scattering	the dense cores of x-ray emitting gaseous halos of large elliptical galaxieswith temperatures below about 0.8 kev show two prominent fe xvii emissionfeatures, which provide a sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the effects ofresonant scattering. we present here high-resolution spectra of five brightnearby elliptical galaxies, obtained with the reflection grating spectrometers(rgs) on the xmm-newton satellite. the spectra for the cores of four of thegalaxies show the fe xvii line at 15.01 angstrom being suppressed by resonantscattering. the data for ngc 4636 in particular allow the effects of resonantscattering to be studied in detail and to prove that the 15.01 angstrom line issuppressed only in the dense core and not in the surrounding regions. usingdeprojected density and temperature profiles for this galaxy obtained with thechandra satellite, we model the radial intensity profiles of the strongestresonance lines, accounting for the effects of resonant scattering, fordifferent values of the characteristic turbulent velocity. comparing the modelto the data, we find that the isotropic turbulent velocities on spatial scalessmaller than about 1 kpc are less than 100 km/s and the turbulent pressuresupport in the galaxy core is smaller than 5% of the thermal pressure at the90% confidence level, and less than 20% at 95% confidence. neglecting theeffects of resonant scattering in spectral fitting of the inner 2 kpc core ofngc 4636 will lead to underestimates of the chemical abundances of fe and o by~10-20%.

0910.0025	ram pressure stripping of the cool core of the ophiuchus cluster	(abridged) we report results from a chandra study of the central regions ofthe nearby, x-ray bright, ophiuchus cluster (z = 0.03), the second-brightestcluster in the sky. our study reveals a dramatic, close-up view of thestripping and potential destruction of a cool core within a rich cluster. thex-ray emission from the ophiuchus cluster core exhibits a comet-like morphologyextending to the north, driven by merging activity, indicative of ram-pressurestripping caused by rapid motion through the ambient cluster gas. a cold frontat the southern edge implies a velocity of 1000$\pm$200 km/s (m~0.6). the x-rayemission from the cluster core is sharply peaked. as previously noted, the peakis offset by 4 arcsec (~2 kpc) from the optical center of the associated cdgalaxy, indicating that ram pressure has slowed the core, allowing therelatively collisionless stars and dark matter to carry on ahead. the clusterexhibits the strongest central temperature gradient of any massive clusterobserved to date: the temperature rises from 0.7 kev within 1 kpc of thebrightness peak, to 10 kev by 30 kpc. a strong metallicity gradient is alsoobserved within the same region. this supports a picture in which the outerparts of the cool core have been stripped by ram-pressure due to its rapidmotion. the cooling time of the innermost gas is very short, ~5$\times10^7$yrs. within the central 10 kpc radius, multiple small-scale fronts and acomplex thermodynamic structure are observed, indicating significant motions.beyond the central 50 kpc, and out to a radius ~150 kpc, the cluster appearsrelatively isothermal and has near constant metallicity. the exception is alarge, coherent ridge of enhanced metallicity observed to trail the cool core,and which is likely to have been stripped from it.

1003.5334	feedback under the microscope ii: heating, gas uplift, and mixing in the  nearest cluster core	using a combination of deep 574ks chandra data, xmm-newton high-resolutionspectra, and optical halpha+nii images, we study the nature and spatialdistribution of the multiphase plasma in m87. our results provide directobservational evidence of `radio mode' agn feedback in action, stripping thecentral galaxy of its lowest entropy gas and preventing star-formation. thislow entropy gas was entrained with and uplifted by the buoyantly risingrelativistic plasma, forming long "arms". these arms are likely oriented within15-30 degrees of our line-of-sight. the mass of the uplifted gas in the arms iscomparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpccore, demonstrating that the agn has a profound effect on its immediatesurroundings. the coolest x-ray emitting gas in m87 has a temperature of ~0.5kev and is spatially coincident with halpha+nii nebulae, forming a multiphasemedium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments. weplace strong upper limits of 0.06 msun/yr on the amount of plasma coolingradiatively from 0.5 kev and show that a uniform, volume-averaged heatingmechanism could not be preventing the cool gas from further cooling. all of thebright halpha filaments appear in the downstream region of the &lt;3 myr old shockfront, at smaller radii than ~0.6'. we suggest that shocks induce shearingaround the filaments, thereby promoting mixing of the cold gas with the ambienthot icm via instabilities. by bringing hot thermal particles into contact withthe cool, line-emitting gas, mixing can supply the power and ionizing particlesneeded to explain the observed optical spectra. mixing of the coolest x-rayemitting plasma with the cold optical line emitting filamentary gas promotesefficient conduction between the two phases, allowing non-radiative coolingwhich could explain the lack of x-ray gas with temperatures under 0.5 kev.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

1006.5484	feedback under the microscope: thermodynamic structure and agn driven  shocks in m87	(abridged) using a deep chandra exposure (574 ks), we present high-resolutionthermodynamic maps created from the spectra of $\sim$16,000 independentregions, each with $\sim$1,000 net counts. the excellent spatial resolution ofthe thermodynamic maps reveals the dramatic and complex temperature, pressure,entropy and metallicity structure of the system. excluding the 'x-ray arms',the diffuse cluster gas at a given radius is strikingly isothermal. thissuggests either that the ambient cluster gas, beyond the arms, remainsrelatively undisturbed by agn uplift, or that conduction in the intraclustermedium (icm) is efficient along azimuthal directions. we confirm the presenceof a thick ($\sim$40 arcsec or $\sim$3 kpc) ring of high pressure gas at aradius of $\sim$180 arcsec ($\sim$14 kpc) from the central agn. we verify thatthis feature is associated with a classical shock front, with an average machnumber m = 1.25. another, younger shock-like feature is observed at a radius of$\sim$40 arcsec ($\sim$3 kpc) surrounding the central agn, with an estimatedmach number m &gt; 1.2. as shown previously, if repeated shocks occur every$\sim$10 myrs, as suggested by these observations, then agn driven weak shockscould produce enough energy to offset radiative cooling of the icm. a highsignificance enhancement of fe abundance is observed at radii 350 - 400 arcsec(27 - 31 kpc). this ridge is likely formed in the wake of the rising bubblesfilled with radio-emitting plasma that drag cool, metal-rich gas out of thecentral galaxy. we estimate that at least $\sim1.0\times10^6$ solar masses offe has been lifted and deposited at a radius of 350-400 arcsec; approximatelythe same mass of fe is measured in the x-ray bright arms, suggesting that asingle generation of buoyant radio bubbles may be responsible for the observedfe excess at 350 - 400 arcsec.

1108.4434	core-collapse supernova enrichment in the core of the virgo cluster	using a deep (574 ks) chandra observation of m87, the dominant galaxy of thenearby virgo cluster, we present the best measurements to date of the radialdistribution of metals in the central intracluster medium (icm). ourmeasurements, made in 36 independent annuli with $\sim$250,000 counts each,extend out to a radius r$\sim$40 kpc and show that the abundance profiles offe, si, s, ar, ca, ne, mg, and ni are all centrally peaked. interestingly, theabundance profiles of si and s - which are measured robustly and to highprecision - are even more centrally peaked than fe, while the si/s ratio isrelatively flat. these measurements challenge the standard picture of chemicalenrichment in galaxy clusters, wherein type ia supernovae (sn ia) from anevolved stellar population are thought to dominate the central enrichment. theobserved abundance patterns are most likely due to one or more of the followingprocesses: continuing enrichment by winds of a stellar population pre-enrichedby sncc products; intermittent formation of massive stars in the centralcooling core; early enrichment of the low entropy gas. we also discuss otherprocesses that might have contributed to the observed radial profiles, such asa stellar initial mass function that changes with radius; changes in thepre-enrichment of core-collapse supernova progenitors; and a diversity in theelemental yields of sn ia. although systematic uncertainties prevent us frommeasuring the o abundance robustly, indications are that it is about 2 timeslower than predicted by the enrichment models.

1205.1563	on the thermodynamic self-similarity of the nearest, most relaxed, giant  ellipticals	we present detailed spatially resolved measurements of the thermodynamicproperties of the x-ray emitting gas in the inner regions of the five nearest,x-ray and optically brightest, and most x-ray morphologically relaxed giantelliptical galaxies known. beyond the innermost region at r &gt; 1 kpc, and out tor ~ 6 kpc, the density, pressure, entropy, and cooling time distributions forthe x-ray emitting gas follow remarkably similar, simple, power-law likedistributions. notably, the entropy profiles follow a power-law form, with anindex 0.92-1.07. the cumulative hot x-ray emitting gas mass profiles and thegas-mass to stellar-light ratios of all five galaxies are also similar. overallthe observed similarity of the thermodynamic profiles in this radial rangeargues that, in these systems, relativistic jets heat the gas at a similar rateaveraged over time scales longer than the cooling time of 10^8 yr. these jetsare powered by accretion from the hot gas, or material entrained within it,onto the central super-massive black hole. this jet heating creates an energybalance where heating and cooling are in equilibrium, keeping the hot galacticatmospheres in a `steady-state'. within r &lt; 1 kpc, this similarity breaks down:the observed entropy profiles show well resolved flattening and the valuesdiffer from system to system substantially. the accretion rate onto the blackhole and the agn activity, heating the interstellar medium, must therefore varysignificantly on time scales shorter than the cooling time of 10^7 - 10^8 yr.

1211.5606	the rapid evolution of agn feedback in brightest cluster galaxies:  switching from quasar-mode to radio-mode feedback	we present an analysis of the 2-10 kev x-ray emission associated with theactive galactic nuclei (agns) in brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). our sampleconsists of 32 bcgs that lie in highly x-ray luminous cluster of galaxies(l_x-ray (0.1-2.4 kev) &gt; 3*10^44 erg/s) in which agn-jetted outflows arecreating and sustaining clear xray cavities. our sample covers the redshiftrange 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 and reveals strong evolution in the nuclear x-rayluminosities, such that the black holes in these systems have become on averageat least 10 times fainter over the last 5 gyrs. mindful of potential selectioneffects, we propose two possible scenarios to explain our results: 1) eitherthat the agns in bcgs with x-ray cavities are steadily becoming fainter, ormore likely, 2) that the fraction of these bcgs with radiatively efficientnuclei is decreasing with time from roughly 60 per cent at z=0.6 to 30 per centat z=0.1. based on this strong evolution, we predict that a significantfraction of bcgs in z=1 clusters may host quasars at their centres, potentiallycomplicating the search for such clusters at high redshift. in analogy withblack-hole binaries and based on the observed eddington ratios of our sources,we further propose that the evolving agn population in bcgs with x-ray cavitiesmay be transiting from a canonical low/hard state, analogous to that of x-raybinaries, to a quiescent state over the last 5 gyrs.

1211.6722	the nature of filamentary cold gas in the core of the virgo cluster	we present a multi-wavelength study of the emission-line nebulae locatedsoutheast of the nucleus of m87, the central dominant galaxy of the virgocluster. we report the detection of far-infrared (fir) [cii] line emission fromthe nebulae using observations made with herschel pacs. the infrared lineemission is extended and cospatial with optical h{\alpha}+[nii],far-ultraviolet civ lines, and soft x-ray emission. the filamentary nebulaeevidently contain multi-phase material spanning a temperature range of at least5 orders of magnitude, from ~100 k to ~10^7 k. this material has most likelybeen uplifted by the agn from the center of m87. the thermal pressure of the10^4 k phase appears to be significantly lower than that of the surrounding hotintra-cluster medium (icm) indicating the presence of additional turbulent andmagnetic pressure in the filaments. if the turbulence in the filaments issubsonic then the magnetic field strength required to balance the pressure ofthe surrounding icm is b~30-70 {\mu}g. the spectral properties of the softx-ray emission from the filaments indicate that it is due to thermal plasmawith kt~0.5-1 kev, which is cooling by mixing with the cold gas and/orradiatively. charge exchange can be ruled out as a significant source of softx-rays. both cooling and mixing scenarios predict gas with a range oftemperatures. this is at first glance inconsistent with the apparent lack ofx-ray emitting gas with kt&lt;0.5 kev. however, we show that the missing very softx-ray emission could be absorbed by the cold gas in the filaments with anintegrated hydrogen column density of ~1.6x10^21 cm^-2, providing a naturalexplanation for the apparent temperature floor to the x-ray emission at kt~0.5kev. the fir through ultra-violet line emission is most likely primarilypowered by the icm particles penetrating the cold gas following a shearinginduced mixing process.

1308.1956	resonant scattering in the perseus cluster: spectral model for  constraining gas motions with astro-h	x-ray spectra from cores of galaxy clusters can be strongly distorted byresonant scattering of line photons, affecting metal abundance and gas velocitymeasurements. we introduce simulated spectral models that take into account theresonant scattering effect, radial variations of thermodynamic properties ofthe hot gas, projection effects and small-scale isotropic gas motions. the keyfeature of the models is that all these effects are treated self-consistentlyfor the whole spectrum, rather than for individual lines. the model spectra arepublicly available and can be used for direct comparison with observedprojected spectra. comparison with the existing xmm-newton and chandra data ofthe perseus cluster shows that even though there is no strong evidence for theresonant scattering in perseus, the low energy resolution of the x-ray ccds isnot sufficient to robustly distinguish spectral distortions due to the resonantscattering, different metal abundance profiles and different levels of gasturbulence. future astro-h data will resolve most of the problems we are facingwith ccds. with the help of our models, the resonant scattering analysis can bedone self-consistently using the whole spectral information, constraining thelevel of gas turbulence already with a 100 ks observation with astro-h.

1310.5450	the origin of cold gas in giant elliptical galaxies and its role in  fueling radio-mode agn feedback	we present a multi-wavelength study of the interstellar medium in eightnearby, x-ray and optically bright, giant elliptical galaxies. using herschelpacs, we map the cold gas in the lines of [cii], [oi], and [oib]. additionally,we present ha+[nii] imaging of warm ionized gas with the soar telescope, and astudy of the hot x-ray emitting plasma with chandra. all systems with extendedha emission in our sample (6/8 galaxies) display significant [cii] lineemission indicating the presence of cold gas. this emission is co-spatial withthe ha+[nii] emitting nebulae and the lowest entropy x-ray emitting plasma. theentropy profiles of the hot galactic atmospheres show a clear dichotomy, withthe systems displaying extended emission line nebulae having lower entropiesbeyond r~1 kpc than the cold-gas-poor systems. we show that while the hotatmospheres of the cold-gas-poor galaxies are thermally stable outside of theirinnermost cores, the atmospheres of the cold-gas-rich systems are prone tocooling instabilities. this result indicates that the cold gas is producedchiefly by thermally unstable cooling from the hot phase. we show that coolinginstabilities may develop more easily in rotating systems and discuss analternative condition for thermal instability for this case. the hotatmospheres of cold-gas-rich galaxies display disturbed morphologies indicatingthat the accretion of clumpy multiphase gas in these systems may result invariable power output of the agn jets, potentially triggering sporadic, largeroutbursts. in the two cold-gas-poor, x-ray morphologically relaxed galaxies ofour sample, ngc 1399 and ngc 4472, powerful agn outbursts may have destroyed orremoved most of the cold gas from the cores, allowing the jets to propagate anddeposit most of their energy further out, increasing the entropy of the hotgalactic atmospheres and leaving their cores relatively undisturbed.

1404.5306	the relation between gas density and velocity power spectra in galaxy  clusters: qualitative treatment and cosmological simulations	we address the problem of evaluating the power spectrum of the velocity fieldof the icm using only information on the plasma density fluctuations, which canbe measured today by chandra and xmm-newton observatories. we argue that forrelaxed clusters there is a linear relation between the rms density andvelocity fluctuations across a range of scales, from the largest ones, wheremotions are dominated by buoyancy, down to small, turbulent scales:$(\delta\rho_k/\rho)^2 = \eta_1^2 (v_{1,k}/c_s)^2$, where $\delta\rho_k/\rho$is the spectral amplitude of the density perturbations at wave number $k$,$v_{1,k}^2=v_k^2/3$ is the mean square component of the velocity field, $c_s$is the sound speed, and $\eta_1$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity.using cosmological simulations of relaxed galaxy clusters, we calibrate thisrelation and find $\eta_1\approx 1 \pm 0.3$. we argue that this value is set atlarge scales by buoyancy physics, while at small scales the density andvelocity power spectra are proportional because the former are a passive scalaradvected by the latter. this opens an interesting possibility to use gasdensity power spectra as a proxy for the velocity power spectra in relaxedclusters, across a wide range of scales.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1407.8181	x-ray bright active galactic nuclei in massive galaxy clusters iii: new  insights into the triggering mechanisms of cluster agn	we present the results of a new analysis of the x-ray selected activegalactic nuclei (agn) population in the vicinity of 135 of the most massivegalaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 observed with chandra.with a sample of more than 11,000 x-ray point sources, we are able to measure,for the first time, evidence for evolution in the cluster agn population beyondthe expected evolution of field agn. our analysis shows that overall numberdensity of cluster agn scales with the cluster mass as $\sim m_{500}^{-1.2}$.there is no evidence for the overall number density of cluster member x-ray agndepending on the cluster redshift in a manner different than field agn, northere is any evidence that the spatial distribution of cluster agn (given inunits of the cluster overdensity radius r_500) strongly depends on the clustermass or redshift. the $m^{-1.2 \pm 0.7}$ scaling relation we measure isconsistent with theoretical predictions of the galaxy merger rate in clusters,which is expected to scale with the cluster velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, as $\sim \sigma^{-3}$ or $\sim m^{-1}$. this consistency suggests that agn inclusters may be predominantly triggered by galaxy mergers, a result that isfurther corroborated by visual inspection of hubble images for 23spectroscopically confirmed cluster member agn in our sample. a merger-drivenscenario for the triggering of x-ray agn is not strongly favored by studies offield galaxies, however, suggesting that different mechanisms may be primarilyresponsible for the triggering of cluster and field x-ray agn.

1410.0025	x-ray cavities in a sample of 83 spt-selected clusters of galaxies:  tracing the evolution of agn feedback in clusters of galaxies out to z=1.2	x-ray cavities are key tracers of mechanical (or radio mode) heating arisingfrom the active galactic nuclei (agn) in brightest cluster galaxies. we reporton a survey for x-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2)clusters of galaxies selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature in thesouth pole telescope data. based on chandra x-ray images, we find a total of 6clusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistentwith the picture of radio jets inflating x-ray cavities in the intraclustermedium. the majority of these detections are of relatively low significance andrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. further, due to thelimitations of chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (&lt;10 kpc),unresolved x-ray cavities at high (z&gt;0.5) redshift. despite these limitations,our results suggest that the power generated by agn feedback in brightestcluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of theuniverse (&gt;7 gyrs at z=0.8). on average, the detected x-ray cavities havepowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.integrating over 7 gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in thebrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9m_sun ofmaterial to power these outflows. this level of accretion indicates thatsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,in the quasar era, but at late times as well. we also find that x-ray cavitiesat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 kev per particle into thehot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.this value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, breakself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres.

1410.1955	the growth of the galaxy cluster abell 85: mergers, shocks, stripping  and seeding of clumping	we present the results of deep chandra, xmm-newton and suzaku observations ofthe nearby galaxy cluster abell 85, which is currently undergoing at least twomergers, and in addition shows evidence for gas sloshing which extends out to r~ 600 kpc. one of the two infalling subclusters, to the south of the maincluster center, has a dense, x-ray bright cool core and a tail extending to thesoutheast. the northern edge of this tail is strikingly smooth and sharp(narrower than the coulomb mean free path of the ambient gas) over a length of200 kpc, while toward the southwest the boundary of the tail is blurred andbent, indicating a difference in the plasma transport properties between thesetwo edges. the thermodynamic structure of the tail strongly supports an overallnorthwestward motion. we propose, that a sloshing-induced tangential, ambient,coherent gas flow is bending the tail eastward. the brightest galaxy of thissubcluster is at the leading edge of the dense core, and is trailed by the tailof stripped gas, suggesting that the cool core of the subcluster has beenalmost completely destroyed by the time it reached its current radius of r ~500 kpc. the surface-brightness excess, likely associated with gas strippedfrom the infalling southern subcluster, extends toward the southeast out to atleast r_500 of the main cluster, indicating that the stripping of infallingsubclusters may seed gas inhomogeneities. the second merging subcluster appearsto be a diffuse non-cool core system. its merger is likely supersonic with amach number of ~ 1.4.

1410.6485	turbulent heating in galaxy clusters brightest in x-rays	the hot, x-ray-emitting intracluster medium (icm) is the dominant baryonicconstituent of clusters of galaxies. in the cores of many clusters, radiativeenergy losses from the icm occur on timescales significantly shorter than theage of the system. unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulationsof cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations.various sources of energy capable of compensating these cooling losses havebeen proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holesin the central galaxies through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma.regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy istransferred to the icm has remained open. here we present a plausible solutionto this question based on deep chandra x-ray observatory data and a newdata-analysis method that enables us to evaluate directly the icm heating ratedue to the dissipation of turbulence. we find that turbulent heating issufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locallyat each radius - it might therefore be the key element in resolving the gascooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in atmospheres of x-raygas-rich systems.

1411.0050	a suzaku search for dark matter emission lines in the x-ray brightest  galaxy clusters	we present the results of a search for unidentified emission lines in deepsuzaku x-ray spectra for the central regions of the four x-ray brightest galaxyclusters: perseus, coma, virgo and ophiuchus. we employ an optimized energyrange for our analysis (3.2-5.3 kev) that is relatively free of instrumentalfeatures, and a baseline plasma emission model that incorporates the abundancesof elements with the strongest expected emission lines at these energies (s,ar, ca) as free parameters. for the perseus cluster core, employing thisbaseline model, we find evidence for an additional emission feature at anenergy $3.51^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ kev with a flux of ~$2.87\times10^{-7}$ph/s/cm^2/arcmin^2. at slightly larger radii, we detect an emission line at3.59+/-0.02 kev with a flux of ~$4.8\times10^{-8}$ ph/s/cm^2/arcmin^2. theenergies and fluxes of these features are broadly consistent with previousclaims, although the radial variation of the line strength appears in tensionwith standard dark matter (dm) model predictions. assuming a decaying dm originfor the perseus emission features allows us to predict the energies and linefluxes for the other clusters in our sample. critically, we do not detect anemission feature at the predicted energy and line flux in the coma, virgo andophiuchus clusters. the formal 99.5 per cent upper limits on the strengths ofan emission line in each cluster are below the decaying dm model predictions,scaling from the perseus cluster center, apparently ruling the model out. inthe light of these results, we search for other explanations for the ~3.55 kevemission feature in perseus. our results suggest that systematic effectsassociated with modeling the complex spectra for the perseus cluster core,details of the assumed ionization balance, and errors in the predictedemissivities of the spectral lines may in part be responsible for the ~3.5 kevfeature.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1501.07271	gas density fluctuations in the perseus cluster: clumping factor and  velocity power spectrum	x-ray surface brightness fluctuations in the core of the perseus cluster areanalyzed, using deep observations with the chandra observatory. the amplitudeof gas density fluctuations on different scales is measured in a set of radialannuli. it varies from 8 to 12 per cent on scales of ~10-30 kpc within radii of30-160 kpc from the cluster center and from 9 to 7 per cent on scales of ~20-30kpc in an outer, 60-220 kpc annulus. using a statistical linear relationbetween the observed amplitude of density fluctuations and predicted velocity,the characteristic velocity of gas motions on each scale is calculated. thetypical amplitudes of the velocity outside the central 30 kpc region are 90-140km/s on ~20-30 kpc scales and 70-100 km/s on smaller scales ~7-10 kpc. thevelocity power spectrum is consistent with cascade of turbulence and its slopeis in a broad agreement with the slope for canonical kolmogorov turbulence. thegas clumping factor estimated from the power spectrum of the densityfluctuations is lower than 7-8 per cent for radii ~30-220 kpc from the center,leading to a density bias of less than 3-4 per cent in the cluster core.uncertainties of the analysis are examined and discussed. future measurementsof the gas velocities with the astro-h, athena and smart-x observatories willdirectly measure the gas density-velocity perturbation relation and furtherreduce systematic uncertainties in these quantities.

astro-ph;0002506	the properties of cooling flows in x-ray luminous clusters of galaxies	we discuss the x-ray properties of the cooling flows in a sample of thirtyhighly x-ray luminous clusters of galaxies observed with the asca and rosatsatellites. we demonstrate the need for multiphase models to consistentlyexplain the spectral and imaging x-ray data for the clusters. the massdeposition rates of the cooling flows, independently determined from the ascaspectra and rosat images, exhibit good agreement and exceed 1000 solar massesper year in the largest systems. we confirm the presence of intrinsic x-rayabsorption in the clusters using a variety of spectral models. the measuredequivalent hydrogen column densities of absorbing material are sensitive to thespectral models used in the analysis, varying from average values of a few10^{20} atom/cm^2 for a simple isothermal emission model, to a few 10^{21}atom/cm^2 using our preferred cooling flow models, assuming in each case thatthe absorber lies in a uniform foreground screen. the true intrinsic columndensities are likely to be even higher if the absorbing medium is distributedthroughout the clusters. we summarize the constraints on the nature of thex-ray absorber from observations in other wavebands. a significant part of thex-ray absorption may be due to dust.

astro-ph;0003191	the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs) - iv. the extended sample	we present a low-flux extension of the x-ray selected rosat brightest clustersample (bcs) published in paper i of this series. like the original bcs andemploying an identical selection procedure, the bcs extension is compiled fromrosat all-sky survey (rass) data in the northern hemisphere (dec &gt; 0 deg) andat high galactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 20 deg). it comprises 100 x-ray selectedclusters of galaxies with measured redshifts z &lt; 0.3 (as well as seven more atz &gt; 0.3) and total fluxes between 2.8 x 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 and 4.4 x 10-12 ergcm-2 s-1 in the 0.1-2.4 kev band (the latter value being the flux limit of theoriginal bcs). the extension can be combined with the main sample published in1998 to form the homogeneously selected extended bcs (ebcs), the largest andstatistically best understood cluster sample to emerge from the rosat all-skysurvey to date.  the nominal completeness of the combined sample (defined with respect to apower law fit to the bright end of the bcs log n-log s distribution) isrelatively low at 75 per cent (compared to 90 per cent for the high-flux sampleof paper i). however, just as for the original bcs, this incompleteness can beaccurately quantified, and thus statistically corrected for, as a function ofx-ray luminosity and redshift.  in addition to its importance for improved statistical studies of theproperties of clusters in the local universe, the low-flux extension of the bcsis also intended to serve as a finding list for x-ray bright clusters in thenorthern hemisphere which we hope will prove useful in the preparation ofcluster observations with the next generation of x-ray telescopes such aschandra or xmm-newton.

astro-ph;0111368	chandra observations of rxj1347.5-1145: the distribution of mass in the  most x-ray luminous galaxy cluster known	we present chandra observations of rxj1347.5-1145, the most x-ray luminouscluster of galaxies known. we report the discovery of a region of relativelyhot, bright x-ray emission, located approximately 20 arcsec to the southeast ofthe main x-ray peak, at a position consistent with the region of enhancedsunyaev-zeldovich effect reported by komatsu et al. (2001). we suggest thatthis region contains shocked gas resulting from a recent subcluster mergerevent. excluding the data for the southeast quadrant, the cluster appearsrelatively relaxed. the x-ray gas temperature rises from kt~6 kev within thecentral 25 h_50^{-1} kpc radius to a mean value of ~16 kev between 0.1-0.5h_50^{-1} mpc. the mass profile for the relaxed regions of the cluster,determined under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, can beparameterized by a navarro, frenk &amp; white (1997) model with a scale radiusr_s~0.4 h_50^{-1} mpc and a concentration parameter c~6. the best-fit chandramass model is in good agreement with independent measurements from weakgravitational lensing studies. strong lensing data for the central regions ofthe cluster can be also explained by the introduction of an additional massclump centred on the second brightest galaxy. we argue that this galaxy islikely to have been the dominant galaxy of the recently merged subcluster.

astro-ph;0203312	conduction and cooling flows	chandra and xmm-newton observations have confirmed the presence of largetemperature gradients within the cores of many relaxed clusters of galaxies.here we investigate whether thermal conduction operating over those gradientscan supply sufficient heat to offset radiative cooling. narayan &amp; medvedev(2001) and gruzinov (2002) have noted, using published results on clustertemperatures, that conduction within a factor of a few of the spitzer rate issufficient to balance bremsstrahlung cooling. from a detailed study of thetemperature and emission measure profiles of abell 2199 and abell 1835, we findthat the heat flux required by conduction is consistent with or below the ratepredicted by spitzer in the outer regions of the core. conduction may thereforeexplain the lack of observational evidence for large mass cooling ratesinferred from arguments based simply on radiative cooling, provided thatconductivity is suppressed by no more than a factor of three below the fullspitzer rate. to stem cooling in the cluster centre, however, would necessitateconductivity values at least a factor of two larger than the spitzer values,which we consider implausible. this may provide an explanation for the observedstar formation and optical nebulosities in cluster cores. the solution islikely to be time dependent. we briefly discuss the possible origin of thecooler gas and the implications for massive galaxies.

astro-ph;0206382	exciting molecular hydrogen in the central galaxies of cooling flows	the origin of rovibrational h_2 emission in the central galaxies of coolingflow clusters is poorly understood. here we address this issue using data fromour near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 32 of the most line luminous suchsystems, presented in the companion paper by edge et al. (2002).  we consider excitation by x-rays from the surrounding intracluster medium, uvradiation from young stars, and shocks. the v=1-0 k-band lines with upperlevels within 10^4 k of the ground state appear to be mostly thermalised(implying gas densities above ~10^5 cm^-3), with excitation temperaturestypically exceeding 2000k, as found earlier by jaffe, bremer and van der werf(2001). together with the lack of strong v=2-0 lines in the h-band, this rulesout uv fluorescence.  using the cloudy photoionisation code, we deduce that the h_2 lines canoriginate in a population of dense clouds, exposed to the same hot (t~50000k)stellar continuum as the lower density gas which produces the bulk of theforbidden optical line emission in the h-alpha luminous systems. this dense gasmay be in the form of self-gravitating clouds deposited directly by the coolingflow, or may instead be produced in the high-pressure zones behind strongshocks. furthermore, the shocked gas is likely to be gravitationally unstable,so collisions between the larger clouds may lead to the formation of globularclusters.

astro-ph;0503250	vla polarimetry observations of pks 2322-123; estimating magnetic fields  in the abell 2597 cluster	we present 5, 8, and 15 ghz total intensity and polarimetric observations ofthe radio source pks 2322-123 taken with the very large array (vla). this small(11 kpc) source is located at the center of the cooling-core cluster abell2597. the inner x-ray structure, the radio morphology, and the steep spectralindex (alpha = -1.8) in the lobes, all suggest that the radio emission isconfined by the ambient x-ray gas. we detect a small region of polarized fluxin the southern lobe and are able to calculate a faraday rotation measure (rm)of 3620 rad/m/m over this region. based on these observations and chandra x-raydata we suggest that the southern lobe has been deflected from its originalsouthwestern orientation to the south and into our line-of-sight. using theobserved rms and our calculated electron density profiles, and assuming both auniform and tangled magnetic field topology, we estimate a lower limit of theline-of-sight cluster magnetic field, b = 2.1 microgauss.

astro-ph;0510247	the low-power nucleus of pks 1246-410 in the centaurus cluster	we present chandra, very large array (vla), and very long baseline array(vlba) observations of the nucleus of ngc 4696, a giant elliptical in thecentaurus cluster of galaxies. like m87 in the virgo cluster, pks 1246-410 inthe centaurus cluster is a nearby example of a radio galaxy in a dense clusterenvironment. in analyzing the new x-ray data we have found a compact x-rayfeature coincident with the optical and radio core. while nuclear emission fromthe x-ray source is expected, its luminosity is low, &lt;10^{40} erg/s. weestimate the bondi accretion radius to be 30 pc and the accretion rate to be0.01 m_sun/yr which under the canonical radiative efficiency of 10% wouldoverproduce by 3.5 orders of magnitude the radiative luminosity. much of thisenergy can be directed into the kinetic energy of the jet, which over timeinflates the observed cavities seen in the thermal gas. the vlba observationsreveal a weak nucleus and a broad, one-sided jet extending over 25 parsecs inposition angle -150 degrees. this jet is deflected on the kpc-scale to a moreeast-west orientation (position angle of -80 degrees).

astro-ph;0510476	a very deep chandra observation of the perseus cluster: shocks, ripples  and conduction	we present the first results from a very deep chandra x-ray observation ofthe core of the perseus cluster of galaxies. a pressure map reveals a clearthick band of high pressure around the inner radio bubbles. the gas in the bandmust be expanding outward and the sharp front to it is identified as a shockfront, yet we see no temperature jump across it; indeed there is more softemission behind the shock than in front of it. we conclude that in this innerregion either thermal conduction operates efficiently or the co-existingrelativistic plasma seen as the radio mini-halo is mediating the shock. ifcommon, isothermal shocks in cluster cores mean that we cannot diagnose theexpansion speed of radio bubbles from temperature measurements alone. they canat times expand more rapidly than currently assumed without producingsignificant regions of hot gas. bubbles may also be significantly moreenergetic. the pressure ripples found in earlier images are identified asisothermal sound waves. a simple estimate based on their amplitude confirmsthat they can be an effective distributed heat source able to balance radiativecooling. we see multiphase gas with about 10^9 msun at a temperature of about0.5 kev. much, but not all, of this cooler gas is spatially associated with theoptical filamentary nebula around the central galaxy, ngc 1275. a residualcooling flow of about 50 msun/yr may be taking place. a channel is found in thepressure map along the path of the bubbles, with indications found of outerbubbles. the channel connects in the s with a curious cold front.

astro-ph;0602549	the relation between accretion rate and jet power in x-ray luminous  elliptical galaxies	using chandra x-ray observations of 9 nearby, x-ray luminous ellipticals withgood optical velocity dispersion measurements, we show that a tight correlationexists between the bondi accretion rates calculated from the x-ray data andestimated black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems inrelativistic jets. the jet powers, inferred from the energies and timescalesrequired to inflate the cavities observed in the surrounding x-ray emittinggas, can be related to the accretion rates by a power law model. a significantfraction (2.2^{+1.0}_{-0.7} per cent, for p_jet=10^{43} erg/s) of the energyassociated with the rest mass of material entering the accretion radiuseventually emerges in the jets. the data also hint that this fraction may riseslightly with increasing jet power. our results have significant implicationsfor studies of accretion, jet formation and galaxy formation. the tightcorrelation between p_bondi and p_jet suggests that the bondi formulae providea reasonable description of the accretion process, despite the likely presenceof magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas, and that theaccretion flows are approximately stable over timescales of a few millionyears. our results show that the black hole `engines' at the hearts of largeelliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem coolingand star formation, leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off atthe bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.

astro-ph;0605747	fe emission and ionized excess absorption in the luminous quasar 3c109  with xmm-newton	we report results from an xmm-newton observation of the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c109 (z=0.3056). confirming previous results, an fe emission line isdetected, possibly comprising a broad component. however, the data cannotdistinguish between an untruncated accretion disc and a case in which theinnermost 20-30 gravitational radii are missing. in fact, a partial-coveringplus narrow fe line scenario is not ruled out statistically. however, theabsorber would have to comprise hundreds/thousands very compact clouds close tothe x-ray source, which seems rather extreme a requirement. the 2-10 kevintrinsic luminosity of 3c109 is of the order of 2-3x10^45 erg/s which,combined with a recent black hole mass estimate of ~2x10^8 m_sun, implies aneddington ratio greater than unity. if partial covering is excluded, theobserved reflection fraction (of the order of unity), steep photon index(1.86), and fe line equivalent width (about 100 ev) all suggest to exclude thatthe x-ray continuum is strongly beamed, indicating that the large eddingtonratio is associated with a radiatively efficient accretion process. we alsoconfirm previous findings on the detection of low energy absorption in excessof the galactic value. the better quality of the xmm-newton data enables us toattribute the excess absorption to slightly ionized gas in the line of sight,located at the redshift of 3c109.

astro-ph;0610038	the dark matter halos of massive, relaxed galaxy clusters observed with  chandra	we use the chandra x-ray observatory to study the dark matter halos of 34massive, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters, spanning the redshift range0.06&lt;z&lt;0.7. the observed dark matter and total mass (dark-plus-luminous matter)profiles can be approximated by the navarro frenk &amp; white (hereafter nfw) modelfor cold dark matter (cdm) halos; for ~80 per cent of the clusters, the nfwmodel provides a statistically acceptable fit. in contrast, the singularisothermal sphere model can, in almost every case, be completely ruled out. weobserve a well-defined mass-concentration relation for the clusters with anintrinsic scatter in good agreement with the predictions from simulations. theslope of the mass-concentration relation, c\propto m_vir^a/(1+z)^b witha=-0.45\pm0.12 at 95 per cent confidence, is steeper than the value a~-0.1predicted by cdm simulations for lower mass halos. with the slope a included asa free fit parameter, the redshift evolution of the concentration parameter,b=0.71\pm0.52 at 95 per cent confidence, is consistent with the samesimulations (b~1). fixing a~-0.1 leads to an apparent evolution that issignificantly slower, b=0.30\pm0.49, although the goodness of fit in this caseis significantly worse. using a generalized nfw model, we find the inner darkmatter density slope, alpha, to be consistent with unity at 95 per centconfidence for the majority of clusters. combining the results for all clustersfor which the generalized nfw model provides a good description of the data, wemeasure alpha=0.88\pm0.29 at 95 per cent confidence, in agreement with cdmmodel predictions.

astro-ph;0612233	monitoring the bi-directional relativistic jets of the radio galaxy 3c  338	we present the analysis of vla and vlba observations of the radio source 3c338, associated with the cd galaxy ngc 6166, the central dominant galaxy of thecluster abell 2199. the vlba observations were done at 8.4 and 15.4 ghz, whilethe vla observations were performed at 0.074, 0.330, and 8.4 ghz. themilliarcsecond resolution vlba data, spanning 7 years, reveal the parsec-scalejets, whose kinematics and orientation cannot be unambiguously derived. basedon the observed morphology, jet/counter-jet length ratio, flux density ratio,and proper motions of the jet components, we consider two possibleexplanations: either the jets are strongly relativistic and lie within 10 - 20degrees of the plane of the sky, or they are only mildly relativistic, and arepointing at an angle between 30 - 50 degrees from the plane of the sky. thearcsecond resolution vla data enable us to investigate the large scalestructure of the radio source. the morphology of the low frequency radio lobesclearly indicates that they are associated with the cavities present in thex-ray emission. low frequency observations also reveal an extension to thesouth corresponding to an x-ray hole. the age of these bubbles, computed fromthe sound speed, the buoyancy time and the radiative age are all in fairagreement with each other. estimates of the power necessary to inflate thesecavities suggest that the accretion power onto the central engine has not beenconstant over time.

astro-ph;9503107	cooling flows, central galaxy--cluster alignments, x-ray absorption and  dust	we present the analysis of pointed rosat pspc observations of five of themost luminous, intermediate redshift ($0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.15$) clusters of galaxiesdetected in the rosat all-sky survey. the pspc data are combined with opticalccd images and spectra to examine the relationship between clusters and theircentral cluster galaxies (ccgs). abell 1068, abell 1361 and abell 1664 containthree of the most optically line-luminous ccgs known. the pspc x-ray data showthat these galaxies lie at the centres of massive (200 -- 400 solar masses peryear) cooling flows. the alignment between ccgs and their host clusters hasbeen investigated. for those clusters with cooling flows, the position anglesof the x-ray emission from the clusters and the optical emission from the ccgsagrees within 5 degrees. for the one probable non-cooling flow cluster in thesample, abell 2208, the alignment is significantly poorer. we examine theevidence for intrinsic x-ray absorption in the clusters. the x-ray spectra forabell 1068 and abell 1664 show that the cooling flows in these clusters areintrinsically absorbed by equivalent hydrogen column densities $\geq 10^{21}atom cm$^{-2}$. the optical spectra of the ccgs in these clusters exhibitsubstantial intrinsic reddening, at levels consistent with the x-ray absorptionresults if standard dust to gas ratios are assumed.

astro-ph;9506036	a combined x-ray and gravitational lensing study of the massive  cooling-flow cluster pks0745-191	we present spatially-resolved x-ray spectroscopy of the x-ray luminouscluster of galaxies, pks0745-191, using observations made with the asca androsat satellites. the x-ray data measure the density, temperature, andmetallicity profiles of the cluster gas and constrain the distribution of massin the cluster to a radius of \sim 1.5 mpc. we report the discovery of a brightgravitationally-lensed arc at a redshift, z_{\rm arc} = 0.433, in the cluster.this result identifies pks0745 as the lowest-redshift cluster (z_{\rm clus} =0.1028) known to exhibit gravitational lensing. the properties of the lensedsource are consistent with an s_{\rm ab} galaxy with ongoing star formation.the projected cluster mass determined from lensing arguments is in excellentagreement with the value measured from a multiphase analysis of the x-ray data.this contrasts with previously-reported results for the clusters abell 1689 andabell 2218, for which discrepancies of \sim a factor 2 in the lensing and x-raymasses are observed. at both x-ray and optical wavelengths pks0745 appearsregular and dynamically relaxed. abell 1689 and abell 2218 exhibit more complexdynamical states, indicative of ongoing merger events. we suggest that mergingactivity has lead to line-of-sight mass enhancements in these systems. thex-ray spectra and images presented here confirm that pks0745 contains one ofthe largest known cooling flows, with a mass deposition rate of \sim 1000\msunpyr.

astro-ph;9612032	the spatial distributions of cooling gas and intrinsic x-ray absorbing  material in cooling flows	we present the results from a study of the spatial distributions of coolinggas and intrinsic x-ray absorbing material in a sample of nearby, x-ray brightcooling flow clusters observed with the position sensitive proportional counter(pspc) on rosat. our method of analysis employs x-ray colour profiles, formedfrom ratios of the surface brightness profiles of the clusters in selectedenergy bands, and an adapted version of the deprojection code of fabian et. al(1981). we show that all of the cooling flow clusters in our sample exhibitsignificant central concentrations of cooling gas. at larger radii the clustersappear approximately isothermal. in detail, the spatial distributions andemissivity of the cooling material are shown to be in excellent agreement withthe predictions from the deprojection code, and can be used to constrain theages of the cooling flows. the x-ray colour profiles also indicate substantiallevels of intrinsic x-ray absorption in the clusters. the intrinsic absorptionincreases with decreasing radius, and is confined to the regions occupied bythe cooling flows. we explore a range of likely spatial distributions for theabsorbing gas and discuss the complexities involved in the measurement ofcolumn densities from x-ray data. comparison of our results with previouslyreported observations made with einstein observatory solid state spectrometer(white et. al 1991) shows reasonable agreement, but requires that the absorbingmaterial only partially covers the x-ray emitting regions. the resultspresented in this paper provide strong support for the standard model ofinhomogeneous cooling flows in clusters of galaxies.

astro-ph;9710217	resolving the discrepancy between x-ray and gravitational lensing mass  measurements for clusters of galaxies	we present a detailed comparison of mass measurements for clusters ofgalaxies using asca and rosat x-ray data and constraints from strong and weakgravitational lensing. our results for a sample of 13 clusters provide aconsistent description of the distribution of gravitating matter in thesesystems. for the 6 cooling-flow clusters in the sample, which are the moredynamically-relaxed systems, the x-ray and strong gravitational lensing massmeasurements show excellent agreement. the core radii for the massdistributions are small, with a mean value of ~ 50 $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc.  for the non-cooling flow clusters, the masses determined from the stronglensing data exceed the x-ray values by factors of $2-4$. however, significantoffsets between the x-ray and lensing centres are observed, indicating that thex-ray and strong-lensing data are probing different lines of sight through theclusters. these offsets, and the generally complex dynamical states of theclusters inferred from their x-ray morphologies, lensing data and galaxydistributions, suggest that the gravitational potentials in the central regionsof the non-cooling flow systems are evolving rapidly, and that the assumptionof hydrostatic equilibrium involved in the x-ray mass measurements is likely tohave broken down. the discrepancies between the x-ray and strong lensing massmeasurements may be reconciled if the dynamical activity has caused the x-rayanalyses to overestimate the core radii of the dominant mass clumps in theseclusters. on larger spatial scales, comparisons of the x-ray mass results withmeasurements from weak gravitational lensing show excellent agreement for bothcooling-flow and non-cooling flow clusters.

astro-ph;9805122	a rosat study of the cores of clusters of galaxies - i. cooling flows in  an x-ray flux-limited sample	this is the first part of a study of the detailed x-ray properties of thecores of nearby clusters. we have used the flux-limited sample of 55 clustersof edge et al. (1990) and archival and proprietary data from the {\it rosat}observatory. in this paper an x-ray spatial analysis based on thesurface-brightness-deprojection technique is applied to the clusters in thesample with the aim of studying their cooling flow properties. we determine thefraction of cooling flows in this sample to be 70-90 percent and estimate thecontribution of the flow region to the cluster x-ray luminosity. we show thatthe luminosity within a strong cooling flow can account for up to 70 percent ofa cluster x-ray bolometric luminosity. our analysis indicates that about 40percent of the clusters in the sample have flows depositing more than 100\msunpyr throughout the cooling region and that these possibly have beenundisturbed for many gyr, confirming that cooling flows are the natural stateof cluster cores. new cooling flows in the sample are presented and previouslyambiguous ones are clarified. we have constructed a catalogue of someintracluster medium properties for the clusters in this sample. the profiles ofthe mass deposited from cooling flows are analyzed and evidence presented forthe existence of breaks in some of the profiles. comparison is made to recentoptical and radio data. we cross-correlate our sample with the green bank, nvssand first surveys and to the volume-limited sample of brightest clustergalaxies presented by lauer and postman (1994). although weak trends exist, nostrong correlation between optical magnitude or radio power of the brightestcluster galaxy and the strength of the flow is found.

astro-ph;9905053	low radiative efficiency accretion in the nuclei of elliptical galaxies	the discovery of hard, power-law x-ray emission from a sample of six nearbyelliptical galaxies, including the dominant galaxies of the virgo,fornax andcentaurus clusters (m87, ngc 1399 and ngc 4696, respectively), and ngc 4472,4636 and 4649 in the virgo cluster, has important implications for the study ofquiescent supermassive black holes. we describe how the broad band spectralenergy distributions of these galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseoushalos at rates comparable to their bondi rates, can be explained bylow-radiative efficiency accretion flows in which a significant fraction of themass, angular momentum and energy is removed from the flows by winds. theobserved suppression of the synchrotron component in the radio band and thesystematically hard x-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermalbremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that significant mass outflowis a natural consequence of systems accreting at low-radiative efficiencies. webriefly discuss an alternative model for the x-ray emission, namely that it isdue to nonthermal synchrotron-self compton processes in the accretion flow, orwind. this appears to require implausibly weak magnetic fields. emission from acollimated jet viewed off axis should be distinguishable from thebremsstrahlung model by variability and thermal line emission studies. we arguethat the difference in radiative efficiency between the nuclei of spiral andelliptical galaxies arises from the different manner in which interstellar gasis fed into the nuclei. in ellipticals, matter fed from the hot (slowlycooling) ism is likely to be highly magnetized and with low specific angularmomentum, both of which favor low-radiative efficiency accretion solutions andpossibly the formation of the observed jets.

0811.0834	chandra measurements of non-thermal-like x-ray emission from massive,  merging, radio-halo clusters	we report the discovery of spatially-extended, non-thermal-like emissioncomponents in chandra x-ray spectra for five of a sample of seven massive,merging galaxy clusters with powerful radio halos. the emission components canbe fitted by power-law models with mean photon indices in the range 1.5 &lt; gamma&lt; 2.0. a control sample of regular, dynamically relaxed clusters, without radiohalos but with comparable mean thermal temperatures and luminosities, shows nocompelling evidence for similar components. detailed x-ray spectral mappingreveals the complex thermodynamic states of the radio halo clusters. ourdeepest observations, of the bullet cluster 1e 0657-56, demonstrate a spatialcorrelation between the strongest power-law x-ray emission, highest thermalpressure, and brightest 1.34ghz radio halo emission in this cluster. we confirmthe presence of a shock front in the 1e 0657-56 and report the discovery of anew, large-scale shock front in abell 2219. we explore possible origins for thepower-law x-ray components. these include inverse compton scattering of cosmicmicrowave background photons by relativistic electrons in the clusters;bremsstrahlung from supra-thermal electrons energized by coulomb collisionswith an energetic, nonthermal proton population; and synchrotron emissionassociated with ultra-relativistic electrons. interestingly, we show that thepower-law signatures may also be due to complex temperature and/or metallicitystructure in clusters particularly in the presence of metallicity gradients. inthis case, an important distinguishing characteristic between the radio haloclusters and control sample of predominantly cool-core clusters is therelatively low central x-ray surface brightness of the former.
