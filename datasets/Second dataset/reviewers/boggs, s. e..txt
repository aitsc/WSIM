1106.0323	detection and imaging of the crab nebula with the nuclear compton  telescope	the nuclear compton telescope (nct) is a balloon-borne compton telescopedesigned for the study of astrophysical sources in the soft gamma-ray regime(200 kev--20 mev). nct's ten high-purity germanium crossed-strip detectorsmeasure the deposited energies and three-dimensional positions of gamma-rayinteractions in the sensitive volume, and this information is used to restrictthe initial photon to a circle on the sky using the compton scatter technique.thus nct is able to perform spectroscopy, imaging, and polarization analysis onsoft gamma-ray sources. nct is one of the next generation of compton telescopes--- so-called compact compton telescopes (ccts) --- which can achieve effectiveareas comparable to comptel's with an instrument that is a fraction of thesize. the crab nebula was the primary target for the second flight of the nctinstrument, which occurred on 17--18 may 2009 in fort sumner, new mexico.analysis of 29.3 ks of data from the flight reveals an image of the crab at asignificance of 4-sigma. this is the first reported detection of anastrophysical source by a cct.

1302.7002	a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole at the centre of ngc 1365	broad x-ray emission lines from neutral and partially ionized iron observedin active galaxies have been interpreted as fluorescence produced by thereflection of hard x-rays off the inner edge of an accretion disk. in thismodel, line broadening and distortion result from rapid rotation andrelativistic effects near the black hole, the line shape being sensitive to itsspin. alternative models in which the distortions result from absorption byintervening structures provide an equally good description of the data, andthere has been no general agreement on which is correct. recent claims that theblack hole (2e6 solar masses) at the centre of the galaxy ngc 1365 is rotatingat close to its maximum possible speed rest on the assumption of relativisticreflection. here we report x-ray observations of ngc 1365 that reveal therelativistic disk features through broadened fe line emission and an associatedcompton scattering excess of 10-30 kev. using temporal and spectral analyses,we disentangle continuum changes due to time-variable absorption fromreflection, which we find arises from a region within 2.5 gravitational radiiof the rapidly spinning black hole. absorption-dominated models that do notinclude relativistic disk reflection can be ruled out both statistically and onphysical grounds.

1306.3500	weak hard x-ray emission from two broad absorption line quasars observed  with nustar: compton-thick absorption or intrinsic x-ray weakness?	we present nustar hard x-ray observations of two x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars, pg 1004+130 (radio loud) and pg 1700+518 (radio quiet).many bal quasars appear x-ray weak, probably due to absorption by the shieldinggas between the nucleus and the accretion-disk wind. the two targets are amongthe optically brightest bal quasars, yet they are known to be significantlyx-ray weak at rest-frame 2-10 kev (16-120 times fainter than typical quasars).we would expect to obtain ~400-600 hard x-ray (&gt;10 kev) photons with nustar,provided that these photons are not significantly absorbed (nh&lt;1e24 cm^{-2}).however, both bal quasars are only detected in the softer nustar bands (e.g.,4-20 kev) but not in its harder bands (e.g., 20-30 kev), suggesting that eitherthe shielding gas is highly compton-thick or the two targets are intrinsicallyx-ray weak. we constrain the column densities for both to be nh~7e24 cm^{-2} ifthe weak hard x-ray emission is caused by obscuration from the shielding gas.we discuss a few possibilities for how pg 1004+130 could have compton-thickshielding gas without strong fe k? line emission; dilution from jet-linkedx-ray emission is one likely explanation. we also discuss the intrinsic x-rayweakness scenario based on a coronal-quenching model relevant to the shieldinggas and disk wind of bal quasars. motivated by our nustar results, we perform achandra stacking analysis with the large bright quasar survey bal quasar sampleand place statistical constraints upon the fraction of intrinsically x-ray weakbal quasars; this fraction is likely 17-40%.

1307.1733	the nustar extragalactic survey: a first sensitive look at the  high-energy cosmic x-ray background population	we report on the first ten identifications of sources serendipitouslydetected by the nustar to provide the first sensitive census of the cosmicx-ray background (cxb) source population at &gt;10 kev. we find that thesenustar-detected sources are ~100x fainter than those previously detected at &gt;10kev and have a broad range in redshift and luminosity (z=0.020-2.923 andl_10-40 kev~4x10^{41}-5x10^{45} erg/s); the median redshift and luminosity arez~0.7 and l_10-40 kev~3x10^{44} erg/s, respectively. we characterize thesesources on the basis of broad-band ~0.5-32 kev spectroscopy, opticalspectroscopy, and broad-band ultraviolet-to-mid-infrared sed analyzes. we findthat the dominant source population is quasars with l_10-40 kev&gt;10^{44} erg/s,of which ~50% are obscured with n_h&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2}. however, none of the tennustar sources are compton thick (n_h&gt;10^{24} cm^{-2}) and we place a 90%confidence upper limit on the fraction of compton-thick quasars (l_10-40kev&gt;10^{44} erg/s) selected at &gt;10 kev of ~33% over the redshift rangez=0.5-1.1. we jointly fitted the rest-frame ~10-40 kev data for all of thenon-beamed sources with l_10-40 kev&gt;10^{43} erg/s to constrain the averagestrength of reflection; we find r&lt;1.4 for \gamma=1.8, broadly consistent withthat found for local agns observed at &gt;10 kev. we also constrain the hostgalaxy masses and find a median stellar mass of ~10^{11} m_sun, a factor ~5times higher than the median stellar mass of nearby high-energy selected agns,which may be at least partially driven by the order of magnitude higher x-rayluminosities of the nustar sources. within the low source-statistic limitationsof our study, our results suggest that the overall properties of the nustarsources are broadly similar to those of nearby high-energy selected agns butscaled up in luminosity and mass.

1310.2633	an extremely luminous and variable ultraluminous x-ray source in the  outskirts of circinus observed with nustar	following a serendipitous detection with the nustar observatory, we present amulti-epoch spectral and temporal analysis of an extreme ultraluminous x-raysource (ulx) located in the outskirts of the circinus galaxy, hereaftercircinus ulx5, including coordinated follow-up observations with xmm-newton andnustar. the nustar data presented here represent one of the first instances ofa ulx reliably detected at hard (e&gt;10 kev) x-rays. circinus ulx5 is variable onlong timescales by at least a factor of ~5 in flux, and was caught in ahistorically bright state during our 2013 observations (0.3-30.0 kev luminosityof 1.6e40 erg/s). during this epoch, the source displayed a curved 3-10 kevspectrum, broadly similar to other bright ulxs. while in many cases theinterpretation of spectral components in ulxs is uncertain, the spectral andtemporal properties of the all the high quality datasets currently availablestrongly support a simple disk-corona model reminiscent of that invoked forgalactic binaries, with the accretion disk becoming more prominent as theluminosity increases. however, although the disk temperature and luminosity areremarkably well correlated across all timescales currently probed, the observedluminosity follows t^(1.70+/-0.17), flatter than that expected for simpleblackbody radiation. the spectral variability displayed by circinus ulx5 ishighly reminiscent of that observed from some known galactic black holebinaries (bhbs) at high luminosities. this comparison would imply a black holemass of ~90 msun for circinus ulx5. however, given the diverse behaviorobserved from galactic bhb accretion disks, this mass estimate is stilluncertain. finally, the limits placed on any undetected iron absorptionfeatures with the 2013 dataset imply that we are not viewing the centralregions of circinus ulx5 through any extreme super-eddington outflow.[abridged]

1310.5776	constraints on the neutron star and inner accretion flow in serpens x-1  using nustar	we report on an observation of the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary serpensx-1, made with nustar. the extraordinary sensitivity afforded by nustarfacilitated the detection of a clear, robust, relativistic fe k emission linefrom the inner disk. a relativistic profile is required over a single gaussianline from any charge state of fe at the 5-sigma level of confidence, and anytwo gaussians of equal width at the same confidence. the comptonback-scattering "hump" peaking in the 10-20 kev band is detected for the firsttime in a neutron star x-ray binary. fits with relativistically-blurred diskreflection models suggest that the disk likely extends close to the innermoststable circular orbit (isco) or stellar surface. the best-fit blurredreflection models constrain the gravitational redshift from the stellar surfaceto be z &gt; 0.16. the data are broadly compatible with the disk extending to theisco; in that case, z &gt; 0.22 and r &lt; 12.6 km (assuming m = 1.4 msun and a=0,where a = cj/gm^2). if the star is as large or larger than its isco, or if theeffective reflecting disk leaks across the isco to the surface, the redshiftconstraints become measurements. we discuss our results in the context ofefforts to measure fundamental properties of neutron stars, and models foraccretion onto compact objects.

1406.3345	the 2-79 kev x-ray spectrum of the circinus galaxy with nustar,  xmm-newton and chandra: a fully compton-thick agn	the circinus galaxy is one of the nearest obscured agn, making it an idealtarget for detailed study. combining archival chandra and xmm-newton data withnew nustar observations, we model the 2-79 kev spectrum to constrain theprimary agn continuum and to derive physical parameters for the obscuringmaterial. chandra's high angular resolution allows a separation of nuclear andoff-nuclear galactic emission. in the off-nuclear diffuse emission we findsignatures of strong cold reflection, including high equivalent-width neutralfe lines. this compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts to 18% of thenuclear flux in the fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclearemission above 30 kev. the new analysis no longer supports a prominenttransmitted agn component in the observed band. we find that the nuclearspectrum is consistent with compton-scattering by an optically-thick torus,where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\gamma = 2.2-2.4$,the torus has an equatorial column density of $n_{\rm h} =(6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic agn $2-10$ kev luminosity is$(2.3-5.1)\times 10^{42}$ erg/s. these values place circinus along the samerelations as unobscured agn in accretion rate-vs-$\gamma$ and $l_x$-vs-$l_{ir}$phase space. nustar's high sensitivity and low background allow us to study theshort time-scale variability of circinus at x-ray energies above 10 kev for thefirst time. the lack of detected variability favors a compton-thick absorber,in line with the the spectral fitting results.

1407.1844	nustar unveils a compton-thick type 2 quasar in mrk 34	we present nustar 3-40 kev observations of the optically selected type 2quasar (qso2) sdss j1034+6001 or mrk 34. the high-quality hard x-ray spectrumand archival xmm-newton data can be fitted self-consistently with areflection-dominated continuum and strong fe kalpha fluorescence line withequivalent-width &gt;1 kev. prior x-ray spectral fitting below 10 kev showed thesource to be consistent with being obscured by compton-thin column densities ofgas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns frommultiwavelength data. nustar now enables a direct measurement of this column,and shows that nh lies in the compton-thick (ct) regime. the new data also showa high intrinsic 2-10 kev luminosity of l_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast toprevious low-energy x-ray measurements for which l_{2-10}&lt;~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.x-ray selection below 10 kev does not pick up this source as an intrinsicallyluminous obscured quasar). both the obscuring column and the intrinsic powerare about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-nustarx-ray spectral fitting. mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' ct qso2 and is thenearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local ctquasar ngc6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strongstar-formation. for typical x-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretionluminosity of mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infraredluminosity. x-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related tostar-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3kev, favoring photionization instead.

1407.8223	the nustar spectrum of mrk 335: extreme relativistic effects within 2  gravitational radii of the event horizon?	we present 3-50 kev nustar observations of the agn mrk 335 in a very low fluxstate. the spectrum is dominated by very strong features at the energies of theiron line at 5-7 kev and compton hump from 10-30 kev. the source is variableduring the observation, with the variability concentrated at low energies,which suggesting either a relativistic reflection or a variable absorptionscenario. in this work we focus on the reflection interpretation, making use ofnew relativistic reflection models that self consistently calculate thereflection fraction, relativistic blurring and angle-dependent reflectionspectrum for different coronal heights to model the spectra. we find that thespectra can be well fit with relativistic reflection, and that the lowest fluxstate spectrum is described by reflection alone, suggesting the effects ofextreme light-bending occurring within ~2 gravitational radii of the eventhorizon. the reflection fraction decreases sharply with increasing flux,consistent with a point source moving up to above 10 rg as the sourcebrightens. we constrain the spin parameter to greater than 0.9 at the 3 sigmaconfidence level. by adding a spin-dependent upper limit on the reflectionfraction to our models, we demonstrate that this can be a powerful way ofconstraining the spin parameter, particularly in reflection dominated states.we also calculate a detailed emissivity profile for the iron line, and findthat it closely matches theoretical predictions for a compact source within afew rg of the black hole.

1408.3633	weak hard x-ray emission from broad absorption line quasars: evidence  for intrinsic x-ray weakness	we report nustar observations of a sample of six x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars. these targets, at z=0.148-1.223, are among the opticallybrightest and most luminous bal quasars known at z&lt;1.3. however, theirrest-frame 2 kev luminosities are 14 to &gt;330 times weaker than expected fortypical quasars. our results from a pilot nustar study of two low-redshift balquasars, a chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift bal quasars,and a nustar spectral analysis of the local bal quasar mrk 231 have alreadysuggested the existence of intrinsically x-ray weak bal quasars, i.e., quasarsnot emitting x-rays at the level expected from their optical/uv emission. theaim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinaryobjects. three of the six new targets are weakly detected by nustar with &lt;45counts in the 3-24 kev band, and the other three are not detected. the hardx-ray (8-24 kev) weakness observed by nustar requires compton-thick absorptionif these objects have nominal underlying x-ray emission. however, a softstacked effective photon index ({\gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavorscompton-thick absorption in general. the uniform hard x-ray weakness observedby nustar for this and the pilot samples selected with &lt;10 kev weakness alsosuggests that the x-ray weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets.we conclude that the nustar observations have likely discovered a significantpopulation (&gt;33%) of intrinsically x-ray weak objects among the bal quasarswith significantly weak &lt;10 kev emission. we suggest that intrinsically x-rayweak quasars might be preferentially observed as bal quasars.

1408.5281	nustar reveals the comptonizing corona of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c  382	broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs) are active galactic nuclei that producepowerful, large-scale radio jets, but appear as seyfert 1 galaxies in theiroptical spectra. in the x-ray band, blrgs also appear like seyfert galaxies,but with flatter spectra and weaker reflection features. one explanation forthese properties is that the x-ray continuum is diluted by emission from thejet. here, we present two nustar observations of the blrg 3c 382 that showclear evidence that the continuum of this source is dominated by thermalcomptonization, as in seyfert 1 galaxies. the two observations were separatedby over a year and found 3c 382 in different states separated by a factor of1.7 in flux. the lower flux spectrum has a photon-index of$\gamma=1.68^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, while the photon-index of the higher fluxspectrum is $\gamma=1.78^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. thermal and anisotropiccomptonization models provide an excellent fit to both spectra and show thatthe coronal plasma cooled from $kt_e=330\pm 30$ kev in the low flux data to$231^{+50}_{-88}$ kev in the high flux observation. this cooling behavior istypical of comptonizing corona in seyfert galaxies and is distinct from thevariations observed in jet-dominated sources. in the high flux observation,simultaneous swift data are leveraged to obtain a broadband spectral energydistribution and indicates that the corona intercepts $\sim 10$% of the opticaland ultraviolet emitting accretion disk. 3c 382 exhibits very weak reflectionfeatures, with no detectable relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line, that may be bestexplained by an outflowing corona combined with an ionized inner accretiondisk.

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1410.3357	iron k and compton hump reverberation in swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc 1365  revealed by nustar and xmm-newton	in the past five years, a flurry of x-ray reverberation lag measurements ofaccreting supermassive black holes have been made using the xmm-newtontelescope in the 0.3-10 kev energy range. in this work, we use the nustartelescope to extend the lag analysis up to higher energies for two seyfertgalaxies, swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc 1365. x-ray reverberation lags are due tothe light travel time delays between the direct continuum emission and thereprocessed emission from the inner radii of an ionised accretion disc.xmm-newton has been particularly adept at measuring the lag associated with thebroad fe k emission line, where the gravitationally redshifted wing of the lineis observed to respond before the line centroid at 6.4 kev, produced at largerradii. now we use nustar to probe the lag at higher energies, where thespectrum shows clear evidence for compton reflection, known as the compton'hump'. the xmm-newton data show fe k lags in both swift j2127.4+5654 and ngc1365. the nustar data provide independent confirmation of these fe k lags, andalso show evidence for the corresponding compton hump lags, especially in swiftj2127.4+5654. these broadband lag measurements confirm that the compton humpand fe k lag are produced at small radii. at low-frequencies in ngc 1365, wherethe spectrum shows evidence for eclipsing clouds in the line of sight, we finda clear negative (not positive) lag from 2--10 kev, which can be understood asthe decrease in column density from a neutral eclipsing cloud moving out of ourline of sight during the observation.

1410.3590	an ultraluminous x-ray source powered by an accreting neutron star	ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) are off-nuclear point sources in nearbygalaxies whose x-ray luminosity exceeds the theoretical maximum for sphericalinfall (the eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. their luminosityranges from $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1} &lt; l_x$(0.5 - 10 kev) $&lt;10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$.since higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to theisotropic eddington limit theoretical models have focused on black hole ratherthan neutron star systems. the most challenging sources to explain are those atthe luminous end ($l_x$ &gt; $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which require black holemasses mbh &gt;50 solar masses and/or significant departures from the standardthin disk accretion that powers bright galactic x-ray binaries. here we reportbroadband x-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy m82, whichcontains two bright ulxs. the observations reveal pulsations of average period1.37 s with a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. the pulsations result from therotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from itsbinary orbit. the pulsed flux alone corresponds to $l_x$(3 - 30 kev) = $4.9\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the pulsating source is spatially coincident witha variable ulx which can reach $l_x$ (0.3 - 10 kev) = $1.8 \times 10^{40}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this association implies a luminosity ~100 times the eddington limitfor a 1.4 solar mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any knownaccreting pulsar. this finding implies that neutron stars may not be rare inthe ulx population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion ofmatter onto magnetized compact objects.

1502.07353	determining the covering factor of compton-thick active galactic nuclei  with nustar	the covering factor of compton-thick obscuring material associated with thetorus in active galactic nuclei (agn) is at present best understood through thefraction of sources exhibiting compton-thick absorption along the line of sight($n_{h}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the x-ray band, which reveals theaverage covering factor. determining this compton-thick fraction is difficulthowever, due to the extreme obscuration. with its spectral coverage at hardx-rays ($&gt;$10 kev), nustar is sensitive to the agn covering factor sincecompton scattering of x-rays off optically thick material dominates at theseenergies. we present a spectral analysis of 10 agn observed with nustar wherethe obscuring medium is optically thick to compton scattering, so calledcompton-thick (ct) agn. we use the torus models of brightman &amp; nandra whichpredict the x-ray spectrum from reprocessing in a torus and include the torusopening angle as a free parameter and aim to determine the covering factor ofthe compton-thick gas in these sources individually. across the sample we findmild to heavy compton-thick columns, with $n_{h}$ measured from$10^{24}-10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a wide range of covering factors, whereindividual measurements range from 0.2-0.9. we find that the covering factor,$f_{c}$, is a strongly decreasing function of the intrinsic 2-10 kevluminosity, $l_{x}$, where $f_{c}=(-0.41\pm0.13)$log$_{10}$($l_{x}$/ergs$^{-1}$)$+18.31\pm5.33$, across more than two orders of magnitude in $l_{x}$(10$^{41.5}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). the covering factors measured here agreewell with the obscured fraction as a function of $l_{x}$ as determined bystudies of local agn with $l_{x}&gt;10^{42.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$.

1505.02788	distorted cyclotron line profile in cep x-4 as observed by nustar	we present spectral analysis of nustar and swift observations of cep x-4during its outburst in 2014. we observed the source once during the peak of theoutburst and once during the decay, finding good agreement in the spectralshape between the observations. we describe the continuum using a powerlaw witha fermi-dirac cutoff at high energies. cep x-4 has a very strong cyclotronresonant scattering feature (crsf) around 30 kev. a simple absorption-like linewith a gaussian optical depth or a pseudo-lorentzian profile both fail todescribe the shape of the crsf accurately, leaving significant deviations atthe red side of the line. we characterize this asymmetry with a secondabsorption feature around 19 kev. the line energy of the crsf, which is notinfluenced by the addition of this feature, shows a small but significantpositive luminosity dependence. with luminosities between (1-6)e36 erg/s, cepx-4 is below the theoretical limit where such a correlation is expected. thisbehavior is similar to vela x-1 and we discuss parallels between the twosystems.

1506.00007	nustar and suzaku observations of the hard state in cygnus x-1: locating  the inner accretion disk	we present simultaneous nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar ) andsuzaku observations of the x-ray binary cygnus x-1 in the hard state. this isthe first time this state has been observed in cyg x-1 with nustar, whichenables us to study the reflection and broad-band spectra in unprecedenteddetail. we confirm that the iron line cannot be fit with a combination ofnarrow lines and absorption features, and instead requires a relativisticallyblurred profile in combination with a narrow line and absorption from thecompanion wind. we use the reflection models of garcia et al. (2014) tosimultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronalheight in a self-consistent manner. detailed fits to the iron line profileindicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and alow source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitationalradii at the 3{\sigma} confidence level. in addition, we find that the lineprofile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, andthat the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflectionspectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. we find that the blurringparameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line or the entirebroad-band spectrum, which is well modelled with a comptonized continuum plusreflection model.

1506.01381	the complex accretion geometry of gx 339-4 as seen by nustar and swift	we present spectral analysis of five nustar and swift observations of gx339-4 taken during a failed outburst in summer 2013. these observations covereddington luminosity fractions in the range ~0.9-6%. throughout this outburst,gx 339-4 stayed in the hard state, and all five observations show similar x-rayspectra with a hard power-law with a photon index near 1.6 and significantcontribution from reflection. using simple reflection models we findunrealistically high iron abundances. allowing for different photon indices forthe continuum incident on the reflector relative to the underlying observedcontinuum results in a statistically better fit and reduced iron abundances.with a photon index around 1.3, the input power-law on the reflector issignificantly harder than that which is directly observed. we study theinfluence of different emissivity profiles and geometries and consistently findan improvement when using separate photon indices. the inferred inner accretiondisk radius is strongly model dependent, but we do not find evidence for atruncation radius larger than 100 r_g in any model. the data do not allowindependent spin constraints but the results are consistent with the literature(i.e., a&gt;0). our best-fit models indicate an inclination angle in the range40-60 degrees, consistent with limits on the orbital inclination but higherthan reported in the literature using standard reflection models. the iron linearound 6.4 kev is clearly broadened, and we detect a superimposed narrow coreas well. this core originates from a fluorescence region outside the influenceof the strong gravity of the black hole and we discuss possible geometries.

1506.02513	antideuteron sensitivity for the gaps experiment	the general antiparticle spectrometer (gaps) is a novel approach for indirectdark matter searches that exploits cosmic antiparticles, especiallyantideuterons. the gaps antideuteron measurement utilizes distinctive detectionmethods using atomic x-rays and charged particles from the decay of exoticatoms as well as the timing and stopping range of the incoming particle, whichtogether provide excellent antideuteron identification. prior to the futureballoon experiment, an accelerator test and a prototype flight weresuccessfully conducted in 2005 and 2012 respectively, in order to verify thegaps detection concept. this paper describes how the sensitivity of gaps toantideuterons was estimated using a monte carlo simulation along with theatomic cascade model and the intra-nuclear cascade model. the sensitivity forthe gaps antideuteron search obtained using this method is 2.0 $\times 10^{-6}$[m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$(gev/$n$)$^{-1}$] for the proposed long durationballoon program (ldb, 35 days $\times$ 3 flights), indicating that gaps has astrong potential to probe a wide variety of dark matter annihilation and decaymodels through antideuteron measurements. gaps is proposed to fly fromantarctica in the austral summer of 2019-2020.

1506.05120	nustar reveals extreme absorption in z &lt; 0.5 type 2 quasars	the intrinsic column density (nh) distribution of quasars is poorly known. atthe high obscuration end of the quasar population and for redshifts z&lt;1, thex-ray spectra can only be reliably characterized using broad-band measurementswhich extend to energies above 10 kev. using the hard x-ray observatory nustar,along with archival chandra and xmm-newton data, we study the broad-band x-rayspectra of nine optically selected (from the sdss), candidate compton-thick (nh&gt; 1.5e24 cm^-2) type 2 quasars (ctqso2s); five new nustar observations arereported herein, and four have been previously published. the candidate ctqso2slie at z&lt;0.5, have observed [oiii] luminosities in the range 8.4 &lt; log(l_[oiii]/l_solar) &lt; 9.6, and show evidence for extreme, compton-thickabsorption when indirect absorption diagnostics are considered. amongst thenine candidate ctqso2s, five are detected by nustar in the high energy (8-24kev) band: two are weakly detected at the ~ 3 sigma confidence level and threeare strongly detected with sufficient counts for spectral modeling (&gt;~ 90 netsource counts at 8-24 kev). for these nustar-detected sources direct (i.e.,x-ray spectral) constraints on the intrinsic agn properties are feasible, andwe measure column densities ~2.5-1600 times higher and intrinsic (unabsorbed)x-ray luminosities ~10-70 times higher than pre-nustar constraints from chandraand xmm-newton. assuming the nustar-detected type 2 quasars are representativeof other compton-thick candidates, we make a correction to the nh distributionfor optically selected type 2 quasars as measured by chandra and xmm-newton for39 objects. with this approach, we predict a compton-thick fraction of f_ct =36^{+14}_{-12} %, although higher fractions (up to 76%) are possible ifindirect absorption diagnostics are assumed to be reliable.

1509.01248	a soft x-ray spectral episode for the clocked burster, gs 1826-24 as  measured by swift and nustar	we report on nustar and swift observations of a soft state of the neutronstar low-mass x-ray binary gs 1826-24, commonly known as the "clocked" burster.the transition to the soft state was recorded in 2014 june through an increaseof the 2-20 kev source intensity measured by maxi, simultaneous with a decreaseof the 15-50 kev intensity measured by swift/bat. the episode lastedapproximately two months, after which the source returned to its usual hardstate. we analyze the broad-band spectrum measured by swift/xrt and nustar, andestimate the accretion rate during the soft episode to be about 13% ofeddington, within the range of previous observations. however, the best fitspectral model, adopting the double comptonization used previously, exhibitssignificantly softer components. we detect seven type-i x-ray bursts, allsignificantly weaker (and with shorter rise and decay times) than observedpreviously. the burst profiles and recurrence times vary significantly, rulingout the regular bursts that are typical for this source. one burst exhibitedphotospheric radius expansion, and we estimate the source distance at about(5.7 / xi_b^1/2) kpc, where xi_b parameterizes the possible anisotropy of theburst emission. interpreting the soft state as a transition from an opticallythin inner flow to an optically thick flow passing through a boundary layer, asis commonly observed in similar systems, is contradicted by the lower opticaldepth measured for the double comptonization model we find for this soft state.the effect of a change in disk geometry on the burst behavior remains unclear.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0305377	polarization of the prompt gamma-ray emission from the gamma-ray burst  of 6 december 2002	observations of the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have revealed thatthey lie at cosmological distances, and so correspond to the release of anenormous amount of energy. the nature of the central engine that powers theseevents and the prompt gamma-ray emission mechanism itself remain enigmaticbecause, once a relativistic fireball is created, the physics of the afterglowis insensitive to the nature of the progenitor. here we report the discovery oflinear polarization in the prompt gamma-ray emission from grb021206, whichindicates that it is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in astrong magnetic field. the polarization is at the theoretical maximum, whichrequires a uniform, large-scale magnetic field over the gamma-ray emissionregion. a large-scale magnetic field constrains possible progenitors to thoseeither having or producing organized fields. we suggest that the large magneticenergy densities in the progenitor environment (comparable to the kineticenergy densities of the fireball), combined with the large-scale structure ofthe field, indicate that magnetic fields drive the grb explosion.

astro-ph;0406173	unified 1-d simulations of gamma-ray line emission from type ia  supernovae	the light curves of type ia supernovae (sn ia) are powered by gamma-raysemitted by the decay of radioactive elements such as $^{56}$ni and its decayproducts. these gamma-rays are downscattered,absorbed, and eventuallyreprocessed into the optical emission which makes up the bulk of all supernovaobservations. detection of the gamma-rays that escape the expanding starprovide the only direct means to study this power source for sn ia lightcurves. unfortunately, disagreements between calculations for the gamma-raylines have made it difficult to interpret any gamma-ray observations.  here we present a detailed comparison of the major gamma-ray line transportcodes for a series of 1-dimensional ia models. discrepancies in past resultswere due to errors in the codes, and the corrected versions of the sevendifferent codes yield very similar results. this convergence of the simulationresults allows us to infer more reliable information from the current set ofgamma-ray observations of sne ia. the observations of sne 1986g, 1991t and1998bu are consistent with explosion models based on their classification:sub-luminous, super-luminous and normally-luminous respectively.

astro-ph;0602233	searching for annihilation radiation from sn 1006 with spi on integral	historical type ia supernovae are a leading candidate for the source ofpositrons observed through their diffuse annihilation emission in the galaxy.however, search for annihilation emission from individual type ia supernovaehas not been possible before the improved sensitivity of \integral. the total511 kev annihilation flux from individual sne ia, as well as their contributionto the overall diffuse emission, depends critically on the escape fraction ofpositrons produced in $^{56}$co decays. late optical light curves suggest thatthis fraction may be as high as 5%. we searched for positron annihilationradiation from the historical type ia supernova sn 1006 using the spiinstrument on \integral. we did not detect significant 511 kev line emission,with a 3$\sigma$ flux upper limit of 0.59 x 10$^{-4}$ ergs cm^-2 s^-1 for \wsim1 msec exposure time, assuming a fwhm of 2.5 kev. this upper limit correspondsto a 7.5% escape fraction, 50% higher than the expected 5% escape scenario, andrules out the possibility that type ia supernovae produce all of the positronsin the galaxy (~ 12% escape fraction), if the mean positron lifetime is lessthan 10$^{5}$ years. future observations with \integral will provide strongerlimits on the escape fraction of positrons, the mean positron lifetime, and thecontribution of type ia supernovae to the overall positron content of thegalaxy.

astro-ph;9908170	diffuse galactic soft gamma-ray emission	the galactic diffuse soft gamma-ray (30-800 kev) emission has been measuredfrom the galactic center by the hiregs balloon-borne germanium spectrometer todetermine the spectral characteristics and origin of the emission. theresulting galactic diffuse continuum is found to agree well with a singlepower-law (plus positronium) over the entire energy range, consistent with rxteand comptel/cgro observations at lower and higher energies, respectively. wefind no evidence of spectral steepening below 200 kev, as has been reported inprevious observations. the spatial distribution along the galactic ridge isfound to be nearly flat, with upper limits set on the longitudinal gradient,and with no evidence of an edge in the observed region. the soft gamma-raydiffuse spectrum is well modeled by inverse compton scattering of interstellarradiation off of cosmic-ray electrons, minimizing the need to invokeinefficient nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission. the resulting power requirementis well within that provided by galactic supernovae. we speculate that themeasured spectrum provides the first direct constraints on the cosmic-rayelectron spectrum below 300 mev.
