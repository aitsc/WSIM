0903.0654	unstable helium shell burning on accreting white dwarfs	am canum venaticorum (am cvn) binaries consist of a degenerate helium donorand a helium, c/o, or o/ne wd accretor, with accretion rates of mdot = 1e-13 -1e-5 msol/yr. for accretion rates &lt; 1e-6 msol/yr, the accreted helium ignitesunstably, resulting in a helium flash. as the donor mass and mdot decrease, theignition mass increases and eventually becomes larger than the donor mass,yielding a "last-flash" ignition mass of &lt; 0.1 msol. bildsten et al. (2007)predicted that the largest outbursts of these systems will lead to dynamicalburning and thermonuclear supernovae. in this paper, we study the evolution ofthe he-burning shells in more detail. we calculate maximum achievabletemperatures as well as the minimum envelope masses that achieve dynamicalburning conditions, finding that am cvn systems with accretors &gt; 0.8 msol willundergo dynamical burning. triple-alpha reactions during the hydrostaticevolution set a lower limit to the 12c mass fraction of 0.001 - 0.05 whendynamical burning occurs, but core dredge-up may yield 12c, 16o, and/or 20nemass fractions of ~ 0.1. accreted 14n will likely remain 14n during theaccretion and convective phases, but regardless of 14n's fate, theneutron-to-proton ratio at the beginning of convection is fixed until the onsetof dynamical burning. during explosive burning, the 14n will undergo14n(a,g)18f(a,p)21ne, liberating a proton for the subsequent12c(p,g)13n(a,p)16o reaction, which bypasses the relatively slow alpha-captureonto 12c. future hydrodynamic simulations must include these isotopes, as theadditional reactions will reduce the zel'dovich-von neumann-doring (znd)length, making the propagation of the detonation wave more likely.

0706.3062	carbon detonation and shock-triggered helium burning in neutron star  superbursts	the strong degeneracy of the 12c ignition layer on an accreting neutron starresults in a hydrodynamic thermonuclear runaway, in which the nuclear heatingtime becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. we model the resultingcombustion wave during these superbursts as an upward propagating detonation.we solve the reactive fluid flow and show that the detonation propagatesthrough the deepest layers of fuel and drives a shock wave that steepens as ittravels upward into lower density material. the shock is sufficiently strongupon reaching the freshly accreted h/he layer that it triggers unstable 4heburning if the superburst occurs during the latter half of the regular type ibursting cycle; this is likely the origin of the bright type i precursor burstsobserved at the onset of superbursts. the cooling of the outermost shock-heatedlayers produces a bright, ~0.1s, flash that precedes the type i burst by a fewseconds; this may be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4u1820-30 and 4u 1636-54, the only two bursts observed with rxte at high timeresolution. the dominant products of the 12c detonation are 28si, 32s, and36ar. gupta et al. showed that a crust composed of such intermediate masselements has a larger heat flux than one composed of iron-peak elements andhelps bring the superburst ignition depth into better agreement with valuesinferred from observations.

0704.1278	turbulent mixing in the surface layers of accreting neutron stars	during accretion a neutron star (ns) is spun up as angular momentum istransported through its surface layers. we study the resulting differentiallyrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type i x-ray bursts. thepredominant viscosity is likely provided by the tayler-spruit dynamo. theradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 g and~10^10 g, respectively. this leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths ofinterest for x-ray bursts. a remaining small shear transmits the accretedangular momentum inward to the ns interior. though this shear gives littleviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. detailed simulations will berequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our modelsillustrate some general features. mixing has the greatest impact when thebuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashesis overcome. this occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, ormay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. we then find two new regimesof burning. the first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavierelements from the ashes. if ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. this may explain theshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed toexplain these bursts' energetics. when mixing is sufficiently strong, a secondregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,quenching x-ray bursts. we speculate that the observed change in x-ray burstproperties near one-tenth the eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.the carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be importantfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

0906.3767	helium white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables	binary evolution predicts a population of helium core (m &lt; 0.5 msol) whitedwarfs (wds) that are slowly accreting hydrogen-rich material from low massmain sequence or brown dwarf donors with orbital periods less than four hours.four binaries are presently known in the milky way that will reach such amass-transferring state in a few gyr. despite these predictions andobservations of progenitor binaries, there are still no secure cases of heliumcore wds among the mass-transferring cataclysmic variables (cvs). this led usto calculate the fate of he wds once accretion begins at a rate mdot &lt; 1e-10msol/yr set by angular momentum losses. we show here that the cold he coretemperatures (t_c &lt; 1e7 k) and low mdot result in ~ 1e-3 msol of accumulatedh-rich material at the onset of the thermonuclear runaway. shara andcollaborators noted that these large accumulated masses may lead toexceptionally long classical nova (cn) events. for a typical donor star of 0.2msol, such binaries will only yield a few hundred cne, making these events rareamongst all cne. we calculate the reheating of the accreting wd, allowing acomparison to the measured wd effective temperatures in quiescent dwarf novaeand raising the possibility that wd seismology may be the best way to confirmthe presence of a he wd. we also find that a very long (&gt; 1000 yr) stableburning phase occurs after the cn outburst, potentially explaining enigmaticshort orbital period supersoft sources like rx j0537-7034 (p_orb = 3.5 hr) and1e 0035.4-7230 (p_orb = 4.1 hr).

0911.0680	supernova light curves powered by young magnetars	we show that energy deposited into an expanding supernova remnant by a highlymagnetic (b ~ 5 x 10^14 g) neutron star spinning at an initial period of p ~2-20 ms can substantially brighten the light curve. for magnetars withparameters in this range, the rotational energy is released on a timescale ofdays to weeks, which is comparable to the effective diffusion time through thesupernova remnant. the late time energy injection can then be radiated withoutsuffering overwhelming adiabatic expansion losses. the magnetar input alsoproduces a central bubble which sweeps ejecta into an internal dense shell,resulting in a prolonged period of nearly constant photospheric velocity in theobserved spectra. we derive analytic expressions for the light curve rise timeand peak luminosity as a function of b, p and the properties of the supernovaejecta that allow for direct inferences about the underlying magnetar in brightsupernovae. we perform numerical radiation hydrodynamical calculations of a fewspecific instances and compare the resulting light curves to observed events.magnetar activity is likely to impact more than a few percent of all corecollapse supernovae, and may naturally explain some of the brightest eventsever seen (e.g., sn 2005ap and sn 2008es) at l &gt; 10^44 ergs/s.

1002.2258	thermonuclear .ia supernovae from helium shell detonations: explosion  models and observables	during the early evolution of an am cvn system, helium is accreted onto thesurface of a white dwarf under conditions suitable for unstable thermonuclearignition. the turbulent motions induced by the convective burning phase in thehe envelope become strong enough to influence the propagation of burning frontsand may result in the onset of a detonation. such an outcome would yieldradioactive isotopes and a faint rapidly rising thermonuclear ".ia" supernova.in this paper, we present hydrodynamic explosion models and observable outcomesof these he shell detonations for a range of initial core and envelope masses.the peak uvoir bolometric luminosities range by a factor of 10 (from 5e41 -5e42 erg/s), and the r-band peak varies from m_r,peak = -15 to -18. the risetimes in all bands are very rapid (&lt;10 d), but the decline rate is slower inthe red than the blue due to a secondary near-ir brightening. thenucleosynthesis primarily yields heavy alpha-chain elements (40ca through 56ni)and unburnt he. thus, the spectra around peak light lack signs of intermediatemass elements and are dominated by caii and tiii features, with the caveat thatour radiative transfer code does not include the non-thermal effects necessaryto produce he features.

1005.5423	pulsations in hydrogen burning low mass helium white dwarfs	helium core white dwarfs (wds) with mass m &lt;~ 0.20 msun undergo several gyrsof stable hydrogen burning as they evolve. we show that in a certain range ofwd and hydrogen envelope masses, these wds may exhibit g-mode pulsationssimilar to their passively cooling, more massive carbon/oxygen corecounterparts, the zz cetis. our models with stably burning hydrogen envelopeson helium cores yield g-mode periods and period spacings longer than thecanonical zz cetis by nearly a factor of 2. we show that core composition andstructure can be probed using seismology since the g-mode eigenfunctionspredominantly reside in the helium core. though we have not carried out a fullynonadiabatic stability analysis, the scaling of the thermal time in theconvective zone with surface gravity highlights several low-mass helium wdsthat should be observed in search of pulsations: nltt 11748, sdss j0822+2753,and the companion to psr j1012+5307. seismological studies of these he core wdsmay prove especially fruitful, as their luminosity is related (via stablehydrogen burning) to the hydrogen envelope mass, which eliminates one modelparameter.

1008.1993	diffusive nuclear burning of helium on neutron stars	diffusive nuclear burning of h by an underlying material capable of capturingprotons can readily consume h from the surface of neutron stars (nss) duringtheir early cooling history. in the absence of subsequent accretion, it will bedepleted from the photosphere. we now extend diffusive nuclear burning to he,motivated by the recent observation by ho \&amp; heinke of a carbon atmosphere onthe ns in the cassiopeia a supernova remnant. we calculate the equilibriumstructure of he on an underlying $\alpha$ capturing material, accounting forthermal, mass defect, and coulomb corrections on the stratification of materialwith the same zeroth order $\mu_e = a/z$. we show that coulomb correctionsdominate over thermal and mass defect corrections in the highly degenerate partof the envelope. we also show that the bulk of the he sits deep in the enveloperather than near the surface. thus, even if the photospheric he abundance islow, the total he column could be substantially larger than the photosphericcolumn, which may have implications for rapid surface evolution ($\approx 1$ yrtimescales) of neutron stars. when nuclear reactions are taken into account, wefind that for base temperatures $\gtrsim 1.6 \times 10^8$ k, he is readilycaptured onto c. as these high temperatures are present during the early stagesof ns evolution, we expect that the primordial he is completely depleted fromthe ns surface like the case for primordial h. we also find that magneticfields $\lesssim 10^{12}$ g do not affect our conclusions. armed with theresults of this work and our prior efforts, we expect that primordial h and heare depleted, and so any observed h or he on the surfaces of these ns must bedue to subsequent accretion (with or without spallation). if this subsequentaccretion can be prevented, the underlying mid-z material would be exposed.

1009.2509	evidence for the white dwarf nature of mira b	the nature of the accreting companion to mira --- the prototypical pulsatingasymptotic giant branch star --- has been a matter of debate for more than 25years. here we use a quantitative analysis of the rapid optical brightnessvariations from this companion, mira b, which we observed with the nickeltelescope at lick observatory, to show that it is a white dwarf (wd). theamplitude of aperiodic optical variations on time scales of minutes to tens ofminutes (approximately 0.2 mag) is consistent with that of accreting wds incataclysmic variables on these same time scales. it is significantly greaterthan that expected from an accreting main-sequence star. with mira b identifiedas a wd, its ultraviolet (uv) and optical luminosities, along with constraintson the wd effective temperature from the uv, indicate that it accretes at~1e-10 solar masses per year. we do not find any evidence that the accretionrate is higher than predicted by bondi-hoyle theory. the accretion rate is highenough, however, to explain the weak x-ray emission, since the accretion-diskboundary layer around a low-mass wd accreting at this rate is likely to beoptically thick and therefore to emit primarily in the far or extreme uv.furthermore, the finding that mira b is a wd means that it has experienced, andwill continue to experience nova explosions, roughly every million years. italso highlights the similarity between mira ab and other jet-producingsymbiotic binaries such as r aquarii, ch cygni, and mwc 560, and thereforeraises the possibility that mira b launched the recently discovered bipolarstreams from this system.

1103.0779	ptf10iya: a short-lived, luminous flare from the nuclear region of a  star-forming galaxy	we present the discovery and characterisation of ptf10iya, a short-lived (dt~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (m_g ~ -21mag) transient source found by the palomar transient factory. theultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by ablackbody with t ~ 1-2 x 10^4 k and peak bolometric luminosity l_bb ~ 1-5 x10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). acomparable amount of energy is radiated in the x-ray band that appears toresult from a distinct physical process. the location of ptf10iya is consistentwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than1.2 kpc. at first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of thecharacteristic "big blue bump" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of manyactive galactic nuclei (agns). however, emission-line diagnostics of the hostgalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show noevidence for agn-like activity. we therefore consider whether the tidaldisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole mayaccount for our observations. though with limited temporal information,ptf10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early"super-eddington" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 m_sun blackhole. regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, thelarge luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxiescan transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the eddington limit; many suchoutbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

1108.4036	the long-term evolution of double white dwarf mergers	in this paper, we present a model for the long-term evolution of the mergerof two unequal mass c/o white dwarfs (wds). after the dynamical phase of themerger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading tonearly solid-body rotation on a viscous timescale of 1e-4 to 1 yr, long beforesignificant cooling can occur. due to heating during the dynamical and viscousphases, the less massive wd is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, andradially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.  following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near theenvelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convectivecarbon-burning. if not, kelvin-helmholtz contraction of the inner region of theenvelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of theenvelope, again yielding off-center burning. as a result, the long-termevolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previouscalculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventuallyyielding a high-mass o/ne wd or a collapse to a neutron star. during thecooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near theeddington limit. given the double wd merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, tens ofthese ~1e38 erg/s sources should exist in a milky way-type galaxy.  while the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physicalpicture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previouswork. furthermore, remaining uncertainties related to the convective structurenear the photosphere and mass loss during the thermal evolution maysignificantly affect our conclusions. thus, future work within the context ofthe physical model presented here is required to better address the eventualfate of double wd mergers, including those for which one or both of thecomponents is a he wd.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1111.6867	acoustic signatures of the helium core flash	all evolved stars with masses m &lt;2 solar masses undergo an initiatingoff-center helium core flash in their 0.48 solar mass he core as they ascendthe red giant branch (rgb). this off-center flash is the first of a fewsuccessive helium shell subflashes that remove the core electron degeneracyover 2 myrs, converting the object into a he burning star. though characterizedby thomas over 40 years ago, this core flash phase has yet to beobservationally probed. using the modules for experiments in stellarastrophysics (mesa) code, we show that red giant asteroseismology enabled byspace-based photometry (i.e. kepler and corot) can probe these stars during theflash. the rapid (&lt; 100,000 years) contraction of the red giant envelope afterthe initiating flash dramatically improves the coupling of the p-modes to thecore g-modes, making the detection of l=1 mixed modes possible for these 2myrs. this duration implies that 1 in 35 stars near the red clump in the hrdiagram will be in their core flash phase. during this time, the star has ag-mode period spacing of delta p_g = 70-100 seconds, lower than the deltap_g=250 seconds of he burning stars in the red clump, but higher than the rgbstars at the same luminosity. this places them in an underpopulated part of thelarge frequency spacing (delta nu) vs. delta p_g diagram that should ease theiridentification amongst the thousands of observed red giants.

1205.6517	laterally propagating detonations in thin helium layers on accreting  white dwarfs	theoretical work has shown that intermediate mass (0.01msun&lt;m_he&lt;0.1msun)helium shells will unstably ignite on the accreting white dwarf (wd) in an amcvn binary. for more massive (m&gt;0.8msun) wds, these helium shells can be denseenough (5x10^5 g/cc) that the convectively burning region runs away on atimescale comparable to the sound travel time across the shell; raising thepossibility for an explosive outcome. the nature of the explosion (i.e.deflagration or detonation) remains ambiguous. in the case of detonation, thiscauses a laterally propagating front whose properties in these geometricallythin and low density shells we begin to study here. our calculations show thatthe radial expansion time of &lt;0.1 s leads to incomplete helium burning, inagreement with recent work by sim and collaborators, but that the nuclearenergy released is still adequate to realize a self-sustaining detonationpropagating laterally at slower than the chapman-jouguet speed. our simulationsresolve the subsonic region behind the front and are consistent with a directcomputation of the reaction structure from the shock strength. the ashes aretypically he rich, and consist of predominantly ti-44, cr-48, along with asmall amount of fe-52, with very little ni-56 and with significant ca-40 incarbon-enriched layers. if this helium detonation results in a type iasupernova, its spectral signatures would appear for the first few days afterexplosion.

1210.5525	the observational signatures of convectively excited internal gravity  modes in main sequence stars	we predict the flux and surface velocity perturbations produced byconvectively excited gravity modes (g-modes) in main sequence stars. coreconvection in massive stars can excite g-modes to sufficient amplitudes to bedetectable with high precision photometry by kepler and corot, if the thicknessof the convective overshoot region is &lt; 30 per cent of a pressure scale height.the g-modes manifest as excess photometric variability, with amplitudes of ~ 10micromagnitudes at frequencies ~ 10 microhz (0.8 1/d) near the solarmetallicity zero-age main sequence. the flux variations are largest for starswith m &gt; 5 solar masses, but are potentially detectable down to m ~ 2 - 3 solarmasses. during the main sequence evolution, radiative damping decreases suchthat ever lower frequency modes reach the stellar surface and fluxperturbations reach up to ~ 100 micromagnitudes at the terminal-age mainsequence. using the same convective excitation model, we confirm previouspredictions that solar g-modes produce surface velocity perturbations of &lt; 0.3mm/s. this implies that stochastically excited g-modes are more easilydetectable in the photometry of massive main sequence stars than in the sun.

1210.7546	circumstellar shell formation in symbiotic recurrent novae	we present models of spherically symmetric recurrent nova shells interactingwith circumstellar material in a symbiotic system composed of a red giantexpelling a wind, and a white dwarf accreting from this material. recurrentnova eruptions periodically eject material at high velocities ($\gtrsim 10^3$km/s) into the red giant wind profile, creating a decelerating shock wave ascircumstellar material is swept up. high circumstellar material densities causethe shocked wind and ejecta to have very short cooling times of days to weeks.thus, the late time evolution of the shell is determined by momentumconservation instead of energy conservation. we compute and show evolutionarytracks of shell deceleration, as well as post-shock structure. after sweepingup all the red giant wind, the shell coasts at a velocity $\sim 100$ km/s,depending on system parameters. these velocities are similar to those measuredin blue-shifted circumstellar material from the symbiotic nova rs oph, as wellas a few type ia supernovae that show evidence of circumstellar material, suchas 2006x, 2007le, and ptf 11kx. supernovae occurring in such systems may notshow circumstellar material interaction until the inner nova shell gets hit bythe supernova ejecta, days to months after the explosion.

1302.2070	x-ray diagnostics of chemical composition of the accretion disk and  donor star in ultra-compact x-ray binaries	non-solar composition of the donor star in ultra-compact x-ray binaries mayhave a pronounced effect on the fluorescent lines appearing in their spectradue to reprocessing of primary radiation by the accretion disk and the whitedwarf surface. we show that the most dramatic and easily observable consequenceof the anomalous c/o abundance, is the significant, by more than an order ofmagnitude, attenuation of the ka line of iron. it is caused by screening of thepresence of iron by oxygen - in the c/o dominated material the main interactionprocess for a e ~ 7kev photon is absorption by oxygen rather than by iron,contrary to the solar composition case. ionization of oxygen at high massaccretion rates adds a luminosity dependence to this behavior - the iron lineis significantly suppressed only at low luminosity, log(lx) less than 37-37.5,and should recover its nominal strength at higher luminosity. the increase ofthe ew of the ka lines of carbon and oxygen, on the other hand, saturates atrather moderate values. screening by he is less important, due to its lowionization threshold and because in the accretion disk it is mostly ionized.consequently, in the case of the he-rich donor, the iron line strength remainsclose to its nominal value, determined by the iron abundance in the accretiondisk. this opens the possibility of constraining the nature of donor stars inucxbs by means of x-ray spectroscopy with moderate energy resolution.

1303.1820	r coronae borealis stars in m31 from the palomar transient factory	we report the discovery of r coronae borealis (rcb) stars in the andromedagalaxy (m31) using the palomar transient factory (ptf). rcb stars are rarehydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiant variables, most likely the mergerproducts of two white dwarfs. these new rcbs, including two confirmed ones andtwo candidates, are the first to be found beyond the milky way and themagellanic clouds. all of m31 rcbs showed &gt;1.5 mag irregular declines overtimescales of weeks to months. due to the limiting magnitude of our data(r~21-22 mag), these rcb stars have r~19.5 to 20.5 mag at maximum light,corresponding to m_r= -4 to -5, making them some of the most luminous rcbsknown. spectra of two objects show that they are warm rcbs, similar to themilky way rcbs ry sgr and v854 cen. we consider these results, derived from apilot study of m31 variables, as an important proof-of-concept for the study ofrare bright variables in nearby galaxies with the ptf or other synopticsurveys.

1305.6925	the ignition of carbon detonations via converging shock waves in white  dwarfs	the progenitor channel responsible for the majority of type ia supernovae isstill uncertain. one emergent scenario involves the detonation of a he-richlayer surrounding a c/o white dwarf, which sends a shock wave into the core.the quasi-spherical shock wave converges and strengthens at an off-centerlocation, forming a second, c-burning, detonation that disrupts the whole star.in this paper, we examine this second detonation of the double detonationscenario using a combination of analytic and numeric techniques. we perform aspatially resolved study of the imploding shock wave and outgoing detonationand calculate the critical imploding shock strengths needed to achieve a core cdetonation. we find that he detonations in recent two-dimensional simulationsyield converging shock waves that are strong enough to ignite c detonations inhigh-mass c/o cores, with the caveat that a truly robust answer requiresmulti-dimensional detonation initiation calculations. we also find thatconvergence-driven detonations in low-mass c/o cores and in o/ne cores areharder to achieve and are perhaps unrealized in standard binary evolution.

1308.4193	the effects of curvature and expansion on helium detonations on white  dwarf surfaces	accreted helium layers on white dwarfs have been highlighted for many decadesas a possible site for a detonation triggered by a thermonuclear runaway. inthis paper, we find the minimum helium layer thickness that will sustain asteady laterally propagating detonation and show that it depends on the densityand composition of the helium layer, specifically c12 and o16. detonations inthese thin helium layers have speeds slower than the chapman-jouget (cj) speedfrom complete helium burning, v_cj=1.5e9 cm/s. though gravitationally unbound,the ashes still have unburned helium (~ 80% in the thinnest cases) and onlyreach up to heavy elements such as ca40, ti44, cr48, and fe52. it is rare forthese thin shells to generate large amounts of ni56. we also find a new set ofsolutions that can propagate in even thinner helium layers when o16 is presentat a minimum mass fraction of ~0.07. driven by energy release from alphacaptures on o16 and subsequent elements, these slow detonations only createashes up to si28 in the outer detonated he shell. we close by discussing howthe unbound helium burning ashes may create faint and fast ".ia" supernovae aswell as events with virtually no radioactivity, and speculate on how the slowerhelium detonation velocities impact the off-center ignition of a carbondetonation that could cause a type ia supernova in the double detonationscenario.

1311.6831	properties of the eclipsing double-white dwarf binary nltt 11748	we present high-quality ultracam photometry of the eclipsing detacheddouble-white dwarf binary nltt 11748. this system consists of a carbon/oxygenwhite dwarf and an extremely-low mass (&lt; 0.2 msun) helium-core white dwarf in a5.6 hr orbit. to date such extremely-low mass wds, which can have thin,stably-burning outer layers, have been modeled via poorly-constrainedatmosphere and cooling calculations where uncertainties in the detailedstructure can strongly influence the eventual fates of these systems whenmass-transfer begins. with precise (individual precision ~1%) high-cadence (~2s) multi-color photometry of multiple primary and secondary eclipses spanning&gt;1.5 yr, we constrain the masses and radii of both objects in the nltt 11748system to a statistical uncertainty of a few percent. however, we find thatoverall uncertainty in the thickness of the envelope of the secondarycarbon/oxygen white dwarf leads to a larger (~13%) systematic uncertainty inthe primary he wd's mass. over the full range of possible envelope thicknesseswe find that our primary mass (0.136-0.162 msun) and surface gravity(log(g)=6.32-6.38; radii are 0.0423-0.0433 rsun) constraints do not agree withprevious spectroscopic determinations. we use precise eclipse timing to detectthe romer delay at 7 sigma significance, providing an additional weakconstraint on the masses and limiting the eccentricity to e*cos(omega)= -4e-5+/- 5e-5. finally, we use multi-color data to constrain the secondary'seffective temperature (7600+/-120 k) and cooling age (1.6-1.7 gyr).

0805.2160	the effect of composition on nova ignitions	the accretion of hydrogen-rich matter onto c/o and o/ne white dwarfs inbinary systems leads to unstable thermonuclear ignition of the accretedenvelope, triggering a convective thermonuclear runaway and a subsequentclassical, recurrent, or symbiotic nova. prompted by uncertainties in thecomposition at the base of the accreted envelope at the onset of convection, aswell as the range of abundances detected in nova ejecta, we examine the effectsof varying the composition of the accreted material. for high accretion ratesand carbon mass fractions &lt; 0.002, we find that carbon, which is usuallyassumed to trigger the runaway via proton captures, is instead depleted andconverted to 14n. additionally, we quantify the importance of 3he, finding thatconvection is triggered by 3he+3he reactions for 3he mass fractions &gt; 0.002.these different triggering mechanisms, which occur for critical abundancesrelevant to many nova systems, alter the amount of mass that is accreted priorto a nova, causing the nova rate to depend on accreted composition. upcomingdeep optical surveys such as pan-starrs-1, pan-starrs-4, and the large synopticsurvey telescope may allow us to detect the dependence of nova rates onaccreted composition. furthermore, the burning and depletion of 3he with a massfraction of 0.001, which is lower than necessary for triggering convection,still has an observable effect, resulting in a pre-outburst brightening in diskquiescence to &gt; lsun and an increase in effective temperature to 6.5e4 k for a1.0 msun white dwarf accreting at 1e-8 msun/yr.

1507.03645	magnetar driven shock breakout and double peaked supernova light curves	the light curves of some luminous supernovae are suspected to be powered bythe spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar. here we describe a possiblesignature of the central engine: a burst of shock breakout emission occurringseveral days after the supernova explosion. the energy input from the magnetarinflates a high-pressure bubble that drives a shock through the pre-explodedsupernova ejecta. if the magnetar is powerful enough, that shock will near theejecta surface and become radiative. at the time of shock breakout, the ejectawill have expanded to a large radius (~10^{14} cm) so that the radiationreleased is at optical/ultraviolet wavelengths (t ~ 20,000 k) and lasts forseveral days. the luminosity and timescale of this magnetar driven shockbreakout are similar to the first peak observed recently in the double-peakedlight curve of snlsq14bdq. however, for a large region of model parameterspace, the breakout emission is predicted to be dimmer than the diffusiveluminosity from direct magnetar heating. a distinct double peaked light curvemay therefore only be conspicuous if thermal heating from the magnetar issuppressed at early times. we describe how such a delay in heating maynaturally result from inefficient dissipation and thermalization of the pulsarwind magnetic energy. without such suppression, the breakout may only benoticeable as a small bump or kink in the early luminosity or color evolution,or as a small but abrupt rise in the photospheric velocity. a similar breakoutsignature may accompany other central engines in supernovae, such as a blackhole accreting fallback material.

1509.05417	local radiation hydrodynamic simulations of massive star envelopes at  the iron opacity peak	we perform three dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of thestructure and dynamics of radiation dominated envelopes of massive stars at thelocation of the iron opacity peak. one dimensional hydrostatic calculationspredict an unstable density inversion at this location, whereas our simulationsreveal a complex interplay of convective and radiative transport whose behaviordepends on the ratio of the photon diffusion time to the dynamical time. thelatter is set by the ratio of the optical depth per pressure scale height,$\tau_0$, to $\tau_c=c/c_g$, where $c_g \approx$ 50 km/s is the isothermalsound speed in the gas alone. when $\tau_0 \gg \tau_c$, convection reduces theradiation acceleration and removes the density inversion. the turbulent energytransport in the simulations agrees with mixing length theory and provides itsfirst numerical calibration in the radiation dominated regime. when $\tau_0 \ll\tau_c$, convection becomes inefficient and the turbulent energy transport isnegligible. the turbulent velocities exceed $c_g$, driving shocks and largedensity fluctuations that allow photons to preferentially diffuse out throughlow-density regions. however, the effective radiation acceleration is stilllarger than the gravitational acceleration so that the time average densityprofile contains a modest density inversion. in addition, the simulatedenvelope undergoes large-scale oscillations with periods of a few hours. theturbulent velocity field may affect the broadening of spectral lines andtherefore stellar rotation measurements in massive stars, while the timevariable outer atmosphere could lead to variations in their mass loss andstellar radius.

astro-ph;0001135	theory and observations of type i x-ray bursts from neutron stars	i review our understanding of the thermonuclear instabilities on accretingneutron stars that produce type i x-ray bursts. i emphasize those observationaland theoretical aspects that should interest the broad audience of thismeeting. the easily accessible timescales of the bursts (durations of tens ofseconds and recurrence times of hours to days) allow for a very stringentcomparison to theory. the largest discrepancy (which was found with exosatobservations) is the accretion rate dependence of the type i burst properties.bursts become less frequent and energetic as the global accretion rateincreases, just the opposite of what the spherical theory predicts. i present aresolution of this issue by taking seriously the observed dependence of theburning area on the global accretion rate, which implies that as the accretionrate increases, the accretion rate per unit area decreases. this resurrects theunsolved problem of knowing where the freshly accreted material accumulates onthe star, equally relevant to the likely signs of rotation during the burstssummarized by swank at this meeting. i close by highlighting the type i burstsfrom gs 1826-238 that were found with bepposax and rxte. their energetics,recurrence times and temporal profiles clearly indicate that hydrogen is beingburned during these bursts, most likely by the rapid-proton (rp) process.

astro-ph;0001136	deformations of accreting neutron star crusts and gravitational wave  emission	motivated by the narrow range of spin frequencies of nearly 20 accretingneutron stars, bildsten (1998) conjectured that their spin-up had been haltedby the emission of gravitational waves. he also pointed out that smallnonaxisymmetric temperature variations in the accreted crust will lead to"wavy" electron capture layers, whose horizontal density variations naturallycreate a mass quadrupole moment.  we present a full calculation of the crust's elastic adjustment to thesedensity perturbations and find that the elastic response of the crust reducesbildsten's original estimate of the quadrupole moment in the thin outer crustby a factor of 20-50. however, this basic picture, when applied to capturelayers in the deep inner crust, can generate quadrupoles in the necessary rangeas long as there are ~5% lateral temperature variations in the inner crust. bycalculating the thermal flow throughout the core and the crust, we find thattemperature gradients this large are easily maintained by asymmetric heatsources or lateral composition gradients in the crust.  we also derive a general relation between the stresses and strains in thecrust and the maximum quadrupole moment they can generate. we show under quitegeneral conditions that maintaining a quadrupole of the magnitude necessary tobalance the accretion torque requires dimensionless strains close to 0.01 atnear-eddington accretion rates, of order the breaking strain of conventionalmaterials.

astro-ph;0003229	nearly coherent oscillations in type i x-ray bursts from ks 1731-260	we present an analysis of the nine type i x-ray bursts that were observedfrom ks 1731-260 with rxte. we find that the bursts divide naturally into twopopulations: ``fast bursts'' occur on the banana branch when the accretion rateis high and exhibit short decay times, high peak fluxes, and radius expansionepisodes. ``slow bursts'' occur in the island state at lower accretion rates,have lower peak fluxes, higher fluences, longer decay times, and show noevidence of radius expansion. all five of the fast bursts, and none of the fourslow bursts, show coherent oscillations near 524 hz.  we perform in-burst phase connection of the burst pulsations, which allows usto unambiguously characterize their frequency evolution. that evolutionexhibits a variety of behaviors, including a sharp spin-down during one burst.applying our phase models, we find that the pulsations are spectrally harderthan the burst emission, with the strength of the pulsations increasingmonotonically with photon energy. coherently summing all of the burst signals,we find upper limits of ~5% relative to the strength of the main pulse on anymodulation at 1/2 or 3/2 the main pulse frequency. we discuss our results inthe context of models in which the burst pulsations are produced by a hot spoton the surface of a spinning neutron star.

astro-ph;0004347	rotational evolution during type i x-ray bursts	the rotation rates of six weakly-magnetic neutron stars accreting in low-massx-ray binaries have most likely been measured by type i x-ray burstobservations with rxte. the nearly coherent oscillations detected during thefew seconds of thermonuclear burning are most simply understood as rotationalmodulation of brightness asymmetries on the neutron star surface. we show that,as suggested by strohmayer and colleagues, the frequency changes of 1-2 hzobserved during bursts are consistent with angular momentum conservation as theburning shell hydrostatically expands and contracts. we calculate how verticalheat propagation through the radiative outer layers of the atmosphere andconvection affect the coherence of the oscillation. we show that the evolutionof the rotational profile depends strongly on whether the burning layers arecomposed of pure helium or mixed hydrogen/helium. our results help explain theabsence (presence) of oscillations from hydrogen-burning (helium-rich) burststhat was found by muno and collaborators.  we investigate angular momentum transport within the burning layers and therecoupling of the burning layers with the star. we show that thekelvin-helmholtz instability is quenched by the strong stratification, and thatmixing between the burning fuel and underlying ashes by the baroclinicinstability does not occur. however, the baroclinic instability may have timeto operate within the differentially rotating burning layer, potentiallybringing it into rigid rotation.

astro-ph;0101365	gravitational settling of 22ne in liquid white dwarf interiors	the nuclear reactions that occur in the stellar progenitors of white dwarfs(wds) lead to an internal composition of 12c, 16o, and a ``contaminant''nucleus, 22ne. the 22ne is produced by helium captures on 14n left fromhydrogen burning via the cno cycle. by virtue of its two excess neutrons(relative to the predominant a=2z nuclei), a downward force of 2m_pg is exertedon 22ne in the wd interior. this biases its diffusive equilibrium, forcing 22neto settle towards the center of the wd. we discuss the physics of thegravitational settling when the wd is in the liquid state and the luminositygenerated by it. this modifies the cooling of wd's with masses in excess of asolar mass. the current uncertainties in the microphysics even allow forsolutions where a 1.2m_\odot wd remains mostly liquid for a few gyrs due to theinternal heating from 22ne sedimentation. this highlights the need for anaccurate calculation of the inter-diffusion coefficient, especially in thequantum liquid regime relevant for high mass wd's. there is also time in old,liquid wd's (such as those found in cataclysmic variables and possibly inaccreting type ia progenitors) for partial settling.

astro-ph;0102178	magnetic screening in accreting neutron stars	we investigate whether the magnetic field of an accreting neutron star may bediamagnetically screened by the accreted matter. we assume the freshlyaccumulated material is unmagnetized, and calculate the rate at which theintrinsic stellar magnetic flux is transported into it by ohmic diffusion. wecalculate the one-dimensional steady-state magnetic field profiles, and showthat the magnetic field strength decreases as one moves up through the outercrust and ocean by roughly (mdot/0.02 mdot_edd) orders of magnitude, where mdotis the accretion rate and mdot_edd the eddington accretion rate. we show thatbuoyancy instabilities set a limit to the strength of any buried field ofroughly 10^10-10^11 g.  our results show that magnetic screening is ineffective for mdot&lt;0.01mdot_edd, so that, no matter how the accreted material joins onto the star, theunderlying stellar field should always be evident. in this respect, we pointout the only known persistently-pulsing accreting x-ray millisecond pulsar, saxj1808.4-3658, has an accretion rate of 10^-3 mdot_edd, far below the regimewhere magnetic screening can play a role.  most steadily accreting neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries in ourgalaxy accrete at rates where screening would be effective if the simplifiedmagnetic and accretion geometry we adopt were correct. if screened, then theunderlying field will emerge after accretion halts, on a timescale of only100--1000 years, set by the ohmic diffusion time across the outer crust. itthus seems unlikely that screening alone can explain the low magnetic fields ofthe millisecond radio pulsars.

astro-ph;0107213	carbon flashes in the heavy element ocean on accreting neutron stars	we show that burning of a small mass fraction of carbon in a neutron starocean is thermally unstable at low accumulated masses when the ocean containsheavy ashes from the hydrogen burning rapid proton (rp) process. the key toearly unstable ignition is the low thermal conductivity of a heavy elementocean. the instability requires accretion rates in excess of one-tenth theeddington limit when the carbon mass fraction is 0.1 or less. the unstableflashes release 10^{42} to 10^{43} ergs over hours to days, and are likely thecause of the recently discovered large type i x-ray bursts (so-called``superbursts'') from six galactic low mass x-ray binaries. in addition toexplaining the energetics, recurrence times, and durations of the superbursts,these mixed carbon/heavy element flashes have an accretion rate dependence ofunstable burning similar to that observed. though the instability is present ataccretion rates near eddington, there is less contrast with the accretionluminosity there, explaining why most detections are made at accretion ratesbetween 0.1 and 0.3 eddington. future comparisons of time dependentcalculations with observations will provide new insights into the rp process.

astro-ph;0112270	faint cataclysmic variables in quiescence: globular cluster and field  surveys	current evolutionary models imply that most cataclysmic variables (cvs) havep_orb&lt;2 hours and are dwarf nova (dn) systems that are quiescent most of thetime. observations of nearby quiescent dn find that the uv spectrum isdominated by the hot white dwarf (wd), indicating that it provides asignificant fraction of the optical light in addition to the quiescent disk andmain sequence companion. hence, identifying a faint, quiescent cv in either thefield or a globular cluster (gc) from broadband colors depends on our abilityto predict the wd contribution in quiescence. we are undertaking a theoreticalstudy of the compressional heating of wds, extending down to very low timeaveraged accretion rates, &lt;mdot&gt;~10^{-11}m_sun/yr, which allows us toself-consistently find the t_eff} of the wd. we demonstrate here that most ofthe compressional heating occurs in the freshly accreted envelope and that thewd core temperature reaches a fixed value on a timescale less than typicalevolutionary times. since nuclear burning is unstable at these &lt;mdot&gt;'s, wehave incorporated the recurrent heating and cooling of the wd core throughoutthe classical novae limit cycle in order to find the t_eff-&lt;mdot&gt; relations.comparing to observations of field dn confirms the &lt;mdot&gt;-p_orb relation ofdisrupted magnetic braking. we also predict broad-band colors of a quiescent cvas a function of &lt;mdot&gt; and companion mass and show that this leads to theidentification of what may be many cvs in deep hst images of gcs.

astro-ph;0204102	variability in the thermal emission from accreting neutron star  transients	the composition of the outer 100 m of a neutron star sets the heat flux thatflows outwards from the core. for an accreting neutron star in an x-raytransient, the thermal quiescent flux depends sensitively on the amount ofhydrogen and helium remaining on the surface after an accretion outburst and onthe composition of the underlying ashes of previous h/he burning. because h/hehas a higher thermal conductivity, a larger mass of h/he implies a shallowerthermal gradient through the low density envelope and hence a higher effectivetemperature for a given core temperature. the mass of residual h and he variesfrom outburst to outburst, so the thermal quiescent flux is variable eventhough the core temperature is constant for timescales &lt; 10 000 yr. heavyelements settle from a h/he envelope in a few hours; we therefore model thequiescent envelope as two distinct layers, h/he over heavier elements, andtreat the mass of h/he as a free parameter. we find that the emergent thermalquiescent flux can vary by a factor of 2 to 3 between different quiescentepochs. the variation is more pronounced at lower interior temperatures, makingsystems with low quiescent luminosities and frequent outbursts, such as saxj1808.4-3658, ideal candidates from which to observe this effect. we compute,for different ash compositions, the interior temperatures of cen x-4, aql x-1,and sax j1808.4-3658. in the case of aql x-1, the inferred high interiortemperature suggests that neutrino cooling contributes to the neutron star'sthermal balance.

astro-ph;0204495	transient x-ray binaries in elliptical galaxies	chandra observations of elliptical galaxies have revealed large numbers oflow mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) accreting at rates above 10^-9 solar masses peryear. one scenario which generates this transfer rate from an old stellarpopulation is nuclear driven mass transfer onto a neutron star or black holefrom a roche lobe filling red giant. however, in our galaxy, most of thesesystems accrete sporadically as transients due to a thermal instability in theaccretion disk. using the common criterion for disk instability (includingirradiation), we find that this mode of mass transfer leads to transientaccretion for at least 75% of the binary's life. repeated chandra observationsof elliptical galaxies should reveal this population. the recurrence timesmight exceed 1000 years (depending on the orbital period at the onset of masstransfer), and outbursts might last for 1-100 years. mass transfering binariescan also be formed in old populations via interactions in dense stellarenvironments, such as globular clusters. these tend to have shorter orbitalperiods and are more likely stable accretors, making them apparently a largefraction of the elliptical's lmxb population.

astro-ph;0208164	hot white dwarf donors in ultracompact x-ray binaries	the discovery of two accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars in binaries with 43minute orbital periods allows for a new probe of the donor's structure. for xtej1751-305, only a hot white dwarf (wd) can fill the roche lobe. a cold he wd isa possible solution for xte j0929-314, though i will show that evolutionaryarguments make a hot wd more likely. in addition to being larger than the t=0models, these finite entropy, low-mass (&lt;0.03 solar masses) wds have a minimummass for a fixed core temperature. if they remain hot as they lose mass andexpand, they can ``evaporate'' to leave an isolated millisecond radio pulsar.they also adiabatically expand upon mass loss at a rate faster than the growthof the roche radius if the angular momentum deposited in the disk is notreturned to the donor. if the timescale of the resulting runaway mass transferis shorter than the viscous timescale in the outer disk, then the mass transferinstability of ruderman and shaham for he wds would be realized. however, myestimates of these timescales still makes the instability unlikely foradiabatic responses. i close by noting the possible impact of finite t wds onour understanding of am cvn binaries.

astro-ph;0212004	arresting accretion torques with gravitational radiation	recent theoretical work has made it plausible for neutron stars (nss) to loseangular momentum via gravitational radiation on long timescales (around myrs)while actively accreting. the gravitational waves (gws) can either be emittedvia the excitation of r-modes or from a deformed crust. gw emission can thusintervene to slow-down or halt the otherwise relentless spin-up from accretion.prior to this theoretical work (and the measurements of ns rotation rates inlmxbs) the community was rather confident that an accreting ns would be spun-upto rotation rates near breakup, motivating searches for sub-millisecondobjects. after only briefly describing the physics of the gw processes, i arguethat the limiting spin frequency might be appreciably lower than the breakupfrequency. millisecond radio pulsar observers would likely discover the impactof gw emission as a dropoff in the number of pulsars beyond 600 hz, and i showhere that the millisecond pulsar inventory in 47 tuc might already exhibit sucha cutoff. these theoretical ideas will be tested by gw searches withground-based interferometers, such as the advanced ligo instrument proposed foroperation by 2008.

astro-ph;0309208	measuring white dwarf accretion rates via their effective temperatures	our previous theoretical study of the impact of an accreting envelope on thethermal state of an underlying white dwarf (wd) has yielded equilibrium coretemperatures, classical nova ignition masses and thermal luminosities for wdsaccreting at time averaged rates of &lt;mdot&gt; = 10^-11 - 10^-8 msun/yr. these&lt;mdot&gt;'s are appropriate to wds in cataclysmic variables (cvs) of p_orb &lt;~ 7hr, many of which accrete sporadically as dwarf novae. approximately thirtynonmagnetic dwarf novae have been observed in quiescence, when the accretionrate is low enough for spectral detection of the wd photosphere, and ameasurement of t_eff. we use our theoretical work to translate the measuredt_eff's into local time-averaged accretion rates, confirming the factor of tendrop in &lt;mdot&gt; predicted for cv's as they transit the period gap. for dn belowthe period gap, we show that if &lt;mdot&gt; is that given by gravitational radiationlosses alone, then the wd masses are &gt; 0.8 msun. an alternative conclusion isthat the masses are closer to 0.6 msun and &lt;mdot&gt; is 3-4 times larger than thatexpected from gravitational radiation losses. in either case, it is veryplausible that a subset of cvs with p_orb &lt; 2 hours will have t_eff's lowenough for them to become non-radial pulsators, as discovered by van zyl andcollaborators in gw lib.

astro-ph;0311398	unstable nonradial oscillations on helium burning neutron stars	material accreted onto a neutron star can stably burn in steady state onlywhen the accretion rate is high (typically super-eddington) or if a large fluxfrom the neutron star crust permeates the outer atmosphere. for such situationswe have analyzed the stability of nonradial oscillations, finding one unstablemode for pure helium accretion. this is a shallow surface wave which resides inthe helium atmosphere above the heavier ashes of the ocean. it is excited bythe increase in the nuclear reaction rate during the oscillations, and it growson the timescale of a second. for a slowly rotating star, this mode has afrequency of approximately 20-30 hz (for l=1), and we calculate the fullspectrum that a rapidly rotating (&gt;&gt;30 hz) neutron star would support. theshort period x-ray binary 4u 1820--30 is accreting helium rich material and isthe system most likely to show this unstable mode,especially when it is notexhibiting x-ray bursts. our discovery of an unstable mode in a thermallystable atmosphere shows that nonradial perturbations have a different stabilitycriterion than the spherically symmetric thermal perturbations that generatetype i x-ray bursts.

astro-ph;0404214	spreading of accreted material on white dwarfs	when a white dwarf (wd) is weakly magnetized and its accretion disk is thin,accreted material first reaches the wd's surface at its equator. this matterslows its orbit as it comes into co-rotation with the wd, dissipating kineticenergy into thermal energy and creating a hot band of freshly accreted materialaround the equator. radiating in the extreme ultraviolet and soft x-rays, thismaterial moves toward the pole as new material piles behind it, eventuallybecoming part of the wd once it has a temperature and rotational velocitycomparable with the surface. we present a set of solutions which describe theproperties of this ``spreading layer'' in the steady state limit based on theconservation equations derived by inogamov &amp; sunyaev (1999) for accretingneutron stars. our analysis and subsequent solutions show that the case of wdsis qualitatively different. we investigate example solutions of the spreadinglayer for a wd of mass $m=0.6m_\odot$ and radius $r=9\times10^{8}{\rm cm}$.these solutions show that the spreading layer typically extends to an angle of$\theta_{\rm sl}\approx0.01-0.1$ (with respect to the equator), depending onaccretion rate and the magnitude of the viscosity. at low accretion rates,$\dot{m}\lesssim10^{18}{\rm g s}^{-1}$, the amount of spreading is negligibleand most of the dissipated energy is radiated back into the accretion disk.when the accretion rate is high, such as in dwarf novae, symbiotic binaries,and supersoft sources, the material may spread to latitudes high enough to bedirectly visible above the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0410427	a spreading layer origin for dwarf nova oscillations	dwarf nova outbursts often show coherent ($q\sim10^4-10^6$) sinusoidaloscillations with the largest pulsed fraction in the extreme ultraviolet.called dwarf nova oscillations (dnos), they have periods of $p\approx3-40 {\rms}$ and scale with luminosity as $p\propto l^{-\beta}$ with$\beta\approx0.1-0.2$. we propose that dnos may be produced by nonradialoscillations in a thin hydrostatic layer of freshly accreted material, the``spreading layer'' (sl), at the white dwarf (wd) equator. this would naturallyexplain a number of key properties of dnos, including their frequency range,sinusoidal nature, sensitivity to accretion rate, and why they are only seenduring outburst. in support of this hypothesis we construct a simple model thattreats the sl as a cavity containing shallow surface waves, each with the sameradial structure, but split into three different modes denoted by theirazimuthal wavenumber, $m$. the $m=0$ latitudinally propagating mode bestmatches the periods and scalings associated with most dnos, and dnos withperiods shorter than the wd keplerian period are explained by the $m=-1$prograde mode. we also predict a third set of oscillations, produced by the$m=1$ retrograde mode, and show its expected dependence on accretion rate.

astro-ph;0502546	surface modes on bursting neutron stars and x-ray burst oscillations	accreting neutron stars (nss) often show coherent modulations during type ix-ray bursts, called burst oscillations. we consider whether a nonradial modecan serve as an explanation for burst oscillations from those nss which are notmagnetic. we find that a surface wave in the shallow burning layer transitionsinto a crustal interface wave as the envelope cools, a new and previouslyuninvestigated phenomenon. the surface modulations decrease dramatically as themode switches, explaining why burst oscillations often disappear before burstcooling ceases. when we include rotational modifications, we find modefrequencies and drifts consistent with those observed. the large ns spin($\approx270-620 {\rm hz}$) needed to make this match implies that accretingnss are spinning at frequencies $\approx4 {\rm hz}$ above the burstoscillation. since the asymptotic frequency is set by the crustal interfacewave, the observed late time frequency drifts are a probe of the compositionand temperature of ns crusts. we compare our model with the observed drifts andpersistent luminosities of x-ray burst sources, and find that nss with a higheraverage accretion rate show smaller drifts, as we predict. furthermore, thedrift sizes are consistent with crusts composed of iron-like nuclei, asexpected for the ashes of the he-rich bursts that are exhibited by theseobjects.

astro-ph;0503641	white dwarf heating and subsequent cooling in dwarf nova outbursts	we follow the time dependent thermal evolution of a white dwarf (wd)undergoing sudden accretion in a dwarf nova outburst, using both simulationsand analytic estimates. the post-outburst lightcurve clearly separates intoearly times when the wd flux is high, and late times when the flux is near thequiescent level. the break between these two regimes, occurring at a time oforder the outburst duration, corresponds to a thermal diffusion wave reachingthe base of the freshly accreted layer. our principal result is that long afterthe outburst, the fractional flux perturbation about the quiescent flux decaysas a power law with time (and {\it not} as an exponential). we use this resultto construct a simple fitting formula that yields estimates for both thequiescent flux and the accreted column, i.e. the total accreted mass divided bywd surface area. the wd mass is not well constrained by the late timelightcurve alone, but it can be inferred if the accreted mass is known fromobservations. we compare our work with the well-studied outburst of wz sge,finding that the cooling is well described by our model, giving an effectivetemperature $t_{\rm eff}=14,500 {\rm k}$ and accreted column $\deltay\approx10^6 {\rm g cm^{-2}}$, in agreement with the modeling of godon et al.to reconcile this accreted column with the accreted mass inferred from thebolometric accretion luminosity, a large wd mass $\gtrsim1.1m_\odot$ is needed.our power law result is a valuable tool for making quick estimates of theoutburst properties. we show that fitting the late time lightcurve with thisformula yields a predicted column within 20% of that estimated from our fullnumerical calculations.

astro-ph;0510663	the energy dependence of neutron star surface modes and x-ray burst  oscillations	we calculate the photon energy dependence of the pulsed amplitude of neutronstar (ns) surface modes. simple approximations demonstrate that it depends moststrongly on the bursting ns surface temperature. this result compares well withfull integrations that include doppler shifts from rotation and generalrelativistic corrections to photon propagation. we show that the energydependence of type i x-ray burst oscillations agrees with that of a surfacemode, lending further support to the hypothesis that they originate fromsurface waves. the energy dependence of the pulsed emission is ratherinsensitive to the ns inclination, mass and radius, or type of mode, thushindering constraints on these parameters. we also show that, for thisenergy-amplitude relation, the majority of the signal (relative to the noise)comes in the 2-25 kev band, so that the current burst oscillation searches withthe rossi x-ray timing explorer are close to optimal. the critical test of themode hypothesis for x-ray burst oscillations would be a measurement of theenergy dependence of burst oscillations from an accreting millisecond pulsar.

astro-ph;0511247	exposing the nuclear burning ashes of radius expansion type i x-ray  bursts	we solve for the evolution of the vertical extent of the convective region ofa neutron star atmosphere during a type i x-ray burst. the convective region iswell-mixed with ashes of nuclear burning and its extent determines the risetime of the burst light curve. using a full nuclear reaction network, we showthat the maximum vertical extent of the convective region during photosphericradius expansion (re) bursts can be sufficiently great that: (1) some ashes ofburning are ejected by the radiation driven wind during the re phase and, (2)some ashes of burning are exposed at the neutron star surface following the rephase. we find that ashes with mass number a ~ 30 - 60 are mixed in with theejected material. we calculate the expected column density of ejected andsurface ashes in hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths ofthe resulting photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron starsurface. we find that these can exceed 100 ev and are potentially detectable. adetection would probe the nuclear burning processes and might enable ameasurement of the neutron star gravitational redshift. in addition, we findthat in bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)reactions cause a rapid onset of the 12c(p, gamma)13n(alpha, p)16o reactionsequence. the sequence bypasses the relatively slow 12c(alpha, gamma)16oreaction and leads to a sudden surge in energy production that is directlyobservable as a rapid (~ ms) increase in flux during burst rise.

astro-ph;0601317	thermal structure and radius evolution of irradiated gas giant planets	we consider the thermal structure and radii of strongly irradiated gas giantplanets over a range in mass and irradiating flux. the cooling rate of theplanet is sensitive to the surface boundary condition, which depends on thedetailed manner in which starlight is absorbed and energy redistributed byfluid motion. we parametrize these effects by imposing an isothermal boundarycondition $t \equiv t_{\rm deep}$ below the photosphere, and then constrain$t_{\rm deep}$ from the observed masses and radii. we compute the dependence ofluminosity and core temperature on mass, $t_{\rm deep}$ and core entropy,finding that simple scalings apply over most of the relevant parameter space.these scalings yield analytic cooling models which exhibit power-law behaviorin the observable age range $0.1-10 {\rm gyr}$, and are confirmed bytime-dependent cooling calculations. we compare our model to the radii ofobserved transiting planets, and derive constraints on $t_{\rm deep}$. only hd209458 has a sufficiently accurate radius measurement that $t_{\rm deep}$ istightly constrained; the lower error bar on the radii for other planets isconsistent with no irradiation. more accurate radius and age measurements willallow for a determination of the correlation of $t_{\rm deep}$ with theequilibrium temperature, informing us about both the greenhouse effect andday-night asymmetries.

astro-ph;0604319	pulsational instabilities in accreting white dwarfs	(abridged) the cataclysmic variable (cv) population harbors a diverse rangeof donor stars and accreting white dwarfs (wds). a range of wd masses isexpected, from low mass helium core wds, to massive wds which have previouslyaccreted at rates high enough for hydrogen to burn steadily. furthermore, awide range of helium enrichment is expected in the accreted material dependingon the degree to which the donor star is evolved. we investigate the impact ofthis diversity on the range of effective temperatures ($t_{\rm eff}$) for whichg-modes are unstable. the critical $t_{\rm eff}$ below which modes are unstable("blue edge") depends on both surface gravity, $g$, and he abundance, $y$. thehydrogen/first helium ionization instability strip is more sensitive to $g$than $y$. we find that (for solar composition envelopes), relative to afiducial wd mass $0.6 m_\odot$, the blue edge for a $0.4 m_\odot$ he core wdshifts downward by $\approx 1000 {\rm k}$, while that for a massive $\approx1.2 m_\odot$ wd shifts upward by $\approx 2000 {\rm k}$. the second heliumionization instability strip exhibits strong dependences on both $g$ and $y$.surprisingly, increasing $y$ by only 10% relative to solar creates aninstability strip near $15,000 {\rm k}$. hence cv's below the period gap withevolved donor stars of $y\ga 0.4$ may have an "intermediate" instability stripwell outside of the isolated da and db variables. this "intermediate"instability strip also occurs for low mass he wd with solar compositionenvelopes. the lack of pulsations in cv's with $t_{\rm eff}$ in the purehydrogen zz ceti instability strip is also easily explained.

astro-ph;0702049	thermally stable nuclear burning on accreting white dwarfs	one of the challenges to increasing the mass of a white dwarf throughaccretion is the tendency for the accumulating hydrogen to ignite unstably andpotentially trigger mass loss. it has been known for many years that there is anarrow range of accretion rates for which the hydrogen can burn stably,allowing for the white dwarf mass to increase as a pure helium layeraccumulates. we first review the physics of stable burning, providing a clearexplanation for why radiation pressure stabilization leads to a narrow range ofaccretion rates for stable burning near the eddington limit, confirming therecent work of nomoto and collaborators. we also explore the possibility ofstabilization due to a high luminosity from beneath the burning layer. we thenexamine the impact of the beta-decay-limited ''hot'' cno cycle on the stabilityof burning. though this plays a significant role for accreting neutron stars,we find that for accreting white dwarfs, it can only increase the range ofstably-burning accretion rates for metallicities below 0.01 solar metallicity.

astro-ph;9505042	spin-orbit interaction in neutron star/main sequence binaries and  implications for pulsar timing	the spin-induced quadrupole moment of a rapidly rotating star changes theorbital dynamics in a binary system, giving rise to advance (or regression) ofperiastron and precession of the orbital plane. we show that these effects areimportant in the recently discovered radio pulsar/main sequence star binarysystem psr j0045$-$7319, and can reliably account for the observed peculiartiming residuals. precise measurements of the apsidal motion and orbital planeprecession can yield valuable information on the internal structure androtation of the star. the detection of orbital precession implies that the spinof the companion star is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum, andsuggests that the supernova gave the pulsar a kick out of the original orbitalplane. tidal excitation of g-mode oscillations in the psr j0045$-$7319 systeminduces an orbital period change of order $|\delta p_{\rm orb}/p_{\rm orb}|\sim10^{-6}$ at each periastron passage, but the secular trend depends on theradiative damping time of the g-modes. we also discuss the spin-orbit couplingeffects for the accreting x-ray pulsars and the other known radio pulsar/mainsequence binary, psr b1259$-$63.

astro-ph;9612155	lithium depletion in fully convective pre-main sequence stars	we present an analytic calculation of the thermonuclear depletion of lithiumin contracting, fully convective, pre-main sequence stars of mass m &lt; 0.5m_sun. previous numerical work relies on still-uncertain physics (atmosphericopacities and convection, in particular) to calculate the effective temperatureas a unique function of stellar mass. we assume that the star's effectivetemperature, t_eff, is fixed during hayashi contraction and allow its actualvalue to be a free parameter constrained by observation. using thisapproximation, we compute lithium burning analytically and explore thedependence of lithium depletion on t_eff, m, and composition. our calculationsyield the radius, age, and luminosity of a pre-main sequence star as a functionof lithium depletion. this allows for more direct comparisons to observationsof lithium depleted stars. our results agree with those numerical calculationsthat explicitly determine stellar structure during hayashi contraction. inagreement with basri, marcy, and graham (1996), we show that the absence oflithium in the pleiades star hhj 3 implies that it is older than 100 myr. wealso suggest a generalized method for dating galactic clusters younger than 100myr (i.e., those with contracting stars of m &gt; 0.08 m_sun) and for constrainingthe masses of lithium depleted stars.

astro-ph;9707125	observations of accreting pulsars	we summarize five years of continuous monitoring of accretion-powered pulsarswith the burst and transient source experiment (batse) on the compton gamma rayobservatory. our 20-70 kev observations have determined or refined the orbitalparameters of 13 binaries, discovered 5 new transient accreting pulsars,measured the pulsed flux history during outbursts of 12 transients (groj1744-28, 4u 0115+634, gro j1750-27, gs 0834-430, 2s 1417-624, gro j1948+32,exo 2030+375, gro j1008-57, a 0535+26, gro j2058+42, 4u 1145-619 and a1118-616), and also measured the accretion torque history of during outburstsof 6 of those transients whose orbital parameters were also known. we have alsocontinuously measured the pulsed flux and spin frequency for eight persistentlyaccreting pulsars (her x-1, cen x-3, vela x-1, oao 1657-415, gx 301-2, 4u1626-67, 4u 1538-52, and gx 1+4). because of their continuity and uniformityover a long baseline, batse observations have provided new insights into thelong-term behavior of accreting magnetic stars. we have found that allaccreting pulsars show stochastic variations in their spin frequencies andluminosities, including those displaying secular spin-up or spin-down on longtime scales, blurring the conventional distinction between disk-fed andwind-fed binaries. pulsed flux and accretion torque are strongly correlated inoutbursts of transient accreting pulsars, but uncorrelated, or evenanticorrelated, in persistent sources.

astro-ph;9708193	on the dramatic spin-up/spin-down torque reversals in accreting pulsars	dramatic torque reversals between spin up and spin down have been observed inhalf of the persistent x-ray pulsars monitored by the batse all-sky monitor oncgro. theoretical models developed to explain early pulsar timing data canexplain spin down torques via a disk-magnetosphere interaction if the starnearly corotates with the inner accretion disk. to produce the observed batsetorque reversals, however, these equilibrium models require the disk toalternate between two mass accretion rates, with $\dot m_{\pm}$ producingaccretion torques of similar magnitude, but always of opposite sign. moreover,in at least one pulsar (gx 1+4) undergoing secular spin down the neutron starspins down faster during brief ($\sim 20$ day) hard x-ray flares -- this isopposite the correlation expected from standard theory, assuming batse pulsedflux increases with mass accretion rate. the $10$ day to 10 yr intervalsbetween torque reversals in these systems are much longer than anycharacteristic magnetic or viscous time scale near the inner disk boundary andare more suggestive of a global disk phenomenon.  we discuss possible explanations of the observed torque behavior. despite thepreferred sense of rotation defined by the binary orbit, the batse observationsare surprisingly consistent with an earlier suggestion by makishima \etal(1988) for gx~1+4: the disks in these systems somehow alternate betweenepisodes of prograde and retrograde rotation. we are unaware of any mechanismthat could produce a stable retrograde disk in a binary undergoing roche-lobeoverflow, but such flip-flop behavior does occur in numerical simulations ofwind-fed systems. one possibility is that the disks in some of these binariesare fed by an x-ray excited wind.

astro-ph;9709094	thermonuclear burning on rapidly accreting neutron stars	neutron stars in mass-transferring binaries are accreting the hydrogen andhelium rich matter from the surfaces of their companions. this article simplyexplains the physics associated with how that material eventually fuses to formheavier nuclei and the observations of the time dependent phenomena (such astype i x-ray bursts) associated with the thermally unstable thermonuclearreactions. we explain how the outcome depends on the composition of theaccreting matter, the accretion rate and the mass, radius and thermal state ofthe neutron star. we also introduce many new analytic relations that areconvenient for comparisons to both observations and computational results.after explaining nuclear burning for spherically symmetric accretion ontoneutron stars, we discuss the possibility of asymmetric burning. in particular,we discuss some of the mysteries from exosat observations of type i x-raybursts and how the solution to these puzzles may lie in considering the lateralpropagation of nuclear burning fronts around the star. fully understanding thisproblem requires knowledge of parameters previously neglected such as thedistribution of fresh fuel on the star, the magnetic field strength, and thestellar rotation. recent rxte observations of bursters may finally tell us someof these parameters.

astro-ph;9711099	light element depletion in contracting brown dwarfs and  pre--main-sequence stars	we present an analytic calculation of the thermonuclear depletion of thelight elements lithium, beryllium, and boron in fully convective, low-massstars. under the presumption that the pre--main-sequence star is always fullymixed during contraction, we find that the burning of these rare light elementscan be computed analytically, even when the star is degenerate. using theeffective temperature as a free parameter, we constrain the properties oflow-mass stars from observational data, independently of the uncertaintiesassociated with modeling their atmospheres and convection. our analyticsolution explains the dependence of the age at a given level of elementaldepletion on the stellar effective temperature, nuclear cross sections, andchemical composition. most importantly, our results allow observers totranslate lithium non-detections in young cluster members into amodel-independent minimum age for that cluster. using this procedure, we havefound lower limits to the ages of the pleiades (100 myr) and alpha persei (60myr) clusters. recent experimental work on the low energy resonance in the^10b(p,\alpha)^7be reaction has greatly enhanced estimates of the destructionrate of ^10b, making it possible for stars with m&gt;0.1 m_sun to deplete both^10b and ^11b before reaching the main sequence. moreover, there is aninteresting range of masses, 0.085 m_sun &lt; m &lt; 0.13 m_sun, where borondepletion occurs on the main sequence in less than a hubble time, providing apotential ``clock'' for dating low-mass stars.

astro-ph;9807012	hydrogen electron capture in accreting neutron stars and the resulting  g-mode oscillation spectrum	we investigate hydrogen electron capture in the oceans of neutron starsaccreting at rates appropriate for most low-mass x-ray binaries. these starsburn the accreted hydrogen and helium unstably in the upper atmosphere andaccumulate material which usually contains some small amount of hydrogen (massfractions are typically 10%) mixed in with the heavier iron group ashes. thesubsequent evolution of this matter is determined by compression towards higherdensities until electron capture on the hydrogen occurs. we constructsteady-state models of the electron captures and the subsequent neutronrecombinations onto the heavy nuclei. the density discontinuity from thesecaptures gives rise to a new g-mode (much like a surface wave), which has alowest order (l=1) frequency of 35 hz when x=0.1 on a slowly rotating star. wealso discuss, for the first time, a new set of non-radial g-modes unique tothese neutron stars. these modes have most of their nodes in the finitethickness layer where the electron captures are occurring. the lowest ordermode frequencies are in the 1-10 hz range for a few radial nodes on a slowlyrotating star. we conclude by discussing how the dispersion relations for thesemodes are modified for a rapidly rotating neutron star. whether any of thesemodes are observable depends on their excitation and damping mechanisms and theability to excite them, issues we will address in a future paper.
