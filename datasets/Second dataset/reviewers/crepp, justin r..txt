0902.2779	formation, survival, and detectability of planets beyond 100 au	direct imaging searches have begun to detect planetary and brown dwarfcompanions and to place constraints on the presence of giant planets at largeseparations from their host star. this work helps to motivate such planetsearches by predicting a population of young giant planets that could bedetectable by direct imaging campaigns. both the classical core accretion andthe gravitational instability model for planet formation are hard-pressed toform long-period planets in situ. here, we show that dynamical instabilitiesamong planetary systems that originally formed multiple giant planets muchcloser to the host star could produce a population of giant planets at large(~100 au - 100000 au) separations. we estimate the limits within which theseplanets may survive, quantify the efficiency of gravitational scattering intoboth stable and unstable wide orbits, and demonstrate that population analysesmust take into account the age of the system. we predict that planet scatteringcreates a population of detectable giant planets on wide orbits that decreasesin number on timescales of ~10 myr. we demonstrate that several members of suchpopulations should be detectable with current technology, quantify theprospects for future instruments, and suggest how they could place interestingconstraints on planet formation models.

0909.2259	direct detection of planets orbiting large angular diameter stars:  sensitivity of an internally-occulting space-based coronagraph	high-contrast imaging observations of large angular diameter stars enablecomplementary science questions to be addressed compared to the baseline goalsof proposed missions like the terrestrial planet finder-coronagraph, newworld's observer, and others. such targets however present a practical problemin that finite stellar size results in unwanted starlight reaching thedetector, which degrades contrast. in this paper, we quantify the sensitivity,in terms of contrast, of an internally-occulting, space-based coronagraph as afunction of stellar angular diameter, from unresolved dwarfs to the largestevolved stars. our calculations show that an assortment of band-limited imagemasks can accommodate a diverse set of observations to help maximize missionscientific return. we discuss two applications based on the results: thespectro-photometric study of planets already discovered with the radialvelocity technique to orbit evolved stars, which we elucidate with the exampleof pollux b, and the direct detection of planets orbiting our closest neighbor,alpha centauri, whose primary component is on the main-sequence but subtends anappreciable angle on the sky. it is recommended that similar trade studies beperformed with other promising internal, external, and hybrid occulter designsfor comparison, as there is relevance to a host of interesting topics inplanetary science and related fields.

0912.1597	parallactic motion for companion discovery: an m-dwarf orbiting alcor	the a5v star alcor has an m3-m4 dwarf companion, as evidenced by a novelastrometric technique. imaging spectroscopy combined with adaptive opticscoronagraphy allowed for the detection and spectrophotometric characterizationof the point source at a contrast of ~6 j- and h-band magnitudes and separationof 1" from the primary star. the use of an astrometric pupil plane grid allowedus to determine the projected separations between the companion and thecoronagraphically occulted primary star to &lt;=3 milliarcsecond precision at twoobservation epochs. our measurements demonstrate common parallactic and propermotion over the course of 103 days, significantly shorter than the period oftime needed for most companion confirmations through proper motion measurementsalone. this common parallax method is potentially more rigorous than commonproper motion, ensuring that the neighboring bodies lie at the same distance,rather than relying on the statistical improbability that two objects in closeproximity to each other on the sky move in the same direction. the discovery ofa low-mass (~0.25m_sun) companion around a bright (v = 4.0), nearby (d = 25 pc)star highlights a region of binary star parameter space that to date has notbeen fully probed.

1005.3084	giant planet occurrence in the stellar mass-metallicity plane	correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanetscan be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts andprovide valuable clues about the planet formation process. we analyze a sampleof 1194 stars drawn from the california planet survey targets to determine theempirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giantplanet as a function of its mass and metallicity. our stellar sample rangesfrom m dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 msun to intermediate-mass subgiantswith masses as high as 1.9 msun. in agreement with previous studies, our sampleexhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; the fractionof stars that harbor giant planets scales as f \propto 10^{1.2 [fe/h]}. we canrule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98%confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets arenot likely due to convective envelope "pollution." our data also rule out aconstant planet occurrence rate for [fe/h]&lt; 0, indicating that giant planetscontinue to become rarer at sub-solar metallicities. we also find that planetoccurrence increases with stellar mass (f \propto mstar), characterized by arise from 3.5% around m dwarfs (0.5 msun) to 14% around a stars (2 msun), atsolar metallicity. we argue that the correlation between stellar properties andgiant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretionmodel of planet formation.

1010.4028	establishing alpha oph as a prototype rotator: improved astrometric  orbit	the nearby star alpha oph (ras alhague) is a rapidly rotating a5iv starspinning at ~89% of its breakup velocity. this system has been imagedextensively by interferometric techniques, giving a precise geometric model ofthe star's oblateness and the resulting temperature variation on the stellarsurface. fortuitously, alpha oph has a previously known stellar companion, andcharacterization of the orbit provides an independent, dynamically-based checkof both the host star and the companion mass. such measurements are crucial toconstrain models of such rapidly rotating stars. in this study, we combineeight years of adaptive optics imaging data from the palomar, aeos, and cfhttelescopes to derive an improved, astrometric characterization of the companionorbit. we also use photometry from these observations to derive a model-basedestimate of the companion mass. a fit was performed on the photocenter motionof this system to extract a component mass ratio. we find masses of2.40^{0.23}_{0.37} solar masses and 0.85^{0.06}_{0.04} solar masses for alphaoph a and alpha oph b, respectively. previous orbital studies of this systemfound a mass too high for this system, inconsistent with stellar evolutionarycalculations. our measurements of the host star mass are more consistent withthese evolutionary calculations, but with slightly higher uncertainties. inaddition to the dynamically-derived masses, we use ijhk photometry to derive amodel-based mass for alpha oph b, of 0.77 +/- 0.05 solar masses marginallyconsistent with the dynamical masses derived from our orbit. our model fitspredict a periastron passage on 2012 april 19, with the two components having a~50 milliarcsec separation from march to may 2012. a modest amount ofinterferometric and radial velocity data during this period could provide amass determination of this star at the few percent level.

1012.0008	a new high contrast imaging program at palomar observatory	we describe a new instrument that forms the core of a long-term high contrastimaging program at the 200-inch hale telescope at palomar observatory. theprimary scientific thrust is to obtain images and low-resolution spectroscopyof brown dwarfs and young jovian mass exoplanets in the vicinity of starswithin 50 parsecs of the sun. the instrument is a microlens-based integralfield spectrograph integrated with a diffraction limited, apodized-pupil lyotcoronagraph, mounted behind the palomar adaptive optics system. thespectrograph obtains imaging in 23 channels across the j and h bands (1.06 -1.78 microns). in addition to obtaining spectra, this wavelength resolutionallows suppression of the chromatically dependent speckle noise, which wedescribe. we have recently installed a novel internal wave front calibrationsystem that will provide continuous updates to the ao system every 0.5 - 1.0minutes by sensing the wave front within the coronagraph. the palomar ao systemis undergoing an upgrade to a much higher-order ao system ("palm-3000"): a3388-actuator tweeter deformable mirror working together with the existing241-actuator mirror. this system will allow correction with subapertures assmall as 8cm at the telescope pupil using natural guide stars. the coronagraphalone has achieved an initial dynamic range in the h-band of 2 x 10^-4 at 1arcsecond, without speckle noise suppression. we demonstrate that spectralspeckle suppression is providing a factor of 10-20 improvement over thisbringing our current contrast at an arcsecond to ~2 x 10^-5. this system is thefirst of a new generation of apodized pupil coronagraphs combined withhigh-order adaptive optics and integral field spectrographs (e.g. gpi, sphere,hiciao), and we anticipate this instrument will make a lasting contribution tohigh contrast imaging in the northern hemisphere for years.

1103.4910	estimates of the planet yield from ground-based high-contrast imaging  observations as a function of stellar mass	we use monte carlo simulations to estimate the number of extrasolar planetsthat are directly detectable in the solar-neighborhood using current andforthcoming high-contrast imaging instruments. our calculations take intoaccount the important factors that govern the likelihood for imaging a planet,including the statistical properties of nearby stars, correlations between starand planet properties, observational effects, and selection criteria. weconsider several different ground-based surveys and express the resultingyields as a function of stellar mass. selecting targets based on their youth,visual brightness, and proximity to the sun, we find that strong correlationsbetween star mass and planet properties are required to reproduce high-contrastimaging results to date. using the most recent empirical findings for theoccurrence rate of planets from rv surveys, our simulations indicate thatextrapolation of the doppler planet population to separations accessible tohigh-contrast instruments provides excellent agreement between simulations andobservations using present-day contrast levels. in addition to beingintrinsically young and bright to serve as their own beacon for ao correction,a-stars have a high planet occurrence rate and propensity to form massiveplanets in wide orbits, making them ideal targets. the same effects responsiblefor creating a multitude of detectable planets around massive stars conspire toreduce the number orbiting low-mass stars. however, in the case of a youngstellar cluster, mk-stars can dominate the number of detections because of anobservational bias related to small number statistics. the degree to whichlow-mass stars produce the most detections in this special case depends uponformation mechanism.

1105.2027	eclipsing binary science via the merging of transit and doppler  exoplanet survey data - a case study with the marvels pilot project and  superwasp	exoplanet transit and doppler surveys discover many binary stars during theiroperation that can be used to conduct a variety of ancillary science.specifically, eclipsing binary stars can be used to study the stellarmass-radius relationship and to test predictions of theoretical stellarevolution models. by cross-referencing 24 binary stars found in the marvelspilot project with superwasp photometry, we find two new eclipsing binaries,tyc 0272-00458-1 and tyc 1422-01328-1, which we use as case studies to developa general approach to eclipsing binaries in survey data. tyc 0272-00458-1 is asingle-lined spectroscopic binary for which we calculate a mass of thesecondary and radii for both components using reasonable constraints on theprimary mass through several different techniques. for a primary mass of m_1 =0.92 +/- 0.1 m_solar, we find m_2 = 0.610 +/- 0.036 m_solar, r_1 = 0.932 +/-0.076 r_solar and r_2 = 0.559 +/- 0.102 r_solar, and find that both stars havemasses and radii consistent with model predictions. tyc 1422-01328-1 is atriple-component system for which we can directly measure the masses and radiiof the eclipsing pair. we find that the eclipsing pair consists of an evolvedprimary star (m_1 = 1.163 +/- 0.034 m_solar, r_1 = 2.063 +/- 0.058 r_solar) anda g-type dwarf secondary (m_2 = 0.905 +/- 0.067 m_solar, r_2 = 0.887 +/- 0.037r_solar). we provide the framework necessary to apply this analysis to muchlarger datasets.

1111.6102	application of a damped locally optimized combination of images method  to the spectral characterization of faint companions using an integral field  spectrograph	high-contrast imaging instruments are now being equipped with integral fieldspectrographs (ifs) to facilitate the detection and characterization of faintsubstellar companions. algorithms currently envisioned to handle ifs data, suchas the locally optimized combination of images (loci) algorithm, rely uponaggressive point-spread-function (psf) subtraction, which is ideal forinitially identifying companions but results in significantly biased photometryand spectroscopy due to unwanted mixing with residual starlight. thisspectro-photometric issue is further complicated by the fact that algorithmiccolor response is a function of the companion's spectrum, making it difficultto calibrate the effects of the reduction without using iterations involving aseries of injected synthetic companions. in this paper, we introduce a new psfcalibration method, which we call "damped loci", that seeks to alleviate theseconcerns. by modifying the cost function that determines the weightingcoefficients used to construct psf reference images, and also forcing thosecoefficients to be positive, it is possible to extract companion spectra with aprecision that is set by calibration of the instrument response andtransmission of the atmosphere, and not by post-processing. we demonstrate theutility of this approach using on-sky data obtained with the project 1640 ifsat palomar. damped-loci does not require any iterations on the underlyingspectral type of the companion, nor does it rely upon priors involving thechromatic and statistical properties of speckles. it is a general techniquethat can readily be applied to other current and planned instruments thatemploy ifs's.

(2012) argued that higheccentricity migration (hem) mechanisms proposed for situating these close-inplanets should produce an observable population of highly eccentric proto-hotjupiters that have not yet tidally circularized. hem should also createfailed-hot jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fastcircularization. using the technique we previously presented for measuringeccentricities from photometry (the "photoeccentric effect"), we are distillinga collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot jupiters from the keplerobjects of interest (koi). here we present the first, koi-1474.01, which has along orbital period (69.7340 days) and a large eccentricity e =0.81+0.10/-0.07, skirting the proto-hot jupiter boundary. combining keplerphotometry, ground-based spectroscopy, and stellar evolution models, wecharacterize host koi-1474 as a rapidly-rotating f-star. statistical argumentsreveal that the transiting candidate has a low false-positive probability of3.1%. koi-1474.01 also exhibits transit timing variations of order an hour. weexplore characteristics of the third-body perturber, which is possibly the"smoking-gun" cause of koi-1474.01's large eccentricity. using the host-star'srotation period, radius, and projected rotational velocity, we findkoi-1474.01's orbit is marginally consistent with aligned with the stellar spinaxis, although a reanalysis is warranted with future additional data. finally,we discuss how the number and existence of proto-hot jupiters will not onlydemonstrate that hot jupiters migrate via hem, but also shed light on thetypical timescale for the mechanism.

1301.0023	characterizing the cool kois iv: kepler-32 as a prototype for the  formation of compact planetary systems throughout the galaxy	the kepler space telescope has opened new vistas in exoplanet discovery spaceby revealing populations of earth-sized planets that provide a new context forunderstanding planet formation. approximately 70% of all stars in the galaxybelong to the diminutive m dwarf class, several thousand of which lie withinkepler's field of view, and a large number of these targets show planet transitsignals. kepler-32 is a typical star in the kepler m dwarf sample that presentsus with a rare opportunity: five planets transit this star giving us anexpansive view of its architecture. all five planets of this compact systemorbit their host star within a distance one third the size of mercury's orbitwith the innermost planet positioned a mere 4.3 stellar radii from the stellarphotosphere. new observations limit possible false positive scenarios allowingus to validate the entire kepler-32 system making it the richest known systemof transiting planets around an m dwarf. based on considerations of the stellardust sublimation radius, the near period commensurability of three adjacentplanets, a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, and the volatile contentinferred for the planets, we propose that the kepler-32 planets formed atlarger orbital radii and migrated inward to their present locations. thevolatile content inferred for the kepler-32 planets and order of magnitudeestimates for the disk migration rates suggest these planets may have formedbeyond the snow line and migrated in the presence of a gaseous disk. thekepler-32 planets are representative of the full ensemble of planet candidatesorbiting the kepler m dwarfs for which we calculate an occurrence rate of 1.0+/- 0.1 planet per star. the formation of the kepler-32 planets thereforeoffers a plausible blueprint for the formation of one of the largest knownpopulations of planets in our galaxy.

(2011) that includes the effects of macroturbulence,instrumental broadening, and convective blueshift to accurately model theanomaly in the net rv caused by the planet eclipsing part of the rotating star.obliquity measurements are an important tool for testing theories of planetformation and migration. to date, the measured obliquities of ~50 jovianplanets span the full range, from prograde to retrograde, with planets orbitingcool stars preferentially showing alignment of stellar spins and planetaryorbits. our results are consistent with this pattern emerging from tidalinteractions in the convective envelopes of cool stars and close-in planets. inaddition, our 1.8 years of new rvs for this system show that the orbit of theouter planet is more poorly constrained than previously thought, with anorbital period now in the range of 10-36 years.

1307.5849	the trends high-contrast imaging survey. iv. the occurrence rate of  giant planets around m-dwarfs	doppler-based planet surveys have discovered numerous giant planets but areincomplete beyond several au. at larger star-planet separations, direct planetdetection through high-contrast imaging has proven successful, but thistechnique is sensitive only to young planets and characterization relies upontheoretical evolution models. here we demonstrate that radial velocitymeasurements and high-contrast imaging can be combined to overcome theseissues. the presence of widely separated companions can be deduced byidentifying an acceleration (long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star.by obtaining high spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we ruleout scenarios in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binarycompanions with high statistical confidence. we report results from an analysisof doppler measurements of a sample of 111 m-dwarf stars with a median of 29radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr. bytargeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration ("trend") withadaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5% +/- 3.0% of m-dwarf stars hostone or more massive companions with 1 &lt; m/m_jupiter &lt; 13 and 0 &lt; a &lt; 20 au.these results are lower than analyses of the planet occurrence rate aroundhigher-mass stars. we find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by adouble power law in stellar mass m and metallicity f = [fe/h] such that f(m,f)= 0.039(+0.056,-0.028) m^(0.8(+1.1,-0.9)) 10^((3.8 +/- 1.2)f). our results areconsistent with gravitational microlensing measurements of the planetoccurrence rate; this study represents the first model-independent comparisonwith microlensing observations.

1309.3372	the kappa andromedae system: new constraints on the companion mass,  system age &amp; further multiplicity	kappa andromedae is a b9ivn star at 52 pc for which a faint substellarcompanion separated by 55 au was recently announced. in this work, we presentthe first spectrum of the companion, "kappa and b," using the project 1640high-contrast imaging platform. comparison of our low-resolution yjh-bandspectra to empirical brown dwarf spectra suggests an early-l spectral type.fitting synthetic spectra from phoenix model atmospheres to our observedspectrum allows us to constrain the effective temperature to ~2000k, as well asplace constraints on the companion surface gravity. further, we use previouslyreported log(g) and effective temperature measurements of the host star toargue that the kappa and system has an isochronal age of 220 +/- 100 myr, olderthan the 30 myr age reported previously. this interpretation of an older age iscorroborated by the photometric properties of kappa and b, which appear to bemarginally inconsistent with other 10-100 myr low-gravity l-dwarfs for thespectral type range we derive. in addition, we use keck aperture maskinginterferometry combined with published radial velocity measurements to rule outthe existence of any tight stellar companions to kappa and a that might beresponsible for the system's overluminosity. further, we show that luminosityenhancements due to a nearly "pole-on" viewing angle coupled with extremelyrapid rotation is unlikely. kappa and a is thus consistent with its slightlyevolved luminosity class (iv) and we propose here that kappa and, with arevised age of 220 +/- 100 myr, is an interloper to the 30 myr columbaassociation with which it was previously associated. the photometric andspectroscopic evidence for kappa and b combined with our re-assesment of thesystem age implies a substellar companion mass of 50^{+16}_{-13} jupitermasses, consistent with a brown dwarf rather than a planetary mass companion.

1508.06502	a comparison of spectroscopic versus imaging techniques for detecting  close companions to kepler objects of interest	(abbreviated) kepler planet candidates require both spectroscopic and imagingfollow-up observations to rule out false positives and detect blended stars.[...] in this paper, we examine a sample of 11 kepler host stars withcompanions detected by two techniques -- near-infrared adaptive optics and/oroptical speckle interferometry imaging, and a new spectroscopic deblendingmethod. we compare the companion teff and flux ratios (f_b/f_a, where a is theprimary and b is the companion) derived from each technique, and find no caseswhere both companion parameters agree within 1sigma errors. in 3/11 cases thecompanion teff values agree within 1sigma errors, and in 2/11 cases thecompanion f_b/f_a values agree within 1sigma errors. examining each keplersystem individually considering multiple avenues (isochrone mapping, contrastcurves, probability of being bound), we suggest two cases for which thetechniques most likely agree in their companion detections (detect the samecompanion star). overall, our results support the advantage the spectroscopicdeblending technique has for finding very close-in companions ($\theta\lesssim$0.02-0.05") that are not easily detectable with imaging. however, wealso specifically show how high-contrast ao and speckle imaging observationsdetect companions at larger separations ($\theta \geq$0.02-0.05") that aremissed by the spectroscopic technique, provide additional information forcharacterizing the companion and its potential contamination (e.g., pa,separation, $\delta$m), and cover a wider range of primary star effectivetemperatures. the investigation presented here illustrates the utility ofcombining the two techniques to reveal higher-order multiples in knownplanet-hosting systems.

1510.00015	kelt-4ab: an inflated hot jupiter transiting the bright (v~10) component  of a hierarchical triple	we report the discovery of kelt-4ab, an inflated, transiting hot jupiterorbiting the brightest component of a hierarchical triple stellar system. thehost star is an f star with $t_{\rm eff}=6206\pm75$ k, $\log g=4.108\pm0.014$,$\left[{\rm fe}/{\rm h}\right]=-0.116_{-0.069}^{+0.065}$, ${\rmm_*}=1.201_{-0.061}^{+0.067} \ {\rm m}_{\odot}$, and ${\rmr_*}=1.610_{-0.068}^{+0.078} \ {\rm r}_{\odot}$. the best-fit linear ephemerisis $\rm {bjd_{tdb}} = 2456193.29157 \pm 0.00021 + e\left(2.9895936 \pm0.0000048\right)$. with a magnitude of $v\sim10$, a planetary radius of$1.699_{-0.045}^{+0.046} \ {\rm r_j}$, and a mass of $0.902_{-0.059}^{+0.060} \{\rm m_j}$, it is the brightest host among the population of inflated hotjupiters ($r_p &gt; 1.5r_j$), making it a valuable discovery for probing thenature of inflated planets. in addition, its existence within a hierarchicaltriple and its proximity to earth ($210$ pc) provides a unique opportunity fordynamical studies with continued monitoring with high resolution imaging andprecision radial velocities. in particular, the motion of the binary starsaround each other and of both stars around the primary star relative to themeasured epoch in this work should be detectable when it rises in october 2015.

1510.03813	the leech exoplanet imaging survey: orbit and component masses of the  intermediate age, late-type binary no uma	we present high-resolution large binocular telescope lbti/lmircam images ofthe spectroscopic and astrometric binary no uma obtained as part of the lbtiexozodi exoplanet common hunt (leech) exoplanet imaging survey. our h, k$_s$,and l'-band observations resolve the system at angular separations &lt;0.09". thecomponents exhibit significant orbital motion over a span of ~7 months. wecombine our imaging data with archival images, published speckle interferometrymeasurements, and existing spectroscopic velocity data to solve the fullorbital solution and estimate component masses. the masses of the k2.0$\pm$0.5primary and k6.5$\pm$0.5 secondary are 0.83$\pm$0.02 m$_{\odot}$ and0.64$\pm$0.02 m$_{\odot}$, respectively. we also derive a system distance of d= 25.87$\pm$0.02 pc and revise the galactic kinematics of no uma. our revisedgalactic kinematics confirm no uma as a nuclear member of the ~500 myr old ursamajor moving group and it is thus a mass and age benchmark. we compare themasses of the no uma binary components to those predicted by five sets ofstellar evolution models at the age of the ursa major group. we find excellentagreement between our measured masses and model predictions with littlesystematic scatter between the models. no uma joins the short list of nearby,bright, late-type binaries having known ages and fully characterized orbits.

1510.08062	friends of hot jupiters iii: an infrared spectroscopic search for  low-mass stellar companions	surveys of nearby field stars indicate that stellar binaries are common, yetlittle is known about the effects that these companions may have on planetformation and evolution. the friends of hot jupiters project uses threecomplementary techniques to search for stellar companions to knownplanet-hosting stars: radial velocity monitoring, adaptive optics imaging, andnear-infrared spectroscopy. in this paper, we examine high-resolution k bandinfrared spectra of fifty stars hosting gas giant planets on short-periodorbits. we use spectral fitting to search for blended lines due to the presenceof cool stellar companions in the spectra of our target stars, where we aresensitive to companions with temperatures between 3500-5000 k and projectedseparations less than 100 au in most systems. we identify eight systems withcandidate low-mass companions, including one companion that was independentlydetected in our ao imaging survey. for systems with radial velocityaccelerations, a spectroscopic non-detection rules out scenarios involving astellar companion in a high inclination orbit. we use these data to place anupper limit on the stellar binary fraction at small projected separations, andshow that the observed population of candidate companions is consistent withthat of field stars and also with the population of wide-separation companionsdetected in our previous ao survey. we find no evidence that spectroscopicstellar companions are preferentially located in systems with short-period gasgiant planets on eccentric and/or misaligned orbits.

1511.09183	the leech exoplanet imaging survey: characterization of the coldest  directly imaged exoplanet, gj 504 b, and evidence for super-stellar  metallicity	as gas giant planets and brown dwarfs radiate away the residual heat fromtheir formation, they cool through a spectral type transition from l to t,which encompasses the dissipation of cloud opacity and the appearance of strongmethane absorption. while there are hundreds of known t-type brown dwarfs, thefirst generation of directly-imaged exoplanets were all l-type. recently,kuzuhara et al. (2013) announced the discovery of gj 504 b, the first t dwarfexoplanet. gj 504 b provides a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of anew type of exoplanet with a ~500 k temperature that bridges the gap betweenthe first directly imaged planets (~1000 k) and our own solar system's jupiter(~130 k). we observed gj 504 b in three narrow l-band filters (3.71, 3.88, and4.00 microns), spanning the red end of the broad methane fundamental absorptionfeature (3.3 microns) as part of the leech exoplanet imaging survey. bycomparing our new photometry and literature photometry to a grid of custommodel atmospheres, we were able to fit gj 504 b's unusual spectral energydistribution for the first time. we find that gj 504 b is well-fit by modelswith the following parameters: t_eff=544+/-10 k, g&lt;600 m/s^2,[m/h]=0.60+/-0.12, cloud opacity parameter of f_sed=2-5, r=0.96+/-0.07 r_jup,and log(l)=-6.13+/-0.03 l_sun, implying a hot start mass of 3-30 m_jup for aconservative age range of 0.1-6.5 gyr. of particular interest, our model fitssuggest that gj 504 b has a super-stellar metallicity. since planet formationcan create objects with non-stellar metallicities, while binary star formationcannot, this result suggests that gj 504 b formed like a planet, not like abinary companion.
