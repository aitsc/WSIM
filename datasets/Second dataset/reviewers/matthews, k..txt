0706.1782	a constant spectral index for sagittarius a* during infrared/x-ray  intensity variations	we report the first time-series of broadband infrared (ir) color measurementsof sgr a*, the variable emission source associated with the supermassive blackhole at the galactic center. using the laser and natural guide star ao systemson the keck ii telescope, we imaged sgr a* in multiple near-infrared broadbandfilters with a typical cycle time of ~3 min during 4 observing runs(2005-2006), two of which were simultaneous with chandra x-ray measurements. inspite of the large range of dereddened flux densities for sgr a* (2-30 mjy),all of our near-ir measurements are consistent with a constant spectral indexof alpha = -0.6+-0.2. furthermore, this value is consistent with the spectralindices observed at x-ray wavelengths during nearly all outbursts; which isconsistent with the synchrotron self-compton model for the production of thex-ray emission. during the coordinated observations, one ir outburst occurs &lt;36min after a possibly associated x-ray outburst, while several similar iroutbursts show no elevated x-ray emission. a variable x-ray to ir ratio andconstant infrared spectral index challenge the notion that the ir and x-rayemission are connected to the same electrons. we, therefore, posit that thepopulation of electrons responsible for both the ir and x-ray emission aregenerated by an acceleration mechanism that leaves the bulk of the electronenergy distribution responsible for the ir emission unchanged, but has avariable high-energy cutoff. occasionally a tail of electrons &gt;1 gev isgenerated, and it is this high-energy tail that gives rise to the x-rayoutbursts. one possible explanation for this type of variation is from theturbulence induced by a magnetorotational instability, in which the outer scalelength of the turbulence varies and changes the high-energy cutoff.

0903.0383	the galactic center: a laboratory for fundamental astrophysics and  galactic nuclei	as the closest example of a galactic nucleus, the galactic center presents anexquisite laboratory for learning about supermassive black holes (smbh) andtheir environs. detailed studies of stellar dynamics deep in the potential wellof a galaxy, with exisiting and future large ground-based telescopes, offerseveral exciting directions in the coming decade. first, it will be possible toobtain precision measurements of the galaxy's central potential, providing botha unique test of general relativity (gr) and a detection of the extended darkmatter distribution that is predicted to exist around the smbh. tests ofgravity have not previously been possible on the mass scale of a smbh.similarly, only upper limits on the extended matter distribution on smallscales currently exist; detection of dark matter on these scales is animportant test of lambda-cdm and the detection of stellar remnants would reveala population that may dominate the stellar dynamics on the smallest scales.second, our detailed view of the smbh and its local gas and stellar environmentprovides insight into how smbhs at the centers of galaxies form, grow andinteract with their environs as well as on the exotic processes at work in thedensest stellar clusters in the universe. the key questions, still unanswered,of when and how smbhs formed in the early universe, and the myriad ways inwhich feedback from smbhs can affect structure formation, can be informed bydirectly observing the physical processes operating at the smbh.

1110.2536	disentangling baryons and dark matter in the spiral gravitational lens  b1933+503	measuring the relative mass contributions of luminous and dark matter inspiral galaxies is important for understanding their formation and evolution.the combination of a galaxy rotation curve and strong lensing is a powerful wayto break the disk-halo degeneracy that is inherent in each of the methodsindividually. we present an analysis of the 10-image radio spiral lensb1933+503 at z_l=0.755, incorporating (1) new global vlbi observations, (2) newadaptive-optics assisted k-band imaging, (3) new spectroscopic observations forthe lens galaxy rotation curve and the source redshift. we construct athree-dimensionally axisymmetric mass distribution with 3 components: anexponential profile for the disk, a point mass for the bulge, and an nfwprofile for the halo. the mass model is simultaneously fitted to the kinematicsand the lensing data. the nfw halo needs to be oblate with a flattening ofa/c=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.05} to be consistent with the radio data. this suggeststhat baryons are effective at making the halos oblate near the center. thelensing and kinematics analysis probe the inner ~10 kpc of the galaxy, and weobtain a lower limit on the halo scale radius of 16 kpc (95% ci). the darkmatter mass fraction inside a sphere with a radius of 2.2 disk scale lengths isf_{dm,2.2}=0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}. the contribution of the disk to the totalcircular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths is 0.76^{+0.05}_{-0.06}, suggestingthat the disk is marginally submaximal. the stellar mass of the disk from ourmodeling is log_{10}(m_{*}/m_{sun}) = 11.06^{+0.09}_{-0.11} assuming that thecold gas contributes ~20% to the total disk mass. in comparison to the stellarmasses estimated from stellar population synthesis models, the stellar initialmass function of chabrier is preferred to that of salpeter by a probabilityfactor of 7.2.

1304.5280	keck observations of the galactic center source g2: gas cloud or star?	we present new observations and analysis of g2 - the intriguing redemission-line object which is quickly approaching the galaxy's central blackhole. the observations were obtained with the laser guide star adaptive opticssystems on the w. m. keck i and ii telescopes and include spectroscopy (r ~3600) centered on the hydrogen br-gamma line as well as k' (2.1 micrometer) andl' (3.8 micrometer) imaging. analysis of these observations shows the br-gammaline emission has a positional offset from the l' continuum. this offset islikely due to background source confusion at l'. we therefore present the firstorbital solution derived from br-gamma line astrometry, which when coupled withradial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach(2014.21 +/- 0.14), closer periastron (130 au, 1900rs), and higher eccentricity(0.9814 +/- 0.0060) compared to a solution using l' astrometry. the new orbitcasts doubt on previous associations of g2 and a low surface brightness "tail".it is shown that g2 has no k' counterpart down to k' ~ 20 mag. g2's l'continuum and the br-gamma line-emission is unresolved in almost all epochs;however it is marginally extended in our highest quality br-gamma data set from2006 and exhibits a clear velocity gradient at that time. while theobservations altogether suggest that g2 has a gaseous component which istidally interacting with the central black hole, there is likely a central starproviding the self-gravity necessary to sustain the compact nature of thisobject.

astro-ph;0212175	near-infrared observations of powerful high-redshift radio galaxies: 4c  40.36 and 4c 39.37	we present near-infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of two fr iihigh-redshift radio galaxies (hzrgs), 4c 40.36 (z=2.3) and 4c 39.37 (z=3.2),obtained with the hubble, keck, and hale telescopes. high resolution imageswere taken with filters both in and out of strong emission lines, and togetherwith the spectroscopic data, the properties of the line and continuum emissionswere carefully analyzed. our analysis of 4c 40.36 and 4c 39.37 shows thatstrong emission lines (e.g., [o iii] 5007 a and h alpha+[n ii]) contribute tothe broad-band fluxes much more significantly than previously estimated (80%vs. 20-40%), and that when the continuum sources are imaged through line-freefilters, they show an extremely compact morphology with a high surfacebrightness. if we use the r^1/4-law parametrization, their effective radii(r(e)) are only 2-3 kpc while their restframe b-band surface brightnesses atr(e) are i(b) ~ 18 mag/arcsec^2. compared with z ~ 1 3cr radio galaxies, theformer is x3-5 smaller, while the latter is 1-1.5 mag brighter than what ispredicted from the i(b)-r(e) correlation. although exponential profiles produceequally good fits for 4c 40.36 and 4c 39.37, this clearly indicates that withrespect to the z~1 3cr radio galaxies, the light distribution of these twohzrgs is much more centrally concentrated. spectroscopically, 4c 40.36 shows aflat (fnu=const) continuum while 4c 39.37 shows a spectrum as red as that of alocal giant elliptical galaxy. although this difference may be explained interms of a varying degree of star formation, the similarities of their surfacebrightness profiles and the submillimeter detection of 4c 39.37 might suggestthat the intrinsic spectra is equally blue (young stars or an agn), and thatthe difference is the amount of reddening.

astro-ph;0301377	discovery of early optical emission from grb 021211	we report our discovery and early time optical, near-infrared, and radiowavelength follow-up observations of the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst grb021211. our optical observations, beginning 21 min after the burst trigger,demonstrate that the early afterglow of this burst is roughly three magnitudesfainter than the afterglow of grb 990123 at similar epochs, and fainter thanalmost all known afterglows at an epoch of 1d after the grb. our near-infraredand optical observations indicate that this is not due to extinction. combiningour observations with data reported by other groups, we identify the signatureof a reverse shock. this reverse shock is not detected to a 3-sigma limit of110 ujy in an 8.46-ghz vla observation at t=0.10d, implying either that thelorentz factor of the burst gamma &lt;~ 200, or that synchrotron self-absorptioneffects dominate the radio emission at this time. our early opticalobservations, near the peak of the optical afterglow (forward shock), allow usto characterize the afterglow in detail. comparing our model to flux upperlimits from the vla at later times, t &gt;~ 1 week, we find that the late-timeradio flux is suppressed by a factor of two relative to the &gt;~ 80 ujy peak fluxat optical wavelengths. this suppression is not likely to be due to synchrotronself-absorption or an early jet break, and we suggest instead that the burstmay have suffered substantial radiative corrections.

astro-ph;0302299	the first measurement of spectral lines in a short-period star bound to  the galaxy's central black hole: a paradox of youth	we have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one ofthe high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the galaxy's central supermassiveblack hole. both brgamma (2.1661 micron) and he i (2.1126 micron) are seen inabsorption in s0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+-0.3 ang &amp; 1.7+-0.4 ang) and aninferred stellar rotational velocity (220+-40 km/s) that are consistent withthat of an o8-b0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 msun), young(&lt;10 myr) main sequence star. this presents a major challenge to star formationtheories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reachedby s0-2 in its current orbit (130 - 1900 au) and the difficulty in migratingthis star inward during its lifetime from further out where tidal forces shouldno longer preclude star formation. the radial velocity measurements (-510+-40km/s) and our reported proper motions for s0-2 strongly constrain its orbit,providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+-0.6)x10^6(ro/8kpc)^3msun. the keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainities that are reduced by afactor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the firsttime, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, whileconsistent with the nominal infrared position of sgr a*, is localized to afactor of 5 more precisely (+-2 milli-arcsec). furthermore, the ambiguity inthe inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radialvelocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at thetime of closest approach and counter-revolving against the galaxy. with furtherradial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of s0-2 willprovide the most robust estimate of the distance to the galactic center.

0808.2870	measuring distance and properties of the milky way's central  supermassive black hole with stellar orbits	we report new precision measurements of the properties of our galaxy'ssupermassive black hole. based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity(2000-2007) measurements from the w. m. keck 10-meter telescopes, a fullyunconstrained keplerian orbit for the short period star s0-2 provides valuesfor ro of 8.0+-0.6 kpc, m_bh of 4.1+-0.6x10^6 mo, and the black hole's radialvelocity, which is consistent with zero with 30 km/s uncertainty. if the blackhole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the galaxy, we can furtherconstrain the fit and obtain ro = 8.4+-0.4 kpc and m_bh = 4.5+-0.4x10^6 mo.more complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be lessthan 3-4x10^5 mo within 0.01 pc, ~100x higher than predictions from stellar andstellar remnant models. for all models, we identify transient astrometricshifts from source confusion and the assumptions regarding the black hole'sradial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy andthe usefulness of fainter stars. future astrometric and rv observations willremedy these effects. our estimates of ro and the galaxy's local rotationspeed, which it is derived from combining ro with the apparent proper motion ofsgr a*, (theta0 = 229+-18 km/s), are compatible with measurements made usingother methods. the increased black hole mass found in this study, compared tothat determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period forthe innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars inthe vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the m_bh-sigmarelation.

astro-ph;9710374	evidence for a disk-jet interaction in the microquasar grs 1915+105	we report simultaneous x-ray and infrared (ir) observations of the galacticmicroquasar grs1915+105 using xte and the palomar 200-inch telescope on august13-15, 1997 utc. during the last two nights, the microquasar grs 1915+105exhibited quasi-regular x-ray/infrared (ir) flares with a spacing of $\sim 30$minutes. while the physical mechanism triggering the flares is currentlyunknown, the one-to-one correspondence and consistent time offset between thex-ray and ir flares establish a close link between the two. at late times inthe flares the x-ray and ir bands appear to ``decouple'', with the x-ray bandshowing large-amplitude fast oscillations while the ir shows a much smoother,more symmetrical decline. in at least three cases, the ir flare has returned tonear its minimum while the x-rays continue in the elevated oscillatory state,ruling out thermal reprocessing of the x-ray flux as the source of ir flare.furthermore, observations of similar ir and radio flares by fender et al.(1997) imply that the source of the ir flux in such flares is synchrotronemission. the common rise and subsequent decoupling of the x-ray and ir fluxand probable synchrotron origin of the ir emission is consistent with ascenario wherein the ir flux originates in a relativistic plasma which has beenejected from the inner accretion disk. in that case, these simultaneousx-ray/ir flares from a black-hole/relativistic-jet system are the first clearobservational evidence linking of the time-dependent interaction of the jet andthe inner disk in decades of quasar and microquasar studies.

astro-ph;9801216	the multiplicity of the hyades and its implications for binary star  formation and evolution	a 2.2 micron speckle imaging survey of 167 bright (k $&lt; 8.5$ mag) hyadesmembers reveals a total of 33 binaries with separations spanning 0."044 to1."34 and magnitude differences as large as 5.5 mag. of these binaries, 13 arenew detections. combining the results of this survey with previous radialvelocity, optical speckle, and direct imaging hyades surveys, the detectedmultiplicity of the sample is: 98 singles, 59 binaries, and 10 triples.  a statistical analysis of this sample investigates a variety of multiple starformation and evolution theories. accounting for the inability to detect highflux ratio binaries results in an implied companion star fraction (csf) of 0.30+/- 0.06 in this separation range 0."1 to 1."07 (5 to 50 au). the hyades csf isintermediate between the values derived from observations of t tauri stars (ttauri csf=0.40 +/- 0.08) and solar neighborhood g-dwarfs (g-dwarf csf=0.14 +/-0.03). this result allows for an evolution of the csf from an initially highvalue for the pre-main sequence to that found for main sequence stars. withinthe hyades, the csf is independent of the radial distance from the clustercenter and the primary star mass. the distribution of mass ratios is best fitby a power law q^(-1.3 +/- 0.3) and shows no dependence on the primary mass,binary separation, or the radial distance from the cluster center. overall, thehyades data are consistent with scale-free fragmentation, but inconsistent withcapture in small clusters and disk-assisted capture in small clusters. withouttestable predictions, scale-dependent fragmentation and disk fragmentationcannot be assessed with the hyades data.

astro-ph;9802299	the spectrum of the brown dwarf gliese 229b	we present a spectrum of the cool (t_eff = 900 k) brown dwarf gliese 229b.this spectrum, with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio per spectralresolution element (&gt; 30), spans the wavelength range from 0.837 microns to 5.0microns. we identify a total of four different major methane absorptionfeatures, including the fundamental band at 3.3 microns, at least four steambands, and two neutral cesium features. we confirm the recent detection ofcarbon monoxide (co) in excess of what is predicted by thermochemicalequilibrium calculations. carbon is primarily involved in a chemical balancebetween methane and co at the temperatures and pressures present in the outerparts of a brown dwarf. at lower temperatures, the balance favors methane,while in the deeper, hotter regions, the reaction reverses to convert methaneinto co. the presence of co in the observable part of the atmosphere istherefore a sensitive indicator of vertical flows. the high signal-to-noiseratio in the 1 to 2.5 microns region permits us to place constraints on thequantity of dust in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf. we are unable toreconcile the observed spectrum with synthetic spectra that include thepresences of dust. the presence of co but lack of dust may be a clue to thelocation of the boundaries of the outer convective region of the atmosphere:the lack of dust may mean that it is not being conveyed into the photosphere byconvection, or that it exists in patchy clouds. if the dust is not in clouds,but rather sits below the outer convective region, we estimate that theboundary between outer convective and inner radiative layers is between 1250 kand 1600 k, in agreement with recent models.

astro-ph;9805219	near infrared observations of a redshift 4.92 galaxy: evidence for  significant dust absorption	near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy have been obtained of thegravitationally lensed galaxy at z=4.92 discovered in hst images by franx etal. (1997). images at 1.2, 1.6 and 2.2 microns show the same arc morphology asthe hst images. the spectrum with resolution \lambda / \delta\lambda ~ 70 showsno emission lines with equivalent width stronger than 100 a in the rest framewavelength range 0.34 to 0.40 microns. in particular, [oii]3727 a and[neiii]3869 a are not seen. the energy distribution is quite blue, as expectedfor a young stellar population with the observed ly alpha flux. the spectralenergy distribution can be fit satisfactorily for such a young stellarpopulation when absorption by dust is included. the models imply a reddening0.1 mag &lt; e(b-v) &lt; 0.4 mag. the stellar mass of the lensed galaxy lies in therange of 2 to 16 x 10^9 msun. this is significantly higher than estimates basedon the hst data alone. our data imply that absorption by dust is important toredshifts of ~5.

astro-ph;9806243	near infrared observations of a redshift 5.34 galaxy: further evidence  for dust absorption in the early universe	imaging at 1.25 and 2.20 microns has been obtained of the field containingthe galaxy (rd1) found at redshift 5.34 by dey et al.(1998). this galaxy hasbeen detected at 1.25 microns, while the lower redshift (z=4.02) galaxy alsofound in the same field by dey et al. was detected at both 1.25 and 2.20microns. comparison to stellar population synthesis models indicates that ifrd1 is a young (&lt; 100 myr old) galaxy, significant reddening (a(v) &gt; 0.5 mag)is indicated. combined with observations of other high redshift systems, thesedata show that dust is likely to be an important component of young galaxieseven at redshifts of z &gt; 5. the extinction-corrected monochromatic luminosityof rd1 at 1500 angstroms is then a factor of about three larger than l(1500)*as determined by dickinson (1998) for z ~ 3 starburst galaxies. the impliedstar formation rate in rd1, corrected for extinction, is ~ 50-100 solar massesper year.

astro-ph;9810120	high spatial resolution imaging of arp 220 from 3 - 25 microns	images of arp 220 from 3.45 to 24.5 $\mu$m with 0.5'' resolution arepresented which clearly separate the nucleus into at least two components. thewestern component is about three times more luminous than the easterncomponent, but the silicate absorption in the fainter, eastern component isroughly 50% greater than the absorption in the western component. eachcomponent is marginally resolved. the two components seen at 24.5 $\mu$m areidentified with the two radio components. the western source most likelycoincides with the high extinction disk previously suggested to exist in arp220, while the eastern nucleus is identified with a faint highly reddenedsource seen in hst 2.2 $\mu$m nicmos images. the two nuclei together accountfor essentially all of the measured 24.5 $\mu$m flux density. two models arepresented, both of which fit the observations. in one, the majority of thetotal luminosity is produced in an extended star formation region and in theother most of the luminosity is produced in the compact but extincted regionsassociated with the two nuclei seen at 24.5 $\mu$m. in both pictures,substantial luminosity at 100 $\mu$m emerges from a component having a diameterof 2--3'' ($\sim$1kpc).

astro-ph;9811167	b2045+265: a new four-image gravitational lens from class	we have discovered a new gravitational lens in the cosmic lens all-sky survey(class). b2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9arcsec. a fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and itspositional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy stronglysuggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. this implies that theb2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed byanother flat-spectrum radio source. infrared images detect the lensed images ofthe background source and the lensing galaxy. the lensed images have relativepositions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radiowavelengths. spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and asource redshift of z_s=1.28. the image splitting and system redshifts implythat the projected mass inside the einstein radius of the lensing galaxy ism_e=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} m_sun. an estimate of the light emitted inside theeinstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame b band of(m/l_b)_e = 20 h (m/l_b)_sun. both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higherthan what is seen in nearby sa galaxies. in fact, the implied rotation velocityfor the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearbyspirals. the large projected mass inside the einstein ring radius may be theresult of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from acompact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentificationof the source redshift. a simple model of the gravitational potential of thelens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required tosatisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. with furtherobservations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of h_0.

astro-ph;9910557	high resolution infrared imaging of the compact nuclear source in  ngc4258	we present high resolution imaging of the nucleus of ngc4258 from 1 micron to18 microns. our observations reveal that the previously discovered compactsource of emission is unresolved even at the near-infrared resolution of about0.2 arcsec fwhm which corresponds to about 7 pc at the distance of the galaxy.this is consistent with the source of emission being the region in theneighborhood of the purported 3.5*10^7 m_sun black hole. after correcting forabout 18 mags of visual extinction, the infrared data are consistent with af_nu \propto nu^(-1.4+/-0.1) spectrum from 1.1 micron to 18 micron, implying anon-thermal origin. based on this spectrum, the total extinction correctedinfrared luminosity (1-20 micron) of the central source is 2*10^8 l_sun. weargue that the infrared spectrum and luminosity of the central source obviatesthe need for a substantial contribution from a standard, thin accretion disk atthese wavelengths and calculate the accretion rate through an advectiondominated accretion flow to be mdot \sim 10^(-3) m_sun/yr. the agreementbetween these observations and the theoretical spectral energy distribution foradvection dominated flows provides evidence for the existence of an advectiondominated flow in this low luminosity agn.
