0902.4890	the evolution of galaxy clusters across cosmic time	the large scale structure of the present universe is determined by the growthof dark matter density fluctuations and by the dynamical action of dark energyand dark matter. while much progress has been made in recent years inconstraining the cosmological parameters, and in reconstructing the evolutionin the large--scale structure of the dark matter distribution, we still lack anunderstanding of the evolution of the baryonic component of the universe.  located at nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies are the largestcollapsed structures in the universe with total masses up to 10$^{15}$m$_{\sun}$. over 80% of their mass resides in the form of dark matter. theremaining mass is composed of baryons, most of which (about 85%) is a diffuse,hot plasma that radiates primarily in x-rays. x-ray observations of theevolving cluster population provide a unique opportunity to address such openand fundamental questions as: how do hot diffuse baryons dynamically evolve indark matter potentials? how and when was the excess energy which we observe inthe intergalactic medium generated? what is the cosmic history of heavy-elementproduction and circulation?  our current knowledge comes primarily from detailed studies of clusters inthe relatively nearby universe (z$&lt;$0.5). major advances will come from highthroughput, high spectral and spatial resolution x-ray observations thatmeasure the thermodynamical properties and metal content of the first low massclusters emerging at z $\sim$ 2 and directly trace their evolution into today'smassive clusters.

0903.2878	suzaku observations of near-relativistic outflows in the bal quasar apm  08279+5255	we present results from three suzaku observations of the z=3.91gravitationally lensed broad absorption line quasar apm 08279+5255. we detectstrong and broad absorption at rest-frame energies of &lt;2 kev (low-energy) and7-12 kev (high-energy). the detection of these features confirms the results ofprevious long-exposure (80-90 ks) chandra and xmm-newton observations. the lowand high-energy absorption is detected in both the back-illuminated (bi) andfront-illuminated (fi) suzaku xis spectra (with an f-test significance of&gt;99%). we interpret the low-energy absorption as arising from a low-ionizationabsorber with log nh~23 and the high-energy absorption as due to lines arisingfrom highly ionized (2.75 &lt; log xi &lt; 4.0; where xi is the ionization parameter)iron in a near-relativistic outflowing wind. assuming this interpretation wefind that the velocities in the outflow range between 0.1c and 0.6c. weconstrain the angle between the outflow direction of the x-ray absorber and ourline of sight to be &lt;36 degrees. we also detect likely variability of theabsorption lines (at the &gt;99.9% and &gt;98% significance levels in the fi and bispectra, respectively) with a rest-frame time scale of ~1 month. assuming thatthe detected high-energy absorption features arise from fe xxv, we estimatethat the fraction of the total bolometric energy injected over the quasar'slifetime into the intergalactic medium in the form of kinetic energy to be&gt;10%.

0906.4342	the sizes of the x-ray and optical emission regions of rxj1131-1231	we use gravitational microlensing of the four images of the z=0.658 quasarrxj1131-1231 to measure the sizes of the optical and x-ray emission regions ofthe quasar. the (face-on) scale length of the optical disk at rest frame 400 nmis 1.3 10^15cm, while the half-light radius of the rest frame 0.3-17 kev x-rayemission is 2.3 10^14cm. the formal uncertainties are factors of 1.6 and 2.0,respectively. with the exception of the lower limit on the x-ray size, theresults are very stable against any changes in the priors used in the analysis.based on the hbeta line-width, we estimate that the black hole mass is ~10^8msun, which corresponds to a gravitational radius of r_g~2 10^13 cm. thus, thex-ray emission is emerging on scales of ~10r_g and the 400 nm emission onscales of ~70 r_g. a standard thin disk of this size should be significantlybrighter than observed. possible solutions are to have a flatter temperatureprofile or to scatter a large fraction of the optical flux on larger scalesafter it is emitted. while our calculations were not optimized to constrain thedark matter fraction in the lens galaxy, dark matter dominated models arefavored. with well-sampled optical and x-ray light curves over a broad range offrequencies there will be no difficulty in extending our analysis to completelymap the structure of the accretion disk as a function of wavelength.

0907.3464	high velocity outflows in narrow absorption line quasars	the current paradigm for the agn phenomenon is a central engine that consistsof an inflow of material accreting in the form of a disk onto a supermassiveblack hole. observations in the uv and optical find high velocity ionizedmaterial outflowing from the black hole. we present results from suzaku andxmm-newton observations of a sample of intrinsic nal quasars with high velocityoutflows. our derived values of the intrinsic column densities of the x-rayabsorbers are consistent with an outflow scenario in which nal quasars areviewed at smaller inclination angles than bal quasars. we find that thedistributions of alpha_ox and dalpha_ox of the nal quasars of our sample differsignificantly from those of bal quasars and sdss radio-quiet quasars. the nalquasars are not significantly absorbed in the x-ray band and the positivevalues of dalpha_ox suggest absorption in the uv band. the positive values ofdalpha_ox of the intrinsic nal quasars can be explained in a geometric scenariowhere our lines of sight towards the compact x-ray hot coronae of nal quasarsdo not traverse the absorbing wind whereas lines of sight towards their uvemitting accretion disks do intercept the outflowing absorbers.

0910.0021	confirmation of and variable energy injection by a near-relativistic  outflow in apm 08279+5255	we present results from multi-epoch spectral analysis of xmm-newton andchandra observations of the broad absorption line (bal) quasar apm 08279+5255.our analysis shows significant x-ray bals in all epochs with rest-frameenergies lying in the range of ~ 6.7-18 kev. the x-ray bals and 0.2-10 kevcontinuum show significant variability on timescales as short as 3.3 days(proper time) implying a source size-scale of ~ 10 r_g, where r_g is thegravitational radius. we find a large gradient in the outflow velocity of thex-ray absorbers with projected outflow velocities of up to 0.76 c. the maximumoutflow velocity constrains the angle between the wind velocity and our line ofsight to be less than ~ 22 degrees. we identify the following components of theoutflow: (a) highly ionized x-ray absorbing material (2.9 &lt; logxi &lt; 3.9) and acolumn density of log n_h ~ 23 outflowing at velocities of up to 0.76 c. (b)low-ionization x-ray absorbing gas with log n_h ~ 22.8. we find that flatterspectra appear to result in lower outflow velocities. based on our spectralanalysis of observations of apm 08279+5255 over a period of 1.2 years (propertime) we estimate the mass-outflow rate and efficiency of the outflow to havevaried between 16(-8,+12) m_solar yr^-1 and 64(-40,+66) m_solar yr^-1 and0.18(-0.11,+0.15) to 1.7(-1.2+1.9), respectively. assuming that the outflowproperties of apm 08279+5255 are a common property of most quasars at similarredshifts, our results then imply that quasar winds are massive and energeticenough to influence significantly the formation of the host galaxy, providesignificant metal enrichment to the interstellar medium and intergalacticmedium, and are a viable mechanism for feedback at redshifts near the peak inthe number density of galaxy mergers.

1106.4032	a study of the x-rayed outflow of apm 08279+5255 through photoionization  codes	we present new results from our study of the x-rayed outflow of the z = 3.91gravitationally lensed broad absorption line (bal) quasar apm 08279+5255. theseresults are based on spectral fits to all the long exposure observations of apm08279+5255 using a new quasar-outflow model. this model is based on cloudysimulations of a near-relativistic quasar outflow. the main conclusions fromour multi-epoch spectral re-analysis of chandra, xmm-newton and suzakuobservations of apm 08279+5255 are: 1) in every observation we confirm thepresence of two strong features, one at rest-frame energies between 1-4 kev,and the other between 7-18 kev. 2) we confirm that the low-energy absorption(1-4 kev rest-frame) arises from a low-ionization absorber with lognh~23 andthe high-energy absorption (7-18 kev rest-frame) arises from highly ionized(3&gt;log xi&gt;4; where xi is the ionization parameter) iron in a near-relativisticoutflowing wind. assuming this interpretation, we find that the velocities onthe outflow could get up to ~0.7c. 3) we confirm a correlation between themaximum outflow velocity and the photon index and find possible trends betweenthe maximum outflow velocity and the x-ray luminosity, and between the totalcolumn density and the photon index. we performed calculations of the forcemultipliers of material illuminated by absorbed power laws and amathews-ferland sed. we found that variations of the x-ray and uv parts of theseds and the presence of a moderate absorbing shield will produce importantchanges in the strength of the radiative driving force. these results supportthe observed trend found between the outflow velocity and x-ray photon index inapm 08279+5255. if this result is confirmed it will imply that radiationpressure is an important mechanism in producing quasar outflows.

1204.4480	revealing the structure of an accretion disk through energy dependent  x-ray microlensing	we present results from monitoring observations of the gravitationally lensedquasar rx j1131-1231 performed with the chandra x-ray observatory. the x-rayobservations were planned with relatively long exposures that allowed a searchfor energy-dependent microlensing in the soft (0.2-2 kev) and hard (2-10 kev)light curves of the images of rx j1131-1231. we detect significant microlensingin the x-ray light-curves of images a and d, and energy-dependent microlensingof image d. the magnification of the soft band appears to be larger than thatin the hard band by a factor of ~ 1.3 when image d becomes more magnified. thiscan be explained by the difference between a compact, softer-spectrum coronathat is producing a more extended, harder spectrum reflection component off thedisk. this is supported by the evolution of the fluorescent iron line in imaged over three consecutive time-averaged phases of the light curve. in the firstperiod, a fe line at e = 6.36(-0.16,+0.13) kev is detected (at &gt; 99%confidence). in the second period, two fe lines are detected, one at e =5.47(-0.08,+0.06) kev (detected at &gt; 99% confidence) and another at e =6.02(-0.07,+0.09) kev (marginally detected at &gt; 90% confidence), and in thethird period, a broadened fe line at 6.42(-0.15,+0.19) kev is detected (at &gt;99% confidence). this evolution of the fe line profile during the microlensingevent is consistent with the line distortion expected when a caustic passesover the inner disk where the shape of the fluorescent fe line is distorted bygeneral relativistic and doppler effects.

1205.6587	hs 1700+6416: the first high redshift non lensed nal-qso showing  variable high velocity outflows	we present a detailed analysis of the x-ray emission of hs 1700+6416, a highredshift (z=2.7348), luminous quasar, classified as a narrow absorption line(nal) quasar on the basis of its sdss spectrum. the source has been observed 9times by chandra and once by xmm from 2000 to 2007. long term variability isclearly detected, between the observations, in the 2-10 kev flux varying by afactor of three (~3-9x10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2) and in the amount of neutralabsorption (nh &lt; 10^22 cm^-2 in 2000 and 2002 and nh=4.4+-1.2x10^22 cm^-2 in2007). most interestingly, one broad absorption feature is clearly detected at10.3+-0.7 kev (rest frame) in the 2000 chandra observation, while two similarfeatures, at 8.9+-0.4 and at 12.5+-0.7 kev, are visible when the 8 contiguouschandra observations of 2007 are stacked together. in the xmm observation of2002, strongly affected by background flares, there is a hint for a similarfeature at 8.0+-0.3 kev. we interpreted these features as absorption lines froma high velocity, highly ionized (i.e. fe xxv, fexxvi) outflowing gas. in thisscenario, the outflow velocities inferred are in the range v=0.12-0.59c. toreproduce the observed features, the gas must have high column density(nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2), high ionization parameter (log(xi)&gt;3.3 erg cm s^-1) and alarge range of velocities (delta v~10^4 km s^-1). this absorption line qso isthe fourth high-z quasar displaying x-ray signatures of variable, high velocityoutflows, and among these, is the only one non-lensed. a rough estimate of theminimum kinetic energy carried by the wind of up to 18% l(bol), based on abiconical geometry of the wind, implies that the amount of energy injected inthe outflow environment is large enough to produce effective mechanicalfeedback.

1307.5562	a mini x-ray survey of sub-dlas; searching for agns formed in  protogalaxies	a significant fraction of the sub-damped lyman-alpha (sub-dla) absorptionsystems in quasar spectra appear to be metal-rich, many with even super-solarelement abundances. this raises the question whether some sub-dlas may harboractive galactic nuclei (agn) since supersolar metallicities are observed inagn. here we investigate this question based on a mini-survey of 21 quasarsknown to contain sub-dlas in their spectra. the x-ray observations wereperformed with the chandra x-ray observatory. in cases of no detection weestimated upper limits of the x-ray luminosities of possible agns at theredshifts of the sub-dlas. in six cases we find possible x-ray emission within~ 1 arcsec of the background quasar consistent with the presence of a nearbyx-ray source. if these nearby x-ray sources are at the redshifts of thesub-dlas, their estimated 0.2-10 kev luminosities range between 0.8 x10^{44}h^{-2} and 4.2 x 10^{44}h^{-2} erg s^{-1}, thus ruling out a normallate-type galaxy origin, and suggesting that the emission originates in agalactic nucleus near the center of a protogalaxy. the projected distances ofthese possible nearby x-ray sources from the background quasars lie in therange of 3-7 h^{-1} kpc, consistent with our hypothesis that they representagns centered on the sub-dlas. deeper follow-up x-ray and optical observationsare required to confirm the marginal detections of x-rays from these sub-dlagalaxies.

1401.4486	magnified views of the ultrafast outflow of the z = 1.51 agn hs  0810+2554	we present results from an observation of the gravitationally lensed z=1.51narrow absorption line agn hs 0810+2554 performed with the chandra x-rayobservatory. the factor of ~100 lensing magnification of hs 0810+2554 makesthis source exceptionally bright. absorption lines are detected at rest-frameenergies of ~ 7.7 kev and ~11.0 kev at &gt;97% significance. by interpreting theselines to arise from highly ionized iron the implied outflow velocities of thex-ray absorbing gas corresponding to these lines are 0.13c and 0.41c,respectively. the presence of these relativistic outflows and the absence ofany significant low-energy x-ray absorption suggest that a shielding gas is notrequired for the generation of the relativistic x-ray absorbing winds in hs0810+2554. uv spectroscopic observations with vlt/uves indicate that the uvabsorbing material is outflowing at v_uv ~0.065c. our analysis indicates thatthe fraction of the total bolometric energy released by hs 0810+2554 into theigm in the form of kinetic energy is epsilon_k = 1.0(-0.6,+0.8). an efficiencyof greater than unity implies that magnetic driving is likely a significantcontributor to the acceleration of this x-ray absorbing wind. we also estimatethe mass-outflow rate of the strongest absorption component to bemdot_abs=1.1(-0.7,+0.9) m_solar yr^-1. assuming that the energetic outflowdetected in the nal agn hs 0810+2554 is a common property of most agn it wouldsuggest that the x-ray absorbing wind may have a larger opening angle thanpreviously thought. this has important consequences for estimating the feedbackcontribution of x-ray absorbing winds to the surrounding igm.

0805.4492	x-ray microlensing in rxj1131-1231 and he1104-1805	we present results from a monitoring campaign performed with the chandrax-ray observatory of the gravitationally lensed quasars rx j1131-1231 and he1104-1805. we detect significant x-ray variability in all images of bothquasars. the flux variability detected in image a of rx j1131-1231 is ofparticular interest because of its high amplitude (a factor of ~ 20). weinterpret it as arising from microlensing since the variability is uncorrelatedwith that of the other images and the x-ray flux ratios show larger changesthan the optical as we would expect for microlensing of the more compact x-rayemission regions. the differences between the x-ray and optical flux ratios ofhe 1104-1805 are less dramatic, but there is no significant soft x-ray or dustabsorption, implying the presence of x-ray microlensing in this system as well.combining the x-ray data with the optical light curves we find that the x-rayemitting region of he 1104-1805 is compact with a half-light radius ~ 6 r_g,where the gravitational radius is r_g = 3.6 x 10^14 cm, thus placingsignificant constraints on agn corona models. we also find that themicrolensing in he 1104-1805 favors mass models for the lens galaxy that aredominated by dark matter. finally, we better characterize the massiveforeground cluster near rx j1131-1231, set limits on other sources of extendedx-ray emission, and limit the fluxes of any central odd images to be 30-50 (3sigma) times fainter than the observed images.

1509.05375	gravitational lensing size scales for quasars	we review results from our monitoring observations of several lensed quasarsperformed in the optical, uv, and x-ray bands. modeling of the multi-wavelengthlight curves provides constraints on the extent of the optical, uv, and x-rayemission regions. one of the important results of our analysis is that theoptical sizes as inferred from the microlensing analysis are significantlylarger than those predicted by the theoretical-thin-disk estimate. in a fewcases we also constrain the slope of the size-wavelength relation. our sizeconstraints of the soft and hard x-ray emission regions of quasars indicatethat in some objects of our sample the hard x-ray emission region is morecompact than the soft and in others the soft emission region is smaller. thisdifference may be the result of the relative strengths of the disk-reflected(harder and extended) versus corona-direct (softer and compact) components inthe quasars of our sample. finally, we present the analysis of several strongmicrolensing events where we detect an evolution of the relativistic fe lineprofile as the magnification caustic traverses the accretion disk. thesecaustic crossings are used to provide constraints on the innermost stablecircular orbit (isco) radius and the accretion disk inclination angle of theblack hole in quasar rx j1131-1231.

astro-ph;0005255	chandra discovery of a 100 kpc x-ray jet in pks 0637--752	the quasar pks 0637-753, the first celestial x-ray target of the chandrax-ray observatory, has revealed asymmetric x-ray structure extending from 3 to12 arcsec west of the quasar, coincident with the inner portion of the jetpreviously detected in a 4.8 ghz radio image (tingay et al. 1998). at aredshift of z=0.651, the jet is the largest (~100 kpc) and most luminous(~10^{44.6} ergs/s) of the few so far detected in x-rays. this letter presentsa high resolution x-ray image of the jet, from 42 ks of data when pks 0637-753was on-axis and acis-s was near the optimum focus. for the inner portion of theradio jet, the x-ray morphology closely matches that of new atca radio imagesat 4.8 and 8.6 ghz. observations of the parsec scale core using the vsop spacevlbi mission show structure aligned with the x-ray jet, placing importantconstraints on the x-ray source models. hst images show that there are threesmall knots coincident with the peak radio and x-ray emission. two of these areresolved, which we use to estimate the sizes of the x-ray and radio knots. theouter portion of the radio jet, and a radio component to the east, show nox-ray emission to a limit of about 100 times lower flux.  the x-ray emission is difficult to explain with models that successfullyaccount for extra-nuclear x-ray/radio structures in other active galaxies. wethink the most plausible is a synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model, but thiswould imply extreme departures from the conventional minimum-energy and/orhomogeneity assumptions. we also rule out synchrotron or thermal bremsstrahlungmodels for the jet x-rays, unless multicomponent or ad hoc geometries areinvoked.

astro-ph;0101019	chandra observations of the gravitationally lensed system 2016+112	an observation of the gravitationally lensed system 2016+112 with the chandrax-ray observatory has resolved a mystery regarding the proposed presence of adark matter object in the lens plane of this system. the chandra acisobservation has clearly detected the lensed images of 2016+112 with positionsin good agreement with those reported in the optical and also detects 13additional x-ray sources within a radius of 3.5 arcmin. previous x-rayobservations in the direction of 2016+112 with the rosat hri and asca sis haveinterpreted the x-ray data as arising from extended emission from a darkcluster. however, the present chandra observation can account for all the x-rayemission as originating from the lensed images and additional point x-raysources in the field. thus cluster parameters based on previous x-rayobservations are unreliable. we estimate an upper limit on the mass-to-lightratio within a radius of 800 h_(50)^(-1) kpc of m/l_(v) &lt; 190 h_(50)(m/l_(v))_sun. the lensed object is quite unusual, with reported narrowemission lines in the optical that suggest it may be a type-2 quasar (yamadaet. al. 1999). our modeling of the x-ray spectrum of the lensed object impliesthat the column density of an intrinsic absorber must lie between 3 and 85 x10^22 cm^-2 (3 sigma confidence level). the 2-10 kev luminosity of the lensedobject, corrected for the lens magnification effect and using the above rangeof intrinsic absorption, is 3 x 10^43 - 1.4 x 10^44 erg/s.

astro-ph;0104035	a chandra study of the circinus galaxy point-source population	we have used the chandra x-ray observatory to resolve spatially andspectrally the x-ray emission from the circinus galaxy. we report here on thenature of the x-ray emission from the off-nuclear point sources associated withthe disk of circinus. we find that many of the serendipitous x-ray sources areconcentrated along the optical disk of the galaxy, but few have opticalcounterparts within 1" of their x-ray positions down to v=23-25. at 3.8 mpc,their intrinsic 0.5-10 kev luminosities range from approx. 2e37 erg/s to 4e39erg/s. one quarter of the sources are variable over the duration of the 67 ksobservation, and spectral fitting of these off-nuclear sources shows a diverserange of spectral properties. the properties of the two strongest off-nuclearsources are remarkable, with average x-ray luminosities of 3.7e39 erg/s and3.4e39 erg/s. the former displays large and periodic flux variations every 7.5hr and is well fit by a multicolor blackbody accretion-disk model witht_in=1.35 kev, properties consistent with an eclipsing &gt;50 m_sun black-holebinary. the latter appears to be a young supernova remnant, as it coincideswith a non-thermal radio counterpart and an h\alpha-detected hii region. thissource exhibits both long-term (approx. 4 yr) x-ray variability and a 6.67-6.97kev iron emission-line blend with a 1.6 kev equivalent width. these two objectsfurther support the notion that super-eddington x-ray sources in nearbygalaxies can be explained by a mixture of intermediate-mass black holes inx-ray binaries and young supernova remnants.

astro-ph;0306125	xmm-newton reveals the quasar outflow in pg 1115+080	we report on an observation of the broad absorption line (bal) quasar pg1115+080 performed with the xmm-newton observatory. spectral analysis revealsthe second case of a relativistic x-ray absorbing outflow in a bal quasar. thefirst case was revealed in a recent observation of apm 08279+5255 with thechandra x-ray observatory. the spectrum of pg1115+080 indicates the presence ofcomplex low-energy absorption in the 0.2-0.6 kev observed energy band andhigh-energy absorption in the 2-5 kev observed energy band. the high-energyabsorption is best modeled by two gaussian absorption lines with rest-frameenergies of 7.4 kev and 9.5 kev. assuming that these two lines are produced byresonant absorption due to fe xxv kalpha, we infer that the x-ray absorbers areoutflowing with velocities of ~0.10c and ~0.34c, respectively. we have detectedsignificant variability of the energies and widths of the x-ray bals in pg1115+080 and apm 08279+5255 over timescales of 19 and 1.8 weeks (proper-time),respectively. the bal variability observed from apm 08279+5255 supports ourearlier conclusion that these absorbers are most likely launched at relativelysmall radii of ~ 10^(16)(m_bh/m_8)^(1/2)cm. a comparison of the ionizationproperties and column densities of the low-energy and high-energy absorbersindicates that these absorbers are likely distinct; however, higher spectralresolution is needed to confirm this result. finally, we comment on prospectsfor constraining the kinematic and ionization properties of these x-ray balswith the next generation of x-ray observatories.

astro-ph;0509146	xmm-newton spectroscopy of the highly polarized and luminous broad  absorption line quasar cso 755	we present the results from xmm-newton observations of the highly opticallypolarized broad absorption line quasar (balqso) cso 755. by analyzing its x-rayspectrum with a total of ~3000 photons we find that this source has an x-raycontinuum of `typical' radio-quiet quasars, with a photon index ofgamma=1.83^{+0.07}_{-0.06}, and a rather flat (x-ray bright) intrinsicoptical-to-x-ray spectral slope of alpha_ox=-1.51. the source shows evidencefor intrinsic absorption, and fitting the spectrum with a neutral-absorptionmodel gives a column density of n_h~1.2x10^{22} cm^{-2}; this is among thelowest x-ray columns measured for balqsos. we do not detect, with highsignificance, any other absorption features in the x-ray spectrum. upper limitswe place on the rest-frame equivalent width of a neutral (ionized) fe ka line,&lt;=180 ev (&lt;=120 ev), and on the compton-reflection component parameter, r&lt;=0.2,suggest that most of the x-rays from the source are directly observed ratherthan being scattered or reflected; this is also supported by the relativelyflat intrinsic alpha_ox we measure. the possibility that most of the x-ray fluxis scattered due to the high level of uv-optical polarization is ruled out.considering data for 46 balqsos from the literature, including cso 755, we havefound that the uv-optical continuum polarization level of balqsos is notcorrelated with any of their x-ray properties. a lack of significant short- andlong-term x-ray flux variations in the source may be attributed to a largeblack-hole mass in cso 755. we note that another luminous balqso, pg 2112+059,has both similar shallow c iv bals and moderate x-ray absorption.

astro-ph;0510271	microlensing of the fe k$\alpha$ line and the x-ray continuum	the observed enhancement of the fe k$\alpha$ line in three gravitationallylensed qsos (mg j0414+0534, qso 2237+0305, h1413+117) is interpreted in termsof microlensing, even when equivalent x-ray continuum amplification is notobserved. in order to interpret these observations, first we studied theeffects of microlensing on quasars spectra, produced by straight fold causticcrossing over standard relativistic accretion disk. the disk emission wasanalyzed using the ray tracing method, considering schwarzschild and kerrmetrics. when the emission is separated in two regions (an inner diskcorresponding to the fe k$\alpha$ line and an outer annulus corresponding tothe continuum, or vice-versa) we find microlensing events which enhance the fek$\alpha$ line without noticeable amplification of the x-ray continuum, butonly during a limited time interval. continuum amplification is expected if acomplete microlensing event is monitored. second, we studied a more realisticcase of amplification by caustic magnification pattern. in this case we couldsatisfactorily explain the observations if the fe k$\alpha$ line is emittedfrom the innermost part of the accretion disk, while the continuum is emittedfrom a larger region. also, we studied the chromatic effects of microlensing,finding that the radial distribution of temperature in the accretion disk,combined with microlensing itself, can induce wavelength dependent variabilityof $\sim$ 30% for microlenses with very small masses. all these results showthat x-ray monitoring of gravitational lenses is a well suited method forstudying of the innermost structure of agn accretion disks.

(2004) which usedsimilar methods to examine z &gt; 4 rlqs with moderate radio-loudness (r=40-400).all of our targets are clearly detected. a search for extended x-ray emissionassociated with kpc-scale radio jets revealed only limited evidence for x-rayextension in our sample: three sources showed no evidence of x-ray extension,and the other three had 3-30% of their total x-ray fluxes extended &gt;1 arcsecaway from their x-ray cores. additionally, we do not observe any systematicflattening of the optical-to-x-ray spectral index (alpha_{ox}) compared tolow-redshift quasars. these results suggest that kpc-scale x-ray jet emissionis not dominated by inverse-compton scattering of cmb-seed photons off jetelectrons. we measured x-ray continuum shapes and performed individual andjoint spectral fits of our data combined with eight archival rlqs. a singlepower-law model acceptably fit the data. we added an intrinsic absorptioncomponent to our model, and neither the moderate-r nor the high-r fits set alower bound on n_h. our spectral results suggest that intrinsic absorption doesnot strongly depend on radio-loudness, and high-r sources have flatter powerlaws than moderate-r sources. overall, our high-redshift rlqs have basic x-rayproperties consistent with similar rlqs in the local universe.

astro-ph;0702742	discovery of probable relativistic fe emission and absorption in the  cloverleaf quasar h 1413+117	we present results from chandra and xmm-newton observations of thelow-ionization broad absorption line (lobal) quasar h 1413+117. our spatial andspectral analysis of a recent deep chandra observation confirms a microlensingevent in a previous chandra observation performed about 5 years earlier. wepresent constraints on the structure of the accretion flow in h 1413+117 basedon the time-scale of this microlensing event. our analysis of the combinedspectrum of all the images indicates the presence of two emission peaks atrest-frame energies of 5.35 kev and 6.32 kev detected at the &gt; 98% and &gt; 99%confidence levels, respectively. the double peaked fe emission line is fit wellwith an accretion-disk line model, however, the best-fitting model parametersare neither well constrained nor unique. additional observations are requiredto constrain the model parameters better and to confirm the relativisticinterpretation of the double peaked fe kalpha line. another possibleinterpretation of the fe emission is fluorescent fe emission from the back-sideof the wind. the spectra of images c and d show significant high-energy broadabsorption features that extend up to rest-frame energies of 9 kev and 15 kevrespectively. we propose that a likely cause of these differences issignificant variability of the outflow on time-scales that are shorter than thetime-delays between the images. the chandra observation of h 1413+117 has madepossible for the first time the detection of the inner regions of the accretiondisk and/or wind and the high ionization component of the outflowing wind of alobal quasar.

astro-ph;9803285	x-ray detection of the primary lens galaxy cluster of the gravitational  lens system q0957+561	analysis of several recent rosat hri observations of the gravitationallylensed system q0957+561 has led to the detection at the 3sigma level of thecluster lens containing the primary galaxy g1. the total mass was estimated byapplying the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to the detected hotintracluster gas for a range of cluster core radii, cluster sizes and fordifferent values of the hubble constant. x-ray estimates of the lensing clustermass provide a means to determine the cluster contribution to the deflection ofrays originating from the quasar q0957+561. the present mass estimates wereused to evaluate the convergence parameter kappa, the ratio of the localsurface mass density of the cluster to the critical surface mass density forlensing. the convergence parameter, kappa, calculated in the vicinity of thelensed images, was found to range between 0.07 and 0.21, depending on theassumed cluster core radius and cluster extent. this range of uncertainty inkappa does not include possible systematic errors arising from the estimationof the cluster temperature through the use of the clusterluminosity-temperature relation and the assumption of spherical symmetry of thecluster gas. applying this range of values of kappa to the lensing model ofgrogin &amp; narayan (1996) for q0957+561 but not accounting for uncertainties inthat model yields a range of values for the hubble constant:67&lt;h_0&lt;82 km s^-1mpc^-1, for a time delay of 1.1 years.

astro-ph;9910299	x-ray observations of gravitationally lensed quasars; evidence for a  hidden quasar population	the large magnification factors of gravitationally lensed (gl) systems allowus to investigate the properties of quasars with x-ray luminosities that aresubstantially lower than those of unlensed ones and also provide an independentmeans of estimating the contribution of faint quasars to the hard x-raycomponent of the cosmic x-ray background. our spectral analysis indicate aflattening of the spectral index in the hard band (4-20kev restframe) for 2radio-loud quasars in the gl quasar sample for which the data have moderatesignal-to-noise ratio. we have identified a large fraction of broad absorptionline (bal) quasars amongst the gl quasar population. we find that approximately35% of radio-quiet gl quasars contain bal features which is significantlylarger than the 10% fraction of bal quasars presently found in opticallyselected flux limited quasar samples. we present a simple model that estimatesthe effects of attenuation and lens magnification on the luminosity function ofquasars and that explains the observed fraction of gl bal quasars. theseobservations suggest that a large fraction of bal quasars are missed from fluxlimited optical surveys. modeling of several x-ray observations of the gl balquasar pg1115+080 suggests that the observed large x-ray variability may becaused in part by a variable intrinsic absorber consistent with previouslyobserved variability of the bal troughs in the uv band. the observed largex-ray flux variations in pg1115+080 offer the prospect of considerably reducingerrors in determining the time delay with future x-ray monitoring of thissystem and hence constraining the hubble constant h$_{0}$.
