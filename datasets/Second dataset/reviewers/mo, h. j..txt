0901.1150	structural properties of central galaxies in groups and clusters	using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (cens) from the sdssdr4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members ingroups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (mstar), (2) dark matterhalo mass of the host group (mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. weestablish and thoroughly test a galfit-based pipeline to fit 2d sersic modelsto sdss data. we find that the fitting results are most sensitive to thebackground sky level determination and strongly recommend using the sdss globalvalue. we find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strongcovariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and sersic index(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. we find that n depends strongly onmstar for cens, but only weakly or not at all on mhalo. less (more) massivecens tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full mhalo range. likewise, thereis a clear r50-mstar relation for cens, with separate slopes for disks andspheroids. when comparing cens with satellite galaxies (sats), we find that lowmass (&lt;10e10.75 msun/h^2) sats have larger median n than cens of similar mstar.low mass, late-type sats have moderately smaller r50 than late-type cens of thesame mstar. however, we find no size differences between spheroid-like cens andsats, and no structural differences between cens and sats matched in both massand colour. the similarity of massive sats and cens shows that this distinctionhas no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. we conclude that mstaris the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.the lack of a clear n-mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass forproducing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processesmust occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

0912.1257	the stellar mass components of galaxies: comparing semi-analytical  models with observation	we compare the stellar masses of central and satellite galaxies predicted bythree independent semianalytical models with observational results obtainedfrom a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sloan digital skysurvey. in particular, we compare the stellar mass functions of centrals andsatellites, the relation between total stellar mass and halo mass, and theconditional stellar mass functions, which specify the average number ofgalaxies of stellar mass m_* that reside in a halo of mass m_h. thesemi-analytical models only predict the correct stellar masses of centralgalaxies within a limited mass range and all models fail to reproduce the sharpdecline of stellar mass with decreasing halo mass observed at the low mass end.in addition, all models over-predict the number of satellite galaxies byroughly a factor of two. the predicted stellar mass in satellite galaxies canbe made to match the data by assuming that a significant fraction of satellitegalaxies are tidally stripped and disrupted, giving rise to a population ofintra-cluster stars in their host halos. however, the amount of intra-clusterstars thus predicted is too large compared to observation. this suggests thatcurrent galaxy formation models still have serious problems in modeling starformation in low-mass halos.

0912.1853	stellar ages and metallicities of central and satellite galaxies:  implications for galaxy formation and evolution	using a large sdss galaxy group catalogue, we study how the stellar ages andmetallicities of central and satellite galaxies depend on stellar mass and halomass. we find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of thesame stellar mass. in addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass andmetallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denserenvironments. this is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity oflow mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which theyreside. a comparison with the semi-analytical model of wang et al. (2008) showsthat it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centralsof the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halomass of the satellite. this is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves thestellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged starformation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. the resultingage offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites wereaccreted earlier. the model fails, however, in reproducing the halo massdependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yieldsmetallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow,and predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals ofthe same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. we argue that thesediscrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of bothsupernova feedback and agn feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description ofstrangulation, and (iii) include a proper treatment of the tidal stripping,heating and destruction of satellite galaxies.

0707.4640	galaxy groups in the sdss dr4: i. the catalogue and basic properties	we use a modified version of the halo-based group finder developed by yang etal. to select galaxy groups from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss dr4). inthe first step, a combination of two methods is used to identify the centers ofpotential groups and to estimate their characteristic luminosity. using aniterative approach, the adaptive group finder then uses the averagemass-to-light ratios of groups, obtained from the previous iteration, to assigna tentative mass to each group. this mass is then used to estimate the size andvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turnis used to determine group membership in redshift space. finally, eachindividual group is assigned two different halo masses: one based on itscharacteristic luminosity, and the other based on its characteristic stellarmass. applying the group finder to the sdss dr4, we obtain 301237 groups in abroad dynamic range, including systems of isolated galaxies. we use detailedmock galaxy catalogues constructed for the sdss dr4 to test the performance ofour group finder in terms of completeness of true members, contamination byinterlopers, and accuracy of the assigned masses. this paper is the first in aseries and focuses on the selection procedure, tests of the reliability of thegroup finder, and the basic properties of the group catalogue (e.g. themass-to-light ratios, the halo mass to stellar mass ratios, etc.). the groupcatalogues including the membership of the groups are available athttp://gax.shao.ac.cn/data/group.html andhttp://www.astro.umass.edu/~xhyang/group.html

1003.3203	satellite kinematics iii: halo masses of central galaxies in sdss	we use the kinematics of satellite galaxies that orbit around the centralgalaxy in a dark matter halo to infer the scaling relations between halo massand central galaxy properties. using galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (mlr) and the halomass-stellar mass relation (msr) of central galaxies. in particular, we focuson the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the centralgalaxy. we find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloesthan blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. however, at fixed stellarmass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red andblue centrals, especially for m* $\lsim$ 10^{10.5} h^{-2} msun. this indicatesthat stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity.nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass isnon-negligible for both red and blue centrals. it increases as a function ofstellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for bluecentrals. we compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with resultsfrom other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from asdss galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, andfrom subhalo abundance matching studies. overall, these different techniquesyield mlrs and msrs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically withina factor of two), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliabledescription of the galaxy-dark matter connection. we briefly discuss some ofthe remaining discrepancies among the various methods.

1004.2518	a bayesian approach to the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation:  methodology	we believe that a wide range of physical processes conspire to shape theobserved galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions.the semi-analytic model (sam) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensionalparameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides atool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. because of the highdimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitablytackled with a bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constraintheory with data in a statistically rigorous way. in this paper we develop asam in the framework of bayesian inference. we show that, with a parallelimplementation of an advanced markov-chain monte-carlo algorithm, it is nowpossible to rigorously sample the posterior distribution of thehigh-dimensional parameter space of typical sams. as an example, wecharacterise galaxy formation in the current $\lambda$cdm cosmology using thestellar mass function of galaxies as an observational constraint. we find thatthe posterior probability distribution is both topologically complex anddegenerate in some important model parameters, suggesting that thoroughexplorations of the parameter space are needed to understand the models. wealso demonstrate that because of the model degeneracy, adopting a narrow priorstrongly restricts the model. therefore, the inferences based on sams areconditional to the model adopted. using synthetic data to mimic systematicerrors in the stellar mass function, we demonstrate that an accurateobservational error model is essential to meaningful inference.

1006.4760	probing hot gas in galaxy groups through the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	we investigate the potential of exploiting the sunyaev-zeldovich effect (sze)to study the properties of hot gas in galaxy groups. it is shown that, withupcoming sze surveys, one can stack sze maps around galaxy groups of similarhalo masses selected from large galaxy redshift surveys to study the hot gas inhalos represented by galaxy groups. we use various models for the hot halo gasto study how the expected sze signals are affected by gas fraction, equation ofstate, halo concentration, and cosmology. comparing the model predictions withthe sensitivities expected from the spt, act and planck surveys shows that aspt-like survey can provide stringent constraints on the hot gas properties forhalos with masses m ~&gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}msun. we also explore the idea of usingthe cross correlation between hot gas and galaxies of different luminosity toprobe the hot gas in dark matter halos without identifying galaxy groups torepresent dark halos. our results show that, with a galaxy survey as large asthe sloan digital sky survey and with the help of the conditional luminosityfunction (clf) model, one can obtain stringent constraints on the hot gasproperties in halos with masses down to 10^{13} h^{-1}msun. thus, the upcomingsze surveys should provide a very promising avenue to probe the hot gas inrelatively low-mass halos where the majority of l*-galaxies reside.

1007.0612	internal properties and environments of dark matter halos	we use seven high-resolution $n$-body simulations to study the correlationsamong different halo properties (assembly time, spin, shape and substructure),and how these halo properties are correlated with the large-scale environmentin which halos reside. the large-scale tidal field estimated from halos above amass threshold is used as our primary quantity to characterize the large-scaleenvironment, while other parameters, such as the local overdensity and themorphology of large-scale structure, are used for comparison. for halos at afixed mass, all the halo properties depend significantly on environment,particularly the tidal field. the environmental dependence of halo assemblytime is primarily driven by local tidal field. the mass of the unbound fractionin substructure is boosted in strong tidal force region, while the boundfraction is suppressed. halos have a tendency to spin faster in stronger tidalfield and the trend is stronger for more massive halos. the spin vectors showsignificant alignment with the intermediate axis of the tidal field, asexpected from the tidal torque theory. both the major and minor axes of halosare strongly aligned with the corresponding principal axes of the tidal field.in general, a halo that can accrete more material after the formation of itsmain halo on average is younger, is more elongated, spins faster, and containsa larger amount of substructure. higher density environments not only providemore material for halo to accrete, but also are places of stronger tidal fieldthat tends to suppress halo accretion. the environmental dependencies are theresults of these two competing effects. the tidal field based on halos can beestimated from observation, and we discuss the implications of our results forthe environmental dependence of galaxy properties.

1008.1075	on the algorithms of radiative cooling in semi-analytic models	we study the behaviour of multiple radiative cooling algorithms implementedin seven semi-analytic models (sams) of galaxy formation, including a new modelwe propose in this paper. we use versions of the models without feedback andapply them to dark matter haloes growing in a cosmological context, which havefinal masses that range from 10^{11}msun to 10^{14}msun. first, usingsimplified smoothly-growing halo models, we demonstrate that the differentalgorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by afactor of ~5 for massive haloes (&gt;10^{12}msun). the algorithms are in betteragreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore,their cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. however,for less massive haloes, all the sams predict less cooling than corresponding1d hydrodynamic models. second, we study the gas accretion history of thecentral galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. the inclusion ofmergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxieswithin small haloes at early times. for realistic halo models, the dispersionin the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high masshaloes and 0.1 dex for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretionrate is about two times larger. comparing to cosmological sph simulations, wefind that most sams systematically under-predict the gas accretion rates forlow-mass haloes but over-predict the gas accretion rates for massive haloes.although the models all include both "rapid" and "slow" mode accretion, thetransition between the two accretion modes varies between models and alsodiffers from the simulations. finally, we construct a new model that explicitlyincorporates cold halo gas to illustrate that such a class of models can bettermatch the results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

1104.1757	an analytical model for the accretion of dark matter subhalos	an analytical model is developed for the mass function of cold dark mattersubhalos at the time of accretion and for the distribution of their accretiontimes. our model is based on the model of zhao et al. (2009) for the medianassembly histories of dark matter halos, combined with a simple log-normaldistribution to describe the scatter in the main-branch mass at a given timefor halos of the same final mass. our model is simple, and can be used topredict the un-evolved subhalo mass function, the mass function of subhalosaccreted at a given time, the accretion-time distribution of subhalos of agiven initial mass, and the frequency of major mergers as a function of time.we test our model using high-resolution cosmological $n$-body simulations, andfind that our model predictions match the simulation results remarkably well.finally, we discuss the implications of our model for the evolution of subhalosin their hosts and for the construction of a self-consistent model to linkgalaxies and dark matter halos at different cosmic times.

1108.1008	reconstructing the cosmic velocity and tidal fields with galaxy groups  selected from the sloan digital sky survey	[abridge]cosmic velocity and tidal fields are important for the understandingof the cosmic web and the environments of galaxies, and can also be used toconstrain cosmology. in this paper, we reconstruct these two fields in sdssvolume from dark matter halos represented by galaxy groups. detailed mockcatalogues are used to test the reliability of our method against uncertaintiesarising from redshift distortions, survey boundaries, and false identificationsof groups by our group finder. we find that both the velocity and tidal fields,smoothed on a scale of ~2mpc/h, can be reliably reconstructed in the innerregion (~66%) of the survey volume. the reconstructed tidal field is used tosplit the cosmic web into clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids, depending onthe sign of the eigenvalues of tidal tensor. the reconstructed velocity fieldnicely shows how the flows are diverging from the centers of voids, andconverging onto clusters, while sheets and filaments have flows that areconvergent along one and two directions, respectively. we use the reconstructedvelocity field and the zel'dovich approximation to predict the mass densityfield in the sdss volume as function of redshift, and find that the massdistribution closely follows the galaxy distribution even on small scales. wefind a large-scale bulk flow of about 117km/s in a very large volume,equivalent to a sphere with a radius of ~170mpc/h, which seems to be producedby the massive structures associated with the sdss great wall. finally, wediscuss potential applications of our reconstruction to study the environmentaleffects of galaxy formation, to generate initial conditions for simulations ofthe local universe, and to constrain cosmological models. the velocity, tidaland density fields in the sdss volume, specified on a cartesian grid with aspatial resolution of ~700kpc/h, are available from the authors upon request.

1109.6658	bayesian inference of galaxy formation from the k-band luminosity  function of galaxies: tensions between theory and observation	we conduct bayesian model inferences from the observed k-band luminosityfunction of galaxies in the local universe, using the semi-analytic model (sam)of galaxy formation introduced in lu et al (2011). the prior distributions forthe 14 free parameters include a large range of possible models. we find thatsome of the free parameters, e.g. the characteristic scales for quenching starformation in both high-mass and low-mass halos, are already tightly constrainedby the single data set. the posterior distribution includes the modelparameters adopted in other sams. by marginalising over the posteriordistribution, we make predictions that include the full inferentialuncertainties for the colour-magnitude relation, the tully-fisher relation, theconditional stellar mass function of galaxies in halos of different masses, thehi mass function, the redshift evolution of the stellar mass function ofgalaxies, and the global star formation history. using posterior predictivechecking with the available observational results, we find that the modelfamily (i) predicts a tully-fisher relation that is curved; (ii) significantlyover predicts the satellite fraction; (iii) vastly over predicts the hi massfunction; (iv) predicts high-z stellar mass functions that have too many lowmass galaxies and too few high mass ones. and (v) predicts a redshift evolutionof the stellar mass density and the star formation history that are in moderatedisagreement. these results suggest that some important processes are stillmissing in the current model family and we discuss a number of possiblesolutions to solve the discrepancies, such as interactions between galaxies anddark matter halos, tidal stripping, the bimodal accretion of gas, preheating,and a redshift-dependent initial mass function.

0710.3164	the importance of satellite quenching for the build-up of the red  sequence of present day galaxies	in the current paradigm, red sequence galaxies are believed to have formed asblue disk galaxies that subsequently had their star formation quenched. sincered-sequence galaxies typically have an early-type morphology, the transitionfrom the blue to the red sequence also involves a morphological transformation.in this paper we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operateonly on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from thesdss, we compare the colors and concentrations of satellites galaxies to thoseof central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that thelatter are the progenitors of the former. on average, satellites are redder andmore concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass.central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and color,however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that thetransformation mechanisms affect color more than morphology. the color andconcentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completelyindependent of the halo mass of the satellite galaxy, indicating thatsatellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in haloes ofall masses. this strongly favors strangulation as the main quenching mechanismfor satellite galaxies. finally, we determine the relative importance ofsatellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. we find that roughly70 percent of red sequence satellite galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^9 msunhad their star formation quenched as satellites. this drops rapidly to zerowith increasing stellar mass, indicating that a significant fraction of redsatellites were already quenched before they became a satellite.

1206.3566	internal kinematics of groups of galaxies in the sloan digital sky  survey data release 7	we present measurements of the velocity dispersion profile (vdp) for galaxygroups in the final data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). forgroups of given mass we estimate the redshift-space cross-correlation function(ccf) with respect to a reference galaxy sample, xi(r_p, pi), the projectedccf, w_p(r_p), and the real-space ccf, xi(r). the vdp is then extracted fromthe redshift distortion in xi(r_p, pi), by comparing xi(r_p, pi) with xi(r). wefind that the velocity dispersion (vd) within virial radius (r_200) shows aroughly flat profile, with a slight increase at radii below ~0.3 r_200 for highmass systems. the average vd within the virial radius, sigma_v, is a stronglyincreasing function of central galaxy mass. we apply the same methodology ton-body simulations with the concordance lambda cold dark matter cosmology butdifferent values of the density fluctuation parameter sigma_8, and we comparethe results to the sdss results. we show that the sigma_v-m_* relation from thedata provides stringent constraints on both sigma_8 and sigma_ms, thedispersion in log m_* of central galaxies at fixed halo mass. our best-fittingmodel suggests sigma_8 = 0.86 +/- 0.03 and sigma_ms = 0.16 +/- 0.03. theslightly higher value of sigma_8 compared to the wmap7 result might be due to asmaller matter density parameter assumed in our simulations. our vdmeasurements also provide a direct measure of the dark matter halo mass forcentral galaxies of different luminosities and masses, in good agreement withthe results obtained by mandelbaum et al.

(2012), we make model predictions for thestar formation histories (sfhs) of {\it central} galaxies in halos of differentmasses. the model requires the following two key ingredients: (i) mass assemblyhistories of central and satellite galaxies, and (ii) local observationalconstraints of the star formation rates of central galaxies as function of halomass. we obtain a universal fitting formula that describes the (median) sfh ofcentral galaxies as function of halo mass, galaxy stellar mass and redshift. weuse this model to make predictions for various aspects of the star formationrates of central galaxies across cosmic time. our main findings are thefollowing. (1) the specific star formation rate (ssfr) at high $z$ increasesrapidly with increasing redshift [$\propto (1+z)^{2.5}$] for halos of a givenmass and only slowly with halo mass ($\propto m_h^{0.12}$) at a given $z$, inalmost perfect agreement with the specific mass accretion rate of dark matterhalos. (2) the ratio between the star formation rate (sfr) in the main-branchprogenitor and the final stellar mass of a galaxy peaks roughly at a constantvalue, $\sim 10^{-9.3} h^2 {\rm yr}^{-1}$, independent of halo mass or thefinal stellar mass of the galaxy. however, the redshift at which the sfr peaksincreases rapidly with halo mass. (3) more than half of the stars in thepresent-day universe were formed in halos with $10^{11.1}\msunh &lt; m_h &lt;10^{12.3}\msunh$ in the redshift range $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.9$. (4) ... [abridged]

1309.3847	alignments of galaxies within cosmic filaments from sdss dr7	using a sample of galaxy groups selected from the sloan digital sky surveydata release 7 (sdss dr7), we examine the alignment between the orientation ofgalaxies and their surrounding large scale structure in the context of thecosmic web. the latter is quantified using the large-scale tidal field,reconstructed from the data using galaxy groups above a certain mass threshold.we find that the major axes of galaxies in filaments tend to be preferentiallyaligned with the directions of the filaments, while galaxies in sheets havetheir major axes preferentially aligned parallel to the plane of the sheets.the strength of this alignment signal is strongest for red, central galaxies,and in good agreement with that of dark matter halos in n-body simulations.this suggests that red, central galaxies are well aligned with their hosthalos, in quantitative agreement with previous studies based on the spatialdistribution of satellite galaxies. there is a luminosity and mass dependencethat brighter and more massive galaxies in filaments and sheets have strongeralignment signals. we also find that the orientation of galaxies is alignedwith the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the tidaltensor. these observational results indicate that galaxy formation is affectedby large-scale environments, and strongly suggests that galaxies are alignedwith each other over scales comparable to those of sheets and filaments in thecosmic web.

1311.0047	bayesian inferences of galaxy formation from the k-band luminosity and  hi mass functions of galaxies: constraining star formation and feedback	we infer mechanisms of galaxy formation for a broad family of semi-analyticmodels (sams) constrained by the k-band luminosity function and hi massfunction of local galaxies using tools of bayesian analysis. even with a broadsearch in parameter space the whole model family fails to match to constrainingdata. in the best fitting models, the star formation and feedback parameters inlow-mass haloes are tightly constrained by the two data sets, and the analysisreveals several generic failures of models that similarly apply to otherexisting sams. first, based on the assumption that baryon accretion follows thedark matter accretion, large mass-loading factors are required for haloes withcircular velocities lower than 200 km/s, and most of the wind mass must beexpelled from the haloes. second, assuming that the feedback is powered bytype-ii supernovae with a chabrier imf, the outflow requires more than 25% ofthe available sn kinetic energy. finally, the posterior predictivedistributions for the star formation history are dramatically inconsistent withobservations for masses similar to or smaller than the milky-way mass. theinferences suggest that the current model family is still missing some keyphysical processes that regulate the gas accretion and star formation ingalaxies with masses below that of the milky way.

1312.7417	measuring the x-ray luminosities of sdss dr7 clusters from rass	we use rosat all sky survey (rass) broadband x-ray images and the opticalclusters identified from sdss dr7 to estimate the x-ray luminosities around$\sim 65,000$ candidate clusters with masses $\ga 10^{13}\msunh$ based on anoptical to x-ray (otx) code we develop. we obtain a catalogue with x-rayluminosity for each cluster. this catalog contains 817 clusters (473 atredshift $z\le 0.12$) with $s/n&gt; 3$ in x-ray detection. we find about $65\%$ ofthese x-ray clusters have their most massive member located near the x-ray fluxpeak; for the rest $35\%$, the most massive galaxy is separated from the x-raypeak, with the separation following a distribution expected from a nfw profile.we investigate a number of correlations between the optical and x-rayproperties of these x-ray clusters, and find that: the cluster x-ray luminosityis correlated with the stellar mass (luminosity) of the clusters, as well aswith the stellar mass (luminosity) of the central galaxy and the mass of thehalo, but the scatter in these correlations is large. comparing the propertiesof x-ray clusters of similar halo masses but having different x-rayluminosities, we find that massive halos with masses $\ga 10^{14}\msunh$contain a larger fraction of red satellite galaxies when they are brighter inx-ray. ... a cluster catalog containing the optical properties of membergalaxies and the x-ray luminosity is available at {\ithttp://gax.shao.ac.cn/data/group.html}.

1402.2036	formation of disk galaxies in preheated media: a preventative feedback  model	we introduce a semi-analytic galaxy formation model implementing aself-consistent treatment for the hot halo gas configuration and the assemblyof central disks. using the model, we explore a preventative feedback model, inwhich the circum-halo medium is assumed to be preheated up to a certain entropylevel by early starbursts or other processes, and compare it with an ejectivefeedback model, in which baryons are first accreted into dark matter halos andsubsequently ejected out by feedback. the model demonstrates that when themedium is preheated to an entropy comparable to the halo virial entropy thebaryon accretion can be largely reduced and delayed. in addition, the preheatedmedium can establish an extended low density gaseous halo when it accretes intothe dark matter halos, and result in a specific angular momentum of the coolinggas large enough to form central disks as extended as those observed. combinedwith simulated halo assembly histories, the preventative feedback model canreproduce remarkably well a number of observational scaling relations. theseinclude the cold baryon (stellar plus cold gas) mass fraction-halo massrelations, star formation histories, disk size-stellar mass relation and itsevolution, and the number density of low-mass galaxies as a function ofredshift. in contrast, the conventional ejective feedback model fails toreproduce these observational trends. using the model, we demonstrate that theproperties of disk galaxies are closely tied to the thermal state of hot halogas and even possibly the circum-halo medium, which suggests that observationaldata for the disk properties and circum-galactic hot/warm medium may jointlyprovide interesting constraints for galaxy formation models.

0803.1213	reconstructing the cosmic density field with the distribution of dark  matter halos	we develop a new method to reconstruct the cosmic density field from thedistribution of dark matter haloes above a certain mass threshold. ourmotivation is that well-defined samples of galaxy groups/clusters, which can beused to represent the dark halo population, can now be selected from largeredshift surveys of galaxies, and our ultimate goal is to use such data toreconstruct the cosmic density field in the local universe. our reconstructionmethod starts with a sample of dark matter haloes above a given mass threshold.each volume element in space is assigned to the domain of the nearest haloaccording to a distance measure that is scaled by the virial radius of thehalo. the distribution of the mass in and around dark matter haloes of a givenmass is modelled using the cross-correlation function between dark matterhaloes and the mass distribution within their domains. we use n-bodycosmological simulations to show that the density profiles required in ourreconstruction scheme can be determined reliably from large cosmologicalsimulations, and that our method can reconstruct the density field accuratelyusing haloes with masses down to $\sim 10^{12}\msun$ (above which samples ofgalaxy groups can be constructed from current large redshift surveys ofgalaxies). working in redshift space, we demonstrate that the redshiftdistortions due to the peculiar velocities of haloes can be corrected in aniterative way. we also describe some applications of our method.

1406.5068	star formation and stellar mass assembly in dark matter halos: from  giants to dwarfs	the empirical model of lu et al. 2014 is updated with recent data and used tostudy galaxy star formation and assembly histories. at $z &gt; 2$, the predictedgalaxy stellar mass functions are steep, and a significant amount of starformation is hosted by low-mass haloes that may be missed in currentobservations. most of the stars in cluster centrals formed earlier than$z\approx 2$ but have been assembled much later. milky way mass galaxies havehad on-going star formation without significant mergers since $z\approx 2$, andare thus free of significant (classic) bulges produced by major mergers. inmassive clusters, stars bound in galaxies and scattered in the halo form ahomogeneous population that is old and with solar metallicity. in contrast, inmilky way mass systems the two components form two distinct populations, withhalo stars being older and poorer in metals by a factor of $\approx 3$. dwarfgalaxies in haloes with $m_{\rm h} &lt; 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$ have experienced astar formation burst accompanied by major mergers at $z &gt; 2$, followed by anearly constant star formation rate after $z = 1$. the early burst leaves asignificant old stellar population that is distributed in spheroids.

0803.2250	on halo formation times and assembly bias	in this paper we use the ``millennium simulation'' to re-examine the massassembly history of dark matter halos and the age dependence of haloclustering. we use eight different definitions of halo formation times tocharacterize the different aspects of the assembly history of a dark matterhalo. we find that these formation times have different dependence on halomass. while some formation times characterize well the hierarchical nature ofhalo formation, in the sense that more massive halos have later formation, thetrend is reversed for other definitions of the formation time. in particular,the formation times that are likely to be related to the formation of galaxiesin dark halos show strong trends of ``down-sizing'', in that lower-mass halosform later. we also investigate how the correlation amplitude of dark matterhalos depends on the different formation times. we find that this dependence isquite strong for some definitions of formation time but weak or absent forother definitions. in particular, the correlation amplitude of halos of a givenmass is almost independent of their last major merger time. for the definitionsthat are expected to be more related to the formation of galaxies in darkhalos, a significant assembly bias is found only for halos less massive thanm_*. we discuss our results in connection to the hierarchical assembly of darkmatter halos, the ``archaeological down-sizing'' observed in the galaxypopulation, and the observed color-dependence of the clustering strength ofgalaxy groups and clusters.

1407.3451	elucid - exploring the local universe with reconstructed initial density  field i: hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo method with particle mesh  dynamics	simulating the evolution of the local universe is important for studyinggalaxies and the intergalactic medium in a way free of cosmic variance. here wepresent a method to reconstruct the initial linear density field from an inputnon-linear density field, employing the hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo(hmc) algorithm combined with particle mesh (pm) dynamics. the hmc+pm method isapplied to cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear densityfields are then evolved to the present day with n-body simulations. theconstrained simulations so obtained accurately reproduce both the amplitudesand phases of the input simulations at various $z$. using a pm model with agrid cell size of 0.75 mpc/h and 40 time-steps in the hmc can recover more thanhalf of the phase information down to a scale k~0.85 h/mpc at high z and tok~3.4 h/mpc at z=0, which represents a significant improvement over similarreconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model canreconstruct the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamicalrange. adopting pm models with higher spatial and temporal resolutions yieldseven better reconstructions, suggesting that our method is limited more by theavailability of computer resource than by principle. dynamic models ofstructure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can inducenon-gaussianity in the reconstructed linear density field, which in turn cancause large systematic deviations in the predicted halo mass function. suchdeviations are greatly reduced or absent in our reconstruction.

1407.4382	classical bulges, supermassive blackholes and agn feedback: extension to  low-mass galaxies	the empirical model of lu et al. 2014a for the relation between starformation rate and halo mass growth is adopted to predict the classical bulgemass ($m_{\rm cb}$) - total stellar mass ($m_\star$) relation for centralgalaxies. the assumption that the supermassive black hole (smbh) mass ($m_{\rmbh}$) is directly proportional to the classical bulge mass, with theproportionality given by that for massive galaxies, predicts a $m_{\rm bh}$ -$m_\star$ relation that matches well the observed relation for different typesof galaxies. in particular, the model reproduces the strong transition at$m_\star=10^{10.5}$ - $10^{11}m_{\odot}$, below which $m_{\rm bh}$ dropsrapidly with decreasing $m_\star$. our model predicts a new sequence at$m_\star &lt;10^{10.5}m_{\odot}$, where $m_{\rm bh} \propto m_\star$ but theamplitude is a factor of $\sim 50$ lower than the amplitude of the sequence at$m_\star&gt;10^{11}m_{\odot}$. if all smbh grow through similar quasar modes witha feedback efficiency of a few percent, the energy produced in low-massgalaxies at redshift $z\gtrsim 2$ can heat the circum-galactic medium up to aspecific entropy level that is required to prevent excessive star formation inlow-mass dark matter halos.

1408.2640	galaxy ecosystems: gas contents, inflows and outflows	we use a set of observational data for galaxy cold gas mass fraction and gasphase metallicity to constrain the content, inflow and outflow of gas incentral galaxies hosted by halos with masses between $10^{11} m_{\odot}$ to$10^{12} m_{\odot}$. the gas contents in high redshift galaxies are obtained bycombining the empirical star formation histories of lu et al. (2014) and starformation models that relate star formation rate with the cold gas mass ingalaxies. we find that the total baryon mass in low-mass galaxies is alwaysmuch less than the universal baryon mass fraction since $z = 2$, regardless ofstar formation model adopted. the data for the evolution of the gas phasemetallicity require net metal outflow at $z\lesssim 2$, and the metal loadingfactor is constrained to be about $0.01$, or about $60\%$ of the metal yield.based on the assumption that galactic outflow is more enriched in metal thanboth the interstellar medium and the material ejected at earlier epochs, we areable to put stringent constraints on the upper limits for both the netaccretion rate and the net mass outflow rate. the upper limits strongly suggestthat the evolution of the gas phase metallicity and gas mass fraction forlow-mass galaxies at $z &lt; 2$ is not compatible with strong outflow. wespeculate that the low star formation efficiency of low-mass galaxies is owingto some preventative processes that prevent gas from accreting into galaxies inthe first place.

0803.4215	feedback from galactic stellar bulges and hot gaseous haloes of galaxies	we demonstrate that the feedback from stellar bulges can play an essentialrole in shaping the halo gas of galaxies with substantial bulge components byconducting 1-d hydrodynamical simulations. the feedback model we considerconsists of two distinct phases: 1) an early starburst during the bulgeformation and 2) a subsequent long-lasting mass and energy injection fromstellar winds of low-mass stars and type ia sne. an energetic outward blastwaveis initiated by the starburst and is maintained and enhanced by thelong-lasting stellar feedback. for a mw-like galactic bulge, this blastwavesweeps up the halo gas in the proto-galaxy and heats up the surrounding mediumto a scale much beyond the virial radius of the halo, thus the accretion of thehalo hot gas can be completely stopped. in addition, the long-lasting feedbackin the later phase powers a galactic bulge wind that is reverse-shocked at alarge radius in the presence of surrounding intergalactic medium and hencemaintains a hot gaseous halo. as the mass and energy injection decreases withtime, the feedback evolves to a subsonic and quasi-stable outflow, which isenough to prevent halo gas from cooling. the two phases of the feedback thusre-enforce each-other's impact on the gas dynamics. the simulation resultsdemonstrate that the stellar bulge feedback may provide a plausible solution tothe long-standing problems in understanding the mw type galaxies, such as the"missing stellar feedback" problem and the "over-cooling" problem. thesimulations also show that the properties of the hot gas in the subsonicoutflow state depend sensitively on the environment and the formation historyof the bulge. this dependence and variance may explain the large dispersion inthe x-ray to b-band luminosity ratio of the low $l_x/l_b$ es.

1502.01256	an observational proxy of halo assembly time and its correlation with  galaxy properties	we show that the ratio between the stellar mass of central galaxy and themass of its host halo, $f_c \equiv m_{*,c}/m_{\rm h}$, can be used as anobservable proxy of halo assembly time, in that galaxy groups with higher $f_c$assembled their masses earlier. using sdss groups of yang et al., we study how$f_c$ correlates with galaxy properties such as color, star formation rate,metallicity, bulge to disk ratio, and size. central galaxies of a given stellarmass in groups with $f_c&gt;0.02$ tend to be redder in color, more quenched instar formation, smaller in size, and more bulge dominated, as $f_c$ increases.the trends in color and star formation appear to reverse at $f_c&lt;0.02$,reflecting a down-sizing effect that galaxies in massive halos formed theirstars earlier although the host halos themselves assembled later (lower $f_c$).no such reversal is seen in the size of elliptical galaxies, suggesting thattheir assembly follows halo growth more closely than their star formation.satellite galaxies of a given stellar mass in groups of a given halo mass tendto be redder in color, more quenched in star formation and smaller in size as$f_c$ increases. for a given stellar mass, satellites also tend to be smallerthan centrals. the trends are stronger for lower mass groups. for groups moremassive than $\sim 10^{13}{\rm m}_\odot$, a weak reversed trend is seen incolor and star formation. the observed trends in star formation arequalitatively reproduced by an empirical model based on halo age abundancematching, but not by a semi-analytical model tested here.

0805.0002	satellite ecology: the dearth of environment dependence	using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) galaxy group catalogue of yang etal. (2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellitegalaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and(iii) their group-centric radius. we find that the colours and concentrationsof satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass.in particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations ofsatellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius.we find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes ofall masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centricradii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. in addition, the weakcolour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass issimply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, moremassive satellites. combining these results with the fact that satellitegalaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than centralgalaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxiesbecome redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo(i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). this is a clear manifestation ofenvironment dependence. however, there is no indication that the magnitude ofthe transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxyundergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matterwhether it becomes a satellite of a small (milky way sized) halo, or of amassive cluster. we discuss the implication of this `dearth' of environmentdependence for the physical processes responsible for transforming satellitegalaxies.

1504.02109	gas and metal contents of galaxies and gaseous halos: preventive versus  ejective feedback	using a semi-analytical approach we investigate the characteristics ofpredictions for the masses and metallicities of the baryonic matter in andaround galaxies made by three galaxy formation models. these models representthree different feedback scenarios: one model with purely ejective feedback,one model with ejective feedback with reincorporation of ejected gas, and onepreventative model. we find that, when the model parameters are adjusted topredict the correct stellar masses for a range of halo masses between 10^{10}to 10^{12}msun, these three scenarios have very different predictions for themasses and metallicities of the interstellar and circum-galactic media.compared with current observational data, the model implementing preventativefeedback has a large freedom to match a broad range of observational data,while the ejective models have difficulties to match a number of observationalconstraints simultaneously, independent of how the ejection and reincorporationare implemented. our results suggest that the feedback process which regulatesthe amounts of stars and cold gas in low-mass galaxies is preventative innature.

1505.04798	assessing colour-dependent occupation statistics inferred from galaxy  group catalogues	we investigate the ability of current implementations of galaxy group findersto recover colour-dependent halo occupation statistics. to test the fidelity ofgroup catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders usedin the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realisticmanner. overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar,and most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.however, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequenceof correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellitedesignation, and halo mass assignment. we introduce a new statistic, the halotransition probability (htp), which captures the combined impact of all theseerrors. as a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinctgalaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), andto result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for redgalaxies than for blue galaxies. a statistic that is particularly poorlyrecovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies asfunction of halo mass. group finders do a good job in recovering galacticconformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none ispresent. we conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics fromgroup catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running groupfinders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on thehtp, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.

1506.04699	star formation and quenching of satellite galaxies	we study the quenching of satellite galaxies by gradual depletion of gas dueto star formation, by ram-pressure striping and by tidally triggered starburst.using progenitors constrained by the empirical model of lu et al., in whichoutflow loading factor is low, we do not find an over-quenching problem insatellites even if there is no further cold gas supply from the cooling of thehalo gas after a galaxy is accreted by its host. gradual depletion alonepredicts a unimodal distribution in specific star formation, in contrast to thebimodal distribution observed, and under-predicts the quenched fraction in lowmass halos. ram-pressure stripping nicely reproduces the bimodal distributionbut under-predicts the quenched fraction in low-mass halos. starbursts ingas-rich satellites triggered by tidal interactions with central galaxies cannicely reproduce the quenched satellite population in low-mass halos, butbecome unimportant for low-mass satellites in massive halos. the combinedprocesses, together with the constrained progenitors, can reproduce theobserved star formation properties of satellites in halos of different masses.

0807.4178	the rise and fall of galaxy activity in dark matter haloes	we use a sdss galaxy group catalogue to study the dependence of galaxyactivity on stellar mass, halo mass, and group hierarchy (centrals vs.satellites). we split our galaxy sample in star-forming galaxies, galaxies withoptical agn activity and radio sources. we find a smooth transition in halomass as the activity of central galaxies changes from star formation to opticalagn activity to radio emission. star-forming centrals preferentially reside inhaloes with m&lt;10^{12} msun, central galaxies with optical-agn activitytypically inhabit haloes with m \sim 10^{13} msun, and centrals emitting in theradio mainly reside in haloes more massive than 10^{14} msun. although thisseems to suggest that the environment (halo mass) determines the type ofactivity of its central galaxy, we find a similar trend with stellar mass:central star formers typically have stellar masses below 10^{10} msun, whileoptical-agn hosts and central radio sources have characteristic stellar massesof 10^{10.8} msun and 10^{11.6} msun, respectively. since more massive haloestypically host more massive centrals, it is unclear whether the activity of acentral galaxy is causally connected to its stellar mass or to its halo mass.in general, satellite galaxies have their activity suppressed wrt centralgalaxies of the same stellar mass. at fixed stellar mass, we find that theactivity of satellite galaxies depends only weakly on halo mass. in fact, forsatellite galaxies the dependence of galaxy activity on halo mass is more thanfour times weaker than the dependence on stellar mass. as we discuss, all theseresults are consistent with a picture in which low mass haloes accrete coldgas, while massive haloes have coronae of hot gas that promote radio activityof their central galaxies.

0807.4932	galaxy clustering &amp; galaxy-galaxy lensing: a promising union to  constrain cosmological parameters	galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing probe the connection betweengalaxies and their dark matter haloes in complementary ways. on one hand, thehalo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties ofgalaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. consequently, differentcosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. on theother hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actualmass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus toconstrain cosmological parameters. in this paper we establish the link betweengalaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosityfunction (clf). we constrain the clf parameters using the galaxy luminosityfunction and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies.the resulting clf models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.for a cosmology with $(\omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.238,0.734)$, the modelaccurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the sdss. for acomparison cosmology with $(\omega_{\rm m},\sigma_8)=(0.3,0.9)$, however, wecan accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of thegalaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are toohigh, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.we conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensingis a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential toyield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. since this method mainlyprobes the mass distribution on non-linear scales, it is complementary toconstraints obtained from the galaxy power-spectrum, which mainly probes thelarge-scale (linear) matter distribution.

astro-ph;0002451	tully-fisher relation and its implications for halo density profile and  self-interacting dark matter	we show that the tully-fisher relation observed for spiral galaxies can beexplained in the current scenario of galaxy formation without invoking subtleassumptions, provided that galactic-sized dark haloes have shallow, core-likecentral profiles, with a core radius proportional to halo circular velocity. insuch a system, both disk and halo contribute significantly to the maximumrotation of the disk, and the interaction between the disk and halo componentsacts to reduce the scatter in the tully-fisher relation. with model parameterschosen in plausible ranges, the model can well accommodate the zero-point,slope, scatter of the observed tully-fisher relation, as well as the largerange of disk sizes. the model predicts that lsb disks obey a tully-fisherrelation similar to that of normal disks, if disk mass-to-light ratio isproperly taken into account. the halo profile required by the tully-fisherrelation is as shallow as that required by the rotation curves of faint disks,but much shallower than that predicted by conventional cdm models. our resultscannot be explained by some of the recent proposals for resolving the conflictbetween conventional cdm models and the rotation-curve shapes of faintgalaxies. if dark matter self-interaction (either scattering or annihilation)is responsible for the shallow profile, the observed tully-fisher relationrequires the interaction cross section \sigma_x to satisfy&lt;\sigma_{x}|v|&gt;/m_{x}~10^{-16} cm^3/s/gev.

astro-ph;0009006	constraining cosmological parameters with the clustering properties of  galaxy clusters in optical and x-ray bands	(abridged) we use a theoretical model to predict the clustering properties ofgalaxy clusters. our technique accounts for past light-cone effects on theobserved clustering and follows the non-linear evolution of the dark mattercorrelation function and cluster bias factor. a linear treatment ofredshift-space distortions is also included. we perform a maximum-likelihoodanalysis by comparing the theoretical predictions to a set of observationaldata, both in the optical (apm and edcc catalogues) and x-ray band (rass1bright sample, bcs, xbacs, reflex). in the framework of cdm models, we computethe constraints on cosmological parameters. our results show that x-ray dataare more powerful than optical ones, allowing smaller regions in the parameterspace. we find that the clustering properties of clusters are almostindependent of the matter density parameter and of the presence of acosmological constant, while they appear to be strongly dependent on the shapeparameter. using the x-ray data only, we obtain gamma~0.1 and 0.4&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.1for the einstein-de sitter model, while 0.14&lt;gamma&lt;0.22 and 0.6&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.3 foropen and flat models with omega_0m=0.3. finally, we use our model to makepredictions on the correlation length of galaxy clusters expected in futuresurveys. in particular, we show the results for an optical catalogue withcharacteristics similar to the eis project and for a very deep x-ray cataloguewith the characteristics of the xmm/lss survey. we find that clusters at highredshifts are expected to have larger a correlation length than local ones.

astro-ph;0102436	the host haloes of lyman break galaxies and sub-millimeter sources	we use the observed sizes and star formation rates of lyman-break galaxies(lbgs) to understand their properties expected in the hierarchical scenario ofgalaxy formation. the observed size distribution constrains the masses of thehost haloes of lbgs from below, while the observed star-formation distributionconstrains the masses from above. assuming a flat cdm model with a cosmologicalconstant ($\omega_\lambda=0.7$), we find that consistency with observationsrequires the circular velocities of lbg host haloes to be in the range100--$300 {\rm km s^{-1}}$. the predicted comoving correlation length of theseobjects is $\sim 3 h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$, and the predicted velocity dispersion oftheir stellar contents is typically $70 {\rm km s^{-1}}$. the same prescriptionapplied to larger haloes in the cdm cosmogony predicts the existence ofgalaxies with star formation rates $\sim 1000 {\rm m_\odot yr^{-1}}$ atredshift $z\sim 3$. we explore the possibility of identifying these galaxies tobe the bright sub-millimeter (sub-mm) sources detected by scuba. the modelpredicts that the host haloes of these sub-mm sources are massive. thesegalaxies are predicted to be strongly correlated, with a comoving correlationlength of $\sim 7 h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$. the descendants of the bright sub-mmsources should reside in clusters of galaxies at the present time, and it islikely that these objects are the progenitors of giant ellipticals. the modelpredicts the existence of a relatively bright and red population of galaxies at$z\sim 3$, which may be observed in the k-band.

astro-ph;0105008	on the distribution of haloes, galaxies and mass	the stochasticity in the distribution of dark haloes in the cosmic densityfield is reflected in the distribution function $p_v(n_h|\delta_m)$ which givesthe probability of finding $n_h$ haloes in a volume $v$ with mass densitycontrast $\delta_m$. we study the properties of this function usinghigh-resolution $n$-body simulations, and find that $p_v(n_n|\delta_m)$ issignificantly non-poisson. the ratio between the variance and the mean goesfrom $\sim 1$ (poisson) at $1+\delta_m\ll 1$ to $&lt;1$ (sub-poisson) at$1+\delta_m\sim 1$ to $&gt;1$ (super-poisson) at $1+\delta_m\gg 1$. the mean biasrelation is found to be well described by halo bias models based on thepress-schechter formalism. the sub-poisson variance can be explained as aresult of halo-exclusion while the super-poisson variance at high $\delta_m$may be explained as a result of halo clustering. a simple phenomenologicalmodel is proposed to describe the behavior of the variance as a function of$\delta_m$. galaxy distribution in the cosmic density field predicted bysemi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows similar stochastic behavior. wediscuss the implications of the stochasticity in halo bias to the modelling ofhigher-order moments of dark haloes and of galaxies.

astro-ph;0105095	the fundamental plane of spiral galaxies: theoretical expectations	current theory of disk galaxy formation is used to study fundamental-plane(fp) type of relations for disk galaxies. we examine how the changes in modelparameters affect these relations and explore the possibility of using suchrelations to constrain theoretical models. the distribution of galaxy disks inthe space of their fundamental properties are predicted to be concentrated in aplane, with the tully-fisher (tf) relation (a relation between luminosity $l$and maximum rotation velocity $v_m$) being an almost edge-on view. usingrotation velocities at larger radii generally leads to larger tf scatter. insearching for a third parameter, we find that both the disk scale-length $r_d$(or surface brightness) and the rotation-curve shape are correlated with the tfscatter. the fp relation in the $(\log l, \log v_m, \log r_d)$-space obtainedfrom the theory is $l\propto r_d^{\alpha'} v_m^{\beta'}$, with ${\alpha'}\sim0.50$ and ${\beta'}\sim 2.60$, consistent with the preliminary result we obtainfrom observational data. among the model parameters we probe, variation in anyof them can generate significant scatter in the tf relation, but the effects ofthe spin parameter and halo concentration can be reduced significantly byintroducing $r_d$ while the scatter caused by varying $m_d$ (the ratio betweendisk mass and halo mass) is most effectively reduced by introducing theparameters which describes the rotation-curve shape. the tf and fp relationscombined should therefore provide useful constraints on models of galaxyformation.

astro-ph;0105233	probing the intergalactic medium with the lyman alpha forest along  multiple lines of sight to distant qsos	(abridged) we present an effective implementation of analytical calculationsof the lyalpha opacity distribution of the intergalactic medium (igm) alongmultiple lines of sight (los) to distant quasars in a cosmological setting.this method fully accounts for the expected correlations between los and thecosmic variance in the large-scale modes of the dark matter distribution.strong correlations extending up to ~300 kpc (proper) and more are found atredshift z~2-&gt;3, in agreement with observations. these correlations areinvestigated using the cross-correlation coefficient and the cross-powerspectrum of the flux distribution along different los and by identifyingcoincident absorption features as fitted with a voigt profile fitting routine.the cross-correlation coefficient between the los can be used to constrain theshape-parameter gamma of the power spectrum if the temperature and thetemperature density relation of the igm can be determined indepedently. we alsopropose a new technique to recover the 3d linear dark matter power spectrum byintegrating over 1d flux cross-spectra which is complementary to the usual`differentiation' of 1d auto-spectra. the cross-power spectrum suffers muchless from errors uncorrelated in different los, like those introduced bycontinuum fitting. investigations of the flux correlations in adjacent losshould thus allow to extend studies of the dark matter power spectrum with thelyalpha forest to significantly larger scales than is possible with fluxauto-power spectra. 30 pairs with separation of 1-2 arcmin should be sufficientto determine the 1d cross-spectrum at scales of 60 mpc/h with an accuracy ofabout 30% if the error is dominated by cosmic variance.

astro-ph;0112108	galaxy formation in preheated intergalactic media	we outline a scenario of galaxy formation in which the gas in galaxy-formingregions was preheated to high entropy by vigorous energy feedback associatedwith the formation of stars in old ellipticals and bulges and with agnactivity. such preheating likely occurred at redshifts z ~ 2-3, and can producethe entropy excess observed today in low-mass clusters of galaxies withoutdestroying the bulk of the lyman alpha forest. subsequent galaxy formation isaffected by the preheating, because the gas no longer follows the dark matteron galaxy scales. the hot gas around galaxy haloes has very shallow profilesand emits only weakly in the x-ray. cooling in a preheated halo is notinside-out, because the cooling efficiency does not change significantly withradius. only part of the gas in a protogalaxy region can cool and be accretedinto the final galaxy halo. the accreted gas is likely in diffuse clouds and sodoes not lose angular momentum to the dark matter. cluster ellipticals areproduced by mergers of stellar systems formed prior to the preheating, whilelarge galaxy disks form in low-density environments where gas accretion cancontinue to the present time.

astro-ph;0201124	an analytical model for the non-linear redshift-space power spectrum	we use n-body simulations to test the predictions of the redshift distortionin the power spectrum given by the halo model in which the clustering of darkmatter particles is considered as a result both of the clustering of dark halosin space and of the distribution of dark matter particles in individual darkhalo. the predicted redshift distortion depends sensitively on several modelparameters in a way different from the real-space power spectrum. an accuratemodel of the redshift distortion can be constructed if the following propertiesof the halo population are modelled accurately: the mass function of darkhalos, the velocity dispersion among dark halos, and the non-linear nature ofhalo bias on small scales. the model can be readily applied to interpreting theclustering properties and velocity dispersion of different populations ofgalaxies once a cluster-weighted bias (or equivalently an halo occupationnumber model) is specified for the galaxies. some non-trivial bias featuresobserved from redshift surveys of optical galaxies and of iras galaxiesrelative to the standard low-density cold dark matter model can be easilyexplained in the cluster weighted bias model. the halo model further indicatesthat a linear bias can be a good approximation only on for k &lt;= 0.1 hmpc^{-1}.

astro-ph;0202393	the abundance and clustering of dark haloes in the standard lambda cdm  cosmogony	much evidence suggests that we live in a flat cold dark matter universe witha cosmological constant. accurate analytic formulae are now available for manyproperties of the dark halo population in such a universe. assuming current``concordance'' values for the cosmological parameters, we plot halo abundanceagainst redshift as a function of halo mass, of halo temperature, of thefraction of cosmic matter in haloes, of halo clustering strength, and of theclustering strength of the z=0 descendants of high redshift haloes. these plotsare useful for understanding how nonlinear structure grows in the model. theydemonstrate a number of properties which may seem surprising, for example: 10^9solar mass haloes are as abundant at z=20 as l_* galaxies are today; 10^6khaloes are equally abundant at z=8 and at z=0; 10% of all matter is currentlyin haloes hotter than 1 kev, while more than half is in haloes too cool to trapphoto-ionized gas; 1% of all matter at z=15 is in haloes hot enough to ionisehydrogen; haloes of given mass or temperature are more clustered at higherredshift; haloes with the abundance of present-day l_* galaxies are equallyclustered at all z&lt;20; the metals produced by star-formation at z&gt;10 are moreclustered at z=0 than are l_* galaxies.

astro-ph;0203418	modelling the igm and the lyalpha forest at high redshift from the dark  matter distribution	a variety of approximate schemes for modelling the low-density intergalacticmedium (igm) in the high-redshift universe is compared to the results of alarge high-resolution hydro-dynamical simulation. these schemes use either ananalytical description of the dark matter distribution and the igm or numericalsimulations of the dm distributions combined with different approximaterelations between dark matter field and the gas distribution. schemes based ona filtering of the dark matter distribution with a global jeans scale result ina rather poor description of the gas distribution. an adaptive filtering whichtakes into account the density/temperature dependence of the jeans scale isrequired. a reasonable description of the gas distribution can be achievedusing a fit of the mean relation between the dark matter and gas densities inthe hydro-dynamical simulation to relate dark matter and gas distribution. inthe hydro-dynamical simulations deviations from this mean relation arecorrelated with gradients in the dark matter peculiar velocity field indicativeof shocks in the gas component. a scheme which takes into account thiscorrelation results in a further improved gas distribution. such adaptivefiltering schemes applied to dark matter simulations will be very well suitedfor studies of statistical properties of the lyalpha forest which investigatethe igm and the underlying dark matter distribution and require a large dynamicrange and/or an extensive parameter study.

astro-ph;0205546	understanding the results of galaxy-galaxy lensing using galaxy-mass  correlation in numerical simulations	mckay et al. (2002) have recently used measurements of weak galaxy-galaxylensing in the sloan digital sky survey to estimate the cross correlationbetween galaxies and the projected dark matter density field. they derive arelation between aperture mass within a radius of $260\kpch$, $m_{260}$, andlens galaxy luminosity, that does not depend on galaxy luminosity, type orenvironment. in this paper, we study the cross-correlation between galaxies anddark matter using galaxy catalogs constructed from a high-resolution n-bodysimulation of a $\lambda$cdm universe. we show that our simulations reproducethe mckay et al. results reasonably well. in the simulation, $m_{260}$ isapproximately equal to the halo virial mass for $l_*$ galaxies. $m_{260}$overestimates the virial mass for fainter galaxies and underestimates it forbrighter galaxies. we use the simulations to show that under certaincircumstances the halo virial mass may be recovered by fitting an nfw profileto the projected galaxy-mass correlation function. if we apply our method tothe observations, we find that $l_*$ galaxies typically reside in halos of$\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1} \msun$, consistent with halo masses estimated fromthe observed tully-fisher relation. in the simulations, the halo virial massscales with galaxy luminosity as $l^{1.5}$ for central galaxies in halos andfor galaxies in low-density regions. for satellite galaxies, and for galaxiesin high-density regions, there is no simple relation between galaxy luminosityand halo mass and care must be exercised when interpreting the lensing results.

astro-ph;0207019	constraining galaxy formation and cosmology with the conditional  luminosity function of galaxies	we use the conditional luminosity function (clf), which gives the number ofgalaxies with luminosities in the range [l, l+dl] that reside in a halo of massm, to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. we seekthe clf that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminositydependence of the galaxy clustering strength and test the models by comparingthe resulting mass-to-light ratios (m/l) with constraints from the tully-fisher(tf) relation. we obtain a number of stringent constraints on both galaxyformation and cosmology. in particular, this method can break the degeneracybetween omega_0 and the power-spectrum normalization sigma_8, inherent incurrent weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. for flat lcdm cosmogonieswith sigma_8 normalized by recent weak lensing observations, the best resultsare obtained for omega_0~0.3; omega_0 &lt; 0.2 leads to too large galaxycorrelation lengths, while omega_0 &gt; 0.4 gives too high m/l. the best-fit modelfor the lcdm concordance cosmology (omega_0=0.3) predicts m/l that are slightlytoo high. we discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy thisproblem, including small modification of cosmological parameters, warm in steadof cold dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and theexistence of dark galaxies. finally we use the clf to predict severalstatistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local universe.

0808.2526	the subhalo - satellite connection and the fate of disrupted satellite  galaxies	in the standard paradigm, satellite galaxies are believed to be associatedwith the population of dark matter subhalos. in this paper, we use theconditional stellar mass functions of {\it satellite galaxies} obtained from alarge galaxy group catalogue together with models of the subhalo mass functionsto explore the fraction and fate of stripped stars from satellites in galaxygroups and clusters of different masses. the majority of the stripped stars inmassive halos are predicted to end up as intra-cluster stars, and the predictedamounts of the intra-cluster component as a function of the velocity dispersionof galaxy system match well the observational results obtained by gonzalez etal. (2007). the fraction of the mass in the stripped stars to that remain boundin the central and satellite galaxies is the highest ($\sim 40%$ of the totalstellar mass) in halos with masses $m_h\sim 10^{14}\msunh$. if all these starsend up in the intra-cluster component (max), or maximum of them are accretedinto the central galaxy (min), then we can predict that a maximum $\sim 19%$and a minimum $\sim 5%$ of the total stars in the whole universe are in termsof the diffused intra-cluster component. in the former case, in massive haloswith $m_h \sim 10^{15} \msunh$, the stellar mass of the intra-cluster componentis roughly 6 times as large as that of the central galaxy. this factordecreases to $\sim 2$, 1 and 0.1 in halos with $m_h \sim 10^{14}$, $10^{13}$,and $10^{12} \msunh$, respectively. the total amount of stars stripped fromsatellite galaxies is insufficient to build up the central galaxies in haloswith masses $\la 10^{12.5}\msunh$, and so the quenching of star formation mustoccur in halos with higher masses. abridged.

astro-ph;0210495	linking early and late type galaxies to their dark matter haloes	(abridged) using data from the 2dfgrs we compute the conditional luminosityfunctions (clfs) of early- and late-type galaxies. these functions give theaverage number of galaxies with luminosity l that reside in a halo of mass m,and are a powerful statistical tool to link the distribution of galaxies tothat of dark matter haloes. we find that the average mass-to-light ratios ofdark matter haloes have a minimum of about 100 msun/lsun around a halo mass ofabout 3x10^{11} msun. in addition, haloes with m &lt; 10^{10} msun are virtuallydevoid of galaxies, while clusters have b_j band mass-to-light ratios in therange 500-1000 msun/lsun. finally, the fact that early-type galaxies are morestrongly clustered than late-type galaxies requires that the fraction oflate-type galaxies is a strongly declining function of halo mass. we alsocompute two-point correlation functions as function of both luminosity andgalaxy type, and find a weak (strong) luminosity dependence for the late(early) type galaxies. finally we compare our clfs with predictions fromseveral semi-analytical models for galaxy formation. as long as these modelsaccurately fit the 2dfgrs luminosity function the agreement with ourpredictions is remarkably good. this indicates that we have recovered astatistical description of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes which fitsnicely within the standard framework for galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0301035	an analytic model for the galactic winds and mass outflows	galactic winds and mass outflows are observed both in nearby starburstgalaxies and in high-redshift star-forming galaxies. in this paper we develop asimple analytic model to understand the observed superwind phenomenon. ourmodel is built upon the model of mckee &amp; ostriker (1977) for the interstellarmedium. it allows one to predict how properties of a superwind, such as windvelocity and mass outflow rate, are related to properties of its star-forminghost galaxy, such as size, gas density and star formation rate. the modelpredicts a threshold of star formation rate density for the generation ofobservable galactic winds. galaxies with more concentrated star formationproduce superwinds with higher velocities. the predicted mass outflow rates arecomparable to (or slightly larger than) the corresponding star formation rates.we apply our model to both local starburst galaxies and high-redshift lymanbreak galaxies, and find its predictions to be in good agreement with currentobservations. our model is simple, and so can be easily incorporated intonumerical simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0301104	towards cosmological concordance on galactic scales	we use the observed abundance and clustering of galaxies from the 2dfgrs todetermine the matter density omega_m and the linear amplitude of massfluctuations sigma_8. we use a method based on the conditional luminosityfunction, which allows straightforward computation of the luminosity dependentbias of galaxies. in addition, it allows the inclusion of constraints on theredshift space distortion parameter beta=omega_m^{0.6}/b, and yields averagemass-to-light ratios as function of halo mass. using only the luminosityfunction and the correlation lengths as function of luminosity we obtainconstraints on omega_m and sigma_8 that are in good agreement with cobe. usingadditional constraints on the mass-to-light ratios of clusters and on the valueof beta as determined from the 2dfgrs yields omega_m = (0.27 +/- 0.06) andsigma_8 = (0.77 +/- 0.06). adding further constraints from current cmb data, weobtain omega_m = (0.25 +/- 0.04) and sigma_8 = (0.78 +/- 0.06). thus, we findstrong indications that both omega_m and sigma_8 are significantly lower thantheir ``standard'' concordance values of 0.3 and 0.9, respectively. finally, weshow that the cosmologies favored here predict dark matter haloes that aresignificantly less centrally concentrated than for the standard lcdmconcordance model. this may solve both the problem with the rotation curves ofdwarf and lsb galaxies, as well as the problem of simultaneously matching thegalaxy luminosity function and the tully-fisher zero-point.

astro-ph;0303524	populating dark matter haloes with galaxies: comparing the 2dfgrs with  mock galaxy redshift surveys	in two recent papers, we developed a powerful technique to link thedistribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes by considering halooccupation numbers as function of galaxy luminosity and type. in this paper weuse these distribution functions to populate dark matter haloes inhigh-resolution n-body simulations of the standard lcdm cosmogony withomega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.9. stacking simulation boxes of 100 mpc/h and 300mpc/h with 512^3 cdm particles each we construct mock galaxy redshift surveysout to a redshift of z=0.2. we use these mock surveys to investigate variousclustering statistics. the projected correlation functions for galaxies withdifferent luminosities and types match the observations well on scales largerthan about 3 mpc/h. on smaller scales, however, the model overpredicts theclustering power by about a factor two. furthermore, the model predictspairwise velocity dispersions (pvd) that are about 400 km/s too high atprojected pair separations of ~1 mpc/h. a strong velocity bias in massivehaloes can reduce the predicted pvd to the observed level, but does not help toresolve the over-prediction of clustering power on small scales. consistentresults can be obtained within the standard lcdm model only when themass-to-light ratio of clusters is almost twice the observed value.alternatively, a lcdm model with sigma_8=0.75 can also reproduce theobservational results.

astro-ph;0310147	the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on large-scale  environment	a basic assumption in current halo occupation model is that the properties ofa galaxy depend only on the mass of its dark matter halo. an importantconsequence of this is that the segregation of the galaxy population bylarge-scale environment is entirely due to the environmental dependence of thehalo population. in this paper we use such a model to predict how the galaxyluminosity function depends on large-scale environment. the latter isrepresented by the density contrast (delta) averaged over a spherical volume ofradius r=8mpc/h. the model predicts that the schechter function is a goodapproximation to the luminosity functions of galaxies brighter than ~10^9h^{-2}l_sun (b_j-band) in virtually all environments. the characteristicluminosity, l^{\star}, increases moderately with \delta. the faint-end slope,\alpha, on the other hand, is quite independent of $\delta$. however, whensplitting the galaxy population into early and late types, it is found that forlate-types \alpha is virtually constant, whereas for early-types \alphaincreases from ~-0.3 in underdense regions (\delta~-0.5) to ~-0.8 in highlyoverdense regions with \delta ~ 10. the luminosity function at l_{b_j}&lt;10^9h^{-2} l_sun is significantly steeper than the extrapolation of the schechterfunction that fits the brighter galaxies. this steepening is more significantfor early-types and in low-density environments. the model also predicts thatthe luminosity density and mass density are closely correlated. the relationbetween the two is monotonic but highly non-linear. this suggests that one canuse the luminosity density, averaged over a large volume, to rank the massdensity. this, in turn, allows the environmental effects predicted here to betested by observations.

astro-ph;0311459	galaxy formation in pre-processed dark halos	recent n-body simulations show that the formation of a present-day, galaxysized dark matter halo in the cdm cosmogony in general consists of an earlyfast collapse phase, during which the potential associated with a halo isestablished, followed by a slow accretion phase, during which mass is addedrather gently in the outer region. here we outline a scenario in which the fastcollapse phase is accompanied with rapid formation of cold clouds and withstarbursts that can eject a large amount of gas from the halo center.the lossof orbital energy of the cold clouds to the dark matter and the ejection of gasfrom halo center by starburst can significantly reduce the halo concentration.the outflow from the starburst can also heat the gas in the protogalaxy region.subsequent formation of galaxies in the slow accretion regime is therefore inhalos that have been pre-processed by these processes and may have propertiesdifferent from that given by n-body simulations.  this scenario can help to solve several outstanding problems in the standard  lambda cdm model of galaxy formation without compromising its success inallowing structure formation at high redshift. the predicted rotation curvesare quite flat,alleviating the discrepancy of the tully-fisher relationpredicted in the lambda cdm model with observations. the flattened galaxy halosallow accreted minihalos to survive in their central regions longer, which maybe helpful in producing the flux anomalies observed in some gravitationallensing systems. the preheating by the early starbursts effectively reduces theamount of gas that can be accreted into galaxy halos, which may explain why thebaryon fraction in a spiral galaxy is in general much lower than the universalbaryon fraction, f_b~0.16, in the standard lambda cdm model.

astro-ph;0404033	probing dark matter haloes with satellite kinematics	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys we investigate to what extent thekinematics of large samples of satellites galaxies extracted from flux-limitedsurveys can be used to constrain halo masses. previous host-satellite selectioncriteria yield relatively large fractions of interlopers and with a velocitydistribution that, contrary to what has typically been assumed, differsstrongly from uniform. a new adaptive selection criterion is proposed whichyields much larger host-satellite samples and with strongly reduced interloperfractions. we show that satellite weighting, which occurs naturally whenstacking many host-satellite pairs, introduces a bias towards higher velocitydispersions compared to the true, host-averaged mean. a further bias, in thesame direction, is introduced when using flux-limited, rather thanvolume-limited surveys. we apply our adaptive selection criterion to the 2dfgrsand obtain a sample of 12613 satellite galaxies and 8004 host galaxies. thesatellite kinematics are in excellent agreement with predictions based on theconditional luminosity function (clf), providing independent, dynamicalconfirmation of the average mass-to-light ratios predicted by the clfformalism.

astro-ph;0404143	the three-point correlation function of galaxies: comparing halo  occupation models with observations	we present models for the three-point correlation function (3pcf) of bothdark matter and galaxies. we show that models based on the halo model canreasonably match the dark matter 3pcf obtained from high-resolution $n$-bodysimulations. on small scales ($r\la 0.5\mpch$) the 3pcf is sensitive to detailsregarding the density distributions of dark matter haloes. on larger scales ($r\ga 2.0\mpch$) the results are very sensitive to the abundance of the few mostprominant haloes. using the conditional luminosity function, we also constructmodels for the 3pcf of galaxies, which we test against large mock galaxysamples. the bias of the galaxy distrubution with respect to the dark matter,and the finite number of galaxies that can be hosted by individual haloes,significantly reduce the normalized three-point correlation function withrespect to that of dark matter. contrary to the 3pcf of the dark matter, thegalaxy 3pcf is much less sensitive to details regarding the spatial numberdensity distribution of galaxies in individual haloes or to the abundance ofthe few most massive systems. finally, we show that our model based on theconditional luminosity function is in good agreement with results obtained fromthe 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey. in particular, the model nicelyreproduces the observational finding that the 3pcf for early-type galaxies isslightly higher than that of late-type galaxies, and that there is nosignificant dependence of the 3pcf on galaxy luminosity.

astro-ph;0404226	optical and near-infrared color profiles in nearby early-type galaxies  and the implied age and metallicity gradients	we present results of age and metallicity gradient analysis inferred fromboth optical and near-infrared surface photometry. the analysis is based on asample of 36 nearby early-type galaxies, obtained from the early data releaseof the sloan digital sky survey and the two micron all sky survey. surfacebrightness profiles were derived in each band, and used to study the colorgradients of the galaxies. using simple stellar population models with bothoptical and near infrared colors, we may interpret the color gradients in termof age and metallicity gradients of galaxies. using $g_z \equiv d \log z_{\rmmet} / d \log r $ and $g_a = d \log {\rm age} / d \log r $ to represent themetallicity and age gradients, we found a median value of $g_z=-0.25\pm 0.03$for the metallicity gradient, with a dispersion $\sigma_{g_z}=0.19\pm0.02$. thecorresponding values for the age gradient were $g_a=0.02\pm 0.04$ and$\sigma_{g_a}=0.25\pm0.03$. these results are in good agreement with recentobservational results, as well as with recent simulations that suggest bothmonolithic collapse and major merger have played important roles in theformation of early-type galaxies. our results demonstrate the potential ofusing multi-waveband colors obtained from current and future optical andinfrared surveys in constraining the age and metallicity gradients ofearly-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0405234	a halo-based galaxy group finder: calibration and application to the  2dfgrs	we use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders inmagnitude-limited redshift surveys. since, according to the current scenario ofstructure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter halos,we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our groupfinder. the method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign atentative mass to each group. this mass is used to estimate the size andvelocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turnis used to determine group membership (in redshift space). this procedure isrepeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. we find that thefinal groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratioassumed. we use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosityfunction (clf), to test the performance of our group finder in terms ofcompleteness of true members and contamination by interlopers. our group finderis more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends group finder inassigning galaxies in common dark matter halos to a single group. we apply ourgroup finder to the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey and compare theresulting group properties with model predictions based on the clf. for the$\lambda$cdm `concordance' cosmology we find a clear discrepancy between themodel and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. inorder to match the observational results we have to either increase themass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher thancurrent observational estimates, or to assume $\sigma_8 \simeq 0.7$, comparedto the `concordance' value of 0.9.

astro-ph;0406246	the abundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies	using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (mgrss) we investigate theabundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies. the mock surveys areconstructed using the conditional luminosity function (clf), and are comparedagainst data from the 2dfgrs. we use monte carlo markov chains to explore thefull posterior distribution of the clf parameter space, and show that theaverage relation between light and mass is tightly constrained. the radialnumber density distribution of satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs reveals apronounced absence of satellites at small projected separations from their hostgalaxies. this is (at least partially) due to the overlap and merging of galaxyimages in the apm catalogue. because of the resulting close-pair incompletenesswe are unfortunately unable to put meaningful constraints on the radialdistribution of satellite galaxies. marginalizing over the full clf parameterspace, we show that in a lcdm concordance cosmology the observed abundances ofhost and satellite galaxies in the 2dfgrs indicate a power spectrumnormalization of sigma_8=0.7. the same cosmology but with sigma_8=0.9 is unableto simultanously match the abundances of host and satellite galaxies. thisconfirms our previous conclusions based on the pairwise peculiar velocitydispersions and the group multipliticy function.

astro-ph;0406593	the two-point correlation of galaxy groups: probing the clustering of  dark matter haloes	we analyze the 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of galaxy groupsidentified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey with the halo basedgroup finder recently developed by yang et al (2004b). with this groupcatalogue we are able to estimate the 2pcfs for systems ranging from isolatedgalaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. the real-space correlation lengthobtained for these systems ranges from $\sim 4\mpch$ to $\sim 15\mpch$,respectively. the observed correlation amplitude (and the corresponding biasfactor) as a function of group abundance is well reproduced by associatinggalaxy groups with dark matter haloes in the standard $\lambda$cdm model.redshift distortions are clearly detected in the redshift-space correlationfunction, the degree of which is consistent with the assumption ofgravitational clustering and halo bias in the cosmic density field. inagreement with previous studies we find a strong increase of the correlationlength with the mean inter-group separation. although well determinedobservationally, we show that current theoretical predictions are not yetaccurate enough to allow for stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.finally, we use our results to explore the power-law nature of the 2pcf ofgalaxies. we split the 2pcf in 1-group and 2-group terms, equivalent to the1-halo and 2-halo terms in halo occupation models, and show that the power-lawform of the 2pcf is broken, when only including galaxies in the more massivesystems.

astro-ph;0408475	semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with high-resolution n-body  simulations	we model the galaxy formation in a series of high-resolution n-bodysimulations using the semi-analytical approach. unlike many earlierinvestigations based on semi-analytical models, we make use of the subhalosresolved in the $n$-body simulations to follow the mergers of galaxies in darkhalos, and we show that this is pivotal in modeling correctly the galaxyluminosity function at the bright end and the bimodal nature of galaxy colordistribution. mergers of galaxies based on subhalos also result in many morebright red galaxies at high $z$. the semi-analytical model we adopt is similarto those used in earlier semi-analytical studies, except that we consider theeffect of a prolonged cooling in small halos and that we explicitly follow thechemical enrichment in the interstellar medium. we use our model to makepredictions for the properties of the galaxy population at low redshift andcompare them with various current observations. we find that our modelpredictions can match the luminosity functions of galaxies in various wavebandsredder than the u-band. the shape of the luminosity function at bright end iswell reproduced if galaxy mergers are modeled with the merger trees of subhalosand the steep faint-end slope can be moderated if the gas cooling time inlow-mass halos is comparable to the age of the universe. the model withsubhalos resolved can reproduce the main features in the observed color bimodaldistribution, though it still predicts too many bright blue galaxies. the samemodel can also match the color-magnitude relation for elliptical galaxies inclusters, the metallicity-luminosity relation.

astro-ph;0410114	galaxy occupation statistics of dark matter haloes: observational  results	we study the occupation statistics of galaxies in dark matter haloes usinggalaxy groups identified from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey withthe halo-based group finder of yang et al. the occupation distribution isconsidered separately for early and late type galaxies, as well as in terms ofcentral and satellite galaxies. the mean luminosity of the central galaxiesscales with halo mass approximately as $l_c\propto m^{2/3}$ for haloes withmasses $m&lt;10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$, and as $l_c\propto m^{1/4}$ for more massivehaloes. the characteristic mass of $10^{13} h^{-1} \msun$ is consistent withthe mass scale where galaxy formation models suggest a transition fromefficient to inefficient cooling. another characteristic halo mass scale,$m\sim 10^{11} h^{-1}\msun$, which cannot be probed directly by our groups, isinferred from the conditional luminosity function (clf) that matches theobserved galaxy luminosity function and clustering. for a halo of given mass,the distribution of $l_c$ is rather narrow. the satellite galaxies are found tofollow a poissonian number distribution. the central galaxies in low-masshaloes are mostly late type galaxies, while those in massive haloes are almostall early types. we also measure the clf of galaxies in haloes of given mass.over the mass range that can be reliably probed with the present data ($13.3\lta {\rm log}[m/(h^{-1}\msun)] \lta 14.7$), the clf is reasonably well fit bya schechter function. contrary to recent claims based on semi-analytical modelsof galaxy formation, the presence of central galaxies does not show up as astrong peak at the bright end of the clf.

astro-ph;0412018	the galaxy dark matter connection	what galaxy lives in what halo? the answer to this simple question holdsimportant information regarding galaxy formation and evolution. we describe anew statistical technique to link galaxies to their dark matter haloes, orlight to mass, using the clustering properties of galaxies as function of theirluminosity. the galaxy-dark matter connection thus established, andparameterized through the conditional luminosity function, indicates thepresence of two characteristic scales in galaxy formation: one at ~10^{11}msun, where galaxy formation is most efficient, and another at ~10^{13} msun,where a transition occurs from systems dominated by one brightest, centralgalaxy to systems with several dominant galaxies of comparable luminosity. weshow that the relation between light and mass established from galaxyclustering alone is in excellent agreement with the dynamical masses inferredfrom satellite kinematics. we also present a new (halo-based) galaxy-groupfinder, and show that the multiplicity function of galaxy groups identified inthe 2dfgrs suggests a relatively high mass-to-light ratio on the scales ofgalaxy clusters, or, alternatively, a relatively low value of sigma_8. thesefindings are also supported by our studies of pairwise peculiar velocities andsatellite abundances.

astro-ph;0502466	the phase-space parameters of brightest halo galaxies	the brightest galaxy in a dark matter halo is expected to reside at rest atthe center of the halo. in this paper we test this `central galaxy paradigm'using group catalogues extracted from the 2dfgrs and the sdss. for each groupwe compute a parameter, r, defined as the difference between the velocity ofthe brightest group galaxy and the average velocity of the other group members(hereafter satellites), normalized by the unbiased estimator of the velocitydispersion of the satellite galaxies. using detailed mock galaxy redshiftsurveys, we show that the central galaxy paradigm is inconsistent with the dataat high confidence, and that instead the brightest halo galaxies have aspecific kinetic energy that is about 25 percent of that of the satellites.this indicates that either central galaxies reside at the minimum of the darkmatter potential, but that the halo itself is not yet fully relaxed, or, thatthe halo is relaxed, but that the central galaxy oscillates in its potentialwell. the former is consistent with the fact that we find a weak hint that thevelocity bias of brightest halo galaxies is larger in more massive haloes,while the latter may be indicative of cored, rather than cusped, dark matterhaloes. we discuss several implications of these findings, including massestimates based on satellite kinematics, strong gravitational lensing, halooccupation models, and the frequency and longevity of lopsidedness in diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0504477	the cross-correlation between galaxies and groups: probing the galaxy  distribution in and around dark matter haloes	we determine the cross-correlation function between galaxies and galaxygroups, using both the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we study the cross-correlation as a functionof group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. all thesecross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups inconsideration. on scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlationfunctions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. inparticular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massivegroups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. in the `1-halo' regime, thecross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the groupcenter. we consider both a luminosity-weighted center (lwc) and a centerdefined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (bgc). with the firstdefinition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to bemore centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. using thebgc, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, weonly find significant segregation in massive groups ($m \gta10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours orspecific star formation rates). in haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. comparing theresults from the 2dfgrs with those obtained from realistic mock samples, wefind that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated thandark matter haloes predicted by the current $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;0506516	preheating by previrialization and its impact on galaxy formation	we use recent observations of the hi-mass function to constrain galaxyformation. the data conflicts with the standard model where most of the gas ina low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas thatis depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the diskbecomes gravitationally stable. a consistent model can be found if low-masshaloes are embedded in a preheated medium, with a specific gas entropy ~ 10kevcm^2. such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxyluminosity function. we propose a preheating model where the medium aroundlow-mass haloes is preheated by gravitational pancaking. since gravitationaltidal fields suppress the formation of low-mass haloes while promoting that ofpancakes, the formation of massive pancakes precedes that of the low-masshaloes within them. we demonstrate that the progenitors of present-day darkmatter haloes with m&lt;10^{12}h^{-1}\msun were embedded in pancakes of masses$~5x10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$ at z~2. the formation of such pancakes heats the gas toa temperature of 5x10^5k and compresses it to an overdensity of ~10. such gashas a cooling time that exceeds the age of the universe at z~2, and has aspecific entropy of ~15kev cm^2, almost exactly the amount required to explainthe stellar and hi mass functions.

astro-ph;0508624	on the origin of cold dark matter halo density profiles	n-body simulations predict that cdm halo-assembly occurs in two phases: 1) afast accretion phase with a rapidly deepening potential well; and 2) a slowaccretion phase characterised by a gentle addition of mass to the outer halowith little change in the inner potential well. we demonstrate, usingone-dimensional simulations, that this two-phase accretion leads to cdm halosof the nfw form and provides physical insight into the properties of the massaccretion history that influence the final profile. assuming that thevelocities of cdm particles are effectively isotropised by fluctuations in thegravitational potential during the fast accretion phase, we show thatgravitational collapse in this phase leads to an inner profile rho(r) ~ r^{-1}.slow accretion onto an established potential well leads to an outer profilewith rho(r) ~ r^{-3}. the concentration of a halo is determined by the fractionof mass that is accreted during the fast accretion phase. using an ensemble ofrealistic mass accretion histories, we show that the model predictions of thedependence of halo concentration on halo formation time, and hence thedependence of halo concentration on halo mass, and the distribution of haloconcentrations all match those found in cosmological n-body simulations. usinga simple analytic model that captures much of the important physics we showthat the inner r^{-1} profile of cdm halos is a natural result of hierarchicalmass assembly with a initial phase of rapid accretion.

astro-ph;0509147	properties of galaxy groups in the sdss: i.-- the dependence of colour,  star formation, and morphology on halo mass	using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sdss, weinvestigate the correlation between various galaxy properties and halo mass. wesplit the population of galaxies in early types, late types, and intermediatetypes, based on their colour and specific star formation rate. at fixedluminosity, the early type fraction increases with increasing halo mass. mostimportantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire massrange probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. we argue that theprevious claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is anartefact of the environment estimators used. at fixed halo mass, the luminositydependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends morestrongly on halo mass than on luminosity. we also find that the early typefraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. contrary to previousstudies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low masshaloes. the properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with thoseof their central galaxy. in particular, the early type fraction of satellitesis significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in ahalo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. this phenomenon,which we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and forsatellites of all luminosities. finally, the fraction of intermediate typegalaxies is always ~20 percent, independent of luminosity, independent of halomass, independent of halo-centric radius, and independent of whether the galaxyis a central galaxy or a satellite galaxy. we discuss the implications of allthese findings for galaxy formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0511365	an excursion set model of the cosmic web: the abundance of sheets,  filaments and halos	we discuss an analytic approach for modeling structure formation in sheets,filaments and knots. this is accomplished by combining models of triaxialcollapse with the excursion set approach: sheets are defined as objects whichhave collapsed along only one axis, filaments have collapsed along two axes,and halos are objects in which triaxial collapse is complete. in the simplestversion of this approach, which we develop here, large scale structure shows aclear hierarchy of morphologies: the mass in large-scale sheets is partitionedup among lower mass filaments, which themselves are made-up of still lower masshalos. our approach provides analytic estimates of the mass fraction in sheets,filaments and halos, and its evolution, for any background cosmological modeland any initial fluctuation spectrum. in the currently popular $\lambda$cdmmodel, our analysis suggests that more than 99% of the cosmic mass is insheets, and 72% in filaments, with mass larger than $10^{10} m_{\odot}$ at thepresent time. for halos, this number is only 46%. our approach also providesanalytic estimates of how halo abundances at any given time correlate with themorphology of the surrounding large-scale structure, and how halo evolutioncorrelates with the morphology of large scale structure.

astro-ph;0512645	the soft x-ray properties of quasars in the sloan digital sky survey	we use the rosat all sky survey (rass) to study the soft x-ray properties ofa homogeneous sample of 46,420 quasars selected from the third data release ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). optical luminosities, both at rest-frame2500\aa ($l_{2500}$) and in [oiii] ($l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$) span more than threeorders of magnitude, while redshifts range over $0.1&lt;z&lt;5.4$. we detect 3366quasars directly in the observed 0.1--2.4 kev band. sub-samples of radio-loudand radio-quiet objects (rlqs and rqqs) are obtained by cross-matching with thefirst catalogue. we study the distribution of x-ray luminosity as a function ofoptical luminosity, redshift and radio power using both individual detectionsand stacks of complete sets of similar quasars. at every optical luminosity andredshift $\log l_{2\kev}$ is, to a good approximation, normally distributedwith dispersion $\sim 0.40$, at least brightwards of the median x-rayluminosity. this median x-ray luminosity of quasars is a power law of opticalluminosity with index $\sim 0.53$ for $l_{2500}$ and $\sim 0.30$ for$l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$. rlqs are systematically brighter than rqqs by about a factorof 2 at given optical luminosity. the zero-points of these relations increasesystematically with redshift, possibly in different ways for rlqs and rqqs.evolution is particularly strong at low redshift and if the optical luminosityis characterised by $l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$. at low redshift and at given$l_{[\rm{oiii}]}$ the soft x-ray emission from type ii agn is more than 100times weaker than that from type i agn.

astro-ph;0604587	dark matter halo response to the disk growth	we consider the sensitivity of the circular-orbit adiabatic contractionapproximation to the baryon condensation rate and the orbital structure of darkmatter halos in the $\lambda$cdm paradigm. using one-dimensional hydrodynamicsimulations including the dark matter halo mass accretion history and gascooling, we demonstrate that the adiabatic approximation is approximately valideven though halos and disks may assemble simultaneously. we further demonstratethe validity of the simple approximation for $\lambda$cdm halos with isotropicvelocity distributions using three-dimensional n-body simulations. this resultis easily understood: an isotropic velocity distribution in a cuspy halorequires more circular orbits than radial orbits. conversely, the approximationis poor in the extreme case of a radial orbit halo. it overestimates theresponse a core dark matter halo, where radial orbit fraction is larger.because no astronomically relevant models are dominated by low-angular momentumorbits in the vicinity of the disk and the growth time scale is never shorterthan a dynamical time, we conclude that the adiabatic contraction approximationis useful in modeling the response of dark matter halos to the growth of adisk.

astro-ph;0606458	properties of galaxy groups in the sdss: ii.- agn feedback and star  formation truncation	successfully reproducing the galaxy luminosity function and the bimodality inthe galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that can truncate star formationin massive haloes. current models of galaxy formation consider two suchtruncation mechanisms: strangulation, which acts on satellite galaxies, and agnfeedback, which predominantly affects central galaxies. the efficiencies ofthese processes set the blue fraction of galaxies as function of galaxyluminosity and halo mass. in this paper we use a galaxy group catalogueextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to determine thesefractions. to demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark forgalaxy formation models, we compare the results to the semi-analytical modelfor galaxy formation of croton et al. (2006). although this model accuratelyfits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape ofthe conditional luminosity function, there are significant discrepancies whenthe blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is comparedbetween the observations and the model. in particular, the model predicts (i)too many faint satellite galaxies in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction ofsatellites that is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of centrals that istoo high and with an inverted luminosity dependence. in the same order, weargue that these discrepancies owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in thesemi-analytical model, (ii) the oversimplified treatment of strangulation, and(iii) improper modeling of dust extinction and/or agn feedback. the datapresented here will prove useful to test and calibrate future models of galaxyformation and in particular to discriminate between various models for agnfeedback and other star formation truncation mechanisms.

astro-ph;0607552	weak lensing by galaxies in groups and clusters: i.--theoretical  expectations	galaxy-galaxy lensing is rapidly becoming one of the most promising means toaccurately measure the average relation between galaxy properties and halomass. in order to obtain a signal of sufficient signal-to-noise, one needs tostack many lens galaxies according to their property of interest, such asluminosity or stellar mass. since such a stack consists of both central andsatellite galaxies, which contribute very different lensing signals, theresulting shear measurements can be difficult to interpret. in the past,galaxy-galaxy lensing studies have either completely ignored this problem, haveapplied rough isolation criteria in an attempt to preferentially select`central' galaxies, or have tried to model the contribution of satellitesexplicitely. however, if one is able to {\it a priori} split the galaxypopulation in central and satellite galaxies, one can measure their lensingsignals separately. this not only allows a much cleaner measurement of therelation between halo mass and their galaxy populations, but also allows adirect measurement of the sub-halo masses around satellite galaxies. in thispaper, we use a realistic mock galaxy redshift survey to show that galaxygroups, properly selected from large galaxy surveys, can be used to accuratelysplit the galaxy population in centrals and satellites. stacking the resultingcentrals according to their group mass, estimated from the total groupluminosity, allows a remarkably accurate recovery of the masses and densityprofiles of their host haloes. in addition, stacking the correspondingsatellite galaxies according to their projected distance from the group centeryields a lensing signal that can be used to accurate measure the masses of bothsub-haloes and host haloes.

astro-ph;0608690	environmental dependence of cold dark matter halo formation	we use a high-resolution $n$-body simulation to study how the formation ofcold dark matter (cdm) halos is affected by their environments, and how suchenvironmental effects produce the age-dependence of halo clustering observed inrecent $n$-body simulations. we estimate, for each halo selected at redshift$z=0$, an `initial' mass $m_{\rm i}$ defined to be the mass enclosed by thelargest sphere which contains the initial barycenter of the halo particles andwithin which the mean linear density is equal to the critical value forspherical collapse at $z=0$. for halos of a given final mass, $m_{\rm h}$, theratio $m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm h}$ has large scatter, and the scatter is larger forhalos of lower final masses. halos that form earlier on average have larger$m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm h}$, and so correspond to higher peaks in the initial densityfield than their final masses imply. old halos are more strongly clustered thanyounger ones of the same mass because their initial masses are larger. theage-dependence of clustering for low-mass halos is entirely due to thedifference in the initial/final mass ratio. low-mass old halos are almostalways located in the vicinity of big structures, and their old ages arelargely due to the fact that their mass accretions are suppressed by the hotenvironments produced by the tidal fields of the larger structure. theage-dependence of clustering is weaker for more massive halos because theheating by large-scale tidal fields is less important.

astro-ph;0609640	the accretion and cooling of preheated gas in dark matter halos	(abridged) we use a one-dimensional hydrodynamical code to investigate theeffects of preheating on gas accretion and cooling in cold dark matter halos.in the absence of radiative cooling, preheating reduces the amount of gas thatcan be accreted into a halo, and the accreted gas fraction is determined by theratio of the initial specific entropy of the gas to the virial entropy of thehalo. in the presence of radiative cooling, preheating affects the gas fractionthat can cool in two different ways. for small halos with masses &lt;10^12msun,preheating suppresses gas accretion, but most of the accreted gas can cool. formore massive halos, preheating not only reduces the amount of accreted gas, butalso reduces the cooling efficiency. for both small and massive halos, gascooling is delayed by preheating and in an inside-out fashion if the halo gasis assumed to be a single-phase medium. however, cooling can occur over a widerrange of redshifts and radii, if we assume a multi-phase medium. as examples,two specific preheating cases are investigated. in the first case, thepreheating entropy is assumed to be proportional to the virial entropy of thehalo, as expected from agn feedback. such preheating effectively suppressesradiative cooling in halos with m&gt;10^13msun. we suggest that this may be thereason why the stellar mass function of galaxies breaks sharply at the massiveend. such preheating also helps create the hot diffused halos within which the"radio mode" feedback of agns can act effectively. in the second case, weassume the intergalactic medium is warm. here the total amount of gas that cancool in a halo scales with halo mass as ~m^2, as would be required to match theobserved stellar- and hi-mass functions in the current cdm model at the smallmass end.

astro-ph;0611714	inclination-dependent luminosity function of spiral galaxies in the  sloan digital sky survey: implication for dust extinction	using a samples of 61506 spiral galaxies selected from the sdss dr2, weexamine the luminosity function (lf) of spiral galaxies with differentinclination angles. we find that the characteristic luminosity of the lf,$l^*$, decreases with increasing inclination, while the faint-end slope,$\alpha$, depends only weakly on it. the inclination-dependence of the lf isconsistent with that expected from a simple model where the optical depth isproportional to the cosine of the inclination angle, and we use a likelihoodmethod to recover both the coefficient in front of the cosine, $\gamma$, andthe lf for galaxies viewed face-on. the value of $\gamma$ is quite independentof galaxy luminosity in a given band, and the values of $\gamma$ obtained inthis way for the 5 sdss bands give an extinction curve which is a power law ofwavelength ($\tau\propto\lambda^{-n}$), with a power index $n=0.96\pm0.04$.using the dust extinction for galaxies obtained by kauffmann et al. (2003), wederive an `extinction-corrected' luminosity function for spiral galaxies. dustextinction makes $m^*$ dimmer by about 0.5 magnitudes in the $z$-band, andabout 1.2 magnitudes in the $u$- band. since our analysis is based on a samplewhere selection effects are well under control, the dimming of edge-on galaxiesrelative to face-on galaxies is best explained by assuming that galaxy disksare optically thick in dust absorptions.

astro-ph;0701130	the alignment between satellites and central galaxies: theory vs.  observations	recent studies have shown that the distribution of satellite galaxies ispreferentially aligned with the major axis of their central galaxy. thestrength of this alignment has been found to depend strongly on the colours ofthe satellite and central galaxies, and only weakly on the mass of the halo inwhich the galaxies reside. in this paper we study whether these alignmentsignals, and their dependence on galaxy and halo properties, can be reproducedin a hierarchical structure formation model of a $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. to that extent we use a large $n$-body simulation which we populatewith galaxies following a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. we findthat if the orientation of the central galaxy is perfectly aligned with that ofits dark matter halo, then the predicted central-satellite alignment signal ismuch stronger than observed. if, however, the minor axis of a central galaxy isperfectly aligned with the angular momentum vector of its dark matter halo, wecan accurately reproduce the observed alignment strength as function of halomass and galaxy color. although this suggests that the orientation of centralgalaxies is governed by the angular momentum of their dark matter haloes, weemphasize that any other scenario in which the minor axes of central galaxy andhalo are misaligned by $\sim 40^{\circ}$ (on average) will match the dataequally well. finally, we show that dependence of the alignment strength on thecolor of the central galaxy is most likely an artefact due to interlopers inthe group catalogue. the dependence on the color of the satellite galaxies, onthe other hand, is real and owes to the fact that red satellites are associatedwith subhaloes that were more massive at their time of accretion.

astro-ph;0703253	the cross-correlation between galaxies of different luminosities and  colors	we study the cross-correlation between galaxies of different luminosities andcolors, using a sample selected from the sdss dr 4. galaxies are divided into 6samples according to luminosity, and each of these samples is divided into redand blue subsamples. projected auto-correlation and cross-correlation isestimated for these subsample. at projected separations r_p &gt; 1\mpch, allcorrelation functions are roughly parallel, although the correlation amplitudedepends systematically on luminosity and color. on r_p &lt; 1\mpch, the auto- andcross-correlation functions of red galaxies are significantly enhanced relativeto the corresponding power laws obtained on larger scales. such enhancement isabsent for blue galaxies and in the cross-correlation between red and bluegalaxies. we esimate the relative bias factor on scales r &gt; 1\mpch for eachsubsample using its auto-correlation function and cross-correlation functions.the relative bias factors obtained from different methods are similar. for bluegalaxies the luminosity-dependence of the relative bias is strong over theluminosity range probed (-23.0&lt;m_r &lt; -18.0),but for red galaxies the dependenceis weaker and becomes insignificant for luminosities below l^*. to examinewhether a significant stochastic/nonlinear component exists in the biasrelation, we study the ratio r_ij= w_{ii}w_{jj}/w_{ij}^2, where w_{ij} is theprojected correlation between subsample i and j. we find that the values ofr_ij are all consistent with 1 for all-all, red-red and blue-blue samples,however significantly larger than 1 for red-blue samples. for faint red - faintblue samples the values of r_{ij} are as high as ~ 2 on small scales r_p &lt; 1\mpch and decrease with increasing r_p.

astro-ph;9412088	an analytic model for the gravitational clustering of dark matter haloes	we develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of darkhaloes. the statistical properties of dark haloes are determined from theinitial density field (assumed to be gaussian) through an extension of thepress-schechter formalism. gravitational clustering is treated by a sphericalmodel which describes the concentration of dark haloes in collapsing regions.we test this model against results from a variety of n-body simulations. theautocorrelation function of dark haloes in such simulations dependssignificantly on how haloes are identified. our predictions agree well withresults based on algorithms which break clusters into subgroups moreefficiently than the standard friends-of-friends algorithm. the agreement isbetter than that found by assuming haloes to lie at the present positions ofpeaks of the linear density field. we use these techniques to study how thedistribution of haloes is biased with respect to that of the mass. the initial(lagrangian) positions of haloes identified at a given redshift and havingcircular velocities $v_c=v_c^*(z)$ (i.e. mass equal to the characteristicnonlinear mass $m^*$ at that redshift) are very weakly correlated with thelinear density field or among themselves. as a result of dynamical evolution,however, the present-day correlations of these haloes are similar to those ofthe mass. haloes with lower $v_c$ are biased toward regions with negativeoverdensity, while those with higher $v_c$ are biased toward regions withpositive overdensity. among the haloes identified at any given epoch, thosewith higher circular velocities are more strongly correlated today. among thehaloes of given circular velocity, those at higher redshifts are also morestrongly clustered today. in the ``standard cdm'' model, haloes with

astro-ph;9512127	an analytic model for the spatial clustering of dark matter haloes	we develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of darkmatter haloes to understand how their spatial distribution is biased relativeto that of the mass. the statistical distribution of dark haloes within theinitial density field (assumed gaussian) is determined by an extension of thepress-schechter formalism. modifications of this distribution caused bygravitationally induced motions are treated using a spherical collapseapproximation. we test this model against results from a variety of n-bodysimulations, and find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function.this bias function is sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation betweendark haloes and mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulationresults and analytic predictions. because haloes are spatially exclusive, thevariance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and overdensityis significantly smaller than the poisson value. this seriously complicates anyanalytic calculation of the autocorrelation function of dark halos. oursimulation results show that this autocorrelation function is proportional tothat of the mass over a wide range in $r$, even including scales where bothfunctions are significantly greater than unity. the constant of proportionalityis very close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. thisresult permits an entirely analytic estimate of the autocorrelation function ofdark haloes. we use our model to study how the distribution of galaxies may bebiased with respect to that of the mass. in conjunction with other data thesetechniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic massfluctuations and the density of the universe.

astro-ph;9602052	the correlation function of clusters of galaxies and the amplitude of  mass fluctuations in the universe	we show that if a sample of galaxy clusters is complete above some massthreshold, then hierarchical clustering theories for structure formationpredict its autocorrelation function to be determined purely by the clusterabundance and by the spectrum of linear density fluctuations. thus if the shapeof the initial fluctuation spectrum is known, its amplitude $\sigma_8$ can beestimated directly from the correlation length of a cluster sample in a waywhich is independent of the value of $\omega_0$. if the cluster masscorresponding to the sample threshold is also known, it provides an independentestimate of the quantity $\sigma_8\omega_0^{0.6}$. thus cluster data shouldallow both $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_0$ to be determined observationally. weexplore these questions using n-body simulations together with a simple butaccurate analytical model based on extensions of press-schechter theory.applying our results to currently available data we find that if the linearfluctuation spectrum has a shape similar to that suggested by the apm galaxysurvey, then a correlation length $r_0$ in excess of $20\mpch$ for abellclusters would require $\sigma_8&gt;1$, while $r_0&lt;15\mpch$ would require$\sigma_8&lt;0.5$. with conventional estimates of the relevant mass thresholdthese imply $\omega_0\la 0.3$ and $\omega_0\ga 1$ respectively.

astro-ph;9707344	on the physical connections between galaxies of different types	galaxies can be classified in two broad sequences which are likely to reflecttheir formation mechanism. the `main sequence', consisting of spirals,irregulars and all dwarf galaxies, is probably produced by gas settling withindark matter haloes. we show that the sizes and surface densities along thissequence are primarily determined by the distributions of the angular momentumand formation time of dark haloes. they are well reproduced by currentcosmogonies provided that galaxies form late, at $z \la 2$. in this scenario,dwarf ellipticals were small `disks' at $z\sim 1$ and become `ellipticals'after they fall into cluster environments. the strong clustering of dwarfellipticals is then a natural by-product of the merging and transformationprocess. the number of dwarf galaxies predicted in a cluster such as virgo isin good agreement with the observed number. on the other hand, the `giantbranch', consisting of giant ellipticals and bulges, is probably produced bythe merging of disk galaxies. based on the observed phase-space densities ofgalaxies, we show that the main bodies of all giant ellipticals can be producedby dissipationless mergers of high-redshift disks. however, high-redshiftdisks, although denser than present-day ones, are still not compact enough toproduce the high central phase space density of some low-luminosityellipticals. dissipation must have occurred in the central parts of thesegalaxies during the merger which formed them.

astro-ph;9807341	the structure and clustering of lyman break galaxies	the number density and clustering properties of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs)are consistent with them being the central galaxies of the most massive darkhalos present at z~3. this conclusion holds in all currently popularhierarchical models for structure formation, and is almost independent of theglobal cosmological parameters. we examine whether the sizes, luminosities,kinematics and star-formation rates of lbgs are also consistent with thisidentification. simple formation models tuned to give good fits to low redshiftgalaxies can predict the distribution of these quantities in the lbgpopulation. the lbgs should be small (with typical half-light radii of 0.6-2kpc/h), should inhabit haloes of moderately high circular velocity (180-290km/s) but have low stellar velocity dispersions (70-120 km/s) and should havesubstantial star formation rates (15-100 msun/yr). the numbers here refer tothe predicted median values in the lbg sample of adelberger et al. (1998); thefirst assumes an omega=1 universe and the second a flat universe withomega=0.3. for either cosmology these predictions are consistent with thecurrent (rather limited) observational data. following the work of kennicutt(1998) we assume stars to form more rapidly in gas of higher surface density.this predicts that lbg samples should preferentially contain objects with lowangular momentum, and so small size, for their mass. in contrast, samples ofdamped lyman alpha systems (dlss), should be biased towards objects with largeangular momentum. bright lbgs and dlss may therefore form distinct populations,with very different sizes and star formation rates, lbgs being smaller and moremetal-rich than dlss of similar mass and redshift.

astro-ph;9907024	ellipsoidal collapse and an improved model for the number and spatial  distribution of dark matter haloes	the press--schechter, excursion set approach allows one to make predictionsabout the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. itcombines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumptionthat the initial density fluctuations were gaussian and small. while thepredicted mass function is reasonably accurate at the high mass end, it hasmore low mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering.this discrepancy can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumedto form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical collapse. in the sphericalmodel, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a thresholdvalue, delta_sc. this value is independent of the initial size of the region,and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size,delta_sc is independent of final mass. in the ellipsoidal model, the collapseof a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initialoverdensity. therefore, there is a relation between the density threshold valuerequired for collapse, and the mass of the final object. we provide a fittingfunction to this delta_ec(m) relation for initially gaussian fields whichsimplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach.we discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halodistribution in high resolution n-body simulations, and show that our simpleparametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents a significantimprovement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. finally, weshow that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and thelarge scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than thestandard predictions.

0706.0262	spatial and kinematic alignments between central and satellite halos	based on a cosmological n-body simulation we analyze spatial and kinematicalignments of satellite halos within six times the virial radius of group sizehost halos (rvir). we measure three different types of spatial alignment: haloalignment between the orientation of the group central substructure (gcs) andthe distribution of its satellites, radial alignment between the orientation ofa satellite and the direction towards its gcs, and direct alignment between theorientation of the gcs and that of its satellites. in analogy we use thedirections of satellite velocities and probe three further types of alignment:the radial velocity alignment between the satellite velocity and connectingline between satellite and gcs, the halo velocity alignment between theorientation of the gcs and satellite velocities and the auto velocity alignmentbetween the satellites orientations and their velocities. we find thatsatellites are preferentially located along the major axis of the gcs within atleast 6 rvir (the range probed here). furthermore, satellites preferentiallypoint towards the gcs. the most pronounced signal is detected on small scalesbut a detectable signal extends out to 6 rvir. the direct alignment signal isweaker, however a systematic trend is visible at distances &lt; 2 rvir. allvelocity alignments are highly significant on small scales. our results suggestthat the halo alignment reflects the filamentary large scale structure whichextends far beyond the virial radii of the groups. in contrast, the maincontribution to the radial alignment arises from the adjustment of thesatellite orientations in the group tidal field. the projected data reveal goodagreement with recent results derived from large galaxy surveys.

0811.0828	accurate universal models for the mass accretion histories and  concentrations of dark matter halos	a large amount of observations have constrained cosmological parameters andthe initial density fluctuation spectrum to a very high accuracy. however,cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of the powerspectrum varies with mass scale dramatically in the so-called concordancelambda cdm cosmology. thus, any successful model for its structural evolutionshould work well simultaneously for various cosmological models and differentpower spectra. we use a large set of high-resolution n-body simulations of avariety of structure formation models (scale-free, standard cdm, open cdm, andlambda cdm) to study the mass accretion histories (mahs), the mass and redshiftdependence of concentrations and the concentration evolution histories of darkmatter halos. we find that there is significant disagreement between themuch-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. according totwo simple but tight correlations we find from the simulation results, wedevelop new empirical models for both the mahs and the concentration evolutionhistories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to predict themass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. these models are accurateand universal: the same set of model parameters works well for differentcosmological models and for halos of different masses at different redshiftsand the model predictions are highly accurate even when the histories aretraced to very high redshift. these models are also simple and easy toimplement. a web calculator and a user-friendly code to make the relevantcalculations are available from http://www.shao.ac.cn/dhzhao/mandc.html . weexplain why lambda cdm halos on nearly all mass scales show two distinct phasesin their evolution histories.

0811.3558	the distribution of ejected subhalos and its implication for halo  assembly bias	using a high-resolution cosmological $n$-body simulation, we identify theejected population of subhalos, which are halos at redshift $z=0$ but were oncecontained in more massive `host' halos at high redshifts. the fraction of theejected subhalos in the total halo population of the same mass ranges from 9%to 4% for halo masses from $\sim 10^{11}$ to $\sim 10^{12}\msun$. most of theejected subhalos are distributed within 4 times the virial radius of theirhosts. these ejected subhalos have distinct velocity distribution around theirhosts in comparison to normal halos. the number of subhalos ejected from a hostof given mass increases with the assembly redshift of the host. ejectedsubhalos in general reside in high-density regions, and have a much higher biasparameter than normal halos of the same mass. they also have earlier assemblytimes, so that they contribute to the assembly bias of dark matter halos seenin cosmological simulations. however, the assembly bias is {\it not} dominatedby the ejected population, indicating that large-scale environmental effects onnormal halos are the main source for the assembly bias.

0812.3723	the nature of red dwarf galaxies	using dark matter halos traced by galaxy groups selected from the sloandigital sky survey data release 4, we find that about 1/4 of the faint galaxies($\rmag &gt;-17.05$, hereafter dwarfs) that are the central galaxies in their ownhalo are not blue and star forming, as expected in standard models of galaxyformation, but are red. in contrast, this fraction is about 1/2 for dwarfsatellite galaxies. many red dwarf galaxies are physically associated with moremassive halos. in total, about $\sim 45$% of red dwarf galaxies reside inmassive halos as satellites, while another $\sim 25$% have a spatialdistribution that is much more concentrated towards their nearest massivehaloes than other dwarf galaxies. we use mock catalogs to show that the reddestpopulation of non-satellite dwarf galaxies are distributed within about 3 timesthe virial radii of their nearest massive halos. we suggest that thispopulation of dwarf galaxies are hosted by low-mass halos that have passedthrough their massive neighbors, and that the same environmental effects thatcause satellite galaxies to become red are also responsible for the red colorsof this population of galaxies. we do not find any significant radialdependence of the population of dwarf galaxies with the highest concentrations,suggesting that the mechanisms operating on these galaxies affect color morethan structure. however, over 30% of dwarf galaxies are red and isolated andtheir origin remains unknown.
