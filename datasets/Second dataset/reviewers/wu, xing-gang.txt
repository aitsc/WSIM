0707.2504	$b\to k$ transition form factor up to ${\cal o}(1/m^2_b)$ within the  $k_t$ factorization approach	in the paper, we apply the $k_t$ factorization approach to deal with the$b\to k$ transition form factor $f^{b\to k}_{+,0}(q^2)$ in the large recoilregions. the b-meson wave functions $\psi_b$ and $\bar\psi_b$ that include thethree-particle fock states' contributions are adopted to give a consistent pqcdanalysis of the form factor up to ${\cal o} (1/m^2_b)$. it has been found thatboth the wave functions $\psi_b$ and $\bar\psi_b$ can give sizablecontributions to the form factor and should be kept for a better understandingof the $b$ meson decays. then the contributions from different twist structuresof the kaon wavefunction are discussed, including the $su_f(3)$-breakingeffects. a sizable contribution from the twist-3 wave function $\psi_p$ isfound, whose model dependence is discussed by taking two group of parametersthat are determined by different distribution amplitude moments obtained in theliterature. it is also shown that $f^{b\to k}_{+,0}(0)=0.30\pm0.04$ and$[f^{b\to k}_{+,0}(0)/f^{b\to \pi}_{+,0}(0)]=1.13\pm0.02$, which are morereasonable and consistent with the light-cone sum rule results in the largerecoil regions.

1111.6175	scale setting using the extended renormalization group and the principle  of maximum conformality: the qcd coupling constant at four loops	a key problem in making precise perturbative qcd predictions is to set theproper renormalization scale of the running coupling. the extendedrenormalization group equations, which express the invariance of physicalobservables under both the renormalization scale- and scheme-parametertransformations, provide a convenient way for estimating the scale- andscheme-dependence of the physical process. in this paper, we present a solutionfor the scale-equation of the extended renormalization group equations at thefour-loop level. using the principle of maximum conformality (pmc) /brodsky-lepage-mackenzie (blm) scale-setting method, all non-conformal$\{\beta_i\}$ terms in the perturbative expansion series can be summed into therunning coupling, and the resulting scale-fixed predictions are independent ofthe renormalization scheme. different schemes lead to different effectivepmc/blm scales, but the final results are scheme independent. conversely, fromthe requirement of scheme independence, one not only can obtainscheme-independent commensurate scale relations among different observables,but also determine the scale displacements among the pmc/blm scales which arederived under different schemes. in principle, the pmc/blm scales can be fixedorder-by-order, and as a useful reference, we present a systematic andscheme-independent procedure for setting pmc/blm scales up to nnlo. an explicitapplication for determining the scale setting of $r_{e^{+}e^-}(q)$ up to fourloops is presented. by using the world average $\alpha^{\bar{ms}}_s(m_z)=0.1184 \pm 0.0007$, we obtain the asymptotic scale for the 't hooft associatedwith the $\bar{ms}$ scheme, $\lambda^{'th}_{\bar{ms}}= 245^{+9}_{-10}$ mev, andthe asymptotic scale for the conventional $\bar{ms}$ scheme,$\lambda_{\bar{ms}}= 213^{+19}_{-8}$ mev.

1203.5312	eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity for top-pair production  using the principle of maximum conformality	it is conventional to choose a typical momentum transfer of the process asthe renormalization scale and take an arbitrary range to estimate theuncertainty in the qcd prediction. however, predictions using this proceduredepend on the renormalization scheme, leave a non-convergent renormalonperturbative series, and moreover, one obtains incorrect results when appliedto qed processes. in contrast, if one fixes the renormalization scale using theprinciple of maximum conformality (pmc), all non-conformal $\{\beta_i\}$-termsin the perturbative expansion series are summed into the running coupling, andone obtains a unique, scale-fixed, scheme-independent prediction at any finiteorder. the pmc scale $\mu^{\rm pmc}_r$ and the resulting finite-order pmcprediction are both to high accuracy independent of the choice of initialrenormalization scale $\mu^{\rm init}_r$, consistent with renormalization groupinvariance. as an application, we apply the pmc procedure to obtain nnlopredictions for the $t\bar{t}$-pair production at the tevatron and lhccolliders. the pmc prediction for the total cross-section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$agrees well with the present tevatron and lhc data. we also verify that theinitial scale-independence of the pmc prediction is satisfied to high accuracyat the nnlo level: the total cross-section remains almost unchanged even whentaking very disparate initial scales $\mu^{\rm init}_r$ equal to $m_t$,$20\,m_t$, $\sqrt{s}$. moreover, after pmc scale setting, we obtain$a_{fb}^{t\bar{t}} \simeq 12.5%$, $a_{fb}^{p\bar{p}} \simeq 8.28%$ and$a_{fb}^{t\bar{t}}(m_{t\bar{t}}&gt;450 \;{\rm gev}) \simeq 35.0%$. thesepredictions have a $1\,\sigma$-deviation from the present cdf and d0measurements; the large discrepancy of the top quark forward-backward asymmetrybetween the standard model estimate and the data are thus greatly reduced.

1204.1405	application of the principle of maximum conformality to top-pair  production	a major contribution to the uncertainty of finite-order perturbative qcdpredictions is the perceived ambiguity in setting the renormalization scale$\mu_r$. for example, by using the conventional way of setting $\mu_r \in[m_t/2,2m_t]$, one obtains the total $t \bar{t}$ production cross-section$\sigma_{t \bar{t}}$ with the uncertainty $\delta \sigma_{t \bar{t}}/\sigma_{t\bar{t}}\sim ({}^{+3%}_{-4%})$ at the tevatron and lhc even for the presentnnlo level. the principle of maximum conformality (pmc) eliminates therenormalization scale ambiguity in precision tests of abelian qed andnon-abelian qcd theories. in this paper we apply pmc scale-setting to predictthe $t \bar t$ cross-section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ at the tevatron and lhccolliders. it is found that $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ remains almost unchanged byvarying $\mu^{\rm init}_r$ within the region of $[m_t/4,4m_t]$. the convergenceof the expansion series is greatly improved. for the $(q\bar{q})$-channel,which is dominant at the tevatron, its nlo pmc scale is much smaller than thetop-quark mass in the small $x$-region, and thus its nlo cross-section isincreased by about a factor of two. in the case of the $(gg)$-channel, which isdominant at the lhc, its nlo pmc scale slightly increases with the subprocesscollision energy $\sqrt{s}$, but it is still smaller than $m_t$ for$\sqrt{s}\lesssim 1$ tev, and the resulting nlo cross-section is increased by$\sim 20%$. as a result, a larger $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ is obtained in comparisonto the conventional scale-setting method, which agrees well with the presenttevatron and lhc data. more explicitly, by setting $m_t=172.9\pm 1.1$ gev, wepredict $\sigma_{\rm tevatron,\;1.96\,tev} = 7.626^{+0.265}_{-0.257}$ pb,$\sigma_{\rm lhc,\;7\,tev} = 171.8^{+5.8}_{-5.6}$ pb and $\sigma_{\rmlhc,\;14\,tev} = 941.3^{+28.4}_{-26.5}$ pb.

1205.1232	application of the principle of maximum conformality to the top-quark  forward-backward asymmetry at the tevatron	the renormalization scale uncertainty can be eliminated by the principle ofmaximum conformality (pmc) in a systematic scheme-independent way. applying thepmc for the $t\bar{t}$-pair hadroproduction at the nnlo level, we have foundthat the total cross-sections $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ at both the tevatron and lhcremain almost unchanged when taking very disparate initial scales $\mu^{\rminit}_r$ equal to $m_t$, $10\,m_t$, $20\,m_t$ and $\sqrt{s}$, which isconsistent with renormalization group invariance. as an important newapplication, we apply pmc scale-setting to study the top-quark forward-backwardasymmetry. we observe that the more convergent perturbative series after pmcscale-setting leads to a more accurate top-quark forward-backward asymmetry.the resulting pmc prediction on the asymmetry is also free from the initialrenormalization scale-dependence. because the nlo pmc scale has a dip behaviorfor the $(q\bar{q})$-channel at small subprocess collision energies, theimportance of this channel to the asymmetry is increased. we observe that theasymmetries $a_{fb}^{t\bar{t}}$ and $a_{fb}^{p\bar{p}}$ at the tevatron will beincreased by 42% in comparison to the previous estimates obtained by usingconventional scale-setting; i.e. we obtain $a_{fb}^{t\bar{t},{\rm pmc}} \simeq12.5%$ and $a_{fb}^{p\bar{p},{\rm pmc}} \simeq 8.28%$. moreover, we obtain$a_{fb}^{t\bar{t},{\rm pmc}}(m_{t\bar{t}}&gt;450 \;{\rm gev}) \simeq 35.0%$. thesepredictions have a $1\sigma$-deviation from the present cdf and d0measurements; the large discrepancies of the top-quark forward-backwardasymmetry between the standard model estimate and the cdf and d0 data are thusgreatly reduced.

1305.7391	determination of the pion distribution amplitude	right now, we have not enough knowledge to determine the hadron distributionamplitudes (das) which are universal physical quantities in the high energyprocesses involving hadron for applying pqcd to exclusive processes. even forthe simplest pion, one can't discriminate from different da models. inversely,one expects that processes involving pion can in principle provide strongconstraints on the pion da. for example, the pion-photon transition form factor(tff) can get accurate information of the pion wave function or da, due to thesingle pion in this process. however, the data from belle and babar have a bigdifference on tff in high $q^2$ regions, at present, they are helpless fordetermining the pion da. at the present paper, we think it is still possible todetermine the pion da as long as we perform a combined analysis of the mostexisting data of the processes involving pion such as $\pi \to \mu \bar{\nu}$,$\pi^0 \to \gamma \gamma$, $b\to \pi l \nu$, $d \to \pi l \nu$, and etc. basedon the revised light-cone harmonic oscillator model, a convenient da model hasbeen suggested, whose parameter $b$ which dominates its longitudinal behaviorfor $\phi_{\pi}(x,\mu^2)$ can be determined in a definite range by thoseprocesses. a light-cone sum rule analysis of the semi-leptonic processes $b \to\pi l \nu$ and $d \to \pi l \nu$ leads to a narrow region $b = [0.01,0.14]$,which indicate a slight deviation from the asymptotic da. then, one can predictthe behavior of the pion-photon tff in high $q^2$ regions which can be testedin the future experiments. following this way it provides the possibility thatthe pion da will be determined by the global fit finally.

1401.6269	hadronic production of $\xi_{cc}$ at a fixed-target experiment at the  lhc	in the paper, we present a detailed discussion on the $\xi_{cc}$ productionat a fixed target experiment at the lhc (after@lhc). the doubly charmed baryon$\xi_{cc}$ is produced via the channel, ${\rm proton} + {\rmproton}\to\xi_{cc}+x$. in estimating its hadroproduction, we discuss threedominant subprocesses, e.g. $g+g\to \xi_{cc} +\bar{c} +\bar{c}$, $g+c\to\xi_{cc}+\bar{c}$ and $c+c\to \xi_{cc}+g$. during the production, it shallfirst generate a binding diquark and then form the $\xi_{cc}$ baryon bygrabbing soft light-quarks or gluons. we observe that both the two diquarkconfigurations $(cc)[^3s_1]_{\bf\bar 3}$ and $(cc)[^1s_0]_{\bf 6}$ can havesizable contributions to the $\xi_{cc}$ production. large number of $\xi_{cc}$events can be generated at the after@lhc, whose total production cross sectionis larger than that of the selex experiment by about thirty-five times. it mayalso possible to study the properties of $\xi_{bc}$ at the after@lhc. morespecifically, we shall have about $8.3 \times 10^6$ $\xi_{cc}$ events/year and$1.8 \times 10^4$ $\xi_{bc}$ events/year when its integrated luminosityapproaches to $2$ fb$^{-1}$/year. thus, in addition to selex and lhc, theafter@lhc shall provide another useful platform for studying the baryonproperties.

1405.3196	renormalization group invariance and optimal qcd renormalization  scale-setting	a valid prediction for a physical observable from quantum field theory shouldbe independent of the choice of renormalization scheme -- this is the primaryrequirement of renormalization group invariance (rgi). satisfying schemeinvariance is a challenging problem for perturbative qcd (pqcd), since atruncated perturbation series does not automatically satisfy the requirementsof the renormalization group. two distinct approaches for satisfying the rgiprinciple have been suggested in the literature. one is the "principle ofmaximum conformality" (pmc) in which the terms associated with the$\beta$-function are absorbed into the scale of the running coupling at eachperturbative order; its predictions are scheme and scale independent at everyfinite order. the other approach is the "principle of minimum sensitivity"(pms), which is based on local rgi; the pms approach determines the optimalrenormalization scale by requiring the slope of the approximant of anobservable to vanish. in this paper, we present a detailed comparison of thepmc and pms procedures by analyzing two physical observables $r_{e+e-}$ and$\gamma(h\to b\bar{b})$ up to four-loop order in pqcd. at the four-loop level,the pmc and pms predictions for both observables agree within small errors withthose of conventional scale setting assuming a physically-motivated scale, andeach prediction shows small scale dependences. however, the convergence of thepqcd series at high orders, behaves quite differently: the pmc displays thebest pqcd convergence since it eliminates divergent renormalon terms; incontrast, the convergence of the pms prediction is questionable, often evenworse than the conventional prediction based on an arbitrary guess for therenormalization scale. ......

1406.1852	reanalysis of the higher order perturbative qcd corrections to hadronic  $z$ decays using the principle of maximum conformality	a complete calculation of the ${\cal o}(\alpha_s^4)$ perturbative qcdcorrections to the hadronic decay width of the $z$-boson has recently beenperformed by baikov et al.[1]. in their analysis, baikov et al. relied on theconventional practice of simply guessing the renormalization scale and takingan arbitrary range to estimate the pqcd uncertainties. this procedureinevitably introduces an arbitrary, scheme-dependent theoretical systematicerror in the predictions. in this paper, we show that the renormalization scaleuncertainties for hadronic $z$ decays can be greatly reduced by applying theprinciple of maximum conformality (pmc), a rigorous extension of the blmmethod. the pmc prediction is independent of the choice of renormalizationscheme; i.e., it respects renormalization group invariance, and thus itprovides an optimal and theoretically rigorous method for setting therenormalization scale. we show that the convergence of the pqcd prediction forthe $z$ hadronic width is greatly improved using the pmc since the divergentrenormalon series does not appear. the magnitude of the high-order correctionsquickly approach a steady point. the pmc predictions also have the propertythat any residual dependence on the choice of initial scale is highlysuppressed, even for low-order predictions. thus, one obtains optimalfixed-order predictions for the $z$-boson hadronic decay rates thus enablinghigh precision tests of the standard model.

1406.3892	$b\to \rho$ transition form factors within the qcd light-cone sum rules  and the $\rho$-meson leading-twist distribution amplitude	the qcd light-cone sum rules (lcsr) provides an effective way for dealingwith the heavy-to-light transition form factors (tffs), whose non-perturbativedynamics are parameterized into the light-meson's light-cone distributionamplitudes (lcdas) with various twist structures. by taking the chiralcorrelator as the starting point, we calculate the lcsrs for the $b\to\rho$tffs up to twist-4 accuracy. as for the tffs at the large recoil region, weobserve that the twist-2 transverse da $\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$ provides thedominant contribution, while the contributions from the remaining twist-3 andtwist-4 terms are $\delta^2$-suppressed. thus, our present improved lcsrsprovides a good platform for testing the $\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$ behavior. for thepurpose, we suggest a convenient wh-model for the $\rho$-meson leading-twistwavefunction, in which the parameter $b_{2;\rho}^\bot\sim a^\bot_2$ dominantlycontrols its longitudinal distribution. typically, its da $\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$is cz-like as $b_{2;\rho}^\bot\simeq-0.20$, which changes to be asymptotic-likeas $b_{2;\rho}^\bot\simeq0.00$. by varying $b_{2;\rho}^\bot\in[-0.20,0.20]$, wepresent a detailed comparison of the lcsr estimation for the $b\to\rho$ tffswith those of pqcd and lattice qcd predictions. furthermore, by using theextrapolated tffs, we estimate the ckm-matrix element $|v_{\rm ub}|$ with thehelp of two $b\to\rho$ semi-leptonic decays. the predicted value for $|v_{\rmub}|$ increases with the increment of $b_{2;\rho}^\bot$, i.e. we have$\vub=(2.91\pm0.19)\times 10^{-3}$ for $b_{2;\rho}^\bot=-0.20$ and$\vub=(3.11\pm0.19)\times 10^{-3}$ for $b_{2;\rho}^\bot=0.00$. if using thebabar prediction as a criteria, we observe that$b^{\perp}_{2;\rho}\in[-0.2,0.10]$, which indicates that the $\rho$-meson da$\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$ prefers a single-peak behavior rather than a double-humpedbehavior.

1410.1607	application of the principle of maximum conformality to the top-quark  charge asymmetry at the lhc	the principle of maximum conformality (pmc) provides a systematic andprocess-independent method to derive renormalization scheme- and scale-independent fixed-order pqcd predictions. in ref.\cite{pmc3}, we studied thetop-quark charge asymmetry at the tevatron. by applying the pmc, we have shownthat the large discrepancies for the top-quark charge asymmetry between thestandard model estimate and the cdf and d0 data are greatly reduced. in thepresent paper, with the help of the bernreuther-si program, we present adetailed pmc analysis on the top-quark pair production up tonext-to-next-to-leading order level at the lhc. after applying pmc scalesetting, the pqcd prediction for the top-quark charge asymmetry at the lhc hasvery small scale uncertainty; e.g., $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 7 tev;pmc}=\left(1.15^{+0.01}_{-0.03}\right)\%$, $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 8 tev;pmc}=\left(1.03^{+0.01}_{+0.00}\right)\%$, and $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 14 tev;pmc}=\left(0.62^{+0.00}_{-0.02}\right)\%$. the corresponding predictions usingconventional scale setting are: $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 7 tev;conv.}=\left(1.23^{+0.14}_{-0.14}\right)\%$, $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 8 tev;conv.}=\left(1.11^{+0.17}_{-0.13}\right)\%$, and $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 14 tev;conv.}=\left(0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.05}\right)\%$. in these predictions, the scale errorsare predicted by varying the initial renormalization and factorization scalesin the ranges $\mu^{\rm init}_r\in[m_t/2,2m_t]$ and $\mu_f\in[m_t/2,2m_t]$. thepmc predictions are also in better agreement with the available atlas and cmsdata. in addition, we have calculated the top-quark charge asymmetry assumingseveral typical cuts on the top-pair invariant mass $m_{t\bar{t}}$. forexample, assuming $m_{t\bar{t}}&gt;0.5 ~ {\rm tev}$ and $\mu_f=\mu^{\rm init}_r=m_t$, we obtain $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 7 tev;pmc}=2.67\%$, $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 8tev;pmc}=2.39\%$, and $a_{\rm c}|_{\rm 14 tev;pmc}=1.28\%$.

1510.06924	the longitudinal and transverse distributions of the pion wavefunction  from the present experimental data on the pion-photon transition form factor	it is noted that the low-energy behavior of the pion-photon transition formfactor $f_{\pi\gamma}(q^2)$ is sensitive to the transverse distribution of thepion wavefunction, and its high-energy behavior is sensitive to thelongitudinal one. thus a careful study on $f_{\pi\gamma}(q^2)$ can providehelpful information on the pion wavefunction precisely. in this paper, wepresent a combined analysis of the data on $f_{\pi\gamma}(q^2)$ reported by thecello, the cleo, the babar and the belle collaborations. it is performed byusing the method of least squares. by using the combined measurements of belleand cleo collaborations, the pion wavefunction longitudinal and transversebehavior can be fixed to a certain degree, i.e. we obtain $\beta \in[0.691,0.757] \rm gev$ and $b \in [0.00,0.235]$ for $p_{\chi^2} \geq 90\%$,where $\beta$ and $b$ are two parameters of a convenient pion wavefunctionmodel whose distribution amplitude can mimic the various longitudinal behaviorunder proper choice of parameters. we observe that the cello, cleo and belledata are consistent with each other, all of which prefers the asymptotic-likedistribution amplitude; while the babar data prefers a more broad distributionamplitude, such as the cz-like one.

0810.3314	revisiting the real graviton effects at cern lhc within the quantum  gravity theory with large extra dimensions	cern lhc provides a good experimental platform to perturbatively probe thefundamental gravity scale up to several tev, with the precise value dependingon the number of extra dimensions. the leading experimental signal of gravitonat lhc is from the process $pp\to jet+{e\slash}_t$, where ${e\slash}_t$ standsfor the transverse missing energy. a detailed discussion on the hadronicproduction of real graviton through hard subprocesses: $q\bar{q}\to g+g$,$g+q\to g+q$ and $g+g\to g+g$ have been studied within the quantum gravitytheory with large extra dimensions. the main theoretical uncertainties togetherwith the dominant standard model background to these processes, e.g.$q\bar{q}\to z^0+g$ and $g+q\to z^0+q$ with $z^0$ further decaying intoneutrinos, have also been discussed. it is found that only in certain jetenergy region and with certain number of extra dimensions can the quantumgravity signal be distinguished from the background, which inversely lead tothe effective scale $m_d$ to be probed up to $(8.8\pm 0.9)$ tev for two extradimensions, and $(5.9\pm 0.5)$ tev for four extra dimensions with sufficientintegrated luminosity, e.g. $100fb^{-1}$, at cern lhc.

hep-ph;0412417	consistent analysis of the $b\to\pi$ transition form factor in the whole  physical region	in the paper, we show that the $b\to\pi$ transition form factor can becalculated by using the different approach in the different $q^2$ regions andthey are consistent with each other in the whole physical region. for the$b\to\pi$ transition form factor in the large recoil regions, one can apply thepqcd approach, where the transverse momentum dependence for both the hardscattering part and the non-perturbative wavefunction, the sudakov effects andthe threshold effects are included to regulate the endpoint singularity and toderive a more reliable pqcd result. pionic twist-3 contributions are carefullystudied with a better endpoint behavior wavefunction for $\psi_p$ and we findthat its contribution is less than the leading twist contribution. both the twowavefunctions $\psi_b$ and $\bar\psi_b$ of the b meson can give sizablecontributions to the $b\to\pi$ transition form factor and should be kept for abetter understanding of the b decays. the present obtained pqcd results canmatch with both the qcd light-cone sum rule results and the extrapolatedlattice qcd results in the large recoil regions.

hep-ph;0507136	pion electromagnetic form factor in the $k_t$ factorization formulae	based on the light-cone (lc) framework and the $k_t$ factorization formalism,the transverse momentum effects and the different helicity components'contributions to the pion form factor $f_{\pi}(q^2)$ are recalculated. inparticular, the contribution to the pion form factor from the higher helicitycomponents ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2=\pm 1$), which come from the spin-space wignerrotation, are analyzed in the soft and hard energy regions respectively. ourresults show that the right power behavior of the hard contribution from thehigher helicity components can only be obtained by fully keeping the $k_t$dependence in the hard amplitude, and that the $k_t$ dependence in lcwavefunction affects the hard and soft contributions substantially. a model forthe twist-3 wavefunction $\psi_p(x,\mathbf{k_\perp})$ of the pion has beenconstructed based on the moment calculation by applying the qcd sum rules,whose distribution amplitude has a better end-point behavior than that of theasymptotic one. with this model wavefunction, the twist-3 contributionsincluding both the usual helicity components ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2=0$) and thehigher helicity components ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2=\pm 1$) to the pion formfactor have been studied within the modified pqcd approach. our results showthat the twist-3 contribution drops fast and it becomes less than the twist-2contribution at $q^2\sim 10gev^2$. the higher helicity components in thetwist-3 wavefunction will give an extra suppression to the pion form factor.when all the power contributions, which include higher order in $\alpha_s$,higher helicities, higher twists in da and etc., have been taken into account,it is expected that the hard contributions will fit the present experimentaldata well at the energy region where pqcd is applicable.

hep-ph;0509040	hadronic production of $b_c(b^*_c)$ meson induced by the heavy quarks  inside the collision hadrons	in general-mass variable-flavor-number (gm-vfn) scheme, the `heavy quarkmechanisms' of $b_c(b_c^*)$ meson hadroproduction via the sub-processes $g+c\tob_c(b_c^*)+...$ and $g+\bar{b}\to b_c(b_c^*)+...$ are investigated. in thescheme, possible double counting from these mechanisms and the `lightmechanisms' (the gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilationmechanisms) is subtracted properly. the numerical results show that thetransverse momentum, $p_t$, distribution of the produced $b_c(b_c^*)$ from the`intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms' (i.e. the heavy quark mechanisms in whichthe double counting components have been subtracted accordingly) declinesfaster with the increment of the $p_t$ than that from the `light mechanisms',and only in small $p_t$ region ($p_t\lesssim 7.0$ gev) the `intrinsic heavyquark mechanisms' themselves may make remarkable contributions. the combinedcontributions from the `intrinsic heavy quark mechanisms' and the `lightmechanisms' to the production are compared with that obtained by the mostcalculations in literature, which in some sense are within the fixed flavornumber (ffn) scheme at leading order, and we find that the production by virtueof the gm-vfn scheme is more or less the same as the one in literature, exceptin the small $p_t$ region.

hep-ph;0601032	estimate of the hadronic production of the doubly charmed baryon  $\xi_{cc}$ under gm-vfn scheme	hadronic production of the doubly charmed baryon $\xi_{cc}$ ($\xi^{++}_{cc}$and $\xi^{+}_{cc}$) is investigated under the general-massvariable-flavor-number (gm-vfn) scheme. the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism andthe intrinsic charm mechanisms, i.e. via the sub-processes$g+g\to(cc)[^3s_1]_{\bar 3}+\bar{c}+\bar{c}$,$g+g\to(cc)[^1s_0]_6+\bar{c}+\bar{c}$; $g+c\to (cc)[^3s_1]_{\bar 3}+\bar{c}$,$g+c\to (cc)[^1s_0]_6+\bar{c}$ and $c+c\to (cc)[^3s_1]_{\bar 3}+g$, $c+c\to(cc)[^1s_0]_6+g$, are taken into account in the investigation, where$(cc)[^3s_1]_{\bar 3}$ (in color {\bf $\bar 3$}) and $(cc)[^1s_0]_6$ (in color{\bf 6}) are two possible $s$-wave configurations of the doubly charmed diquarkpair $(cc)$ inside the baryon $\xi_{cc}$. numerical results for the productionat hadornic colliders lhc and tevatron show that both the contributions fromthe doubly charmed diquark pairs $(cc)[^1s_0]_6$ and $(cc)[^3s_1]_{\bar 3}$ aresizable with the assumption that the two nrqcd matrix elements are equal, andthe total contributions from the `intrinsic' charm mechanisms are bigger thanthose of the gluon-gluon fusion mechanism. for the production in the region ofsmall transverse-momentum $p_t$, the intrinsic mechanisms are dominant over thegluon-gluon fusion mechanism and they can raise the theoretical prediction ofthe $\xi_{cc}$ by almost one order.

hep-ph;0602158	fragmentation function and hadronic production of the heavy  supersymmetric hadrons	the light top-squark $\sto$ may be the lightest squark and its lifetime maybe `long enough' in a kind of susy models which have not been ruled out yetexperimentally, so colorless `supersymmetric hadrons (superhadrons)' $(\sto\bar{q})$ ($q$ is a quark except $t$-quark) may be formed as long as the lighttop-squark $\sto$ can be produced. fragmentation function of $\sto$ to heavy`supersymmetric hadrons (superhadrons)' $(\sto \bar{q})$ ($\bar{q}=\bar{c}$ or$\bar{b}$) and the hadronic production of the superhadrons are investigatedquantitatively. the fragmentation function is calculated precisely. due to thedifference in spin of the susy component, the asymptotic behavior of thefragmentation function is different from those of the existent ones. thefragmentation function is also applied to compute the production of heavysuperhadrons at hadronic colliders tevatron and lhc under the so-calledfragmentation approach. the resultant cross-section for the heavy superhadronsis too small to observe at tevatron, but great enough at lhc, even when all therelevant parameters in the susy models are taken within the favored region forthe heavy superhadrons. the production of `light superhadrons' $(\sto \bar{q})$($q=u, d, s$) is also roughly estimated. it is pointed out that the productioncross-sections of the light superhadrons $(\sto \bar{q})$ may be much greaterthan those of the heavy superhadrons, so that even at tevatron the lightsuperhadrons may be produced in great quantities.

hep-ph;0612007	determination of the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mixing angle from the  pseudoscalar transition form factors	the possible range of $\eta-\eta'$ mixing angle is determined from thetransition form factors $f_{\eta \gamma}(q^2)$ and $f_{\eta' \gamma}(q^2)$ withthe help of the present experimental data. for such purpose, the quark-flavormixing scheme is adopted and the pseudoscalar transition form factors arecalculated under the light-cone pqcd framework, where the transverse momentumcorrections and the contributions beyond the leading fock state have beencarefully taken into consideration. we construct a phenomenological expressionto estimate the contributions to the form factors beyond the leading fock statebased on their asymptotic behavior at $q^2\to 0$ and $q^2\to\infty$. by takingthe quark-flavor mixing scheme, our results lead to $\phi= 38.0^{\circ}\pm1.0^{\circ}\pm 2.0^{\circ}$, where the first error coming from experimentaluncertainty and the second error coming from the uncertainties of thewavefunction parameters. the possible intrinsic charm component in $\eta$ and$\eta'$ is discussed and our present analysis also disfavors a large portion ofintrinsic charm component in $\eta$ and $\eta'$, e.g. $|f^c_{\eta'}|\le 50 {\rmmev}$.
