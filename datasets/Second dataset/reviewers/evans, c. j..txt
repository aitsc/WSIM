0706.1731	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: evolution of surface n  abundances and effective temperature scales in the galaxy and magellanic  clouds	we present an analysis of high resolution vlt-flames spectra of 61 b-typestars with relatively narrow-lined spectra located in 4 fields centered on themilky way clusters; ngc3293 &amp; ngc4755 and the large and small magellanic cloudclusters; ngc2004 and ngc330. for each object a quantitative analysis wascarried out using the non-lte model atmosphere code tlusty; resulting in thedetermination of their atmospheric parameters and photospheric abundances ofthe dominant metal species (c, n, o, mg, si, fe). the results are discussed inrelation to our earlier work on 3 younger clusters in these galaxies; ngc6611,n11 and ngc346 paying particular attention to the nitrogen abundances which arean important probe of the role of rotation in the evolution of stars. this workalong with that of the younger clusters provides a consistent dataset ofabundances and atmospheric parameters for over 100 b-type stars in the threegalaxies. we provide effective temperature scales for b-type dwarfs in allthree galaxies and for giants and supergiants in the smc and lmc. in eachgalaxy a dependence on luminosity is found between the three classes with theunevolved dwarf objects having significantly higher effective temperatures. ametallicity dependence is present between the smc and galactic dwarf objects,and whilst the lmc stars are only slightly cooler than the smc stars, they aresignificantly hotter than their galactic counterparts.

0901.3853	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: constraints on stellar evolution  from the chemical compositions of rapidly rotating galactic and magellanic  cloud b-type stars	we have previously analysed the spectra of 135 early b-type stars in the lmcand found several groups of stars that have chemical compositions that conflictwith the theory of rotational mixing. here we extend this study to galactic andsmc metallicities with the analysis of ~50 galactic and ~100 smc early b-typestars with rotational velocities up to ~300km/s. the surface nitrogenabundances are utilised as a probe of the mixing process.  in the smc, we find a population of slowly rotating nitrogen-rich starsamongst the early b type core-hydrogen burning stars, similar to the lmc. inthe galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the corehydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectationfrom both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. however, onlya small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce asignificant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enrichedrapid rotators previously found in the lmc sample. finally, in each metallicityregime, a population of highly enriched supergiants is observed, which cannotbe the immediate descendants of core-hydrogen burning stars. their abundancesare, however, compatible with them having gone through a previous redsupergiant phase. together, these observations paint a complex picture of thenitrogen enrichment in massive main sequence and supergiant stellaratmospheres, where age and binarity cause crucial effects. whether rotationalmixing is required to understand our results remains an open question at thistime, but could be answered by identifying the true binary fraction in thosegroups of stars that do not agree with single-star evolutionary models(abridged).

0704.1113	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: wind properties and evolution of  hot massive stars in the lmc	[abridged] we have studied the optical spectra of 28 o- and early b-typestars in the large magellanic cloud, 22 of which are associated with the youngstar-forming region n11. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code fastwind with thegenetic-algorithm optimisation routine pikaia. results for stars in the lh9 andlh10 associations of n11 are consistent with a sequential star formationscenario, in which activity in lh9 triggered the formation of lh10. our samplecontains four stars of spectral type o2, of which the hottest is found to be~49-54 kk (cf. ~45-46 kk for o3 stars). the masses of helium-enriched dwarfsand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotatingevolutionary tracks. we interpret this as evidence for efficientrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and toan increase of the stellar luminosity. this result is consistent with findingsfor smc stars by mokiem et al. for bright giants and supergiants no suchmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly(or non-)rotating objects. stellar mass-loss properties were found to beintermediate to those found in massive stars in the galaxy and the smc, andcomparisons with theoretical predictions at lmc metallicity yielded goodagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 &lt; log l/l(sun) &lt;6.1.

1002.0288	vlt-mad observations of the core of 30 doradus	we present h- and ks-band imaging of three fields at the centre of 30 doradusin the large magellanic cloud, obtained as part of the science demonstrationprogramme with the multi-conjugate adaptive optics demonstrator (mad) at thevery large telescope. strehl ratios of 15-30% were achieved in the ks-band,yielding near-infrared images of this dense and complex region at unprecedentedangular resolution at these wavelengths. the mad data are used to construct anear-infrared luminosity profile for r136, the cluster at the core of 30 dor.using cluster profiles of the form used by elson et al., we find the surfacebrightness can be fit by a relatively shallow power-law function(gamma~1.5-1.7) over the full extent of the mad data, which extends to a radiusof ~40" (~10pc). we do not see compelling evidence for a break in theluminosity profile as seen in optical data in the literature, arguing thatcluster asymmetries are the dominant source, although extinction effects andstars from nearby triggered star-formation likely also contribute. theseresults highlight the need to consider cluster asymmetries and multiple spatialcomponents in interpretation of the luminosity profiles of distant unresolvedclusters. we also investigate seven candidate young stellar objects reported bygruendl &amp; chu from spitzer observations, six of which have apparentcounterparts in the mad images. the most interesting of these (gc09:053839.24-690552.3) appears related to a striking bow-shock--like feature,orientated away from both r136 and the wolf-rayet star brey 75, at distances of19.5" and 8" (4.7 and 1.9pc in projection), respectively.

0708.2042	the empirical metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate of o- and  early b-type stars	[abridged] we present a comprehensive study of the metallicity dependence ofthe mass-loss rates in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars. assuminga power-law dependence of mass loss on metallicity, mdot \propto z^{m}, andadopting a theoretical relation between the terminal velocity and metallicity,v_inf \propto z^{0.13} (leitherer et al.), we find m = 0.83 +/- 0.16 fornon-clumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation(wlr) for stars more luminous than 10^{5.2} lsun. within the errors, thisresult agrees with the prediction of m = 0.69 +/- 0.10 from vink et al. for thehigh luminosity stars we find the mass loss rates to be greater than thepredictions, implying wind clumping factors in their line-forming regions of~4. for lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengthscannot be reliably derived from optical lines, and one must rely on analysis ofuv lines. in the low-luminosity domain the galactic wlr is found to be muchsteeper than expected from theory, leading to a discrepancy between uvmass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of l ~10^{4.75} lsun, the origin of which is unknown. we emphasize that even if thecurrent mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars are overestimated as a result ofwind clumping, the degree of clumping would likely to be independent ofmetallicity, so the scalings derived in this study are expected to remaincorrect.

1009.4197	the multiplicity of massive stars	binaries are excellent astrophysical laboratories that provide us with directmeasurements of fundamental stellar parameters. compared to single isolatedstar, multiplicity induces new processes, offering the opportunity to confrontour understanding of a broad range of physics under the extreme conditionsfound in, and close to, astrophysical objects. in this contribution, we willdiscuss the parameter space occupied by massive binaries, and the observationalmeans to investigate it. we will review the multiplicity fraction of ob starswithin each regime, and in different astrophysical environments. in particularwe will compare the o star spectroscopic binary fraction in nearby openclusters and we will show that the current data are adequately described by anhomogeneous fraction of f~0.44. we will also summarize our currentunderstanding of the observed parameter distributions of o+ob spectroscopicbinaries. we will show that the period distribution is overabundant in shortperiod binaries and that it can be described by a bi-modal oepik law with abreak point around p~10d. the distribution of the mass-ratios shows noindication for a twin population of equal mass binaries and seems ratheruniform in the range 0.2&lt; q=m_2/m_1&lt;1.0.

1010.4312	spectroscopic confirmation of a galaxy at redshift z=8.6	galaxies had their most significant impact on the universe when theyassembled their first generations of stars. energetic photons emitted by young,massive stars in primeval galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium surroundingtheir host galaxies, cleared sight-lines along which the light of the younggalaxies could escape, and fundamentally altered the physical state of theintergalactic gas in the universe continuously until the present day.observations of the cosmic microwave background, and of galaxies and quasars atthe highest redshifts, suggest that the universe was reionised through acomplex process that was completed about a billion years after the big bang, byredshift z~6. detecting ionizing ly-alpha photons from increasingly distantgalaxies places important constraints on the timing, location and nature of thesources responsible for reionisation. here we report the detection of ly-aphotons emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang. udfy-38135539is at a redshift z=8.5549+-0.0002, which is greater than those of thepreviously known most distant objects, at z=8.2 and z=6.97. we find that thissingle source is unlikely to provide enough photons to ionize the volumenecessary for the emission line to escape, requiring a significant contributionfrom other, probably fainter galaxies nearby.

1105.1775	the vlt-flames tarantula survey iii: a very massive star in apparent  isolation from the massive cluster r136	vfts 682 is located in an active star-forming region, at a projected distanceof 29 pc from the young massive cluster r136 in the tarantula nebula of thelarge magellanic cloud. it was previously reported as a candidate young stellarobject, and more recently spectroscopically revealed as a hydrogen-richwolf-rayet (wn5h) star. our aim is to obtain the stellar properties, such asits intrinsic luminosity, and to investigate the origin of vfts 682. to thispurpose, we model optical spectra from the vlt-flames tarantula survey with thenon-lte stellar atmosphere code cmfgen, as well as the spectral energydistribution from complementary optical and infrared photometry. we find theextinction properties to be highly peculiar (rv ~4.7), and obtain asurprisingly high luminosity log(l/lsun) = 6.5 \pm 0.2, corresponding to apresent-day mass of ~150msun. the high effective temperature of 52.2 \pm 2.5kkmight be explained by chemically homogeneous evolution - suggested to be thekey process in the path towards long gamma-ray bursts. lightcurves of theobject show variability at the 10% level on a timescale of years. such changesare unprecedented for classical wolf-rayet stars, and are more reminiscent ofluminous blue variables. finally, we discuss two possibilities for the originof vfts 682: (i) the star either formed in situ, which would have profoundimplications for the formation mechanism of massive stars, or (ii) vfts 682 isa slow runaway star that originated from the dense cluster r136, which wouldmake it the most massive runaway known to date.

0711.2264	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: atmospheric parameters and  rotational velocity distributions for b-type stars in the magellanic clouds	we provide atmospheric parameters and rotational velocities of a large sample(~400) of o- and early b-type stars, analysed in a homogeneous and consistentmanner, for use in constraining theoretical models. comparison of therotational velocities with evolutionary tracks suggest that the end of corehydrogen burning occurs later than currently predicted. we also show that thelarge number of the luminous blue supergiants observed in the fields areunlikely to have directly evolved from main-sequence massive o-type stars asneither their low rotational velocities or position on the h-r diagram arepredicted. we suggest that blue-loops or mass-transfer binary systems maypopulate the blue supergiant regime. by comparing the rotational velocitydistributions of the magellanic cloud stars to a similar galactic sample wefind that (at 3sigma confidence level) massive stars (above 8msun) in the smcrotate faster than those in the solar neighbourhood. however there appears tobe no significant difference between the rotational velocity distributions inthe galaxy and the lmc. we find that the vsini distributions in the smc and lmccan modelled with an intrinsic rotational velocity distribution which is agaussian peaking at 175km/s (smc) and 100km/s (lmc). we find that in ngc346 inthe smc, the 10-25msun main-sequence stars appear to rotate faster than theirhigher mass counterparts. recently yoon et al. (2006) have determined rates ofgrbs by modelling rapidly rotating massive star progenitors. our measuredrotational velocity distribution for the 10-25msun stars is peaked at slightlyhigher velocities than they assume, supporting the idea that grbs could comefrom rapid rotators with initial masses as low as 14msun at low metallicities.(abridged).

0711.2267	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: rotation and nitrogen enrichment  as the key to understanding massive star evolution	rotation has become an important element in evolutionary models of massivestars, specifically via the prediction of rotational mixing. here, we study asample of stars, including rapid rotators, to constrain such models and usenitrogen enrichments as a probe of the mixing process. chemical compositions(c, n, o, mg and si) have been estimated for 135 early b-type stars in thelarge magellanic cloud with projected rotational velocities up to ~300km/susing a non-lte tlusty model atmosphere grid. evolutionary models, includingrotational mixing, have been generated attempting to reproduce theseobservations by adjusting the overshooting and rotational mixing parameters andproduce reasonable agreement with 60% of our core hydrogen burning sample. wefind (excluding known binaries) a significant population of highly nitrogenenriched intrinsic slow rotators vsini less than 50km/s incompatible with ourmodels ~20% of the sample). furthermore, while we find fast rotators withenrichments in agreement with the models, the observation of evolved (log gless than 3.7dex) fast rotators that are relatively unenriched (a further ~20%of the sample) challenges the concept of rotational mixing. we also find that70% of our blue supergiant sample cannot have evolved directly from thehydrogen burning main-sequence. we are left with a picture where invokingbinarity and perhaps fossil magnetic fields are required to understand thesurface properties of a population of massive main sequence stars.

1208.0825	the vlt-flames tarantula survey. vii. a low velocity dispersion for the  young massive cluster r136	detailed studies of resolved young massive star clusters are necessary todetermine their dynamical state and evaluate the importance of gas expulsionand early cluster evolution. in an effort to gain insight into the dynamicalstate of the young massive cluster r136 and obtain the first measurement of itsvelocity dispersion, we analyse multi-epoch spectroscopic data of the innerregions of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) obtained as part ofthe vlt-flames tarantula survey. following a quantitative assessment of thevariability, we use the radial velocities of non-variable sources to place anupper limit of 6 km/s on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of stars withina projected distance of 5 pc from the centre of the cluster. after accountingfor the contributions of undetected binaries and measurement errors throughmonte carlo simulations, we conclude that the true velocity dispersion islikely between 4 and 5 km/s given a range of standard assumptions about thebinary distribution. this result is consistent with what is expected if thecluster is in virial equilibrium, suggesting that gas expulsion has not alteredits dynamics. we find that the velocity dispersion would be ~25 km/s ifbinaries were not identified and rejected, confirming the importance of themulti-epoch strategy and the risk of interpreting velocity dispersionmeasurements of unresolved extragalactic young massive clusters.

1209.4638	the vlt-flames tarantula survey viii. multiplicity properties of the  o-type star population	aims. we analyze the multiplicity properties of the massive o-type starpopulation. with 360 o-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample ofmassive stars analyzed to date.  methods. we use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identifyspectroscopic binaries. we also use a monte-carlo method to correct forobservational biases.  results. we observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35\pm0.03, whichcorresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significantradial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20km/s. we compute theintrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51\pm0.04. we adopt power-laws to describethe intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f_p ~ (log p)^\pi\ (with0.15 &lt; log p &lt; 3.5) and f_q ~ q^\kappa\ with 0.1 &lt; q=m_2/m_1 &lt; 1.0. thepower-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are \pi = -0.45+/- 0.30 and \kappa = -1.0\pm0.4. the obtained period distribution thus favoursshorter period systems compared to an oepik law. the mass ratio distribution isslightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with arandom sampling of a classical mass function. the binary fraction seems mostlyuniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types andluminosity classes. the binary fraction in the outer region of the field ofview (r &gt; 7.8', i.e. approx117 pc) and among the o9.7 i/ii objects are howeversignificantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations.  conclusions. using simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over50% of the current o star population in 30 dor will exchange mass with itscompanion within a binary system. this shows that binary interaction is greatlyaffecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken intoaccount to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars.

1212.2424	the vlt-flames tarantula survey x: evidence for a bimodal distribution  of rotational velocities for the single early b-type stars	aims: projected rotational velocities (\vsini) have been estimated for 334targets in the vlt-flames tarantula survey that do not manifest significantradial velocity variations and are not supergiants. they have spectral typesfrom approximately o9.5 to b3. the estimates have been analysed to infer theunderlying rotational velocity distribution, which is critical forunderstanding the evolution of massive stars.  methods: projected rotational velocities were deduced from the fouriertransforms of spectral lines, with upper limits also being obtained fromprofile fitting. for the narrower lined stars, metal and non-diffuse heliumlines were adopted, and for the broader lined stars, both non-diffuse anddiffuse helium lines; the estimates obtained using the different sets of linesare in good agreement. the uncertainty in the mean estimates is typically 4%for most targets. the iterative deconvolution procedure of lucy has been usedto deduce the probability density distribution of the rotational velocities.  results: projected rotational velocities range up to approximately 450 \kmsand show a bi-modal structure. this is also present in the inferred rotationalvelocity distribution with 25% of the sample having $0\leq$\ve$\leq$100\,\kmsand the high velocity component having \ve$\sim 250$\,\kms. there is noevidence from the spatial and radial velocity distributions of the twocomponents that they represent either field and cluster populations ordifferent episodes of star formation. be-type stars have also been identified.  conclusions: the bi-modal rotational velocity distribution in our sampleresembles that found for late-b and early-a type stars. while magnetic brakingappears to be a possible mechanism for producing the low-velocity component, wecan not rule out alternative explanations.

1301.3500	discovery of x-ray emission from young suns in the small magellanic  cloud	we report the discovery of extended x-ray emission within the young starcluster ngc 602 in the wing of the small magellanic cloud (smc) based onobservations obtained with the chandra x-ray observatory. x-ray emission isdetected from the cluster core area with the highest stellar density and from adusty ridge surrounding the hii region. we use a census of massive stars in thecluster to demonstrate that a cluster wind or wind-blown bubble is unlikely toprovide a significant contribution to the x-ray emission detected from thecentral area of the cluster. we therefore suggest that x-ray emission at thecluster core originates from an ensemble of low- and solar-masspre-main-sequence (pms) stars, each of which would be too weak in x-rays to bedetected individually. we attribute the x-ray emission from the dusty ridge tothe embedded tight cluster of the new-born stars known in this area frominfrared studies. assuming that the levels of x-ray activity in young stars inthe low-metallicity environment of ngc 602a are comparable to their galacticcounterparts, then the detected spatial distribution, spectral properties, andlevel of x-ray emission are largely consistent with those expected from low-and solar-mass pms stars and young stellar objects (ysos). this is the firstdiscovery of x-ray emission attributable to pms stars and ysos in the smc,which suggests that the accretion and dynamo processes in young, low-massobjects in the smc resemble those in the galaxy.

1309.2929	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xii. rotational velocities of the single  o-type stars	aims. using ground based multi-object optical spectroscopy obtained in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we aim to establish the(projected) rotational velocity distribution for a sample of 216 presumablysingle o-type stars in 30 doradus (30 dor).  methods. we measured projected rotational velocities, \vrot, by means of afourier transform method and a profile fitting method applied on a set ofisolated spectral lines. we also used an iterative deconvolution procedure toinfer the probability density, $\rm{p(\veq)}$, of the equatorial rotationalvelocity, \veq.  results. the distribution of \vrot\ shows a two-component structure: a peakaround 80 \kms\ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 \kms. thisstructure is also present in the inferred distribution $\rm{p(\veq)}$ witharound 80% of the sample having 0 $&lt;$ \veq\, $\leq\, 300$ \kms\ and the other20% distributed in the high-velocity region.  conclusions. most of the stars in our sample rotate with a rate less than20%\ of their break-up velocity. for the bulk of the sample, mass-loss in astellar wind and/or envelope expansion is not efficient enough to significantlyspin down these stars within the first few myr of evolution. the presence of asizeable population of fast rotators is compatible with recent populationsynthesis computations that investigate the influence of binary evolution onthe rotation rate of massive stars. despite the fact that we have excludedstars that show significant radial velocity variations, our sample may haveremained contaminated by post-interaction binary products. the fact that thehigh-velocity tail may be preferentially (and perhaps even exclusively),populated by post-binary interaction products, has important implications forthe evolutionary origin of systems that produce gamma-ray bursts.

1309.7250	rotational properties of the o-type star population in the tarantula  region	the 30 doradus (30\,dor) region in the large magellanic cloud (also known asthe tarantula nebula) is the nearest massive starburst region, containing therichest sample of massive stars in the local group. it is the best possiblelaboratory to investigate aspects of the formation and evolution of massivestars. here, we focus on rotation which is a key parameter in the evolution ofthese objects. we establish the projected rotational velocity, $v_{e}\sin i$,distribution of an unprecedented sample of 216 radial velocity constant($\rm{\delta rv\, \leq\, 20 \,km s^{-1}}$) o-type stars in 30\,dor observed inthe framework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts). the distribution of$v_{e}\sin i$ shows a two-component structure: a peak around 80 $\rm{kms^{-1}}$ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 $\rm{km s^{-1}}$.around 75% of the sample has 0 $\leq\, v_{e}\sin i \leq$ 200 $\rm{km s^{-1}}$with the other 25% distributed in the high-velocity tail. the presence of thelow-velocity peak is consistent with that found in other studies of late-o andearly-b stars. the high-velocity tail is compatible with expectations frombinary interaction synthesis models and may be predominantly populated bypost-binary interaction, spun-up, objects and mergers. this may have importantimplications for the nature of progenitors of long-duration gamma ray bursts.

(1) several new examples of the earliest spectraltypes o2-o3 have been found. (2) a group of extremely rapidly rotatingmain-sequence objects has been isolated, including the largest $v\sin i$ valuesknown, the spatial and radial-velocity distributions of which suggest ejectionfrom the two principal ionizing clusters. (3) several new examples of theevolved, rapidly rotating onfp class show similar evidence. (4) no fewer than48 members of the vz category, hypothesized to be on or near the zams, arefound in this sample; in contrast to the rapid rotators, they are stronglyconcentrated to the ionizing clusters, supporting their interpretation as veryyoung objects, as do their relatively faint absolute magnitudes. (5) asurprisingly large fraction of the main-sequence spectra belong to the recentlyrecognized v((fc)) class, with c iii emission lines of similar strength to theusual n iii in v((f)) spectra; there are also six objects with veryhigh-quality data but no trace of either mission feature, presenting newchallenges to physical interpretations.

1407.1837	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xvii. physical and wind properties of  massive stars at the top of the main sequence	the evolution and fate of very massive stars (vms) is tightly connected totheir mass-loss properties. their initial and final masses differ significantlyas a result of mass loss. vms have strong stellar winds and extremely highionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanicaland radiative feedback in giant hii regions. however, how vms mass-lossproperties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we explore the mass-losstransition region from optically thin o to denser wnh star winds, therebytesting theoretical predictions. to this purpose we select 62 o, of, of/wn, andwnh stars, an unprecedented sample of stars with the highest masses andluminosities known. we perform a spectral analysis of optical vfts as well asnear-infrared vlt/sinfoni data using the non-lte radiative transfer code cmfgento obtain stellar and wind parameters. for the first time, we observationallyresolve the transition between optically thin o and optically thick wnh starwinds. our results suggest the existence of a kink between both mass-lossregimes, in agreement with recent mc simulations. for the optically thickregime, we confirm the steep dependence on the eddington factor from previoustheoretical and observational studies. the transition occurs on the ms near aluminosity of 10^6.1lsun, or a mass of 80...90msun. above this limit, we findthat - even when accounting for moderate wind clumping (with f = 0.1) - windmass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currentlyadopted in stellar evolution calculations. we also show that this results insubstantial helium surface enrichment. based on our spectroscopic analyses, weare able to provide the most accurate ionising fluxes for vms known to date,confirming the pivotal role of vms in ionising and shaping their environments.

1409.1822	rotational velocities of single and binary o-type stars in the tarantula  nebula	rotation is a key parameter in the evolution of massive stars, affectingtheir evolution, chemical yields, ionizing photon budget, and final fate. wedetermined the projected rotational velocity, $v_e\sin i$, of $\sim$330 o-typeobjects, i.e. $\sim$210 spectroscopic single stars and $\sim$110 primaries inbinary systems, in the tarantula nebula or 30 doradus (30\,dor) region. theobservations were taken using vlt/flames and constitute the largest homogeneousdataset of multi-epoch spectroscopy of o-type stars currently available. themost distinctive feature of the $v_e\sin i$ distributions of thepresumed-single stars and primaries in 30 dor is a low-velocity peak at around100\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$. stellar winds are not expected to have spun-down thebulk of the stars significantly since their arrival on the main sequence andtherefore the peak in the single star sample is likely to represent the outcomeof the formation process. whereas the spin distribution of presumed-singlestars shows a well developed tail of stars rotating more rapidly than300\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$, the sample of primaries does not feature such ahigh-velocity tail. the tail of the presumed-single star distribution isattributed for the most part -- and could potentially be completely due -- tospun-up binary products that appear as single stars or that have merged. thiswould be consistent with the lack of such post-interaction products in thebinary sample, that is expected to be dominated by pre-interaction systems. thepeak in this distribution is broader and is shifted toward somewhat higher spinrates compared to the distribution of presumed-single stars. systems displayinglarge radial velocity variations, typical for short period systems, appearmostly responsible for these differences.

1409.6653	the iacob project: ii. on the scatter of o-dwarf spectral type --  effective temperature calibrations	we are now in an era of large spectroscopic surveys of ob-type stars.quantitative spectroscopic analysis of these modern datasets is enabling us toreview the physical properties of blue massive stars with robust samples, notonly revisiting mean properties and general trends, but also incorporatinginformation about the effects of second-order parameters.  we investigate the spectral type -- effective temperature (spt - teff)calibration for o-type dwarfs, and its claimed dependence on metallicity, usingstatistically-meaningful samples of stars extracted from the iacob and vftssurveys.  we perform a homogeneous differential spectroscopic analysis of 33 galacticand 53 lmc o~dwarfs (spanning spectral types of o4 -- o9.7) using theiacob-gbat package, a $\chi^2$-fitting algorithm based on a large pre-computedgrid of fastwind models, and standard techniques for the hydrogen/heliumanalysis of o-type stars. we compare the estimated effective temperatures andgravities as a function of (internally consistent) spectral classifications.  while the general trend is that the temperature of a star increases withearlier spectral types and decreasing metallicity, we show that the large rangeof gravities found for o-type dwarfs -- spaning up to 0.45-0.50 dex in somespectral bins -- plays a critical role on the dependence of the effectivetemperature calibrations as a function of spectral type and metallicity.  this result warns us about the use of spt - teff calibrations for o-dwarfswhich ignore the effects of gravity, and highlights the risks of employingcalibrations based on small samples. the effects of this scatter in gravities(evolutionary status) for o-type dwarfs should be included in future recipeswhich employ spt - teff calibrations.

1412.2705	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xix. b-type supergiants - atmospheric  parameters and nitrogen abundances to investigate the role of binarity and  the width of the main sequence	tlusty non-lte model atmosphere calculations have been used to determineatmospheric parameters and nitrogen (n) abundances for 34 single and 18 binaryb-type supergiants (bsgs). the effects of flux contribution from an unseensecondary were considered for the binary sample. we present the firstsystematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of bsgs across thetheoretical terminal age main sequence (tams). to account for the distributionof effective temperatures of the bsgs it may be necessary to extend the tams tolower temperatures. this is consistent with the derived distribution of massdiscrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and n abundances,provided that stars cooler than this temperature are post rsg objects. for thebsgs in the tarantula and previous flames surveys, most have small vsini. about10% have larger vsini (&gt;100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no nenhancement. all the cooler bsgs have low vsini of &lt;70km/s and high n abundanceestimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blueloop may be important. a lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the smallsample size. single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, canaccount for the n enhancement in both the single and binary samples. thedetailed distribution of n abundances in the single and binary samples may bedifferent, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. thefirst comparative study of single and binary bsgs has revealed that the mainsequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending toteff=20000k. some marginal differences in single and binary atmosphericparameters and abundances have been identified, possibly implying non-standardevolution for some of the sample. this sample as a whole has implications forseveral aspects of our understanding of the evolution of bsgs. full abstract inpaper

1501.03794	the evolution of rotating very massive stars with lmc composition	we present a dense model grid with tailored input chemical compositionappropriate for the large magellanic cloud. we use a one-dimensionalhydrodynamic stellar evolution code, which accounts for rotation, transport ofangular momentum by magnetic fields, and stellar wind mass loss to compute ourdetailed models. we calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses of70-500 msun and with initial surface rotational velocities of 0-550 km/s,covering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. we find our rapidrotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium,with quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotatingmodels. above 160 msun, homogeneous evolution is also established through massloss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent ofthe initial rotation rate. surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slowerrotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass.for models above 150 mzams, and for models in the whole considered mass rangelater on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity ofthese models to their eddington limit. this leads to a maximum zero-age mainsequence surface temperature of 56000 k, at 180 msun, and to an evolution ofstars in the mass range 50-100 msun to the regime of luminous blue variables inthe hr diagram with high internal eddington factors. inflation also leads todecreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution ofstars above 180 msun. the cool surface temperatures due to the envelopeinflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars atlmc metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae. thecorresponding spin-down will also prevent very massive lmc stars to producelong-duration gamma-ray bursts, which might, however, originate from lowermasses.

1503.00930	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xx. the nature of the x-ray bright  emission line star vfts 399	the stellar population of the 30 doradus star-forming region in the largemagellanic cloud contains a subset of apparently single, rapidly rotatingo-type stars. the physical processes leading to the formation of this cohortare currently uncertain. one member of this group, the late o-type star vfts399, is found to be unexpectedly x-ray bright for its bolometric luminosity -in this study we aim to determine its physical nature and the cause of thisbehaviour. we find vfts 399 to be an aperiodic photometric variable with anapparent near-ir excess. its optical spectrum demonstrates complex emissionprofiles in the lower balmer series and select hei lines - taken together thesesuggest an oebe classification. the highly variable x-ray luminosity is toogreat to be produced by a single star, while the hard, non-thermal naturesuggests the presence of an accreting relativistic companion. finally, thedetection of periodic modulation of the x-ray lightcurve is most naturallyexplained under the assumption that the accretor is a neutron star. vfts 399appears to be the first high-mass x-ray binary identified within 30 dor.comparison of the current properties of vfts 399 to binary-evolution modelssuggests a progenitor mass in excess of 25msun for the putative neutron star,which may host a magnetic field comparable in strength to those of magnetars.vfts 399 is now the second member of the cohort of rapidly rotating `single'o-type stars in 30 dor to show evidence of binary interaction resulting inspin-up, suggesting that this may be a viable evolutionary pathway for theformation of a subset of this stellar population.

1507.02286	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xxi. stellar spin rates of o-type  spectroscopic binaries	the initial distribution of spin rates of massive stars is a fingerprint oftheir elusive formation process. it also sets a key initial condition forstellar evolution and is thus an important ingredient in stellar populationsynthesis. so far, most studies have focused on single stars. most o stars arehowever found in multiple systems. by establishing the spin-rate distributionof a sizeable sample of o-type spectroscopic binaries and by comparing thedistributions of binary sub-populations with one another as well as with thatof presumed single stars in the same region, we aim to constrain the initialspin distribution of o stars in binaries, and to identify signatures of thephysical mechanisms that affect the evolution of the massive stars spin rates.we use ground-based optical spectroscopy obtained in the framework of thevlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts) to establish the projected equatorialrotational velocities (\vrot) for components of 114 spectroscopic binaries in30 doradus. the \vrot\ values are derived from the full-width at half-maximum(fwhm) of a set of spectral lines, using a fwhm vs. \vrot\ calibration that wederive based on previous line analysis methods applied to single o-type starsin the vfts sample. the overall \vrot\ distribution of the primary starsresembles that of single o-type stars in the vfts, featuring a low-velocitypeak (at $\vrot &lt; 200$ kms) and a shoulder at intermediate velocities ($200 &lt;\vrot &lt; 300$ kms). the distributions of binaries and single stars howeverdiffer in two ways. first, the main peak at $\vrot \sim$100 kms is broader andslightly shifted toward higher spin rates in the binary distribution comparedto that of the presumed-single stars. second, the \vrot distribution ofprimaries lacks a significant population of stars spinning faster than 300 kmswhile such a population is clearly present in the single star sample.

astro-ph;0606403	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: mass loss and rotation of  early-type stars in the smc	we have studied the optical spectra of a sample of 31 o- and early b-typestars in the small magellanic cloud, 21 of which are associated with the youngmassive cluster ngc 346. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method. comparison with predictions of stellar evolution that accountfor stellar rotation does not result in a unique age, though most stars arebest represented by an age of 1-3 myr. the present day v_sini distribution ofthe 21 dwarf stars in our sample is consistent with an underlying rotationalvelocity (v_r) distribution that can be characterised by a mean velocity ofabout 160-190 km/s and an effective half width of 100-150 km/s. the v_rdistribution must include a small percentage of slowly rotating stars. ifpredictions of the time evolution of the equatorial velocity for massive starswithin the environment of the smc are correct, the young age of the clusterimplies that this underlying distribution is representative for the initialrotational velocity distribution. the location in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram of the stars showing helium enrichment is in qualitative agreement withevolutionary tracks accounting for rotation, but not for those ignoring v_r.the mass loss rates of the smc objects having luminosities of log l/l_sun &gt; 5.4are in excellent agreement with predictions. however, for lower luminositystars the winds are too weak to determine m_dot accurately from the opticalspectrum. two of three spectroscopically classified vz stars from our sampleare located close to the theoretical zero age main sequence, as expected.
