0904.1374	feedback through multiple outbursts in the cluster 2a 0335+096	we examine the core of the x-ray bright galaxy cluster 2a 0335+096 using deepchandra x-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, and include newradio observations. the set of around eight x-ray bright blobs in the core ofthe cluster, appearing like eggs in a bird's nest, contains multiphase gas from~0.5 to 2 kev. the morphology of the coolest x-ray emitting gas at 0.5 kevtemperature is similar to the halpha emitting nebula known in this cluster,which surrounds the central galaxy. xmm-newton grating spectra confirm thepresence of material at these temperatures, showing excellent agreement withchandra emission measures. on scales of 80 to 250 kpc there is a lowtemperature, high metallicity, swirl of intracluster medium as seen in otherclusters. in the core we find evidence for a further three x-ray cavities, inaddition to the two previously discovered. enhancements in 1.5 ghz radioemission are correlated with the x-ray cavities. the total 4pv enthalpyassociated with the cavities is around 5x10^59 erg. this energy would be enoughto heat the cooling region for ~5x10^7 yr. we find a maximum pressurediscontinuity of 26 per cent (2 sigma) across the surface brightness edge tothe south-west of the cluster core. this corresponds to an upper limit on themach number of the cool core with respect to its surroundings of 0.55.

0910.3793	deep high-resolution x-ray spectra from cool-core clusters	we examine deep xmm-newton reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) spectra fromthe cores of three x-ray bright cool core galaxy clusters, abell 262, abell3581 and hcg 62. each of the rgs spectra show fe xvii emission lines indicatingthe presence of gas around 0.5 kev. there is no evidence for o vii emissionwhich would imply gas at still cooler temperatures. the range in detected gastemperature in these objects is a factor of 3.7, 5.6 and 2 for abell 262, abell3581 and hcg 62, respectively. the coolest detected gas only has a volumefilling fraction of 6 and 3 per cent for abell 262 and abell 3581, but islikely to be volume filling in hcg 62. chandra spatially resolved spectroscopyconfirms the low volume filling fractions of the cool gas in abell 262 andabell 3581, indicating this cool gas exists as cold blobs. any volume heatingmechanism aiming to prevent cooling would overheat the surroundings of the coolgas by a factor of 4. if the gas is radiatively cooling below 0.5 kev, it iscooling at a rate at least an order of magnitude below that at highertemperatures in abell 262 and abell 3581 and two-orders of magnitude lower inhcg 62. the gas may be cooling non-radiatively through mixing in these coolblobs, where the energy released by cooling is emitted in the infrared. we findvery good agreement between smooth particle inference modelling of the clusterand conventional spectral fitting. comparing the temperature distribution fromthis analysis with that expected in a cooling flow, there appears to be a evenlarger break below 0.5 kev as compared with previous empirical descriptions ofthe deviations of cooling flow models.

0911.2339	the x-ray luminous cluster underlying the bright radio-quiet quasar  h1821+643	we present a chandra observation of the only low redshift, z=0.299, galaxycluster to contain a highly luminous radio-quiet quasar, h1821+643. bysimulating the quasar psf, we subtract the quasar contribution from the clustercore and determine the physical properties of the cluster gas down to 3 arcsec(15 kpc) from the point source. the temperature of the cluster gas decreasesfrom 9.0\pm0.5 kev down to 1.3\pm0.2 kev in the centre, with a short centralradiative cooling time of 1.0\pm0.1 gyr, typical of a strong cool-core cluster.the x-ray morphology in the central 100 kpc shows extended spurs of emissionfrom the core, a small radio cavity and a weak shock or cold front forming asemi-circular edge at 15 arcsec radius. the quasar bolometric luminosity wasestimated to be 2 x 10^{47} erg per sec, requiring a mass accretion rate of 40msolar per yr, which corresponds to half the eddington accretion rate. weexplore possible accretion mechanisms for this object and determine that bondiaccretion, when boosted by compton cooling of the accretion material, couldprovide a significant source of the fuel for this outburst. we considerh1821+643 in the context of a unified agn accretion model and, by comparingh1821+643 with a sample of galaxy clusters, we show that the quasar has notsignificantly affected the large-scale cluster gas properties.

1002.1056	star formation in the outer filaments of ngc 1275	we present photometry of the outer star clusters in ngc 1275, the brightestgalaxy in the perseus cluster. the observations were taken using the hubblespace telescope advanced camera for surveys. we focus on two stellar regions inthe south and south-east, far from the nucleus of the low velocity system (~22kpc). these regions of extended star formation trace the h alpha filaments,drawn out by rising radio bubbles. in both regions bimodal distributions ofcolour (b-r)_0 against magnitude are apparent, suggesting two populations ofstar clusters with different ages; most of the h alpha filaments show nodetectable star formation. the younger, bluer population is found to beconcentrated along the filaments while the older population is dispersed evenlyabout the galaxy. we construct colour-magnitude diagrams and derive ages of atmost 10^8 years for the younger population, a factor of 10 younger than theyoung population of star clusters in the inner regions of ngc 1275. we concludethat a formation mechanism or event different to that for the young innerpopulation is needed to explain the outer star clusters and suggest thatformation from the filaments, triggered by a buoyant radio bubble either risingabove or below these filaments, is the most likely mechanism.

1003.2719	a thermally stable heating mechanism for the intracluster medium:  turbulence, magnetic fields and plasma instabilities	we consider the problem of self-regulated heating and cooling in galaxyclusters and the implications for cluster magnetic fields and turbulence.viscous heating of a weakly collisional magnetised plasma is regulated by thepressure anisotropy with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field.the intracluster medium is a high-beta plasma, where pressure anisotropiescaused by the turbulent stresses and the consequent local changes in themagnetic field will trigger very fast microscale instabilities. we argue thatthe net effect of these instabilities will be to pin the pressure anisotropiesat a marginal level, controlled by the plasma beta parameter. this gives riseto local heating rates that turn out to be comparable to the radiative coolingrates. furthermore, we show that a balance between this heating andbremsstrahlung cooling is thermally stable, unlike the often conjecturedbalance between cooling and thermal conduction. given a sufficient (andprobably self-regulating) supply of turbulent power, this provides a physicalmechanism for mitigating cooling flows and preventing cluster core collapse.for observed density and temperature profiles, the assumed balance of viscousheating and radiative cooling allows us to predict magnetic-field strengths,turbulent velocities and turbulence scales as functions of distance from thecentre. specific predictions and comparisons with observations are given forseveral different clusters. our predictions can be further tested by futureobservations of cluster magnetic fields and turbulent velocities.

1003.5334	feedback under the microscope ii: heating, gas uplift, and mixing in the  nearest cluster core	using a combination of deep 574ks chandra data, xmm-newton high-resolutionspectra, and optical halpha+nii images, we study the nature and spatialdistribution of the multiphase plasma in m87. our results provide directobservational evidence of `radio mode' agn feedback in action, stripping thecentral galaxy of its lowest entropy gas and preventing star-formation. thislow entropy gas was entrained with and uplifted by the buoyantly risingrelativistic plasma, forming long "arms". these arms are likely oriented within15-30 degrees of our line-of-sight. the mass of the uplifted gas in the arms iscomparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpccore, demonstrating that the agn has a profound effect on its immediatesurroundings. the coolest x-ray emitting gas in m87 has a temperature of ~0.5kev and is spatially coincident with halpha+nii nebulae, forming a multiphasemedium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments. weplace strong upper limits of 0.06 msun/yr on the amount of plasma coolingradiatively from 0.5 kev and show that a uniform, volume-averaged heatingmechanism could not be preventing the cool gas from further cooling. all of thebright halpha filaments appear in the downstream region of the &lt;3 myr old shockfront, at smaller radii than ~0.6'. we suggest that shocks induce shearingaround the filaments, thereby promoting mixing of the cold gas with the ambienthot icm via instabilities. by bringing hot thermal particles into contact withthe cool, line-emitting gas, mixing can supply the power and ionizing particlesneeded to explain the observed optical spectra. mixing of the coolest x-rayemitting plasma with the cold optical line emitting filamentary gas promotesefficient conduction between the two phases, allowing non-radiative coolingwhich could explain the lack of x-ray gas with temperatures under 0.5 kev.

1004.1559	chandra observation of two shock fronts in the merging galaxy cluster  abell 2146	we present a new chandra observation of the galaxy cluster abell 2146 whichhas revealed a complex merging system with a gas structure that is remarkablysimilar to the bullet cluster (eg. markevitch et al. 2002). the x-ray image andtemperature map show a cool 2-3 kev subcluster with a ram pressure strippedtail of gas just exiting the disrupted 6-7 kev primary cluster. from the sharpjump in the temperature and density of the gas, we determine that thesubcluster is preceded by a bow shock with a mach number m=2.2+/-0.8,corresponding to a velocity v=2200^{+1000}_{-900} km/s relative to the maincluster. we estimate that the subcluster passed through the primary core only0.1-0.3 gyr ago. in addition, we observe a slower upstream shock propagatingthrough the outer region of the primary cluster and calculate a mach numberm=1.7+/-0.3. based on the measured shock mach numbers m~2 and the strength ofthe upstream shock, we argue that the mass ratio between the two mergingclusters is between 3 and 4 to one. by comparing the chandra observation withan archival hst observation, we find that a group of galaxies is located infront of the x-ray subcluster core but the brightest cluster galaxy is locatedimmediately behind the x-ray peak.

1006.5484	feedback under the microscope: thermodynamic structure and agn driven  shocks in m87	(abridged) using a deep chandra exposure (574 ks), we present high-resolutionthermodynamic maps created from the spectra of $\sim$16,000 independentregions, each with $\sim$1,000 net counts. the excellent spatial resolution ofthe thermodynamic maps reveals the dramatic and complex temperature, pressure,entropy and metallicity structure of the system. excluding the 'x-ray arms',the diffuse cluster gas at a given radius is strikingly isothermal. thissuggests either that the ambient cluster gas, beyond the arms, remainsrelatively undisturbed by agn uplift, or that conduction in the intraclustermedium (icm) is efficient along azimuthal directions. we confirm the presenceof a thick ($\sim$40 arcsec or $\sim$3 kpc) ring of high pressure gas at aradius of $\sim$180 arcsec ($\sim$14 kpc) from the central agn. we verify thatthis feature is associated with a classical shock front, with an average machnumber m = 1.25. another, younger shock-like feature is observed at a radius of$\sim$40 arcsec ($\sim$3 kpc) surrounding the central agn, with an estimatedmach number m &gt; 1.2. as shown previously, if repeated shocks occur every$\sim$10 myrs, as suggested by these observations, then agn driven weak shockscould produce enough energy to offset radiative cooling of the icm. a highsignificance enhancement of fe abundance is observed at radii 350 - 400 arcsec(27 - 31 kpc). this ridge is likely formed in the wake of the rising bubblesfilled with radio-emitting plasma that drag cool, metal-rich gas out of thecentral galaxy. we estimate that at least $\sim1.0\times10^6$ solar masses offe has been lifted and deposited at a radius of 350-400 arcsec; approximatelythe same mass of fe is measured in the x-ray bright arms, suggesting that asingle generation of buoyant radio bubbles may be responsible for the observedfe excess at 350 - 400 arcsec.

1008.3500	constraints on turbulent velocity broadening for a sample of clusters,  groups and elliptical galaxies using xmm-newton	using the width of emission lines in xmm-newton reflection gratingspectrometer spectra, we place direct constraints on the turbulent velocitiesof the x-ray emitting medium in the cores of 62 galaxy clusters, groups andelliptical galaxies. we find five objects where we can place an upper limit onthe line-of-sight broadening of 500 km/s (90 per cent confidence level), usinga single thermal component model. two other objects are lower than this limitwhen two thermal components are used. half of the objects examined have anupper limit on the velocity broadening of less than 700 km/s. to look forobjects which have significant turbulent broadening, we use chandra spectralmaps to compute the expected broadening caused by the spatial extent of thesource. comparing these with our observed results, we find that klemola 44 hasextra broadening at the level of 1500 km/s. rx j1347.5-1145 shows weak evidencefor turbulent velocities at 800 km/s. in addition we obtain limits onturbulence for zw3146, abell 496, abell 1795, abell 2204 and hcg 62 of lessthan 200 km/s. after subtraction of the spatial contribution and including a 50km/s systematic uncertainty, we find at least 15 sources with less than 20 percent of the thermal energy density in turbulence.

1105.1735	the energy source of the filaments around the giant galaxy ngc1275	the brightest galaxy in the nearby perseus cluster, ngc1275, is surrounded bya network of filaments. these were first observed through their halpha emissionbut are now known to have a large molecular component with a total massapproaching 10^11msun of gas. the filaments are embedded in hot intraclustergas and stretch over 80 kpc. they have an unusual low excitation spectrum whichis well modelled by collisional heating and ionization by secondary electrons.here we note that the surface radiative flux from the outer filaments is closeto the energy flux impacting on them from particles in the hot gas. we proposethat the secondary electrons within the cold filaments, which excite theobserved submillimetre through uv emission, are due to the hot surrounding gasefficiently penetrating the cold gas through reconnection diffusion. some ofthe soft x-ray emission seen from the filaments is then due to charge exchange,although this is insufficient to account for all the observed x-ray flux. thefilaments are complex with multiphase gas. interpenetration of hot and cold gasleads to the filaments growing in mass, at a rate of up to 100msunpyr. the lackof soft x-ray cooling emission in cool core clusters is then due to thenon-radiative cooling of hot gas on mixing with cold gas around and within thecentral galaxy.

1112.4848	the relation between line emission and brightest cluster galaxies in  three exceptional clusters: evidence for gas cooling from the icm	there is a strong spatial correlation between brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) and the peak density and cooling rate of the intra-cluster medium (icm).in this paper we combine integral field spectroscopy, co observations and x-raydata to study three exceptional clusters (abell 1991, abell 3444 and ophiuchus)where there is a physical and dynamical offset between the bcg and the coolingpeak to investigate the connection between the cooling of the intraclustermedium, the cold gas being deposited and the central galaxy. we find themajority of the optical line emission is spatially coincident with the peak inthe soft x-rays. in the case of a1991 we make separate detections of co(2-1)emission on the bcg and on the peak of the soft x-ray emission suggesting thatcooling continues to occur in the core despite being offset from the bcg. weconclude that there is a causal link between the lowest temperature (&lt; 2 kev)icm gas and the molecular gas(~ 30k). this link is only apparent in systemswhere a transitory event has decoupled the bcg from the soft x-ray peak. wediscuss the prospects for identifying more examples of this rare configuration.

1205.2374	multiphase signatures of agn feedback in abell 2597	we present new chandra x-ray observations of the brightest cluster galaxy(bcg) in the cool core cluster abell 2597. the data reveal an extensivekpc-scale x-ray cavity network as well as a 15 kpc filament of soft-excess gasexhibiting strong spatial correlation with archival vla radio data. in additionto several possible scenarios, multiwavelength evidence may suggest that thefilament is associated with multiphase (10^3 - 10^7 k) gas that has beenentrained and dredged-up by the propagating radio source. stemming from a fullspectral analysis, we also present profiles and 2d spectral maps of modeledx-ray temperature, entropy, pressure, and metal abundance. the maps reveal anarc of hot gas which in projection borders the inner edge of a large x-raycavity. although limited by strong caveats, we suggest that the hot arc may be(a) due to a compressed rim of cold gas pushed outward by the radio bubble or(b) morphologically and energetically consistent with cavity-driven activegalactic nucleus (agn) heating models invoked to quench cooling flows, in whichthe enthalpy of a buoyant x-ray cavity is locally thermalized as ambient gasrushes to refill its wake. if confirmed, this would be the first observationalevidence for this model.

1211.5606	the rapid evolution of agn feedback in brightest cluster galaxies:  switching from quasar-mode to radio-mode feedback	we present an analysis of the 2-10 kev x-ray emission associated with theactive galactic nuclei (agns) in brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). our sampleconsists of 32 bcgs that lie in highly x-ray luminous cluster of galaxies(l_x-ray (0.1-2.4 kev) &gt; 3*10^44 erg/s) in which agn-jetted outflows arecreating and sustaining clear xray cavities. our sample covers the redshiftrange 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 and reveals strong evolution in the nuclear x-rayluminosities, such that the black holes in these systems have become on averageat least 10 times fainter over the last 5 gyrs. mindful of potential selectioneffects, we propose two possible scenarios to explain our results: 1) eitherthat the agns in bcgs with x-ray cavities are steadily becoming fainter, ormore likely, 2) that the fraction of these bcgs with radiatively efficientnuclei is decreasing with time from roughly 60 per cent at z=0.6 to 30 per centat z=0.1. based on this strong evolution, we predict that a significantfraction of bcgs in z=1 clusters may host quasars at their centres, potentiallycomplicating the search for such clusters at high redshift. in analogy withblack-hole binaries and based on the observed eddington ratios of our sources,we further propose that the evolving agn population in bcgs with x-ray cavitiesmay be transiting from a canonical low/hard state, analogous to that of x-raybinaries, to a quiescent state over the last 5 gyrs.

1301.1800	x-ray emission from the ultramassive black hole candidate ngc1277:  implications and speculation on its origin	we study the x-ray emission from ngc1277, a galaxy in the core of the perseuscluster, for which van den bosch et al. have recently claimed the presence ofan ultramassive black hole (umbh) of mass 1.7 times 10^10 msun, unless the imfof the stars in the stellar bulge is extremely bottom heavy. the x-raysoriginate in a power-law component of luminosity 1.3 times 10^40 erg/s embeddedin a 1 kev thermal minicorona which has a half-light radius of about 360 pc,typical of many early-type galaxies in rich clusters of galaxies. if bondiaccretion operated onto the umbh from the minicorona with a radiativeefficiency of 10 per cent, then the object would appear as a quasar withluminosity 10^46 erg/s, a factor of almost 10^6 times higher than observed. theaccretion flow must be highly radiatively inefficient, similar to past resultson m87 and ngc3115. the umbh in ngc1277 is definitely not undergoing anysignificant growth at the present epoch. we note that there are 3 umbhcandidates in the perseus cluster and that the inferred present mean massdensity in umbh could be 10^5 msun/mpc^3, which is 20 to 30 per cent of theestimated mean mass density of all black holes. we speculate on the impliedgrowth of umbh and their hosts, and discuss the possibiity that extreme agnfeedback could make all umbh host galaxies have low stellar masses at redshiftsaround 3. only those which end up at the centres of groups and clusters lateraccrete large stellar envelopes and become brightest cluster galaxies. ngc1277and the other perseus core umbh, ngc1270, have not however been able to gathermore stars or gas owing to their rapid orbital motion in the cluster core.

1302.4140	thermodynamics of the coma cluster outskirts	we present results from a large mosaic of suzaku observations of the comacluster, the nearest and x-ray brightest hot, dynamically active, non-cool coresystem, focusing on the thermodynamic properties of the icm on large scales.for azimuths not aligned with an infalling subcluster towards the southwest,our measured temperature and x-ray brightness profiles exhibit broadlyconsistent radial trends, with the temperature decreasing from about 8.5 kev atthe cluster center to about 2 kev at a radius of 2 mpc, which is the edge ofour detection limit. the sw merger significantly boosts the surface brightness,allowing us to detect x-ray emission out to ~2.2 mpc along this direction.apart from the southwestern infalling subcluster, the surface brightnessprofiles show multiple edges around radii of 30-40 arcmin. the azimuthallyaveraged temperature profile, as well as the deprojected density and pressureprofiles, all show a sharp drop consistent with an outward propagating shockfront located at 40 arcmin, corresponding to the outermost edge of the giantradio halo observed at 352 mhz with the wsrt. the shock front may be poweringthis radio emission. a clear entropy excess inside of r_500 reflects theviolent merging events linked with these morphological features. beyond r_500,the entropy profiles of the coma cluster along the relatively relaxeddirections are consistent with the power-law behavior expected from simplemodels of gravitational large-scale structure formation. the pressure is alsoin agreement at these radii with the expected values measured from sz data fromthe planck satellite. however, due to the large uncertainties associated withthe coma cluster measurements, we cannot yet exclude an entropy flattening inthis system consistent with that seen in more relaxed cool core clusters.

1305.0050	a multi-wavelength view of cooling vs. agn heating in the x-ray luminous  cool-core of abell 3581	we report the results of a multi-wavelength study of the nearby galaxy group,abell 3581 (z=0.0218). this system hosts the most luminous cool core of anynearby group and exhibits active radio mode feedback from the super-massiveblack hole in its brightest group galaxy, ic 4374. the brightest galaxy hassuffered multiple active galactic nucleus outbursts, blowing bubbles into thesurrounding hot gas, which have resulted in the uplift of cool ionised gas intothe surrounding hot intragroup medium. high velocities, indicative of anoutflow, are observed close to the nucleus and coincident with the radio jet.thin dusty filaments accompany the uplifted, ionised gas. no extended starformation is observed, however, a young cluster is detected just north of thenucleus. the direction of rise of the bubbles has changed between outbursts.this directional change is likely due to sloshing motions of the intragroupmedium. these sloshing motions also appear to be actively stripping the x-raycool core, as indicated by a spiraling cold front of high metallicity, lowtemperature, low entropy gas.

1305.7046	searching for the missing iron in the core of the centaurus cluster	we re-analyse a combined 198 ks chandra observation of ngc4696, the brightestgalaxy of the centaurus cluster. we extract temperature and metallicityprofiles from the data, and we confirm the presence of a sharp drop in ironabundance, from ~1.8 zsolar to ~0.4 zsolar, within the central 5 kpc of thecluster. we estimate that this abundance drop corresponds to a total "missing"iron mass of 1.4e06 msolar. we propose that part of this missing iron is lockedup in cool (~19 k) far-ir emitting dust, as found by spitzer and herschelobservations. this can occur if the iron injected by stellar mass loss in thecentral region is in grains, which remain in that form as the injected dustycold gas mixes and joins the cold dusty filamentary nebula observed within thesame region. the bubbling feedback process observed in the cluster core thendrags filaments outward and dumps them at 10-20 kpc radius, where themetallicity is high.

1306.2322	the hot and energetic universe: the astrophysics of galaxy groups and  clusters	as the nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies trace the large-scaledistribution of matter in the universe. they are thus privileged sites in whichto investigate the complex physics of structure formation. however, thecomplete story of how these structures grow, and how they dissipate thegravitational and non-thermal components of their energy budget over cosmictime, is still beyond our grasp. fundamental questions such as how do hotdiffuse baryons accrete and dynamically evolve in dark matter potentials? howand when was the energy that we observe in the icm generated and distributed?where and when are heavy elements produced and how are they circulated? arestill unanswered. most of the cluster baryons exists in the form of a diffuse,hot, metal-enriched plasma that radiates primarily in the x-ray band (theintracluster medium, icm), allowing the x-ray observations of the evolvingcluster population to provide a unique opportunity to address these topics.athena+ with its large collecting area and unprecedented combination of highspectral and angular resolution offers the only way to make major advances inanswering these questions. athena+ will show how the baryonic gas evolves inthe dark matter potential wells by studying the motions and turbulence in theicm. athena+ will be able to resolve the accreting region both spatially andspectroscopically, probing the true nature and physical state of the x-rayemitting plasma. athena+ has the capabilities to permit a definitiveunderstanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structurethrough the study of the cluster population.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

1307.3592	azimuthally resolved x-ray spectroscopy to the edge of the perseus  cluster	we present the results from extensive, new observations of the perseuscluster of galaxies, obtained as a suzaku key project. the 85 pointingsanalyzed span eight azimuthal directions out to 2 degrees = 2.6 mpc, to andbeyond the virial radius r_200 ~ 1.8 mpc, offering the most detailed x-rayobservation of the intracluster medium (icm) at large radii in any cluster todate. the azimuthally averaged density profile for r&gt;0.4r_200 is relativelyflat, with a best-fit power-law index of 1.69+/-0.13 significantly smaller thanexpected from numerical simulations. the entropy profile in the outskirts liessystematically below the power-law behavior expected from large-scale structureformation models which include only the heating associated with gravitationalcollapse. the pressure profile beyond ~0.6r_200 shows an excess with respect tothe best-fit model describing the sz measurements for a sample of clustersobserved with planck. the inconsistency between the expected and measureddensity, entropy, and pressure profiles can be explained primarily by anoverestimation of the density due to inhomogeneous gas distribution in theoutskirts; there is no evidence for a bias in the temperature measurementswithin the virial radius. we find significant differences in thermodynamicproperties of the icm at large radii along the different arms. along thecluster minor axis, we find a flattening of the entropy profiles outside~0.6r_200, while along the major axis, the entropy rises all the way to theoutskirts. correspondingly, the inferred gas clumping factor is typicallylarger along the minor than along the major axis.

0801.4253	the weak shock in the core of the perseus cluster	the dissipation of energy from sound waves and weak shocks is one of the mostpromising mechanisms for coupling agn activity to the surrounding intraclustermedium (icm), and so offsetting cooling in cluster cores. we present a detailedanalysis of the weak shock found in deep chandra observations of the perseuscluster core. a comparison of the spectra either side of the shock front showsthat they are very similar. by performing a deprojection analysis of a sectorcontaining the shock, we produce temperature and density profiles across theshock front. these show no evidence for a temperature jump coincident with thedensity jump. to understand this result, we model the shock formation using 1dhydrodynamic simulations including models with thermal conduction and gamma &lt;5/3 gas. these models do not agree well with the data, suggesting that furtherphysics is needed to explain the shock structure. we suggest that aninteraction between the shock and the h-alpha filaments could have asignificant effect on cooling the post-shock gas.  we also calculate the thermal energy liberated by the weak shock. the totalenergy in the shocked region is about 3.5 times the work needed to inflate thebubbles adiabatically, and the power of the shock is around 6x10^44 erg/s perbubble, just over 10^45 erg/s in total.

1410.4566	implications of coronal line emission in ngc 4696	we announce a new facility in the spectral code cloudy that enables trackingthe evolution of a cooling parcel of gas with time. for gas cooling fromtemperatures relevant to galaxy clusters, earlier calculations estimated the[fe xiv] {\lambda}5303 / [fe x] {\lambda}6375 luminosity ratio, a criticaldiagnostic of a cooling plasma, to slightly less than unity. by contrast, ourcalculations predict a ratio ~3. we revisit recent optical coronal lineobservations along the x-ray cool arc around ngc 4696 by canning et al. (2011),which detected [fe x] {\lambda}6375, but not [fe xiv] {\lambda}5303. we showthat these observations are not consistent with predictions of cooling flowmodels. differential extinction could in principle account for theobservations, but it requires extinction levels (a_v &gt; 3.625) incompatible withprevious observations. the non-detection of [fe xiv] implies a temperatureceiling of 2.1 million k. assuming cylindrical geometry and transonic turbulentpressure support, we estimate the gas mass at ~1 million solar masses. thecoronal gas is cooling isochorically. we propose that the coronal gas has notcondensed out of the intracluster medium, but instead is the conductive ormixing interface between the x-ray plume and the optical filaments. we presenta number of emission lines that may be pursued to test this hypothesis andconstrain the amount of intermediate temperature gas in the system.

1410.6485	turbulent heating in galaxy clusters brightest in x-rays	the hot, x-ray-emitting intracluster medium (icm) is the dominant baryonicconstituent of clusters of galaxies. in the cores of many clusters, radiativeenergy losses from the icm occur on timescales significantly shorter than theage of the system. unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulationsof cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations.various sources of energy capable of compensating these cooling losses havebeen proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holesin the central galaxies through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma.regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy istransferred to the icm has remained open. here we present a plausible solutionto this question based on deep chandra x-ray observatory data and a newdata-analysis method that enables us to evaluate directly the icm heating ratedue to the dissipation of turbulence. we find that turbulent heating issufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locallyat each radius - it might therefore be the key element in resolving the gascooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in atmospheres of x-raygas-rich systems.

1501.07271	gas density fluctuations in the perseus cluster: clumping factor and  velocity power spectrum	x-ray surface brightness fluctuations in the core of the perseus cluster areanalyzed, using deep observations with the chandra observatory. the amplitudeof gas density fluctuations on different scales is measured in a set of radialannuli. it varies from 8 to 12 per cent on scales of ~10-30 kpc within radii of30-160 kpc from the cluster center and from 9 to 7 per cent on scales of ~20-30kpc in an outer, 60-220 kpc annulus. using a statistical linear relationbetween the observed amplitude of density fluctuations and predicted velocity,the characteristic velocity of gas motions on each scale is calculated. thetypical amplitudes of the velocity outside the central 30 kpc region are 90-140km/s on ~20-30 kpc scales and 70-100 km/s on smaller scales ~7-10 kpc. thevelocity power spectrum is consistent with cascade of turbulence and its slopeis in a broad agreement with the slope for canonical kolmogorov turbulence. thegas clumping factor estimated from the power spectrum of the densityfluctuations is lower than 7-8 per cent for radii ~30-220 kpc from the center,leading to a density bias of less than 3-4 per cent in the cluster core.uncertainties of the analysis are examined and discussed. future measurementsof the gas velocities with the astro-h, athena and smart-x observatories willdirectly measure the gas density-velocity perturbation relation and furtherreduce systematic uncertainties in these quantities.

1506.06429	deep chandra observation and numerical studies of the nearest cluster  cold front in the sky	we present the results of a very deep (500 ks) chandra observation, alongwith tailored numerical simulations, of the nearest, best resolved cluster coldfront in the sky, which lies 90 kpc (19 arcmin) to the north-west of m 87. thenorthern part of the front appears the sharpest, with a width smaller than 2.5kpc (1.5 coulomb mean free paths; at 99 per cent confidence). everywhere alongthe front, the temperature discontinuity is narrower than 4-8 kpc and themetallicity gradient is narrower than 6 kpc, indicating that diffusion,conduction and mixing are suppressed across the interface. such transportprocesses can be naturally suppressed by magnetic fields aligned with the coldfront. interestingly, comparison to magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicatesthat in order to maintain the observed sharp density and temperaturediscontinuities, conduction must also be suppressed along the magnetic fieldlines. however, the northwestern part of the cold front is observed to have anon-zero width. while other explanations are possible, the broadening isconsistent with the presence of kelvin-helmholtz instabilities (khi) onlength-scales of a few kpc. based on comparison with simulations, the presenceof khi would imply that the effective viscosity of the intracluster medium issuppressed by more than an order of magnitude with respect to the isotropicspitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity. underneath the cold front, weobserve quasi-linear features that are ~10 per cent brighter than thesurrounding gas and are separated by ~15 kpc from each other in projection.comparison to tailored numerical simulations suggests that the observedphenomena may be due to the amplification of magnetic fields by gas sloshing inwide layers below the cold front, where the magnetic pressure reaches ~5-10 percent of the thermal pressure, reducing the gas density between the brightfeatures.

1508.01037	x-ray analysis of filaments in galaxy clusters	we perform a detailed x-ray study of the filaments surrounding the brightestcluster galaxies in a sample of nearby galaxy clusters using deep chandraobservations, namely the perseus, centaurus and virgo clusters, and abell 1795.we compare the x-ray properties and spectra of the filaments in all of thesesystems, and find that their chandra x-ray spectra are all broadly consistentwith an absorbed two temperature thermal model, with temperature components at0.75 and 1.7 kev. we find that it is also possible to model the chandra acisfilament spectra with a charge exchange model provided a thermal component isalso present, and the abundance of oxygen is suppressed relative to theabundance of fe. in this model, charge exchange provides the dominantcontribution to the spectrum in the 0.5-1.0 kev band. however, when we studythe high spectral resolution rgs spectrum of the filamentary plume seen inx-rays in centaurus, the opposite appears to be the case. the properties of thefilaments in our sample of clusters are also compared to the x-ray tails ofgalaxies in the coma cluster and abell 3627. in the perseus cluster, we searchfor signs of absorption by a prominent region of molecular gas in thefilamentary structure around ngc 1275. we do find a decrement in the x-rayspectrum below 2 kev, indicative of absorption. however the spectral shape isinconsistent with this decrement being caused by simply adding an additionalabsorbing component. we find that the spectrum can be well fit (with physicallysensible parameters) with a model that includes both absorption by moleculargas and x-ray emission from the filament, which partially counteracts theabsorption.

1508.04285	constraining gas motions in the centaurus cluster using x-ray surface  brightness fluctuations and metal diffusion	we compare two different methods of constraining the characteristic velocityand spatial scales of gas motions in the x-ray bright, nearby centauruscluster, using new deep (760ks) chandra observations. the power spectrum ofexcess surface brightness fluctuations in the 0.5-6.0 kev band in a sector tothe west is measured and compared to theoretical expectations for kolmogorovindex fluctuations. the observed power spectrum is flatter than theseexpectations, and the surface brightness fluctuations are around the 8 percentlevel on length scales of 2 kpc. we convert the 2d power spectrum offluctuations into a 3d power spectrum using the method of churazov et al., andthen convert this into constraints on the one-component velocity of the gasmotions as a function of their length scale. we find one-component velocitiesin the range 100-150 km/s on spatial scales of 4-10 kpc. an independentconstraint on the characteristic velocity and length scales of the gas motionsis then found by considering the diffusion coefficient needed to explain thedistribution of metals in the centaurus cluster, combined with the need tobalance the rate of gas cooling with the rate of heat dissipated by the gasmotions. we find that these two methods of constraining the velocity and lengthscales of the gas motions are in good agreement.

1509.04275	investigating the cores of fossil systems with chandra	we investigate the cores of fossil galaxy groups and clusters (`fossilsystems') using archival chandra data for a sample of 17 fossil systems. wedetermined the cool-core fraction for fossils via three observable diagnostics,the central cooling time, cuspiness, and concentration parameter. we quantifiedthe dynamical state of the fossils by the x-ray peak/brightest cluster galaxy(bcg), and the x-ray peak/emission weighted centre separations. we studied thex-ray emission coincident with the bcg to detect the presence of potentialthermal coronae. a deprojection analysis was performed for z &lt; 0.05 fossils toobtain cooling time and entropy profiles, and to resolve subtle temperaturestructures. we investigated the lx-t relation for fossils from the 400dcatalogue to see if the scaling relation deviates from that of other groups.  most fossils are identified as cool-core objects via at least two cool-corediagnostics. all fossils have their dominant elliptical galaxy within 50 kpc ofthe x-ray peak, and most also have the emission weighted centre within thatdistance. we do not see clear indications of a x-ray corona associated with thebcg unlike that has been observed for some other objects. fossils do not haveuniversal temperature profiles, with some low-temperature objects lackingfeatures that are expected for ostensibly relaxed objects with a cool-core. theentropy profiles of the z &lt; 0.05 fossil systems can be well-described by apower law model, albeit with indices smaller than 1. the 400d fossils lx-trelation shows indications of an elevated normalisation with respect to othergroups, which seems to persist even after factoring in selection effects.

0705.2712	a deeper x-ray study of the core of the perseus galaxy cluster: the  power of sound waves and the distribution of metals and cosmic rays	we make a further study of the very deep chandra observation of the x-raybrightest galaxy cluster, a426 in perseus. we examine the radial distributionof energy flux inferred by the quasi-concentric ripples in surface brightness,assuming they are due to sound waves, and show that it is a significantfraction of the energy lost by radiative cooling within the inner 75-100 kpc,where the cooling time is 4-5 gyr, respectively. the wave flux decreasesoutward with radius, consistent with energy being dissipated. some newlydiscovered large ripples beyond 100 kpc, and a possible intact bubble at 170kpc radius, may indicate a larger level of activity by the nucleus a few 100myr ago. the distribution of metals in the intracluster gas peaks at a radiusof about 40 kpc and is significantly clumpy on scales of 5 kpc. the temperaturedistribution of the soft x-ray filaments and the hard x-ray emission componentfound within the inner 50 kpc are analysed in detail. the pressure due to thenonthermal electrons, responsible for a spectral component interpreted asinverse compton emission, is high within 40 kpc of the centre and boosts thepower in sound waves there; it drops steeply beyond 40 kpc. we find no thermalemission from the radio bubbles; in order for any thermal gas to have a fillingfactor within the bubbles exceeding 50 per cent, the temperature of that gashas to exceed 50 kev.

astro-ph;0011500	adaptive binning of x-ray galaxy cluster images	we present a simple method for adaptively binning the pixels in an image. thealgorithm groups pixels into bins of size such that the fractional error on thephoton count in a bin is less than or equal to a threshold value, and the sizeof the bin is as small as possible. the process is particularly useful forgenerating surface brightness and colour maps, with clearly defined error maps,from images with a large dynamic range of counts, for example x-ray images ofgalaxy clusters. we demonstrate the method in application to data from chandraacis-s and acis-i observations of the perseus cluster of galaxies. we use thealgorithm to create intensity maps, and colour images which show the relativex-ray intensities in different bands. the colour maps can later be converted,through spectral models, into maps of physical parameters, such as temperature,column density, etc. the adaptive binning algorithm is applicable to a widerange of data, from observations or numerical simulations, and is not limitedto two-dimensional data.

astro-ph;0510247	the low-power nucleus of pks 1246-410 in the centaurus cluster	we present chandra, very large array (vla), and very long baseline array(vlba) observations of the nucleus of ngc 4696, a giant elliptical in thecentaurus cluster of galaxies. like m87 in the virgo cluster, pks 1246-410 inthe centaurus cluster is a nearby example of a radio galaxy in a dense clusterenvironment. in analyzing the new x-ray data we have found a compact x-rayfeature coincident with the optical and radio core. while nuclear emission fromthe x-ray source is expected, its luminosity is low, &lt;10^{40} erg/s. weestimate the bondi accretion radius to be 30 pc and the accretion rate to be0.01 m_sun/yr which under the canonical radiative efficiency of 10% wouldoverproduce by 3.5 orders of magnitude the radiative luminosity. much of thisenergy can be directed into the kinetic energy of the jet, which over timeinflates the observed cavities seen in the thermal gas. the vlba observationsreveal a weak nucleus and a broad, one-sided jet extending over 25 parsecs inposition angle -150 degrees. this jet is deflected on the kpc-scale to a moreeast-west orientation (position angle of -80 degrees).

astro-ph;0510476	a very deep chandra observation of the perseus cluster: shocks, ripples  and conduction	we present the first results from a very deep chandra x-ray observation ofthe core of the perseus cluster of galaxies. a pressure map reveals a clearthick band of high pressure around the inner radio bubbles. the gas in the bandmust be expanding outward and the sharp front to it is identified as a shockfront, yet we see no temperature jump across it; indeed there is more softemission behind the shock than in front of it. we conclude that in this innerregion either thermal conduction operates efficiently or the co-existingrelativistic plasma seen as the radio mini-halo is mediating the shock. ifcommon, isothermal shocks in cluster cores mean that we cannot diagnose theexpansion speed of radio bubbles from temperature measurements alone. they canat times expand more rapidly than currently assumed without producingsignificant regions of hot gas. bubbles may also be significantly moreenergetic. the pressure ripples found in earlier images are identified asisothermal sound waves. a simple estimate based on their amplitude confirmsthat they can be an effective distributed heat source able to balance radiativecooling. we see multiphase gas with about 10^9 msun at a temperature of about0.5 kev. much, but not all, of this cooler gas is spatially associated with theoptical filamentary nebula around the central galaxy, ngc 1275. a residualcooling flow of about 50 msun/yr may be taking place. a channel is found in thepressure map along the path of the bubbles, with indications found of outerbubbles. the channel connects in the s with a curious cold front.

astro-ph;0512022	precession of the super-massive black hole in ngc 1275 (3c 84)?	the x-ray holes at the centre of the perseus cluster of galaxies are not allat the same position angle with respect to the centre of the cluster. thisconfiguration would result if the jet inflating the bubbles is precessing, ormoving around, and the bubbles detach at different times. the orientationswhich best fit the observed travel directions are an inclination of theprecession axis to the line of sight of 120 degrees and an opening angle of 50degrees. from the timescales for the bubbles seen in the cluster, theprecession timescale, t_prec, is around 3.3x10^7 yrs. the bubbles rising upthrough different parts of the cluster may have interacted with the centralcool gas, forming the whorl of cool gas observed in the temperature structureof the cluster. the dynamics of bubbles rising in fluids is discussed. theconditions present in the cluster are such that oscillatory motion, observedfor bubbles rising in fluids on earth, should take place. however the timescalefor this motion is longer than that taken for the bubbles to evolve intospherical cap bubbles, which do not undergo a path instability, so such motionis not expected to occur.

astro-ph;0603350	cold molecular gas in the perseus cluster core - association with x-ray  cavity, halpha filaments and cooling flow -	cold molecular gas has been recently detected in several cooling flowclusters of galaxies where huge optical nebulosities often stand. these opticalfilaments are tightly linked to the cooling flow and to the related phenomena,like the rising bubbles of relativistic plasma, fed by the radio jets. wepresent here a map in the co(2-1) rotational line of the cold molecular gasassociated with some halpha filaments surrounding the central galaxy of theperseus cluster: ngc 1275. the map, extending to about 50 kpc (135 arcsec) fromthe center of the galaxy, has been made with the 18-receiver array hera, at thefocus of the iram 30m telescope. although most of the cold gas is concentratedto the center of the galaxy, the co emission is also clearly associated to theextended filaments conspicuous in ionised gas and could trace a possiblereservoir fueling the star formation there. some of the co emission is alsofound where the x-ray gas could cool down more efficiently: at the rims of thecentral x-ray cavity (where the hot gas is thought to have been pushed out andcompressed by the central agn expanding radio lobes). the co global kinematicsdoes not show any rotation in ngc 1275. the cold gas is probably a mixture ofgas falling down on the central galaxy and of uplifted gas dragged out by arising bubble in the intracluster medium. as recenlty suggested in othercluster cores, the cold gas peculiar morphology and kinematics argue for thepicture of an intermittent cooling flow scenario where the central agn plays animportant role.

astro-ph;0604575	resonance scattering, absorption and off-centre abundance peaks in  clusters of galaxies	a possible explanation for the central abundance dips found fromspatially-resolved x-ray spectroscopy of several groups and clusters ofgalaxies is resonance scattering. a number of the prominent iron emission linesare resonance lines. we construct a unique spectral model which takes accountof resonance scattering for several thousand resonance lines, projectioneffects, photoelectric absorption, and allows direct spectral fitting. we applyour model to chandra observations of two clusters with pronounced centralabundance dips, centaurus and abell 2199. the results show that the effect ofresonance scattering on emission from the centre of the cluster can be as muchas 30 per cent for the fe-k resonance lines, and 10 per cent for several fe-llines, if turbulence is low. the change to the metallicities obtained byfitting low resolution ccd spectra is at most 10 per cent. accounting forresonance scattering does not remove the central dip. allowing for internalabsorption within the centaurus significantly improves the quality of the fits,indicating the presence of absorbing material within the inner 40 kpc of ngc4696.

astro-ph;0607113	enrichment in the centaurus cluster of galaxies	we perform a detailed spatially-resolved, spectroscopic, analysis of the coreof the centaurus cluster of galaxies using a deep chandra x-ray observation andxmm-newton data. the centaurus cluster core has particularly high metallicity,upto twice solar values, and we measure the abundances of fe, o, ne, mg, si, s,ar, ca and ni. we map the distribution of these elements in many spatialregions,and create radial profiles to the east and west of the centre. theratios of the most robustly determined elements to iron are consistent withsolar ratios, indicating that there has been enrichment by both type ia andtype ii supernovae. for a normal initial stellar mass function it representsthe products of about 4x10^10 solar masses of star formation. this starformation can have occured either continuously at a rate of 5 solar masses peryear for the past 8 gyr or more,or was part of the formation of the centralgalaxy at earlier times. either conclusion requires that the inner core of thecentaurus cluster has not suffered a major disruption within the past 8 gyr, oreven longer.

astro-ph;0611210	hard x-ray emission from the core of the perseus cluster and the thermal  content of the radio bubbles	we use a very deep 900 ks chandra x-ray observation of the core of theperseus cluster to measure and confirm the hard x-ray emission detected from aprevious analysis. by fitting a model made up of multiple temperaturecomponents plus a powerlaw or hot thermal component, we map the spatialdistribution of the hard flux. we confirm there is a strong hard excess withinthe central regions. the total luminosity in the 2-10 kev band inside 3 arcminradius is ~5x10^43 erg s^-1. as a second project we place limits on the thermalgas content of the x-ray cavities in the cluster core. this is done by fittinga model made up of multiple components to spectra from inside and outside ofthe bubbles, and looking at the the difference in strength of a component at aparticular temperature. this approach avoids assumptions about the geometry ofthe core of the cluster. only up to 50 per cent of the volume of the cavitiescan be filled with thermal gas with a temperature of 50 kev.

astro-ph;0612426	heating and cooling in the perseus cluster core	it is well known that the radiative cooling time of the hot x-ray emittinggas in the cores of most clusters of galaxies is less than 10^10 yr. in manyclusters the gas temperature also drops towards the centre. if we draw a causalconnection between these two properties then we infer the presence of a coolingflow onto the central galaxy. high spectral resolution xmm-newton data and highspatial resolution chandra data, show however a lack of x-ray emitting gasbelow about one third of the cluster virial temperature. the explanation isthat some form of heating balances cooling. the smoothness and similarity ofthe cooling time profiles and the flatness of the required heating profiles allindicate that we must seek a relatively gentle, quasi-continuous (on timescales&lt;10^8 yr), distributed heat source. the likely such source is the central blackhole and its powerful jets which create bubble-like cavities in the inner hotgas. we briefly review the general heating and cooling statistics in an x-raybright sample of cluster before we discuss the detailed situation in theperseus cluster, the x-ray brightest cluster in the sky.

0811.0743	giant cavities, cooling and metallicity substructure in abell 2204	we present results from deep chandra and xmm-newton observations of therelaxed x-ray luminous galaxy cluster abell 2204. we detect metallicityinhomogeneities in the intracluster medium on a variety of distance scales,from a ~12 kpc enhancement containing a few times 10^7 msun of iron in thecentre, to a region at 400 kpc radius with an excess of a few times 10^9 msun.subtracting an average surface brightness profile from the x-ray image yieldstwo surface brightness depressions to the north and south of the cluster. theirmorphology is similar to the cavities observed in cluster cores, but they haveradii of 240 kpc and 160 kpc and have a total enthalpy of 2x10^62 erg. if theyare fossil radio bubbles, their buoyancy timescales imply a total mechanicalheating power of 5x10^46 erg/s, the largest such bubble heating power known.more likely, they result from the accumulation of many past bubbles.energetically this is more feasible, as the enthalpy of these regions couldcombat x-ray cooling in this cluster to 500 kpc radius for around 2 gyr. thecore of the cluster also contains five to seven ~4 kpc radius surfacebrightness depressions that are not associated with the observed radioemission. if they are bubbles generated by the nucleus, they are too small tobalance cooling in the core by an order of magnitude. however if the radio axisis close to the line of sight, projection effects may mask more normal bubbles.using rgs spectra we detect a fexvii line. spectral fitting revealstemperatures down to ~0.7 kev; the cluster therefore shows a range in x-raytemperature of at least a factor of 15. the quantity of low temperature gas isconsistent with a mass deposition rate of 65 msun/yr.
