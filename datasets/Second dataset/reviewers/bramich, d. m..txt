0706.2566	an anomaly detector with immediate feedback to hunt for planets of earth  mass and below by microlensing	(abridged) the discovery of ogle 2005-blg-390lb, the first cool rocky/icyexoplanet, impressively demonstrated the sensitivity of the microlensingtechnique to extra-solar planets below 10 m_earth. a planet of 1 m_earth in thesame spot would have provided a detectable deviation with an amplitude of ~ 3 %and a duration of ~ 12 h. an early detection of a deviation could triggerhigher-cadence sampling which would have allowed the discovery of an earth-massplanet in this case. here, we describe the implementation of an automatedanomaly detector, embedded into the estar system, that profits from immediatefeedback provided by the robotic telescopes that form the robonet-1.0 network.it went into operation for the 2007 microlensing observing season. as part ofour discussion about an optimal strategy for planet detection, we shed some newlight on whether concentrating on highly-magnified events is promising andplanets in the 'resonant' angular separation equal to the angular einsteinradius are revealed most easily. given that sub-neptune mass planets can beconsidered being common around the host stars probed by microlensing(preferentially m- and k-dwarfs), the higher number of events that can bemonitored with a network of 2m telescopes and the increased detectionefficiency for planets below 5 m_earth arising from an optimized strategy givesa common effort of current microlensing campaigns a fair chance to detect anearth-mass planet (from the ground) ahead of the corot or kepler missions. thedetection limit of gravitational microlensing extends even below 0.1 m_earth,but such planets are not very likely to be detected from current campaigns.however, these will be within the reach of high-cadence monitoring with anetwork of wide-field telescopes or a space-based telescope.

0904.1012	kinematics of sdss subdwarfs: structure and substructure of the milky  way halo	we construct a new sample of ~1700 solar neighbourhood halo subdwarfs fromthe sloan digital sky survey, selected using a reduced proper motion diagram.radial velocities come from the sdss spectra and proper motions from thelight-motion curve catalogue of bramich et al. (2008). using a photometricparallax relation to estimate distances gives us the full phase-spacecoordinates. typical velocity errors are in the range 30-50 km/s. this halosample is one of the largest constructed to-date and the disc contamination isat a level of &lt; 1 per cent. this enables us to calculate the halo velocitydispersion to excellent accuracy. we find that the velocity dispersion tensoris aligned in spherical polar coordinates and that (sigma_r, sigma_phi,sigma_theta) = (143 \pm 2, 82 \pm 2, 77 \pm 2) km/s. the stellar halo exhibitsno net rotation, although the distribution of v_phi shows tentative evidencefor asymmetry. the kinematics are consistent with a mildly flattened stellardensity falling with distance like r^{-3.75}. using the full phase-spacecoordinates, we look for signs of kinematic substructure in the stellar halo.we find evidence for four discrete overdensities localised in angular momentumand suggest that they may be possible accretion remnants. the most prominent isthe solar neighbourhood stream previously identified by helmi et al. (1999),but the remaining three are new. one of these overdensities is potentiallyassociated with a group of four globular clusters (ngc5466, ngc6934, m2 andm13) and raises the possibility that these could have been accreted as part ofa much larger progenitor.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.5112	investigation of variable star candidates in the globular cluster ngc  5024 (m53)	we have performed a careful investigation of the 74 candidate variable starspresented by safanova &amp; stalin (2011). for this purpose we used our data baseof imaging and light curves from arellano ferro et al.

1205.5409	systematic trends in sloan digital sky survey photometric data	we investigate the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) photometry from datarelease 8 (dr8) in the search for systematic trends that still exist after thecalibration effort of padmanabhan et al. we consider both the aperture andpoint-spread function (psf) magnitudes in dr8. using the objects with repeatobservations, we find that a large proportion of the aperture magnitudes suffera ~0.2-2% systematic trend as a function of psf full-width half-maximum (fwhm),the amplitude of which increases for fainter objects. analysis of the psfmagnitudes reveals more complicated systematic trends of similar amplitude as afunction of psf fwhm and object brightness. we suspect that skyover-subtraction is the cause of the largest amplitude trends as a function ofpsf fwhm. we also detect systematic trends as a function of subpixelcoordinates for the psf magnitudes with peak-to-peak amplitudes of ~1.6 mmagand ~4-7 mmag for the over- and under-sampled images, respectively. we notethat the systematic trends are similar in amplitude to the reported ~1% and ~2%precision of the sdss photometry in the griz and u wavebands, respectively, andtherefore their correction has the potential to substantially improve the sdssphotometric precision. we provide an {\tt idl} program specifically for thispurpose. finally, we note that the sdss aperture and psf magnitude scales arerelated by a non-linear transformation that departs from linearity by ~1-4%,which, without correction, invalidates the application of a photometriccalibration model derived from the aperture magnitudes to the psf magnitudes,as has been done for sdss dr8.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1311.5411	automated data reduction workflows for astronomy	data from complex modern astronomical instruments often consist of a largenumber of different science and calibration files, and their reduction requiresa variety of software tools. the execution chain of the tools represents acomplex workflow that needs to be tuned and supervised, often by individualresearchers that are not necessarily experts for any specific instrument. theefficiency of data reduction can be improved by using automatic workflows toorganise data and execute the sequence of data reduction steps. to realize suchefficiency gains, we designed a system that allows intuitive representation,execution and modification of the data reduction workflow, and has facilitiesfor inspection and interaction with the data. the european southern observatory(eso) has developed reflex, an environment to automate data reductionworkflows. reflex is implemented as a package of customized components for thekepler workflow engine. kepler provides the graphical user interface to createan executable flowchart-like representation of the data reduction process. keyfeatures of reflex are a rule-based data organiser, infrastructure to re-useresults, thorough book-keeping, data progeny tracking, interactive userinterfaces, and a novel concept to exploit information created during dataorganisation for the workflow execution. reflex includes novel concepts toincrease the efficiency of astronomical data processing. while reflex is aspecific implementation of astronomical scientific workflows within the keplerworkflow engine, the overall design choices and methods can also be applied toother environments for running automated science workflows.

0802.1273	a new algorithm for difference image analysis	in the context of difference image analysis (dia), we present a new methodfor determining the convolution kernel matching a pair of images of the samefield. unlike the standard dia technique which involves modelling the kernel asa linear combination of basis functions, we consider the kernel as a discretepixel array and solve for the kernel pixel values directly using linearleast-squares. the removal of basis functions from the kernel model isadvantageous for a number of compelling reasons. firstly, it removes the needfor the user to specify such functions, which makes for a much simpler userapplication and avoids the risk of an inappropriate choice. secondly, basisfunctions are constructed around the origin of the kernel coordinate system,which requires that the two images are perfectly aligned for an optimal result.the pixel kernel model is sufficiently flexible to correct for imagemisalignments, and in the case of a simple translation between images, imageresampling becomes unnecessary. our new algorithm can be extended to spatiallyvarying kernels by solving for individual pixel kernels in a grid of imagesub-regions and interpolating the solutions to obtain the kernel at any onepixel.

1401.5476	variable stars in the globular cluster ngc 288: [fe/h] and distance	a search for variable stars in the globular cluster ngc 288 was carried outusing a time-series of ccd images in the $v$ and $i$ filters. the photometry ofall stellar sources in the field of view of our images, down to $v\approx19$mag, was performed using difference image analysis (dia). for stars of$\approx15$ mag, measurement accuracies of $\approx8$ mmag and $\approx10$ mmagwere achieved for $v$ and $i$ respectively. three independent search strategieswere applied to the 5525 light curves but no new variables were found above thethreshold limits characteristic of our data set. the use of older data from theliterature combined with the present data allowed the refinement of the periodsof all known variables. fourier light curve decomposition was performed for therrab and the rrc stars to obtain an estimate of ${\rm[fe/h]}_{zw}=-1.62\pm0.02$ (statistical) $\pm0.14$ (systematic). a truedistance modulus of $14.768\pm0.003$ mag (statistical) $\pm0.042$ mag(systematic), or a distance of $8.99\pm0.01$ kpc (statistical) $\pm0.17$ kpc(systematic) was calculated from the rrab star. the rrc star predicts adiscrepant distance about one kiloparsec shorter but it is possibly a blazhkovariable. an independent distance from the p--l relationship for sx phe starsleads to a distance of $8.9\pm0.3$ kpc. the sx phe stars v5 and v9 are found tobe double mode pulsators.

1411.2767	high-precision photometry by telescope defocussing. vii. the ultra-short  period planet wasp-103	we present 17 transit light curves of the ultra-short period planetary systemwasp-103, a strong candidate for the detection of tidally-induced orbitaldecay. we use these to establish a high-precision reference epoch for transittiming studies. the time of the reference transit midpoint is now measured toan accuracy of 4.8s, versus 67.4s in the discovery paper, aiding futuresearches for orbital decay. with the help of published spectroscopicmeasurements and theoretical stellar models, we determine the physicalproperties of the system to high precision and present a detailed error budgetfor these calculations. the planet has a roche lobe filling factor of 0.58,leading to a significant asphericity; we correct its measured mass and meandensity for this phenomenon. a high-resolution lucky imaging observation showsno evidence for faint stars close enough to contaminate the point spreadfunction of wasp-103. our data were obtained in the bessell $ri$ and the sdss$griz$ passbands and yield a larger planet radius at bluer optical wavelengths,to a confidence level of 7.3 sigma. interpreting this as an effect of rayleighscattering in the planetary atmosphere leads to a measurement of the planetarymass which is too small by a factor of five, implying that rayleigh scatteringis not the main cause of the variation of radius with wavelength.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1512.07913	exploring the crowded central region of 10 galactic globular clusters  using emccds. variable star searches and new discoveries	obtain time-series photometry of the very crowded central regions of galacticglobular clusters with better angular resolution than previously achieved withconventional ccds on ground-based telescopes to complete, or improve, thecensus of the variable star population in those stellar systems. images weretaken using the danish 1.54-m telescope at the eso observatory at la silla inchile. the telescope was equipped with an electron-multiplying ccd and theshort-exposure-time images obtained (10 images per second) were stacked usingthe shift-and-add technique to produce the normal-exposure-time images(minutes). photometry was performed via difference image analysis. automaticdetection of variable stars in the field was attempted. the light curves of12541 stars in the cores of 10 globular clusters were statistically analysed inorder to automatically extract the variable stars. we obtained light curves for31 previously known variable stars (3 l, 2 sr, 20 rr lyrae, 1 sx phe, 3cataclysmic variables, 1 ew and 1 nc) and we discovered 30 new variables (16 l,7 sr, 4 rr lyrae, 1 sx phe and 2 nc).

0808.0354	a new search for variable stars in the globular cluster ngc 6366	new ccd photometry of ngc 6366 has lead to the discovery of some variablestars. two possible anomalous cepheids (or pop ii cepheids), three long periodvariables, one sx phe and one eclipsing binary have been found. also a list of10 candidate variables is reported. the light curve of the rrab star, v1, hasbeen decomposed into its fourier harmonics, and the fourier parameters wereused to estimate the star's metallicity and distance; [fe/h] = -0.87 +- 0.14and d = 3.2 +- 0.1 kpc. it is argued that v1 may not be a member of the clusterbut rather a more distant object. if this is so, an upper limit for thedistance to the cluster of 2.8 +- 0.1 kpc can be estimated. the p-lrelationship for sx phe stars and the identified modes in the newly discoveredsx phe variable, v6, allow yet another independent determination of thedistance to the cluster of d = 2.7 \+- 0.1 kpc. the m_v - {\rm [fe/h]}relationship for rr lyrae stars is addressed and the case of v1 is discussed.

astro-ph;0603276	microlens ogle-2005-blg-169 implies cool neptune-like planets are common	we detect a neptune mass-ratio (q~8e-5) planetary companion to the lens starin the extremely high-magnification (a~800) microlensing eventogle-2005-blg-169. if the parent is a main-sequence star, it has mass m~0.5m_sun implying a planet mass of ~13 m_earth and projected separation of ~2.7au. when intensely monitored over their peak, high-magnification events similarto ogle-2005-blg-169 have nearly complete sensitivity to neptune mass-ratioplanets with projected separations of 0.6 to 1.6 einstein radii, correspondingto 1.6--4.3 au in the present case. only two other such events were monitoredwell enough to detect neptunes, and so this detection by itself suggests thatneptune mass-ratio planets are common. moreover, another neptune was recentlydiscovered at a similar distance from its parent star in a low-magnificationevent, which are more common but are individually much less sensitive toplanets. combining the two detections yields 90% upper and lower frequencylimits f=0.37^{+0.30}_{-0.21} over just 0.4 decades of planet-star separation.in particular, f&gt;16% at 90% confidence. the parent star hosts no jupiter-masscompanions with projected separations within a factor 5 of that of the detectedplanet. the lens-source relative proper motion is \mu~7--10 mas/yr, implyingthat if the lens is sufficiently bright, i&lt;23.8, it will be detectable by hstby 3 years after peak. this would permit a more precise estimate of the lensmass and distance, and so the mass and projected separation of the planet.analogs of ogle-2005-blg-169lb orbiting nearby stars would be difficult todetect by other methods of planet detection, including radial velocities,transits, or astrometry.

astro-ph;0605705	an orphan in the "field of streams"	we use sloan digital sky survey data release 5 photometry and spectroscopy tostudy a tidal stream that extends over 50 degrees in the north galactic cap.  from the analysis of the path of the stream and the colors and magnitudes ofits stars, the stream is about 20 kpc away at its nearest detection (thecelestial equator). we detect a distance gradient -- the stream is farther awayfrom us at higher declination. the contents of the stream are made up from apredominantly old and metal-poor population that is similar to the globularclusters m13 and m92. the integrated absolute magnitude of the stream stars isestimated to be m_r = -7.5. there istentative evidence for a velocitysignature, with the stream moving at -40 km/s at low declinations and +100 km/sat high declinations. the stream lies on the same great circle as complex a, aroughly linear association of hi high velocity clouds stretching over 30degrees on the sky, and as ursa major ii, a recently discovered dwarfspheroidal galaxy. lying close to the same great circle are a number ofanomalous, young and metal-poor globular clusters, including palomar 1 andruprecht 106.

astro-ph;0608448	cats and dogs, hair and a hero: a quintet of new milky way companions	we present five new satellites of the milky way discovered in sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) imaging data, four of which were followed-up with either thesubaru or the isaac newton telescopes. they include four probable new dwarfgalaxies -- one each in the constellations of coma berenices, canes venatici,leo and hercules -- together with one unusually extended globular cluster,segue 1. we provide distances, absolute magnitudes, half-light radii andcolor-magnitude diagrams for all five satellites. the morphological features ofthe color-magnitude diagrams are generally well described by the ridge line ofthe old, metal-poor globular cluster m92. in the last two years, a total of tennew milky way satellites with effective surface brightness mu_v &gt;~ 28 mag/sq.arcsec have been discovered in sdss data. they are less luminous, moreirregular and appear to be more metal-poor than the previously-known nine milkyway dwarf spheroidals. the relationship between these objects and otherpopulations is discussed. we note that there is a paucity of objects withhalf-light radii between ~40 pc and ~ 100 pc. we conjecture that this mayrepresent the division between star clusters and dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0611157	is ursa major ii the progenitor of the orphan stream?	prominent in the `field of streams' -- the sloan digital sky survey map ofsubstructure in the galactic halo -- is an `orphan stream' without obviousprogenitor. in this numerical study, we show a possible connection between thenewly found dwarf satellite ursa major ii (uma ii) and the orphan stream. weprovide numerical simulations of the disruption of uma ii that match theobservational data on the position, distance and morphology of the orphanstream. we predict the radial velocity of uma ii as -100 km/s as well as theexistence of strong velocity gradients along the orphan stream. the velocitydispersion of uma ii is expected to be high, though this can be caused both bya high dark matter content or by the presence of unbound stars in a disruptedremnant. however, the existence of a gradient in the mean radial velocityacross uma ii provides a clear-cut distinction between these possibilities. thesimulations support the idea that some of the anomalous, young halo globularclusters like palomar 1 or arp 2 or ruprecht 106 may be physically associatedwith the orphan stream.

astro-ph;0701154	discovery of an unusual dwarf galaxy in the outskirts of the milky way	in this letter, we announce the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy, leo t, inthe local group. it was found as a stellar overdensity in the sloan digital skysurvey data release 5 (sdss dr5). the color-magnitude diagram of leo t showstwo well-defined features, which we interpret as a red giant branch and asequence of young, massive stars. as judged from fits to the color-magnitudediagram, it lies at a distance of about 420 kpc and has an intermediate-agestellar population with a metallicity of [fe/h]= -1.6, together with a youngpopulation of blue stars of age of 200 myr. there is a compact cloud of neutralhydrogen with mass roughly 10^5 solar masses and radial velocity 35 km/scoincident with the object visible in the hipass channel maps. leo t is thesmallest, lowest luminosity galaxy found to date with recent star-formation. itappears to be a transition object similar to, but much lower luminosity than,the phoenix dwarf.
