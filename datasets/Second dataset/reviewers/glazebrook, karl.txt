0901.2587	the wigglez dark energy survey: small-scale clustering of lyman break  galaxies at z &lt; 1	the wigglez dark energy survey is a large-scale structure survey ofintermediate-redshift uv-selected emission-line galaxies scheduled to cover1000 sq deg, spanning a broad redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. the main scientificgoal of the survey is the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) inthe galaxy clustering pattern at a significantly higher redshift than previousstudies. the bao may be applied as a standard cosmological ruler to constraindark energy models. based on the first 20% of the dataset, we present initialresults concerning the small-scale clustering of the wigglez targets, togetherwith survey forecasts. the wigglez galaxy population possesses a clusteringlength r_0 = 4.40 +/- 0.12 mpc/h, which is significantly larger than z=0uv-selected samples, with a slope gamma = 1.92 +/- 0.08. this clustering lengthis comparable to z=3 lyman break galaxies with similar uv luminosities. thefull survey, scheduled for completion in 2010, will map an effective volumev_eff ~ 1 gpc^3 (evaluated at a scale k = 0.15 h/mpc) and will measure theangular-diameter distance and hubble expansion rates in three redshift binswith accuracies ~ 5%. we will determine the value of a constant dark energyequation-of-state parameter, w, with a higher precision than existingsupernovae observations using an entirely independent technique. the wigglezand supernovae measurements lie in highly complementary directions in the planeof w and the matter density omega_m. the forecast using the full combination ofwigglez, supernovae and cmb datasets is a marginalized error sigma(w) = 0.07,providing a robust and precise measurement of the properties of dark energyincluding cross-checking of systematic errors.

0902.2064	photometric h alpha and [o ii] luminosity function of sdf and sxdf  galaxies: implications for future baryon oscillation surveys	efficient selection of emission line galaxies at z &gt; 1 by photometricinformation in wide field surveys is one of the keys for future spectroscopicsurveys to constrain dark energy using the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)signature. here we estimate the h alpha and [o ii] line luminosity functions ofgalaxies at z = 0.5-1.7 using a novel approach where multi-wavelength imagingdata is used to jointly estimate both photometric redshifts and star-formationrates. these photometric estimates of line luminosities at high-redshift usethe large data sets of the subaru deep field and subaru xmm-newton deep field(covering \sim 1 deg^2) and are calibrated with the spectroscopic data of thelocal sloan digital sky survey galaxies. the derived luminosity functions(especially h alpha) are in reasonable agreement with the past estimates basedon spectroscopic or narrow-band-filter surveys. this dataset is useful forexamining the photometric selection of target galaxies for bao surveys becauseof the large cosmological volume covered and the large number of galaxies withdetailed photometric information. we use the sample to derive the photometricand physical properties of emission line galaxies to assist planning for futurespectroscopic bao surveys. we also show some examples of photometric selectionprocedures which can efficiently select these emission line galaxies.

0907.4766	on the dearth of compact, massive, red sequence galaxies in the local  universe	using data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss; data release 7), we haveconducted a search for local analogs to the extremely compact, massive,quiescent galaxies that have been identified at z &gt; 2. we show thatincompleteness is a concern for such compact galaxies, particularly for lowredshifts (z &lt; ~0.05) as a result of the sdss spectroscopic target selectionalgorithm. we have identified 63 massive red sequence galaxies at 0.066 &lt; z &lt;0.12 that are smaller than the median size-mass relation by a factor of 2 ormore. consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offsetfrom the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. wedo not find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed atz ~ 2, implying a decrease in the comoving number density (at fixed size andmass) by a factor of &gt; 5000. this result cannot be explained by incompleteness:at 0.066 &lt; z &lt;0.12, the sdss spectroscopic sample should typically be ~75%complete for galaxies with the sizes and masses seen at high redshift, althoughfor the very smallest galaxies it may be as low as ~20%. to confirm that theabsence of such compact massive galaxies in sdss is not a spectroscopicselection effect, we have also looked for such galaxies in the sdss photometriccatalog, using photometric redshifts. while we do find signs of a bias againstmassive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the sdss spectroscopicsample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. acceptingthe high redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergosignificant structural evolution over z&lt;2 in order to match the population seenin the local universe. our results suggest that a highly stochastic mechanismlike major mergers cannot be the primary driver of this strong size evolution.

0911.4246	the wigglez dark energy survey: survey design and first data release	the wigglez dark energy survey is a survey of 240,000 emission line galaxiesin the distant universe, measured with the aaomega spectrograph on the 3.9-manglo-australian telescope (aat). the target galaxies are selected usingultraviolet photometry from the galex satellite, with a flux limit of nuv&lt;22.8mag. the redshift range containing 90% of the galaxies is 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0. theprimary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acousticoscillations (bao) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies atlook-back times of 4-8 gyrs. detailed forecasts indicate the survey willmeasure the bao scale to better than 2% and the tangential and radial acousticwave scales to approximately 3% and 5%, respectively.  this paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, aswell as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction, and redshiftmeasurement techniques employed. it also presents an analysis of the propertiesof the target galaxies, including emission line diagnostics which show thatthey are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and hubble space telescope images,which show they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. inconjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for thefirst 100,000 galaxies measured for the project.

0911.5347	the wigglez dark energy survey: direct constraints on blue galaxy  intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts	correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxy pairs, and between theintrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale density field, may be inducedby tidal fields. these correlations, which have been detected at low redshifts(z&lt;0.35) for bright red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), andfor which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z~0.1, provide a window intogalaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant forcurrent and future weak lensing surveys. measurements of these alignments atintermediate redshifts (z~0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shearobservations are very important for understanding the origin and redshiftevolution of these alignments, and for minimising their impact on weak lensingmeasurements. we present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement forblue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from sdss and spectroscopicredshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. our null detection allows us toplace upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by bluegalaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not requiresignificant model-dependent extrapolation from the z~0.1 sdss observations.also, combining the sdss and wigglez constraints gives us a long redshiftbaseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contaminationof the cosmic shear power spectrum. assuming that the alignments can beexplained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we findthat a measurement of \sigma_8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, cfhtls-like surveywould be contaminated by at most +/-0.02 (95% confidence level, sdss andwigglez) or +/-0.03 (wigglez alone) due to intrinsic alignments.

1002.3170	the redshift one ldss-3 emission line survey (roles) ii: survey method  and z~1 mass-dependent star-formation rate density	motivated by suggestions of 'cosmic downsizing', in which the dominantcontribution to the cosmic star formation rate density (sfrd) proceeds fromhigher to lower mass galaxies with increasing cosmic time, we describe thedesign and implementation of the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey(roles). roles is a k-selected (22.5 &lt; k_ab &lt; 24.0) survey for dwarf galaxies[8.5&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt; 9.5] at 0.89 &lt; z &lt; 1.15 drawn from two extremely deep fields(goods-s and ms1054-fires). using the [oii]3727 emission line, we obtainredshifts and star-formation rates (sfrs) for star-forming galaxies down to alimit of ~0.3 msun/yr. we present the [oii] luminosity function measured inroles and find a faint end slope of alpha_faint ~ -1.5, similar to thatmeasured at z~0.1 in the sdss. by combining roles with higher mass surveys, wemeasure the sfrd as a function of stellar mass using [oii] (with and withoutvarious empirical corrections), and using sed-fitting to obtain the sfr fromthe rest-frame uv luminosity for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. ourbest estimate of the corrected [oii]-sfrd and uv sfrd both independently showthat the sfrd evolves equally for galaxies of all masses between z~1 and z~0.1.the exact evolution in normalisation depends on the indicator used, with the[oii]-based estimate showing a change of a factor of ~2.6 and the uv-based afactor of ~6. we discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy in normalisationbetween the indicators, but note that the magnitude of this uncertainty iscomparable to the discrepancy between indicators seen in other z~1 works. ourresult that the shape of the sfrd as a function of stellar mass (and hence themass range of galaxies dominating the sfrd) does not evolve between z~1 andz~0.1 is robust to the choice of indicator.

1002.3172	the local star-formation rate density: assessing calibrations using  [oii], ha and uv luminosities	we explore the use of simple star-formation rate (sfr) indicators (such asmay be used in high-redshift galaxy surveys) in the local universe using [oii],ha, and u-band luminosities from the deeper 275 deg^2 stripe 82 subsample ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) coupled with uv data from the galaxyevolution explorer satellite (galex). we examine the consistency of suchmethods using the star-formation rate density (sfrd) as a function of stellarmass in this local volume, and quantify the accuracy of corrections for dustand metallicity on the various indicators. rest-frame u-band promises to be aparticularly good sfr estimator for high redshift studies since it does notrequire a particularly large or sensitive extinction correction, yet yieldsresults broadly consistent with more observationally expensive methods. wesuggest that the [oii]-derived sfr, commonly used at higher redshifts (z~1),can be used to reliably estimate sfrs for ensembles of galaxies, but for highmass galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10), a larger correction than is typically used isrequired to compensate for the effects of metallicity dependence and dustextinction. we provide a new empirical mass-dependent correction for the[oii]-sfr.

1003.5721	the wigglez dark energy survey: the selection function and z=0.6 galaxy  power spectrum	we report one of the most accurate measurements of the three-dimensionallarge-scale galaxy power spectrum achieved to date, using 56,159 redshifts ofbright emission-line galaxies at effective redshift z=0.6 from the wigglez darkenergy survey at the anglo-australian telescope. we describe in detail how weconstruct the survey selection function allowing for the varying targetcompleteness and redshift completeness. we measure the total power with anaccuracy of approximately 5% in wavenumber bands of dk=0.01 h/mpc. a modelpower spectrum including non-linear corrections, combined with a linear galaxybias factor and a simple model for redshift-space distortions, provides a goodfit to our data for scales k &lt; 0.4 h/mpc. the large-scale shape of the powerspectrum is consistent with the best-fitting matter and baryon densitiesdetermined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. bysplitting the power spectrum measurement as a function of tangential and radialwavenumbers we delineate the characteristic imprint of peculiar velocities. weuse these to determine the growth rate of structure as a function of redshiftin the range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8, including a data point at z=0.78 with an accuracyof 20%. our growth rate measurements are a close match to the self-consistentprediction of the lcdm model. the wigglez survey data will allow a wide rangeof investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion and growthhistory, topology of cosmic structure, and gaussianity of the initialconditions. our calculation of the survey selection function will be releasedat a future date via our website wigglez.swin.edu.au.

1010.1262	high star formation rates as the origin of turbulence in early and  modern disk galaxies	high spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation andkinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotatingdisk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. theline of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higherthan in today's disk galaxies. this has suggested thatgravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early universe are fuelled bycold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hotgalactic gas halos. however these accreting flows have not been observed, andcosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. here we reporton a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we havediscovered in the nearby universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drivetheir high star-formation rates. we find that the velocity dispersion is mostfundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their massnor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself isthe energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.

1010.1447	dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass and environment  from the redshift one ldss-3 emission line survey (roles)	using the sample from the \it redshift one ldss3 emission line survey \rm(roles), we probe the dependence of star formation rate (sfr) and specific starformation rate (ssfr) as a function of stellar mass $m_*$ and environment asdefined by local galaxy density, in the cdfs field. our spectroscopic sampleconsists of 312 galaxies with $k_{ab}&lt;24$, corresponding to stellar mass$\log(m_*/m_{\sun})&gt;8.5$, and with [oii] derived star-formation ratessfr$&gt;0.3m_{\sun}/$yr, at $0.889\leq z \leq 1.149$. the results have beencompared directly with the sloan digital sky survey stripe 82 sample at$0.032\leq z \leq 0.05$. for star-forming galaxies, we confirm that there islittle correlation between sfr and density at $z\sim 0$. however, for thelowest mass galaxies in our $z\sim 1$ sample, those with$\log(m_*/m_{\sun})&lt;10$, we find that both the median sfr and specific sfr {\itincrease} significantly with increasing local density. the "downsizing" trendfor low mass galaxies to be quenched progressively later in time appears to bemore pronounced in moderately overdense environments. overall we find that theevolution of star-formation in galaxies is most strongly driven by theirstellar mass, with local galaxy density playing a role that becomesincreasingly important for lower mass galaxies.

1011.3818	evidence for imf variations from the integrated light of sdss galaxies	the h alpha equivalent width (ew) is the ratio of the h alpha flux to thecontinuum at 6565{\aa}. in normal star forming galaxies the h alpha flux isdominated by reprocessed photons from stars with masses greater than 10 m_o andthe 6565{\aa} continuum is predominantly due to 0.7-3.0 m_o red giant stars. inthese galaxies the h alpha ew is effectively the ratio of high mass to low massstars and is thus sensitive to the stellar initial mass function (imf). inhoversten &amp; glazebrook 2008 we used ~131,000 galaxies from the sloan digitalsky survey to show evidence for systematic variations in the imf with galaxyluminosity. in this proceeding we use that sample, with the addition of hdelta_a measurements, to investigate other parameterizations of the imf. wefind evidence for imf variations with surface brightness, and also show that,modulo uncertainties in spectral synthesis models, that 120 m_o stars areimportant in accounting for the observed h alpha ew distribution.

1101.3780	a spectroscopic measurement of galaxy formation timescales with roles	we present measurements of the specific star-formation rate (ssfr)-stellarmass relation for star-forming galaxies. our deep spectroscopic samples arebased on the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey, roles, and europeansouthern observatory, eso, public spectroscopy at z=1, and on the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) at z=0.1. these datasets cover an equally deep mass range of8.5&lt;~log(m*/msun)&lt;~11 at both epochs. we find that the ssfr--mass relationevolves in a way which is remarkably independent of stellar mass, as wepreviously found for the star-formation rate density (sfrd)--mass relation. athigher masses, such as those probed by previous surveys, the evolution inssfr--mass is almost independent of stellar mass. at higher masses(log(m*/msun)&gt;10) the shapes of the cumulative cosmic sfrds are very similar atboth z=0.1 and z=1.0, both showing 70% of the total sfrd above a mass oflog(m*/msun)&gt;10. mass functions are constructed for star-forming galaxies andfound to evolve by only &lt;35% between z=1 and z=0.1 over the whole mass range.the evolution is such that the mass function decreases with increasing cosmictime, confirming that galaxies are leaving the star-forming sequence/bluecloud. the observational results are extended to z~2 by adding two recent lymanbreak galaxy samples, and data at these three epochs (z=0.1, 1, 2) are comparedwith the galform semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. galform predicts anoverall sfr density (sfrd) as a function of stellar mass in reasonableagreement with the observations. the star formation timescales inferred from1/ssfr also give reasonable overall agreement, with the agreement becomingworse at the lowest and highest masses.

(2010). the results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0%measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=0.6 (in terms of theacoustic parameter "a(z)" introduced by eisenstein et al. (2005) we finda(z=0.6) = 0.452 +/- 0.018). both baos and power spectrum shape informationcontribute toward these constraints. the statistical significance of thedetection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to awiggle-free model, is 3.2-sigma. the ratios of our distance measurements tothose obtained using baos in the distribution of luminous red galaxies atredshifts z=0.2 and z=0.35 are consistent with a flat lambda cold dark mattermodel that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation. the addition of the currentwigglez data results in a ~ 30% improvement in the measurement accuracy of aconstant equation-of-state, w, using bao data alone. based solely on geometricbao distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w &lt; -1/3) is required with aprobability of 99.8%, providing a consistency check of conclusions based onsupernovae observations. further improvements in cosmological constraints willresult when the wigglez survey dataset is complete.

1108.0656	red nuggets at high redshift: structural evolution of quiescent galaxies  over 10 gyr of cosmic history	we present an analysis of the size growth seen in early-type galaxies over 10gyr of cosmic time. our analysis is based on a homogeneous synthesis ofpublished data from 17 spectroscopic surveys observed at similar spatialresolution, augmented by new measurements for galaxies in the gemini deep deepsurvey. in total, our sample contains structural data for 465 galaxies (mainlyearly-type) in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.7. the size evolution ofpassively-evolving galaxies over this redshift range is gradual and continuous,with no evidence for an end or change to the process around z~1, as has beenhinted at by some surveys which analyze subsets of the data in isolation. thesize growth appears to be independent of stellar mass, with the mass-normalizedhalf-light radius scaling with redshift as r_e (1+z)^(-1.62 +/- 0.34).surprisingly, this power law seems to be in good agreement with the recentlyreported continuous size evolution of uv-bright galaxies in the redshift rangez~0.5-3.5. it is also in accordance with the predictions from recenttheoretical models.

1203.0309	scaling relations of star-forming regions: from kpc-size clumps to hii  regions	we present the properties of 8 star-forming regions, or 'clumps,' in 3galaxies at z~1.3 from the wigglez dark energy survey, which are resolved withthe osiris integral field spectrograph. within turbulent discs, \sigma~90 km/s,clumps are measured with average sizes of 1.5 kpc and average jeans masses of4.2 x 10^9 \msolar, in total accounting for 20-30 per cent of the stellar massof the discs. these findings lend observational support to models that predictlarger clumps will form as a result of higher disc velocity dispersionsdriven-up by cosmological gas accretion. as a consequence of the changes inglobal environment, it may be predicted that star-forming regions at highredshift should not resemble star-forming regions locally. yet despite theincreased sizes and dispersions, clumps and hii regions are found to followtight scaling relations over the range z=0-2 for size, velocity dispersion,luminosity, and mass when comparing &gt;2000 hii regions locally and 30 clumps atz&gt;1 (\sigma \propto r^{0.42+/-0.03}, l(h\alpha) \propto r^{2.72+/-0.04},l(h\alpha) \propto \sigma^{4.18+/-0.21}, and l(h\alpha) \proptom_{jeans}^{1.24+/-0.05}). we discuss these results in the context of theexisting simulations of clump formation and evolution, with an emphasis on theprocesses that drive-up the turbulent motions in the interstellar medium. ourresults indicate that while the turbulence of discs may have importantimplications for the size and luminosity of regions which form within them, thesame processes govern their formation from high redshift to the current epoch.

1204.3674	the wigglez dark energy survey: joint measurements of the expansion and  growth history at z &lt; 1	we perform a joint determination of the distance-redshift relation and cosmicexpansion rate at redshifts z = 0.44, 0.6 and 0.73 by combining measurements ofthe baryon acoustic peak and alcock-paczynski distortion from galaxy clusteringin the wigglez dark energy survey, using a large ensemble of mock catalogues tocalculate the covariance between the measurements. we find that d_a(z) = (1205+/- 114, 1380 +/- 95, 1534 +/- 107) mpc and h(z) = (82.6 +/- 7.8, 87.9 +/- 6.1,97.3 +/- 7.0) km/s/mpc at these three redshifts. further combining our resultswith other baryon acoustic oscillation and distant supernovae datasets, we usea monte carlo markov chain technique to determine the evolution of the hubbleparameter h(z) as a stepwise function in 9 redshift bins of width dz = 0.1,also marginalizing over the spatial curvature. our measurements of h(z), whichhave precision better than 7% in most redshift bins, are consistent with theexpansion history predicted by a cosmological-constant dark-energy model, inwhich the expansion rate accelerates at redshift z &lt; 0.7.

0711.1309	evidence for a non-universal stellar initial mass function from the  integrated properties of sdss galaxies	this paper revisits the classical kennicutt method for inferring the stellarinitial mass function (imf) from the integrated light properties of galaxies.the large size, uniform high quality data set from the sloan digital sky surveydr4 is combined with more in depth modeling and quantitative statisticalanalysis to search for systematic imf variations as a function of galaxyluminosity. galaxy h alpha equivalent widths are compared to a broadband colorindex to constrain the imf. this parameter space is useful for breakingdegeneracies which are traditionally problematic. age and dust corrections arelargely orthogonal to imf variations. in addition the effects of metallicityand smooth star formation history e-folding times are small compared to imfvariations. we find that for the sample as a whole the best fitting imf slopeabove 0.5 m_sun is gamma = 1.4535 with a negligible random error of +/- 0.0004and a systematic error of +/- 0.1. galaxies brighter than around m_r,0.1 = -20(including galaxies like the milky way which has m_r,0.1 ~ -21) are well fit bya universal gamma ~ 1.4 imf, similar to salpeter, and smooth, exponential starformation histories (sfh). fainter galaxies prefer steeper imfs and the qualityof the fits reveal that for these galaxies a universal imf with smooth sfhs isactually a poor assumption. several sources of sample bias are ruled out as thecause of these luminosity dependent imf variations. analysis of bursting sfhmodels shows that an implausible coordination of burst times is required to fita universal imf to the m_r,0.1 = -17 galaxies. this leads to the conclusionsthat the imf in low luminosity galaxies has fewer massive stars, either bysteeper slope or lower upper mass cutoff, and is not universal.

1205.6812	the wigglez dark energy survey: the transition to large-scale cosmic  homogeneity	we have made the largest-volume measurement to date of the transition tolarge-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. we use the wigglezsurvey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200,000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volumeof ~1 (gpc/h)^3. a new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented,which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and whichcan be easily compared between different surveys. due to the large cosmic depthof wigglez (up to z=1) we are able to make the first measurement of thetransition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. the mean number ofgalaxies n(&lt;r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r^3 within1%, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1% of d_2=3,at radii larger than 71 \pm 8 mpc/h at z~0.2, 70 \pm 5 mpc/h at z~0.4, 81 \pm 5mpc/h at z~0.6, and 75 \pm 4 mpc/h at z~0.8. we demonstrate the robustness ofour results against selection function effects, using a lcdm n-body simulationand a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. the results are inexcellent agreement with both the lcdm n-body simulation and an analytical lcdmprediction. we can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension belowd_2=2.97 on scales from ~80 mpc/h up to the largest scales probed by ourmeasurement, ~300 mpc/h, at 99.99% confidence.

1206.1662	the tully-fisher relation for 25,000 sdss galaxies as function of  environment	we construct tully-fisher relationships (tfrs) in the $u$, $g$, $r$, $i$ and$z$ bands and stellar mass tfrs (smtfrs) for a sample of $25,698$ late spiraltype galaxies (with $0.045&lt;z&lt;0.085$) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)and study the effects of environment on the relation. we use sdss-measuredbalmer emission line widths, $v_{\rm fwhm}$, as a proxy for disc circularvelocity, $v_{\rm circ}$. a priori it is not clear whether we can constructaccurate tfrs given the small $3"$ diameter of the fibres used for sdssspectroscopic measurements. however, we show by modelling the h$\alpha$emission profile as observed through a $3"$ aperture that for galaxies atappropriate redshifts ($z&gt;0.045$) the fibres sample enough of the disc toobtain a linear relationship between $v_{\rm fwhm}$ and $v_{\rm circ}$,allowing us to obtain a tfr and to investigate dependence on other variables.we also develop a methodology for distinguishing between astrophysical andsample bias in the fibre tfr trends. we observe the well-known steepening ofthe tfr in redder bands in our sample. we divide the sample of galaxies intofour equal groups using projected neighbour density ($\sigma$) quartiles andfind no significant dependence on environment, extending previous work to awider range of environments and a much larger sample. having demonstrated thatwe can construct sdss-based tfrs is very useful for future applications becauseof the large sample size available.

1207.0972	the slowly evolving role of environment in a spectroscopic survey of  star formation in mstar &gt; 5e8 msun galaxies since z=1	we present a deep [oii] emission line survey of faint galaxies (22.5&lt;kab&lt;24)in the chandra deep field south and the fires field. with these data we measurethe star formation rate (sfr) in galaxies in the stellar mass range 8.85 &lt;log(m*/msun) &lt; 9.5 at 0.62&lt;z&lt;0.885, to a limit of sfr = 0.1msun/yr. thepresence of a massive cluster (ms1054-03) in the fires field, and ofsignificant large scale structure in the cdfs field, allows us to study theenvironmental dependence of sfrs amongst this population of low-mass galaxies.comparing our results with more massive galaxies at this epoch, with ourprevious survey (roles) at the higher redshift z=1, and with sdss stripe 82data, we find no significant evolution of the stellar mass function ofstar-forming galaxies between z=0 and z=1, and no evidence that its shapedepends on environment. the correlation between specific star formation rate(ssfr) and stellar mass at z=0.75 has a power-law slope of beta=-0.2, withevidence for a steeper relation at the lowest masses. the normalization of thiscorrelation lies as expected between that corresponding to z=1 and the presentday. the global sfr density is consistent with an evolution of the form (1+z)^2over 0&lt;z&lt;1, with no evidence for a dependence on stellar mass. the ssfr ofthese star-forming galaxies at z=0.75 does not depend upon the density of theirlocal environment. considering just high-density environments, the low-mass endof the ssfr-m* relation in our data is steeper than that in stripe 82 at z=0,and shallower than that measured by roles at z=1. evolution of low-massgalaxies in dense environments appears to be more rapid than in the generalfield.

1210.2130	the wigglez dark energy survey: final data release and cosmological  results	this paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of thewigglez dark energy survey. we perform full analyses of different cosmologicalmodels using the wigglez power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and0.78, combined with other cosmological datasets. the limiting factor in thisanalysis is the theoretical modelling of the galaxy power spectrum, includingnon-linearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. in this paper weassess several different methods for modelling the theoretical power spectrum,testing them against the gigaparsec wigglez simulations (gigglez). we fit for abase set of 6 cosmological parameters, {omega_b h^2, omega_cdm h^2, h_0, tau,a_s, n_s}, and 5 supplementary parameters {n_run, r, w, omega_k, sum m_nu}. incombination with the cosmic microwave background (cmb), our results areconsistent with the lambdacdm concordance cosmology, with a measurement of thematter density of omega_m =0.29 +/- 0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8= 0.825 +/- 0.017. using wigglez data with cmb and other distance and matterpower spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parametersbeing inconsistent with their lambdacdm model values. the power spectra dataand theoretical modelling tools are available for use as a module for cosmomc,which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data . wealso release the data and random catalogues used to construct the baryonacoustic oscillation correlation function.

1312.4543	fundamental mass-spin-morphology relation of spiral galaxies	this work present high-precision measurements of the specific baryon angularmomentum jb, contained in stars, atomic gas, and molecular gas, out to ~10scale radii, in 16 nearby spiral galaxies of the things sample. the accuracy ofthese measurements improves on existing studies by an order of magnitude,leading to the discovery of a strong correlation between the baryon mass mb,jb, and the bulge mass fraction b/t, fitted byb/t=-(0.34+-0.03)*log(jb/mb/[1e-7 kpc km/s/msun])-(0.04+-0.01) on the fullsample range of b/t=0.00-0.32 and mb/msun=1e9-1e11. the corresponding relationfor the stellar quantities ms and js is identical within the uncertainties.these m-j-b/t relations likely originate from the proportionality between j/mand the surface density of the disk that dictates its stability against(pseudo-)bulge formation. using a cdm model, we can approximately explainclassical scaling relations, such as the fundamental plane of spiral galaxies,the tully-fisher relation, and the mass-size relation, in terms of the m-j-b/trelation. these results advocate the use of mass and angular momentum as themost fundamental quantities of spiral galaxies.

1312.4952	a substantial population of massive quiescent galaxies at z~4 from  zfourge	we report the likely identification of a substantial population of massivem~10^11m_sun galaxies at z~4 with suppressed star formation rates (sfrs),selected on rest-frame optical to near-ir colors from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey. the observed spectral energy distributions show pronouncedbreaks, sampled by a set of near-ir medium-bandwidth filters, resulting intightly constrained photometric redshifts. fitting stellar population modelssuggests large balmer/4000aa breaks, relatively old stellar populations, largestellar masses and low sfrs, with a median specific sfr of 2.9+/-1.8 x10^-11/yr. ultradeep herschel/pacs 100micron, 160micron and spitzer/mips24micron data reveal no dust-obscured sfr activity for 15/19 (79%) galaxies.two far-ir detected galaxies are obscured qsos. stacking the far-ir undetectedgalaxies yields no detection, consistent with the sed fit, indicatingindependently that the average specific sfr is at least 10x smaller than oftypical star-forming galaxies at z~4. assuming all far-ir undetected galaxiesare indeed quiescent, the volume density is 1.8+/-0.7 x 10^-5mpc^-3 to a limitof log10m/m_sun&gt;10.6, which is 10x and 80x lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1.they comprise a remarkably high fraction (~35%) of z~4 massive galaxies,suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very highredshift. given the average stellar age of 0.8gyr and stellar mass of0.8x10^11m_sun, the galaxies likely started forming stars before z =5, withsfrs well in excess of 100m_sun/yr, far exceeding that of similarly abundantuv-bright galaxies at z&gt;4. this suggests that most of the star-formation in theprogenitors of quiescent z~4 galaxies was obscured by dust.

1405.1048	exploring the z=3-4 massive galaxy population with zfourge: the  prevalence of dusty and quiescent galaxies	our understanding of the redshift $z&gt;3$ galaxy population relies largely onsamples selected using the popular "dropout" technique, typically consisting ofuv-bright galaxies with blue colors and prominent lyman breaks. as it iscurrently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxypopulation, we here use the fourstar galaxy evolution (zfourge) survey tocreate a stellar mass-limited sample at $z=3-4$. uniquely, zfourge uses deepnear-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshiftsand stellar population properties. the mass-complete sample consists of 57galaxies with log m $&gt;10.6$, reaching below $m^{\star}$ at $z=3-4$.  on average, the massive $z=3-4$ galaxies are extremely faint in the observedoptical with median $r_{tot}^{ab}=27.48\pm0.41$ (restframe$m_{1700}=-18.05\pm0.37$). they lie far below the uv luminosity-stellar massrelation for lyman break galaxies and are about $\sim100\times$ fainter at thesame mass. the massive galaxies are red ($r-ks_{ab}=3.9\pm0.2$; restframeuv-slope $\beta=-0.2\pm0.3$) likely from dust or old stellar ages. we classifythe galaxy seds by their restframe $u-v$ and $v-j$ colors and find a diversepopulation: $46^{+6+10}_{-6-17}$% of the massive galaxies are quiescent,$54^{+8+17}_{-8-10}$% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only$14^{+3+10}_{-3-4}$% resemble luminous blue star forming lyman break galaxies.this study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies athigher redshift than previously known. furthermore,we uncover a reservoir ofdusty star-forming galaxies with $4\times$ lower specific star-formation ratescompared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at $z&gt;3$. with $5\times$ highernumbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formationcompared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.

1405.6198	field: an automated emission-line detection software for subaru/fmos  near-infrared spectroscopy	we describe the development of automated emission line detection software forthe fiber multi-object spectrograph (fmos), which is a near-infraredspectrograph fed by $400$ fibers from the $0.2$ deg$^2$ prime focus field ofview of the subaru telescope. the software, field (fmos software forimage-based emission line detection), is developed and tested mainly for thefastsound survey, which is targeting h$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at $z \sim1.3$ to measure the redshift space distortion as a test of general relativitybeyond $z \sim 1$. the basic algorithm is to calculate the line signal-to-noiseratio ($s/n$) along the wavelength direction, given by a 2-d convolution of thespectral image and a detection kernel representing a typical emission lineprofile. a unique feature of fmos is its use of oh airglow suppression masks,requiring the use of flat-field images to suppress noise around the maskregions. bad pixels on the detectors and pixels affected by cosmic-rays areefficiently removed by using the information obtained from the fmos analysispipeline. we limit the range of acceptable line-shape parameters for thedetected candidates to further improve the reliability of line detection. thefinal performance of line detection is tested using a subset of the fastsounddata; the false detection rate of spurious objects is examined by usinginverted frames obtained by exchanging object and sky frames. the falsedetection rate is $&lt; 1$\% at $s/n &gt; 5$, allowing an efficient and objectiveemission line search for fmos data at the line flux level of $\gtrsim 1.0\times 10^{-16}$[erg/cm$^2$/s].

1405.6753	dynamo ii: coupled stellar and ionized gas kinematics in two low  redshift clumpy disks	we study the spatially resolved stellar kinematics of two star-forminggalaxies at z = 0.1 from the larger dynamics of newly assembled massive objects(dynamo) sample. these galaxies, which have been characterized by high levelsof star formation and large ionized gas velocity dispersions, are consideredpossible analogs to high-redshift clumpy disks. they were observed using thegmos instrument in integral field spectroscopy (ifs) mode at the geminiobservatory with high spectral resolution (r=5400, equivalent to 24 km/s at theobserved wavelengths) and 6 hour exposure times in order to measure theresolved stellar kinematics via absorption lines. we also obtain higher-qualityemission line kinematics than previous observations. the spatial resolution(1.2 kpc) is sufficient to show that the ionized gas in these galaxies (astraced by h-beta emission) is morphologically irregular, forming multiple giantclumps while stellar continuum light is smooth and well described by anexponential profile. clumpy gas morphologies observed in ifs data are confirmedby complementary narrow band h-alpha imaging from the hubble space telescope.morphological differences between the stars and ionized gas are not reflecteddynamically as stellar kinematics are found the be closely coupled to thekinematics of the ionized gas: both components are smoothly rotating with largevelocity dispersions (~40 km/s) suggesting that the high gas dispersions arenot primarily driven by star-formation feedback. in addition, the stellarpopulation ages of these galaxies are estimated to be quite young (60-500 myr).the large velocity dispersions measured for these young stars suggest that weare seeing the formation of thick disks and/or stellar bulges in support ofrecent models which produce these from clumpy galaxies at high redshift.

1405.7410	extreme gas fractions in clumpy, turbulent disk galaxies at z~0.1	in this letter we report the discovery of co fluxes, suggesting very high gasfractions in three disk galaxies seen in the nearby universe (z ~ 0.1). thesegalaxies were investigated as part of the dynamics of newly assembled massiveobjects (dynamo) survey. high-resolution hubble space telescope imaging ofthese objects reveals the presence of large star forming clumps in the bodiesof the galaxies, while spatially resolved spectroscopy of redshifted halphareveals the presence of high dispersion rotating disks. the internal dynamicalstate of these galaxies resembles that of disk systems seen at much higherredshifts (1 &lt; z &lt; 3). using co(1-0) observations made with the plateau de bureinterferometer, we find gas fractions of 20-30% and depletion times of tdep ~0.5 gyr (assuming a milky way-like co conversion factor). these properties areunlike those expected for low- redshift galaxies of comparable specific starformation rate, but they are normal for their high-z counterparts. dynamogalaxies break the degeneracy between gas fraction and redshift, and we showthat the depletion time per specific star formation rate for galaxies isclosely tied to gas fraction, independent of redshift. we also show that thegas dynamics of two of our local targets corresponds to those expected fromunstable disks, again resembling the dynamics of high-z disks. these resultsprovide evidence that dynamo galaxies are local analogues to the clumpy,turbulent disks, which are often found at high redshift.

1406.6056	the distribution of satellites around massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  zfourge/candels: dependence on star formation activity	we study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming andquiescent central galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 using imaging from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey (zfourge) and the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the deep near-ir data select satellites down to$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;9$ at z&lt;3. the radial satellite distribution around centralsis consistent with a projected nfw profile. massive quiescent centrals,$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.78$, have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites comparedto star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even afteraccounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. we findno statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-massquiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48&lt;\log(m/m_\odot)&lt;10.78$. comparingto the guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicatesthat quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-formingcentrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. we use a simpletoy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces theobserved quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass betweenstar-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenchingprobability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for$\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$13.5. a singlehalo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction andsatellite distribution of centrals. therefore, while halo quenching may be animportant mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. itremains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even inrelatively massive halos.

1407.0390	the gigaparsec wigglez simulations: characterising scale dependant bias  and associated systematics in growth of structure measurements	we use the gigaparsec wigglez (gigglez) simulations to characterise galaxybias and its scale dependence for a range of redshifts and halo masses in astandard $\lambda$lcdm cosmology. assuming bias converges to a scaleindependent form at large scales, we develop a phenomenological model whichfully expresses the mass and redshift dependence of bias and its scaledependence in real or redshift space. we then use this to illustrate howscale-dependent bias can systematically skew measurements of the growth-rate ofcosmic structure obtained from redshift-space distortion measurements. whendata is fit only to scales $k_{\rm max}{\le}0.1$ $[h^{-1} \rm{mpc}]^{-1}$, wefind that these effects are significant only for large biases ($b{\gtrsim}3$)at large redshifts ($z{\gtrsim}1$). however, when smaller scales areincorporated ($k_{\rm max}{\le}0.2$ $[h^{-1} \rm{mpc}]^{-1}$) to increasemeasurement precision, the combination of reduced statistical uncertainty andincreased scale dependent bias can result in highly significant systematics formost large halos across all redshifts. we identify several new interestingaspects of bias, including a significant large-scale bias boost for small halosat low-redshifts due to substructure effects ($\sim$20\% for milky way-likesystems) and a nearly redshift-independent halo mass (corresponding to aredshift-space bias of ${\sim}1.5$) for which halo bias has little-or-no scaledependence on scales greater than $3$ $[h^{-1} {\rm mpc}]$. this suggests anoptimal strategy of targeting bias ${\sim}{1.5}$ systems for clustering studieswhich are dominated by systematic uncertainties in how observed halo (orgalaxy) distributions map to their underlying mass distribution, such ascosmological measurements of neutrino masses. code for generating our fittingformula is publicly available at http://gbpoole.github.io/poole_2014a_code/(abridged)

1504.03326	the differential size growth of field and cluster galaxies at z=2.1  using the zfourge survey	there is ongoing debate regarding the extent that environment affects galaxysize growth beyond z&gt;1. to investigate the differences in star-forming andquiescent galaxy properties as a function of environment at z=2.1, we create amass-complete sample of 59 cluster galaxies spitler et al. (2012) and 478 fieldgalaxies with log(m)&gt;9 using photometric redshifts from the zfourge survey. wecompare the mass-size relation of field and cluster galaxies using measuredgalaxy semi-major axis half-light radii ($r_{1/2,maj}$) from candels hst/f160wimaging. we find consistent mass normalized (log(m)=10.7) sizes for quiescentfield galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=1.81\pm0.29$ kpc) and quiescent cluster galaxies($r_{1/2,maj}=2.17\pm0.63$ kpc). the mass normalized size of star-formingcluster galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=4.00\pm0.26$ kpc ) is 12% larger (ks test$2.1\sigma$) than star-forming field galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=3.57\pm0.10$ kpc).from the mass-color relation we find that quiescent field galaxies with9.7&lt;log(m)&lt;10.4 are slightly redder (ks test $3.6\sigma$) than quiescentcluster galaxies, while cluster and field quiescent galaxies with log(m)&gt;10.4have consistent colors. we find that star-forming cluster galaxies are onaverage 20% redder than star-forming field galaxies at all masses. furthermore,we stack galaxy images to measure average radial color profiles as a functionof mass. negative color gradients are only present for massive star-formingfield and cluster galaxies with log(m)&gt;10.4, the remaining galaxy masses andtypes have flat profiles. our results suggest given the observed differences insize and color of star-forming field and cluster galaxies, that the environmenthas begun to influence/accelerate their evolution. however, the lack ofdifferences between field and cluster quiescent galaxies indicates that theenvironment has not begun to significantly influence their evolution at z~2.

1510.06072	the sfr-m* relation and empirical star-formation histories from zfourge  at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4	we explore star-formation histories (sfhs) of galaxies based on the evolutionof the star-formation rate stellar mass relation (sfr-m*). using data from thefourstar galaxy evolution survey (zfourge) in combination with far-ir imagingfrom the spitzer and herschel observatories we measure the sfr-m* relation at0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4. similar to recent works we find that the average infrared seds ofgalaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broadrange of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.we find that the sfr-m* relation is not consistent with a single power-law ofthe form sfr ~ m*^a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a~1 at lowmasses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (m_0) that ranges from10^9.5 - 10^10.8 msol, with evidence that m_0 increases with redshift. wecompare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmologicalsimulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the sfr-m* relationalbeit with systematic offsets. we use the evolving sfr-m* sequence to generatesfhs, finding that typical sfrs of individual galaxies rise at early times anddecline after reaching a peak. this peak occurs earlier for more massivegalaxies. we integrate these sfhs to generate mass-growth histories and compareto the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. wefind that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but thatthere is room for improvement at a more detailed level. at early times the sfhssuggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from thestellar mass function. however, at later times the sfhs under-predict theinferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due tomergers.

1511.02862	satellite quenching and galactic conformity at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5	we measure the evolution of the quiescent fraction and quenching efficiencyof satellites around star-forming and quiescent central galaxies with stellarmass $\log(m_{\mathrm{cen}}/m_{\odot})&gt;10.5$ at $0.3&lt;z&lt;2.5$. we combine imagingfrom three deep near-infrared-selected surveys (zfourge/candels, uds, andultravista), which allows us to select a stellar-mass complete sample ofsatellites with $\log(m_{\mathrm{sat}}/m_{\odot})&gt;9.3$. satellites for bothstar-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractionscompared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. we alsoobserve "galactic conformity": satellites around quiescent centrals are morelikely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals.in our sample, this conformity signal is significant at $\gtrsim3\sigma$ for$0.6&lt;z&lt;1.6$, whereas it is only weakly significant at $0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6$ and$1.6&lt;z&lt;2.5$. therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has beenpresent for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. the satellitequenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, butdoes not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the masslimit of our sample. when we compare the satellite quenching efficiency ofstar-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescentcentrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformitysignal decreases, but remains statistically significant at $0.6&lt;z&lt;0.9$. this isevidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation propertiesof the central as well as to the mass of the halo. we discuss physical effectsthat may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allowfor continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites arequenched.

astro-ph;0010505	a low global star formation rate in the rich galaxy cluster ac114 at  z=0.32	we present the results of a wide-field survey for h-alpha emitting galaxiesin the cluster ac114 at z=0.32. spectra centred on h-alpha at the clusterredshift have been obtained for 586 galaxies to i~22 out to a radius around2mpc. at most, only ~10% of these were found to be h-alpha-emitting clustermembers. these objects are predominantly blue and of late-type spiralmorphology, consistent with them hosting star formation. however, ~65% of thecluster members classified morphologically as spirals (with hst), have nodetectable h-alpha emission; star-formation and morphological evolution incluster galaxies appear to be largely decoupled. changes in the h-alphadetection rate and the strength of h-alpha emission with environment are foundto be weak within the region studied. star formation within the cluster membersis also found to be strongly and uniformly suppressed, with the rates inferredfrom the h-alpha emission not exceeding 4mo/yr, and ac114's h-alpha luminosityfunction being an order of magnitude below that observed for field galaxies atthe same redshift. none of the galaxies detected have the high star formationrates associated with `starburst' galaxies; however, this may still bereconciliable with the known (8+/-3%) fraction of `post-starburst' galaxieswithin ac114, given the poorly determined but short lifetimes of starbursts andthe possibility that much of the associated star formation is obscured by dust.

astro-ph;0011104	microslit nod-shuffle spectroscopy - a technique for achieving very high  densities of spectra	we describe a new approach to obtaining very high surface densities ofoptical spectra in astronomical observations with extremely accuratesubtraction of night sky emission. the observing technique requires that thetelescope is nodded rapidly between targets and adjacent sky positions; objectand sky spectra are recorded on adjacent regions of a low-noise ccd throughcharge shuffling. this permits the use of extremely high densities of smallslit apertures (`microslits') since an extended slit is not required for skyinterpolation. the overall multi-object advantage of this technique is as largeas 2.9x that of conventional multi-slit observing for an instrumentconfiguration which has an underfilled ccd detector and is always &gt;1.5 for hightarget densities. the `nod-shuffle' technique has been practically implementedat the anglo-australian telescope as the `ldss++ project' and achievessky-subtraction accuracies as good as 0.04%, with even better performancepossible. this is a factor of ten better than is routinely achieved withlong-slits. ldss++ has been used in various observational modes, which wedescribe, and for a wide variety of astronomical projects. the nod-shuffleapproach should be of great benefit to most spectroscopic (e.g. long-slit,fiber, integral field) methods and would allow much deeper spectroscopy on verylarge telescopes (10m or greater) than is currently possible. finally wediscuss the prospects of using nod-shuffle to pursue extremely longspectroscopic exposures (many days) and of mimicking nod-shuffle observationswith infrared arrays.

astro-ph;0012429	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: near infrared galaxy luminosity  functions	we combine the 2mass extended source catalogue and the 2dfgrs to produce anir selected galaxy catalogue with 17,173 measured redshifts. we use thisextensive dataset to estimate the j and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. thelfs are fairly well fit by schechter functions with j: m*-5log h=-22.36+/-0.02, alpha= -0.93+/-0.04, phi=0.0104+/-0.0016 h^3/mpc^3 and k:m*-5log h= -23.44+/-0.03, alpha=-0.96+/-0.05, phi=0.0108+/-0.0016 h^3/mpc^3(2mass kron magnitudes). these parameters assume a cosmological model withomega=0.3 and lambda=0.7. with datasets of this size, systematic rather thanrandom errors are the dominant source of uncertainty in the determination ofthe lf. we carry out a careful investigation of possible systematic effects inour data. the surface brightness distribution of the sample shows no evidencethat significant numbers of low surface brightness or compact galaxies aremissed by the survey. we estimate the present-day distributions of b-k and j-kcolours as a function of absolute magnitude and use models of the galaxystellar populations, constrained by the observed optical and infrared colours,to infer the galaxy stellar mass function. integrated over all galaxy masses,this yields a total mass fraction in stars (in units of the critical massdensity) of omega_*.h= (1.6+/-0.24)/10^3 for a kennicutt imf and omega_*.h=(2.9+/-0.43)/10^3 for a salpeter imf. these values agree with those inferredfrom observational estimates of the star formation history of the universeprovided that dust extinction corrections are modest.

astro-ph;0109152	evidence for a non-zero lambda and a low matter density from a combined  analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey and cosmic microwave background  anisotropies	we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the power spectra of the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropiesunder the assumptions that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic, gaussianand well described by power laws with scalar and tensor indices of n_s and n_t.on its own, the 2dfgrs sets tight limits on the parameter combination omega_mh, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density inbaryons omega_b/omega_m. the cmb anisotropy data alone set poor constraints onthe cosmological constant and hubble constant because of a `geometricaldegeneracy' among parameters. furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the cmbdata allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons andcold dark matter. combining the cmb and 2dfgrs data sets helps to break boththe geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. the values of the parametersderived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models ofinflation, with the baryon density derived from primordial nucleosynthesis andwith direct measurements of the hubble parameter. in particular, we find strongevidence for a positive cosmological constant with a pm 2sigma range of 0.65 &lt;omega_lambda &lt; 0.85, completely independently of constraints on omega_\lambdaderived from type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0112162	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the amplitudes of fluctuations in the  2dfgrs and the cmb, and implications for galaxy biasing	we compare the amplitudes of fluctuations probed by the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey and by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies. by combining the 2dfgrs and cmb data we find the linear-theoryrms mass fluctuations in 8 mpc/h spheres to be sigma_8 = 0.73 +-0.05 (aftermarginalization over the matter density parameter omega_m and three other freeparameters). this normalization is lower than the cobe normalization andprevious estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with somerevised cluster abundance determinations. we also estimate thescale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch l_s = 1.9l_* apm-selectedgalaxies to be b(l_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.15h/mpc. if luminosity segregation operates on these scales, l_* galaxies wouldbe almost un-biased, b(l_*,z=0) = 0.96. these results are derived by assuming aflat lambda-cdm universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters andfixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.we also study the best fit pair (omega_m,b), and the robustness of the resultsto varying n and tau. various modelling corrections can each change theresulting b by 5-15 per cent. the results are compared with other independentmeasurements from the 2dfgrs itself, and from the sdss, cluster abundance andcosmic shear.

astro-ph;0203334	an h-alpha survey of the rich cluster a1689	(abridged) we present results of an h-alpha survey in the rich cluster a1689at z=0.18, using the ldss++ spectrograph on the aat. we obtained spectracovering redshifted h-alpha for 522 galaxies brighter than i=22.5, covering afield of 8.7'x8.7'. we detect h-alpha emission in 46 of these galaxies;accounting for selection effects due to sampling and cluster membership, wedetermine that 24% of cluster members brighter than m_r=-16.5+5log(h) aredetected with h-alpha flux greater than 4h^{-2}x 10^{38} ergs/s. thiscorresponds to a limiting star formation rate of 0.008 h^{-2} msun/yr, assuming1 magnitude of dust extinction. from a hubble space telescope mosaic covering7.5' x 10.0', we determine morphologies for 199 galaxies brighter than i=21,and find that 20% of the cluster members are of type sa or later. more than 90%of cluster spirals show h-alpha emission, compared with less than 10% of e ands0 galaxies. the cluster h-alpha luminosity function has a low normalisationrelative to the z~0.2 field, by ~50%, after accounting for the differentfraction of spiral galaxies in the two environments. when compared with localfield galaxies, this suggests that star formation activity is suppressed inearly-type cluster galaxies, relative to their field counterparts. our sampleincludes 29 galaxies previously observed with isocam at 6 and 15 microns. wedetect all 15-micron sources at h-alpha, so there is no evidence for any starformation completely hidden at h-alpha. comparing the 15-micron and h-alphafluxes, we find evidence that some mid-infrared-detected galaxies could beobscured by as much as 3 magnitudes of extinction at h-alpha, although thisdepends on the largely unknown contribution from any agn-heated dust to themid-infrared flux.

astro-ph;0203336	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the environmental dependence of galaxy  star formation rates near clusters	we have measured the equivalent width of the h-alpha emission line for 11006galaxies brighter than m_b=-19 (lcdm) at 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 in the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2df), in the fields of seventeen known galaxy clusters. the limitedredshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, andto residuals from night sky emission lines. we use these measurements to tracemustar, the star formation rate normalized to lstar, as a function of distancefrom the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. we find that thedistribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasingdistance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution atdistances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. a correlation between starformation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independentof cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1galaxy (brighter than m_b=-19) per mpc^2. this characteristic scale correspondsapproximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. the samecorrelation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the clustercentre. we conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are notrestricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the densityexceeds this critical value. the present day abundance of such systems, and thestrong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth ofstructure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average starformation rate. finally, the low star formation rates well beyond thevirialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressurestripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations ingalaxy properties with environment.

astro-ph;0206256	parameter constraints for flat cosmologies from cmb and 2dfgrs power  spectra	we constrain flat cosmological models with a joint likelihood analysis of anew compilation of data from the cosmic microwave background (cmb) and from the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). fitting the cmb alone yields a knowndegeneracy between the hubble constant h and the matter density omega_m, whicharises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular powerspectrum. this `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail andshown to follow a simple relation omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. adding the 2dfgrspower spectrum constrains omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. if tensoranisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the hubbleconstant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and thephysical cdm and baryon densities omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.002 (standard rms errors). including a possible tensor componentcauses very little change to these figures; we set a upper limit to thetensor-to-scalar ratio of r&lt;0.7 at 95% confidence. we then show how these datacan be used to constrain the equation of state of the vacuum, and find w&lt;-0.52at 95% confidence. the preferred cosmological model is thus very wellspecified, and we discuss the precision with which future cmb data can bepredicted, given the model assumptions. the 2dfgrs power-spectrum data andcovariance matrix, and the cmb data compilation used here, are available fromhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/

astro-ph;0301005	the sloan digital sky survey: the cosmic spectrum and star-formation  history	we present a determination of the `cosmic optical spectrum' of the universe,i.e. the ensemble emission from galaxies, as determined from the red-selectedsloan digital sky survey main galaxy sample and compare with previous resultsof the blue-selected 2df galaxy redshift survey. broadly we find good agreementin both the spectrum and the derived star-formation histories. if we use apower-law star-formation history model where star-formation rate $\propto(1+z)^\beta$ out to z=1, then we find that $\beta$ of 2 to 3 is still the mostlikely model and there is no evidence for current surveys missing large amountsof star formation at high redshift. in particular `fossil cosmology' of thelocal universe gives measures of star-formation history which are consistentwith direct observations at high redshift. using the photometry of sdss we areable to derive the cosmic spectrum in absolute units (i.e.$ w \aa$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$) at 2--5\aa resolution and find good agreement with publishedbroad-band luminosity densities. for a salpeter imf the best fit stellarmass/light ratio is 3.7--7.5 $\msun/\lsun$ in the r-band (corresponding to$\omstars h = 0.0025$--0.0055) and from both the stellar emission history andthe h$\alpha$ luminosity density independently we find a cosmologicalstar-formation rate of 0.03--0.04 h $\msun$ yr$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$ today.

astro-ph;0402436	the gemini deep deep survey: i. introduction to the survey, catalogs and  composite spectra	the gemini deep deep survey (gdds) is an ultra-deep (k&lt;20.6 mag, i&lt;24.5 mag)redshift survey targeting galaxies in the "redshift desert" between 1&lt;z&lt;2. theprimary goal of the survey is to constrain the space density at high redshiftof evolved high-mass galaxies. we obtained 309 spectra in four widely-separated30 arcmin^2 fields using the gemini north telescope and the gemini multi-objectspectrograph (gmos). the spectra define a one-in-two sparse sample of thereddest and most luminous galaxies near the i-k vs. i color-magnitude trackmapped out by passively evolving galaxies in the redshift interval 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.8.this sample is augmented by a one-in-seven sparse sample of the remaininghigh-redshift galaxy population. typical exposures times were 20-30 hours perfield (in nod &amp; shuffle mode), and the resulting spectra are the deepest everobtained. in this paper we present our sample of 309 spectra, along withredshifts, identifications of spectral features, and photometry. the infraredselection underlying the survey means that the gdds is observing not onlystar-forming galaxies, as in most high-redshift galaxy surveys, but alsoquiescent evolved galaxies. the median redshift of the whole gdds sample isz=1.1. together with the data and catalogs, we present a summary of thecriteria for selecting the gdds fields, the rationale behind our mask designs,an analysis of the completeness of the survey, and a description of the datareduction procedures used. all data from the gdds are publicly available.(abridged)

astro-ph;0407464	fortis: pathfinder to the lyman continuum	shull et al. (1999) have asserted that the contribution of stars, relative toquasars, to the metagalactic background radiation that ionizes most of thebaryons in the universe remains almost completely unknown at all epochs. thepotential to directly quantify this contribution at low redshift has recentlybecome possible with the identification by galex of large numbers of sparselydistributed faint ultraviolet galaxies. neither stis nor fuse nor galex havethe ability to efficiently survey these sparse fields and directly measure thelyman continuum radiation that may leak into the low redshift (z &lt; 0.4)intergalactic medium. we present here a design for a new type of farultraviolet spectrograph, one that is more sensitive, covers wider fields, andcan provide spectra and images of a large number of objects simultaneously,called the far-ultraviolet off rowland-circle telescope for imaging andspectroscopy (fortis). we intend to use a sounding rocket flight to validatethe new instrument with a simple long-slit observation of the starburstpopulations in the galaxy m83. if however, the long-slit were replaced withmicroshutter array, this design could isolate the chains of blue galaxies foundby galex over an ~30' diameter field-of-view and directly address the lymancontinuum problem in a long duration orbital mission. thus, our development ofthe sounding rocket instrument is a pathfinder to a new wide fieldspectroscopic technology for enabling the potential discovery of the longhypothesized but elusive lyman continuum radiation that is thought to leak fromlow redshift galaxies and contribute to the ionization of the universe.

astro-ph;0408536	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the local e+a galaxy population	we select a sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) e+a galaxies from the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the spectra of these objects are defined by stronghydrogen balmer absorption lines (h-delta, h-gamma, h-beta) combined with alack of [oii] 3727a emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst ofstar formation. the e+a spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the processof evolution. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity function of the e+a galaxies. we find that the environments areconsistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies: low-redshift e+a systems arelocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poorgroups. however, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using threebalmer absorption lines h-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (e/s0)systems. in a small but significant number we find evidence for recent majormergers, such as tidal tails. we infer that major mergers are one importantformation mechanism for e+a galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. at lowredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thusthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usualmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. regarding the selection of e+agalaxies: we find that basing the balmer-line criterion solely on h-deltaabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems withdetectable h-alpha emission. in these objects the [oii] emission is presumablyeither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the(h-gamma, h-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

astro-ph;0503401	gemini deep deep survey vi: massive hdelta-strong galaxies at z=1	we show that there has been a dramatic decline in the abundance of massivegalaxies with strong hdelta stellar absorption lines from z=1.2 to the present.these ``hdelta-strong'', or hds, galaxies have undergone a recent and rapidbreak in their star-formation activity. combining data from the gemini deepdeep and the sloan digital sky surveys to make mass-matched samples(m*&gt;=10^10.2 msun), with 25 and 50,255 galaxies, respectively), we find thatthe fraction of galaxies in an hds phase has decreased from about 50% at z=1.2to a few percent today. this decrease in fraction is due to an actual decreasein the number density of massive hds systems by a factor of 2-4, coupled withan increase in the number density of massive galaxies by about 30 percent. weshow that this result depends only weakly on the threshold chosen for thehdelta equivalent width to define hds systems (if greater than 4 a) andcorresponds to a (1+z)^{2.5\pm 0.7} evolution. spectral synthesis studies ofthe high-redshift population using the pegase code, treating hdelta_a, ew[oii],dn4000, and rest-frame colors, favor models in which the balmer absorptionfeatures in massive hdelta-strong systems are the echoes of intense episodes ofstar-formation that faded about 1 gyr prior to the epoch of observation. thez=1.4-2 epoch appears to correspond to a time at which massive galaxies are intransition from a mode of sustained star formation to a relatively quiescentmode with weak and rare star-formation episodes. we argue that the most likelylocal descendants of the distant massive hds galaxies are passively evolvingmassive galaxies in the field and small groups.
