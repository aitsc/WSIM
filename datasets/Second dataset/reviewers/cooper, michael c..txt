0901.4338	the large-scale environments of type ia supernovae: evidence for a  metallicity bias in the rate or luminosity of prompt ia events	using data drawn from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the sdss-iisupernova survey, we study the local environments of confirmed type iasupernovae (sne ia) in the nearby universe. at 0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, we find that snia events in blue, star-forming galaxies occur preferentially in regions oflower galaxy density relative to galaxies of like stellar mass andstar-formation rate, while sne ia in nearby red galaxies show no significantenvironment dependence within the measurement uncertainties. even though oursamples of sne in red hosts are relatively small in number, tests on simulatedgalaxy samples suggest that the observed distribution of environments for redsn ia hosts is in poor agreement with a cluster type ia rate strongly elevatedrelative to the field rate. finally, after considering the impact of galaxymorphology, stellar age, stellar metallicity, and other relevant galaxyproperties, we conclude that the observed correlation between the sn ia rateand environment in the star-forming galaxy population is likely driven by agas-phase metallicity effect, such that prompt type ia supernovae occur moreoften or are more luminous in metal-poor systems.

0902.0363	aegis: the clustering of x-ray agn relative to galaxies at z~1	we measure the clustering of non-quasar x-ray agn at z=0.7-1.4 in the aegisfield. using the cross-correlation of 113 chandra-selected agn, with a medianlog l_x=42.8 erg s^-1, with ~5,000 deep2 galaxies, we find that the x-ray agnare fit by a power law with a clustering scale length of r_0=5.95 +/-0.90 h^-1mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. x-ray agn have a similar clustering amplitudeas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantlymore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. the x-ray agn clusteringstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; agn in red hostgalaxies are significantly more clustered than agn in blue host galaxies, witha relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue deep2 galaxies. wedetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, x-ray luminosity, orhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. we find evidence for galaxieshosting x-ray agn to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matchingjoint optical color and magnitude distributions. this implies that galaxieshosting x-ray agn are more likely to reside in groups and more massive darkmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an x-rayagn. in comparison to optically-selected quasars in the deep2 fields, we findthat x-ray agn at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (witha 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive darkmatter halos. our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasarphase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with alower-luminosity x-ray agn, if they are similar objects at differentevolutionary stages.

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0910.0245	galaxy assembly bias on the red sequence	using samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey, we study therelationship between local galaxy density and the properties of galaxies on thered sequence. after removing the mean dependence of average overdensity (or"environment") on color and luminosity, we find that there remains a strongresidual trend between luminosity-weighted mean stellar age and environment,such that galaxies with older stellar populations favor regions of higheroverdensity relative to galaxies of like color and luminosity (and hence oflike stellar mass). even when excluding galaxies with recent star-formationactivity (i.e., younger mean stellar ages) from the sample, we still find ahighly significant correlation between stellar age and environment at fixedstellar mass. this residual age-density relation provides direct evidence foran assembly bias on the red sequence such that galaxies in higher-densityregions formed earlier than galaxies of similar mass in lower-densityenvironments. we discuss these results in the context of the age-metallicitydegeneracy and in comparison to previous studies at low and intermediateredshift. finally, we consider the potential role of assembly bias inexplaining recent results regarding the evolution of post-starburst (orpost-quenching) galaxies and the environmental dependence of the type iasupernova rate.

1001.4560	where do wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers occur? a study of the  environments of close galaxy pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey	we study the environment of wet, dry, and mixed galaxy mergers at 0.75 &lt; z &lt;1.2 using close pairs in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. we find that thetypical environment of mixed and dry merger candidates is denser than that ofwet mergers, mostly due to the color-density relation. while the galaxycompanion rate (nc) is observed to increase with overdensity, using n-bodysimulations we find that the fraction of pairs that will eventually mergedecreases with the local density, predominantly because interlopers are morecommon in dense environments. after taking into account the merger probabilityof pairs as a function of local density, we find only marginal environmentdependence of the fractional merger rate for wet mergers over the redshiftrange we have probed. on the other hand, the fractional dry merger rateincreases rapidly with local density due to the increased population of redgalaxies in dense environments. we also find that the environment distributionof k+a galaxies is similar to that of wet mergers alone and of wet+mixedmergers, suggesting a possible connection between k+a galaxies and wet and/orwet+mixed mergers. we conclude that, as early as z ~ 1, high-density regionsare the preferred environment in which dry mergers occur, and that present-dayred-sequence galaxies in overdense environments have, on average, undergone1.2+-0.3 dry mergers since this time, accounting for (38+-10)% of their massaccretion in the last 8 billion years. our findings suggest that dry mergersare crucial in the mass-assembly of massive red galaxies in dense environments,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in galaxy groups and clusters.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1009.3022	the average physical properties and star formation histories of the  uv-brightest star-forming galaxies at z~3.7	[abridged] we investigate the average physical properties and star formationhistories of the most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies at z~3.7. our resultsare derived from analyses of the average spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed from stacked optical to infrared photometry, of a sample of the1,902 most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies found in 5.3 square degrees of thenoao deep wide-field survey. we bin the sample according to uv luminosity, andfind that the shape of the average sed in the rest-frame optical and infraredis fairly constant with uv luminosity: i.e., more uv luminous galaxies are, onaverage, also more luminous at longer wavelengths. in the rest-uv, however, thespectral slope (measured at 0.13-0.28 um) rises steeply with the median uvluminosity from -1.8 at l l* to -1.2 in the brightest bin (l~4-5l*). we usepopulation synthesis analyses to derive the average physical properties ofthese galaxies and find that: (1) l_uv, and thus star formation rates (sfrs),scale closely with stellar mass such that more uv-luminous galaxies are alsomore massive; (2) the median ages indicate that the stellar populations arerelatively young (200-400 myr) and show little correlation with uv luminosity;and (3) more uv-luminous galaxies are dustier than their less-luminouscounterparts, such that l~4-5l* galaxies are extincted up to a(1600)=2 magwhile l l* galaxies have a(1600)=0.7-1.5 mag. based on these observations, weargue that the average star formation histories of uv-luminous galaxies arebetter described by models in which sfr increases with time in order tosimultaneously reproduce the tight correlation between the observed sfr andstellar mass, and the universally young ages of these galaxies. we demonstratethe potential of measurements of the sfr-m* relation at multiple redshifts todiscriminate between simple models of star formation histories.

1010.2495	automated morphological classification of sdss red sequence galaxies	(abridged) in the last decade, the advent of enormous galaxy surveys hasmotivated the development of automated morphological classification schemes todeal with large data volumes. existing automated schemes can successfullydistinguish between early and late type galaxies and identify mergercandidates, but are inadequate for studying detailed morphologies of redsequence galaxies. to fill this need, we present a new automated classificationscheme that focuses on making finer distinctions between early types roughlycorresponding to hubble types e, s0, and sa. we visually classify a sample of984 non-starforming sdss galaxies with apparent sizes &gt;14". we then develop anautomated method to closely reproduce the visual classifications, which bothprovides a check on the visual results and makes it possible to extendmorphological analysis to much larger samples. we visually classify thegalaxies into three bulge classes (bc) by the shape of the light profile in theouter regions: discs have sharp edges and bulges do not, while some galaxiesare intermediate. we separately identify galaxies with features: spiral arms,bars, clumps, rings, and dust. we find general agreement between bc and thebulge fraction b/t measured by the galaxy modeling package gim2d, but manyvisual discs have b/t&gt;0.5. three additional automated parameters -- smoothness,axis ratio, and concentration -- can identify many of these high-b/t discs toyield automated classifications that agree ~70% with the visual classifications(&gt;90% within one bc). both methods are used to study the bulge vs. discfrequency as a function of four measures of galaxy 'size': luminosity, stellarmass, velocity dispersion, and radius. all size indicators show a fall in discfraction and a rise in bulge fraction among larger galaxies.

1203.1625	dependence of galaxy quenching on halo mass and distance from its centre	we study the dependence of star-formation quenching on galaxy mass andenvironment, in the sdss (z~0.1) and the aegis (z~1). it is crucial that wedefine quenching by low star-formation rate rather than by red colour, giventhat one third of the red galaxies are star forming. we address stellar massm*, halo mass mh, density over the nearest n neighbours deltan, and distance tothe halo centre d. the fraction of quenched galaxies appears more stronglycorrelated with mh at fixed m* than with m* at fixed mh, while for satellitesquenching also depends on d. we present the m*-mh relation for centrals at z~1.at z~1, the dependence of quenching on m* at fixed mh is somewhat morepronounced than at z~0, but the quenched fraction is low (10%) and the haloesare less massive. for satellites, m*-dependent quenching is noticeable at highd, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently capturedsatellites. at small d, where satellites likely fell in more than a few gyrago, quenching strongly depends on mh, and not on m*. the mh-dependence ofquenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating inmassive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping,causing quenching. the interpretation of deltan is complicated by the fact thatit depends on the number of observed group members compared to n, motivatingthe use of d as a better measure of local environment.

1203.3192	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: design, observations, data reduction,  and redshifts	we describe the design and data sample from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey,the densest and largest precision-redshift survey of galaxies at z ~ 1completed to date. the survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massivegalaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down toabsolute magnitude m_b = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on thedeimos spectrograph at keck observatory. deep2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude ofr_ab=24.1. objects with z &lt; 0.7 are rejected based on bri photometry in threeof the four deep2 fields, allowing galaxies with z &gt; 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. approximatelysixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. most of thetargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z~ 1.45. the deimos 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers highspectral resolution (r~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and uniqueinternal kinematic information. extensive ancillary data are available in thedeep2 fields, particularly in the extended groth strip, which has evolved intoone of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. deep2 surpasses otherdeep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshiftaccuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. we alsoprovide an overview of the scientific highlights of the deep2 survey thus far.this paper is intended as a handbook for users of the deep2 data release 4,which includes all deep2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for thepublicly-available deep2 deimos data reduction pipelines.

(2005). in the optimization effort, we have taken particular careto ensure that the mock catalogs resemble the data as closely as possible, andwe have fine-tuned our methods separately on mocks constructed for the egs andthe rest of deep2. we have also probed the effect of the assumed cosmology onour inferred group-finding efficiency by performing our optimization on threedifferent mock catalogs with different background cosmologies, finding largedifferences in the group-finding success we can achieve for these differentmocks. using the mock catalog whose background cosmology is most consistentwith current data, we estimate that the deep2 group catalog is 72% complete and61% pure (74% and 67% for the egs) and that the group-finder correctlyclassifies 70% of galaxies that truly belong to groups, with an additional 46%of interloper galaxies contaminating the catalog (66% and 43% for the egs).(abridged)

1205.3789	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: dynamical modeling of the broad  line region in mrk 50	we present dynamical modeling of the broad line region (blr) in the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 50 using reverberation mapping data taken as part of the lick agnmonitoring project (lamp) 2011. we model the reverberation mapping datadirectly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the blr, as well asderiving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizingfactor or virial coefficient. we find that the geometry of the blr in mrk 50 isa nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, awidth of the blr of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of25\pm10 degrees above the plane. we also constrain the inclination angle to be9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. finally, the black hole mass of mrk 50 isinferred to be log10(m(bh)/msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). by comparison to thevirial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mappinganalysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f)= 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74based on aligning the m(bh)-{\sigma}* relation for agn and quiescent galaxies.while our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflowin the blr, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.

1207.2214	improved mock galaxy catalogs for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey from  subhalo abundance and environment matching	we develop empirical methods for modeling the galaxy population andpopulating cosmological n-body simulations with mock galaxies according to theobserved properties of galaxies in survey data. we use these techniques toproduce a new set of mock catalogs for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey basedon the output of the high-resolution bolshoi simulation, as well as two othersimulations with different cosmological parameters, all of which we release forpublic use. the mock-catalog creation technique uses subhalo abundance matchingto assign galaxy luminosities to simulated dark-matter halos. it then addscolor information to the resulting mock galaxies in a manner that depends onthe local galaxy density, in order to reproduce the measured color-environmentrelation in the data. in the course of constructing the catalogs, we testvarious models for including scatter in the relation between halo mass andgalaxy luminosity, within the abundance-matching framework. we find that thereis no constant-scatter model that can simultaneously reproduce both theluminosity function and the autocorrelation function of deep2. this result hasimplications for galaxy-formation theory, and it restricts the range ofcontexts in which the mocks can be usefully applied. nevertheless, carefulcomparisons show that our new mocks accurately reproduce a wide range of theother properties of the deep2 catalog, suggesting that they can be used to gaina detailed understanding of various selection effects in deep2.

1210.4173	the dependence of quenching upon the inner structure of galaxies at  0.5&lt;z&lt; 0.8 in the deep2/aegis survey	the shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'.although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exactmechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.this paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenchingprocesses through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surfacestellar mass density and sersic index (n). we analyze the rest-frame u-b colorcorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies inthe redshift range 0.5&lt; z&lt;0.8 from the deep2/aegis survey. we find that sersicindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters andresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. there exists,however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. we hypothesize that their sersicvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, agns, and/or poor fits,leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternativeto sersic index. not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tightrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies ismost physically linked with quenching. furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority ofthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since theirgim2d bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses ofsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass mustabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. we discuss atwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates arecontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and asecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellarmass build-up.

1210.6694	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: clustering dependence on galaxy  stellar mass and star formation rate at z~1	we present deep2 galaxy clustering measurements at z~1 as a function ofstellar mass, star formation rate (sfr), and specific sfr (ssfr). we find astrong positive correlation between stellar mass and clustering amplitude on1-10 h^-1 mpc scales for blue, star-forming galaxies with 9.5 &lt; log(m_*/m_sun)&lt; 11 and no dependence for red, quiescent galaxies with 10.5 &lt; log(m_*/m_sun) &lt;11.5. using recently re-calibrated deep2 sfrs from restframe b-band magnitudeand optical colors, we find that within the blue galaxy population at z~1, theclustering amplitude increases strongly with increasing sfr and decreasingssfr. for red galaxies there is no significant correlation between clusteringamplitude and either sfr or ssfr. blue galaxies with high sfr or low ssfr areas clustered on large scales as red galaxies. we find that the clustering trendobserved with sfr can be explained mostly, but not entirely, by the correlationbetween stellar mass and clustering amplitude for blue galaxies. we also showthat galaxies above the star-forming "main sequence" are less clustered thangalaxies below the main sequence, at a given stellar mass. these results arenot consistent with the high ssfr population being dominated by major mergers.we also measure the clustering amplitude of our samples on small scales (&lt; 0.3h^-1 mpc) and find an enhanced clustering signal relative to the best-fitlarge-scale power law for red galaxies with high stellar mass, blue galaxieswith high sfr, and both red and blue galaxies with high ssfr. the increasedsmall-scale clustering for galaxies with high ssfrs is likely linked totriggered star formation in interacting galaxies. these measurements providestrong constraints on galaxy evolution and halo occupation distribution modelsat z~1.

1301.5870	groups of two galaxies in sdss: implications of colours on star  formation quenching time-scales	we have devised a method to select galaxies that are isolated in their darkmatter halo (n=1 systems) and galaxies that reside in a group of exactly two(n=2 systems). our n=2 systems are widely-separated (up to$\sim$\,200\,$h^{-1}$\,kpc), where close galaxy-galaxy interactions are notdominant. we apply our selection criteria to two volume-limited samples ofgalaxies from sdss dr6 with $m_{r}-5 \log_{10} h \leq$ -19 and -20 to study theeffects of the environment of very sparse groups on galaxy colour. forsatellite galaxies in a group of two, we find a red excess attributed to starformation quenching of 0.15\,$\pm$\,0.01 and 0.14\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and-20 samples, respectively, relative to isolated galaxies of the same stellarmass. assuming n=1 systems are the progenitors of n=2 systems, animmediate-rapid star formation quenching scenario is inconsistent with theseobservations. a delayed-then-rapid star formation quenching scenario with adelay time of 3.3 and 3.7\,gyr for the -19 and -20 samples, respectively,yields a red excess prediction in agreement with the observations. theobservations also reveal that central galaxies in a group of two have a slightblue excess of 0.06\,$\pm$\,0.02 and 0.02\,$\pm$\,0.01 for the -19 and -20samples, respectively, relative to n=1 populations of the same stellar mass.our results demonstrate that even the environment of very sparse groups ofluminous galaxies influence galaxy evolution and in-depth studies of thesesimple systems are an essential step towards understanding galaxy evolution ingeneral.

(2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1307.3247	evidence for a correlation between the sizes of quiescent galaxies and  local environment to z ~ 2	we present evidence for a strong relationship between galaxy size andenvironment for the quiescent population in the redshift range 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.environments were measured using projected galaxy overdensities on a scale of400 kpc, as determined from ~ 96,000 k-band selected galaxies from the ukidssultra deep survey (uds). sizes were determined from ground-based k-bandimaging, calibrated using space-based candels hst observations in the centre ofthe uds field, with photometric redshifts and stellar masses derived from11-band photometric fitting. from the resulting size-mass relation, we confirmthat quiescent galaxies at a given stellar mass were typically ~ 50 % smallerat z ~ 1.4 compared to the present day. at a given epoch, however, we find thatpassive galaxies in denser environments are on average significantly larger ata given stellar mass. the most massive quiescent galaxies (m_stellar &gt; 2 x10^11 m_sun) at z &gt; 1 are typically 50 % larger in the highest densityenvironments compared to those in the lowest density environments. using montecarlo simulations, we reject the null hypothesis that the size-mass relation isindependent of environment at a significance &gt; 4.8 sigma for the redshift range1 &lt; z &lt; 2. in contrast, the evidence for a relationship between size andenvironment is much weaker for star-forming galaxies.

1307.3552	a dichotomy in satellite quenching around l* galaxies	we examine the star formation properties of bright (~0.1 l*) satellitesaround isolated ~l* hosts in the local universe using spectroscopicallyconfirmed systems in the sloan digital sky survey dr7. our selection method iscarefully designed with the aid of n-body simulations to avoid groups andclusters. we find that satellites are significantly more likely to be quenchedthan a stellar mass-matched sample of isolated galaxies. remarkably, thisquenching occurs only for satellites of hosts that are themselves quenched:while star formation is unaffected in the satellites of star-forming hosts,satellites around quiescent hosts are more than twice as likely to be quenchedthan stellar-mass matched field samples. one implication of this is thatwhatever shuts down star formation in isolated, passive l* galaxies also playsat least an indirect role in quenching star formation in their brightsatellites. the previously-reported tendency for "galactic conformity" incolor/morphology may be a by-product of this host-specific quenching dichotomy.the s\'ersic indices of quenched satellites are statistically identical tothose of field galaxies with the same specific star formation rates, suggestingthat environmental and secular quenching give rise to the same morphologicalstructure. by studying the distribution of pairwise velocities between thehosts and satellites, we find dynamical evidence that passive host galaxiesreside in dark matter halos that are ~45% more massive than those ofstar-forming host galaxies of the same stellar mass. we emphasize that evenaround passive hosts, the mere fact that galaxies become satellites does nottypically result in star formation quenching: we find that only ~30% of ~0.1 l*galaxies that fall in from the field are quenched around passive hosts,compared with ~0% around star forming hosts.

0801.2769	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the red sequence agn fraction and its  environment and redshift dependence	we measure the dependence of the agn fraction on local environment at z~1,using spectroscopic data taken from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey, andchandra x-ray data from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). to provide a clean sample of agn we restrict our analysis tothe red sequence population; this also reduces additional colour-environmentcorrelations. we find evidence that high redshift liners in deep2 tend tofavour higher density environments relative to the red population from whichthey are drawn. in contrast, seyferts and x-ray selected agn at z~1 show little(or no) environmental dependencies within the same underlying population. wecompare these results with a sample of local agn drawn from the sdss. contraryto the high redshift behaviour, we find that both liners and seyferts in thesdss show a slowly declining red sequence agn fraction towards high densityenvironments. interestingly, at z~1 red sequence seyferts and liners areapproximately equally abundant. by z~0, however, the red seyfert population hasdeclined relative to the liner population by over a factor of 7. we speculateon possible interpretations of our results.

1402.1498	the surprising inefficiency of dwarf satellite quenching	we study dwarf satellite galaxy quenching using observations from the geha etal.

1407.3276	the mass dependance of satellite quenching in milky way-like halos	using the sloan digital sky survey, we examine the quenching of satellitegalaxies around isolated milky way-like hosts in the local universe. we findthat the efficiency of satellite quenching around isolated galaxies is low androughly constant over two orders of magnitude in satellite stellar mass($m_{*}$ = $10^{8.5}-10^{10.5} \, m_{\odot}$), with only $\sim~20\%$ of systemsquenched as a result of environmental processes. while largely independent ofsatellite stellar mass, satellite quenching does exhibit clear dependence onthe properties of the host. we show that satellites of passive hosts aresubstantially more likely to be quenched than those of star-forming hosts, andwe present evidence that more massive halos quench their satellites moreefficiently. these results extend trends seen previously in more massive hosthalos and for higher satellite masses. taken together, it appears that galaxieswith stellar masses larger than about $10^{8}~m_{\odot}$ are uniformlyresistant to environmental quenching, with the relative harshness of the hostenvironment likely serving as the primary driver of satellite quenching. atlower stellar masses ($&lt; 10^{8}~m_{\odot}$), however, observations of the localgroup suggest that the vast majority of satellite galaxies are quenched,potentially pointing towards a characteristic satellite mass scale below whichquenching efficiency increases dramatically.

0804.4686	ubiquitous outflows in deep2 spectra of star-forming galaxies at z=1.4	galactic winds are a prime suspect for the metal enrichment of theintergalactic medium and may have a strong influence on the chemical evolutionof galaxies and the nature of qso absorption line systems. we use a sample of1406 galaxy spectra at z~1.4 from the deep2 redshift survey to show thatblueshifted mg ii 2796, 2803 a absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxiesat this epoch. this is the first detection of frequent outflowing galacticwinds at z~1. the presence and depth of absorption are independent of agnspectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisitefor driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. outflows are found incoadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x instar formation rate (sfr), calibrated from k-band and from mips ir fluxes. theoutflows have column densities of order n_h ~ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristicvelocities of ~ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in themost massive, highest sfr galaxies. the velocities suggest that the outflowinggas can escape into the igm and that massive galaxies can producecosmologically and chemically significant outflows. both the mg ii equivalentwidth and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar massand sfr, with v_wind ~ sfr^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshiftir-luminous galaxies. the high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxypopulation at z~1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors ofmassive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. the increase of outflowvelocity with mass and sfr constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolutionthat include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven modelsfor the wind physics.

1503.06803	taking care of business in a flash: constraining the timescale for  low-mass satellite quenching with elvis	the vast majority of dwarf satellites orbiting the milky way and m31 arequenched, while comparable galaxies in the field are gas-rich and star-forming.assuming that this dichotomy is driven by environmental quenching, we use theelvis suite of n-body simulations to constrain the characteristic timescaleupon which satellites must quench following infall into the virial volumes oftheir hosts. the high satellite quenched fraction observed in the local groupdemands an extremely short quenching timescale (~ 2 gyr) for dwarf satellitesin the mass range mstar ~ 10^6-10^8 msun. this quenching timescale issignificantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction ofmore massive satellites (~ 8 gyr), both in the local group and in more massivehost halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenchingmechanism at mstar &lt; 10^8 msun. combining our work with the results ofcomplementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression ofstar formation in massive satellites (mstar ~ 10^8 - 10^11 msun) is broadlyconsistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenchingtimescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time. below a critical stellarmass scale of ~ 10^8 msun, however, the required quenching times are muchshorter than the expected cold gas depletion times. instead, quenching must acton a timescale comparable to the dynamical time of the host halo. we posit thatram-pressure stripping can naturally explain this behavior, with the criticalmass (of mstar ~ 10^8 msun) corresponding to halos with gravitational restoringforces that are too weak to overcome the drag force encountered when movingthrough an extended, hot circumgalactic medium.

0805.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: environments of poststarburst galaxies  at z~0.1 and z~0.8	postststarburst (k+a) galaxies are candidates for galaxies in transition froma star-forming phase to a passively-evolving phase. we have spectroscopicallyidentified large samples of k+a galaxies both in the sdss at z~0.1 and in thedeep2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in hbetaemission rather than the more problematic [oii] 3727. based on measurements ofthe overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that k+a galaxiesbrighter than 0.4l*_b at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishableenvironment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments,but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. however, at higher-z, theenvironment distribution of k+a galaxies is more similar to red galaxies thanto blue galaxies. we conclude that the quenching of star formation and thebuild-up of the red sequence through the k+a phase is happening in relativelyoverdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing withtime, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same alongwith the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of allgalaxies has to grow with time. in addition, we do not find any significantdependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of k+as. the existenceof a large k+a population in the field at both redshifts indicates thatcluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which thesegalaxies are formed. we also demonstrates that studying k+a-environmentrelations by measuring the k+a fraction in different environments is highlynon-robust. statistical comparisons of the overall environment distributions ofdifferent populations are much better behaved.

1504.01203	the scatter in the hot gas content of early-type galaxies	optically-similar early-type galaxies are observed to have a large and poorlyunderstood range in the amount of hot, x-ray-emitting gas they contain.toinvestigate the origin of this diversity, we studied the hot gas properties ofall 42 early-type galaxies in the multiwavelength atlas$^{\rm 3d}$ survey thathave sufficiently deep {\sl chandra} x-ray observations. we related their hotgas properties to a number of internal and external physical quantities. tocharacterize the amount of hot gas relative to the stellar light, we use theratio of the gaseous x-ray luminosity to the stellar $k$-band luminosity,$l_{x_{\rm gas}}/l_k$; we also use the deviations of $l_{x_{\rm gas}}$ from thebest-fit $l_{x_{\rm gas}}$--$l_k$ relation (denoted $\delta l_{x_{\rm gas}}$).we quantitatively confirm previous suggestions that various effects conspire toproduce the large scatter in the observed $l_x/l_k$ relation. in particular, wefind that the deviations $\delta l_{x_{\rm gas}}$ are most strongly positivelycorrelated with the (low rates of) star formation and the hot gas temperaturesin the sample galaxies. this suggests that mild stellar feedback may energizethe gas without pushing it out of the host galaxies. we also find that galaxiesin high galaxy density environments tend to be massive slow-rotators, whilegalaxies in low galaxy density environments tend to be low mass, fast-rotators.moreover, cold gas in clusters and fields may have different origins. the starformation rate increases with cold gas mass for field galaxies but it appearsto be uncorrelated with cold gas for cluster galaxies.

1504.01391	merger-driven fueling of active galactic nuclei: six dual and offset  active galactic nuclei discovered with chandra and hubble space telescope  observations	dual active galactic nuclei (agns) and offset agns are kpc-scale separationsupermassive black holes pairs created during galaxy mergers, where both or oneof the black holes are agns, respectively. these dual and offset agns arevaluable probes of the link between mergers and agns but are challenging toidentify. here we present chandra/acis observations of 12 optically-selecteddual agn candidates at z &lt; 0.34, where we use the x-rays to identify agns. wealso present hst/wfc3 observations of 10 of these candidates, which reveal anystellar bulges accompanying the agns. we discover a dual agn system withseparation of 2.2 kpc, where the two stellar bulges have coincident [o iii] andx-ray sources. this system is an extremely minor merger (460:1) that mayinclude a dwarf galaxy hosting an intermediate mass black hole. we also findsix single agns, and five systems that are either dual or offset agns withseparations &lt; 10 kpc. four of the six dual agns and dual/offset agns are inongoing major mergers, and these agns are 10 times more luminous, on average,than the single agns in our sample. this hints that major mergers maypreferentially trigger higher luminosity agns. further, we find that confirmeddual agns have hard x-ray luminosities that are half of those of single agns atfixed [o iii] luminosity, on average. this could be explained by high densitiesof gas funneled to galaxy centers during mergers, and emphasizes the need fordeeper x-ray observations of dual agn candidates.

1504.02417	temperature-based metallicity measurements at z=0.8: direct calibration  of strong-line diagnostics at intermediate redshift	we present the first direct calibration of strong-line metallicitydiagnostics at significant cosmological distances using a sample at z=0.8 drawnfrom the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. oxygen and neon abundances are derivedfrom measurements of electron temperature and density. we directly comparevarious commonly used relations between gas-phase metallicity and strong lineratios of o, ne, and h at z=0.8 and z=0. there is no evolution with redshift athigh precision ($\delta \log{\mathrm{o/h}} = -0.01\pm0.03$, $\delta\log{\mathrm{ne/o}} = 0.01 \pm 0.01$). o, ne, and h line ratios follow the samelocus at z=0.8 as at z=0 with $\lesssim$0.02 dex evolution and low scatter($\lesssim$0.04 dex). this suggests little or no evolution in physicalconditions of hii regions at fixed oxygen abundance, in contrast to modelswhich invoke more extreme properties at high redshifts. we speculate thatoffsets observed in the [n ii]/h$\alpha$ versus [o iii]/h$\beta$ diagram athigh redshift are therefore due to [nii] emission, likely as a result ofrelatively high n/o abundance. if this is indeed the case, then nitrogen-basedmetallicity diagnostics suffer from systematic errors at high redshift. ourfindings indicate that locally calibrated abundance diagnostics based onalpha-capture elements can be reliably applied at z$\simeq$1 and possibly atmuch higher redshifts. this constitutes the first firm basis for the widespreaduse of empirical calibrations in high redshift metallicity studies.

1509.04291	the origin of double-peaked narrow lines in active galactic nuclei i:  very large array detections of dual agns and agn outflows	we have examined a subset of 18 active galactic nuclei (agns) drawn from asample of 81 galaxies that possess double-peaked narrow optical emission linespectra in the sloan digital sky survey, have two optical agn emissioncomponents separated by &gt;0.2", and are detected in the faint images of theradio sky at twenty-centimeters survey. without follow-up observations, thesources of the double-peaked narrow emission lines are uncertain, and may beproduced by kpc-scale separation dual active supermassive black holes, agnoutflows, or disk rotation. in this work, we propose a new methodology tocharacterize double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies based on opticallong-slit spectroscopy and high resolution multi-band very large arrayobservations. the nature of the radio emission in the sample galaxies isvaried. of the 18 galaxies, we detect two compact flat-spectrum radio coreswith projected spatial separations on the sky between 0.6-1.6 kpc in threegalaxies: j1023+3243, j1158+3231, and j1623+0808. the two radio sources arespatially coincident with the two optical components of ionized gas withagn-like line ratios, which confirms the presence of dual agns in these threegalaxies. dual agns account for only ~15% (3/18) of the double-peaked agns inour sample. gas kinematics produce ~75% (13/18) of the double-peaked narrowemission lines, distributed in the following way: 7 agn wind-driven outflows, 5radio-jet driven outflows, and one rotating narrow-line region. the remaining~10% (2/18) are ambiguous cases. our method demonstrates the power of spatiallyresolved spectroscopy and high resolution radio observations for theidentification of agn outflows and agn pairs with angular separations as smallas 0.18".

astro-ph;0406145	dynamics and stellar content of the giant southern stream in m31. i.  keck spectroscopy of red giant stars	we present results from a large spectroscopic survey of m31 red giants usingthe keck telescope/deimos. photometric pre-screening, based on the 100a-wideddo51 band centered on the mgb/mgh feature, was used to select spectroscopictargets. red giant candidates were targeted in a small field on m31's giantsouthern tidal stream at a projected distance of 31kpc from the galaxy center.we isolate a clean sample of 68 giants by removing contaminants (foregroundgalactic dwarfs and background galaxies) using spectroscopic, imaging, andphotometric methods. about 65% of the m31 stars are found to be members of thestream, while the rest appear to be members of the general halo population. themean (heliocentric) radial velocity of the stream in our field is -458 km/s, or-158 km/s relative to m31's systemic velocity, in good agreement with recentmeasurements at other stream locations. the intrinsic velocity dispersion ofthe stream is constrained to be 15_{-15}^{+8} km/s (90% confidence limits). thecompanion paper by font et al. (2004, astro-ph/0406146) discusses possibleorbits, implications of the coldness of the stream, and progenitor satelliteproperties. the kinematics (and perhaps [fe/h] distribution) of our halo sampleindicate that it is different from other m31 halo samples; this may be anindication of substructure in the halo. the stream seems to have a higher mean[fe/h] than the halo, -0.51 vs -0.74 dex, and a smaller [fe/h] spread. thestream's high metallicity implies that its progenitor must have been a luminousdwarf galaxy. the caii triplet strengths of the m31 giants are generallyconsistent with photometric estimates of their metallicity (derived by fittingrgb fiducials in the color-magnitude diagram). there is indirect evidence ofintermediate-age stars in the stream.

astro-ph;0409305	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: probing the evolution of dark matter  halos around isolated galaxies at z ~ 1	using the first 25% of deep2 redshift survey data, we probe the line-of-sightvelocity dispersion profile for isolated galaxies with absolute b-bandmagnitude -22&lt;m_b-5log(h)&lt;-21 at z=0.7-1.0, using satellite galaxies asluminous tracers of the underlying velocity distribution. measuring thevelocity dispersion beyond a galactocentric radius of ~200 kpc/h (physical)permits us to determine the total mass, including dark matter, around thesebright galaxies. we find a line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma_los) of162^{+44}_{-30} km/s at ~110 kpc/h, 136^{+26}_{-20} km/s at ~230 kpc/h, and150^{+55}_{-38} km/s at ~320 kpc/h. assuming an nfw model for the dark matterdensity profile, this corresponds to a mass within r_{200} ofm_200=5.5^{+2.5}_{-2.0} x 10^12 m_sun/h for our sample of satellite hosts withmean luminosity ~2.5l*. roughly $~60% of these host galaxies have early-typespectra and are red in restframe (u-b) color, consistent with the overall deep2sample in the same luminosity and redshift range. the halo mass determined fordeep2 host galaxies is consistent with that measured in the sloan digital skysurvey for host galaxies within a similar luminosity range relative to m*_b.this comparison is insensitive to the assumed halo mass profile, and implies anincrease in the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (m_200/l_b) of isolated galaxieswhich host satellites by a factor of ~2.5 from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. our results areconsistent with scenarios in which galaxies populate dark matter halossimilarly from z ~ 0 to z ~ 1, except for ~1 magnitude of evolution in theluminosity of all galaxies.

astro-ph;0506518	measuring galaxy environments with deep redshift surveys	we study the applicability of several galaxy environment measures(n^th-nearest-neighbor distance, counts in an aperture, and voronoi volume)within deep redshift surveys. mock galaxy catalogs are employed to mimicrepresentative photometric and spectroscopic surveys at high redshift (z ~ 1).we investigate the effects of survey edges, redshift precision, redshift-spacedistortions, and target selection upon each environment measure. we find thateven optimistic photometric redshift errors (\sigma_z = 0.02) smear out theline-of-sight galaxy distribution irretrievably on small scales; thissignificantly limits the application of photometric redshift surveys toenvironment studies. edges and holes in a survey field dramatically affect theestimation of environment, with the impact of edge effects depending upon theadopted environment measure. these edge effects considerably limit theusefulness of smaller survey fields (e.g. the goods fields) for studies ofgalaxy environment. in even the poorest groups and clusters, redshift-spacedistortions limit the effectiveness of each environment statistic; measuringdensity in projection (e.g. using counts in a cylindrical aperture or aprojected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure) significantly improves theaccuracy of measures in such over-dense environments. for the deep2 galaxyredshift survey, we conclude that among the environment estimators tested theprojected n^th-nearest-neighbor distance measure provides the most accurateestimate of local galaxy density over a continuous and broad range of scales.

astro-ph;0602248	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: mean ages and metallicities of red  field galaxies at z ~ 0.9 from stacked keck/deimos spectra	as part of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey, we analyze absorption linestrengths in stacked keck/deimos spectra of red field galaxies with weak to noemission lines, at redshifts 0.7 &lt;= z &lt;= 1. comparison with models of stellarpopulation synthesis shows that red galaxies at z ~ 0.9 have meanluminosity-weighted ages of the order of only 1 gyr and at least solarmetallicities. this result cannot be reconciled with a scenario where all starsevolved passively after forming at very high z. rather, a significant fractionof stars can be no more than 1 gyr old, which means that star formationcontinued to at least z ~ 1.2. furthermore, a comparison of these distantgalaxies with a local sdss sample, using stellar populations synthesis models,shows that the drop in the equivalent width of hdelta from z ~ 0.9 to 0.1 isless than predicted by passively evolving models. this admits of twointerpretations: either each individual galaxy experiences continuing low-levelstar formation, or the red-sequence galaxy population from z ~ 0.9 to 0.1 iscontinually being added to by new galaxies with younger stars.

astro-ph;0603177	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the relationship between galaxy  properties and environment at z ~ 1	we study the mean environment of galaxies in the deep2 galaxy redshift surveyas a function of rest-frame color, luminosity, and [oii] equivalent width. thelocal galaxy overdensity for &gt;14,000 galaxies at 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 1.35 is estimatedusing the projected 3rd-nearest-neighbor surface density. of the galaxyproperties studied, mean environment is found to depend most strongly on galaxycolor; all major features of the correlation between mean overdensity andrest-frame color observed in the local universe were already in place at z ~ 1.in contrast to local results, we find a substantial slope in the meandependence of environment on luminosity for blue, star-forming galaxies at z ~1, with brighter blue galaxies being found on average in regions of greateroverdensity. we discuss the roles of galaxy clusters and groups in establishingthe observed correlations between environment and galaxy properties at highredshift, and we also explore the evidence for a ``downsizing of quenching''from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. our results add weight to existing evidence that themechanism(s) that result in star-formation quenching are efficient in groupenvironments as well as clusters. this work is the first of its kind at highredshift and represents the first in a series of papers addressing the role ofenvironment in galaxy formation at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.

astro-ph;0605171	a new method for isolating m31 red giant stars: the discovery of stars  out to a radial distance of 165 kiloparsecs	we present a method for isolating a clean sample of red giant stars in theouterregions of the andromeda spiral galaxy (m31) from an ongoing spectroscopicsurvey using the deimos instrument on the keck 10-m telescope. the survey aimsto study the kinematics, global structure, substructure, and metallicity ofm31's halo. although most of our spectroscopic targets were photometricallyscreened to reject foreground milky way dwarf star contaminants, the latterclass of objects still constitutes a substantial fraction of the observedspectra in the sparse outer halo. our likelihood-based method for isolating m31red giants uses five criteria: (1) radial velocity, (2) photometry in theintermediate-width ddo51 band to measure the strength of the mgh/mgb absorptionfeatures, (3) strength of the na i 8190a absorption line doublet, (4) locationwithin an (i, v-i) color-magnitude diagram, and (5) comparison of photometric(cmd-based) versus spectroscopic (ca ii 8500a triplet-based) metallicityestimates. we also discuss k i and tio diagnostics for giant/dwarf separationthat might be useful in future analyses. training sets consisting of definitem31 red giants and galactic dwarf stars are used to derive empiricalprobabilitydistribution functions for each diagnostic. these functions are usedto calculate the likelihood that a given star is a red giant in m31 versus amilky way dwarf. by applying this diagnostic method to our spectroscopic dataset, we isolate 40 m31 red giants beyond a projected distance of r = 60 kpcfrom the galaxy's center, including three out at r ~ 165 kpc. the ability toidentify individual m31 red giants gives us an unprecedented level ofsensitivity in studying the properties of the galaxy's outer halo.

astro-ph;0607204	evolution in the halo masses of isolated galaxies between z~1 and z~0:  from deep2 to sdss	we measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio (m_{200}/l_b) andvirial-to-stellar mass ratio (m_{200}/m_\ast) for isolated ~ l* galaxiesbetween z~1 and z~0 by combining data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey andthe sloan digital sky survey. utilizing the motions of satellite galaxiesaround isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions andderive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. at both epochsthe velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,\sigma\propto m_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocitydispersion and host galaxy b-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from\sigma\propto l_b^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto l_b^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.the evolution in m_200/m_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar ashost galaxies with stellar mass below m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h maintain aconstant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)while host galaxies above m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. this result can be easilyunderstood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form starswhile star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the darkmatter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordancewith lcdm cosmological simulations. host galaxies that are red in u-b colorhave larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massivehalos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. the redshift and host galaxystellar mass dependence of m_200/m_\ast agrees qualitatively with themillennium run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0607272	aegis: enhancement of dust-enshrouded star formation in close galaxy  pairs and merging galaxies up to z ~ 1	using data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and hst/acs imaging in theextended groth strip, we select nearly 100 interacting galaxy systems includingkinematic close pairs and morphologically identified merging galaxies. spitzermips 24 micron fluxes of these systems reflect the current dusty star formationactivity, and at a fixed stellar mass (m_{*}) the median infrared luminosity(l_{ir}) among merging galaxies and close pairs of blue galaxies is twice (1.9+/- 0.4) that of control pairs drawn from isolated blue galaxies. enhancementdeclines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs and mergers andweaker in wide pairs compared to the control sample. at z ~ 0.9, 7.1% +/- 4.3%of massive interacting galaxies (m_{*} &gt; 2*10^{10} m_{solar}) are found to beulirgs, compared to 2.6% +/- 0.7% in the control sample. the large spread of irluminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting galaxies suggests that thisenhancement may depend on the merger stage as well as other as yet unidentifiedfactors (e.g., galaxy structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics, presenceof agn or bar). the contribution of interacting systems to the total irluminosity density is moderate (&lt;= 36 %).

astro-ph;0607454	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: clustering of quasars and galaxies at  z=1	we present the clustering of deep2 galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4 around quasarsidentified using both the sdss and deep2 surveys. we measure the two-pointcross-correlation of a sample of 36 optically-selected,spectroscopically-identified quasars from the sdss and 16 more found in thedeep2 survey with the full deep2 galaxy sample over scales 0.1 &lt; r_p &lt; 10mpc/h. the clustering amplitude is found to be similar to the auto-correlationfunction of deep2 galaxies, with a relative bias of b=0.89 +/-0.24 betweenquasars and deep2 galaxies at z~1. no significant dependence is found on scale,quasar luminosity, or redshift over the ranges we probe here. the clusteringamplitude errors are comparable to those from significantly larger quasarsamples, such as the 2df qso redshift survey. this results from the statisticalpower of cross-correlation techniques, which exploit the fact that galaxies aremuch more numerous than quasars. we also measure the local environments ofquasars using the 3rd-nearest-neighbor surface density of surrounding deep2galaxies. quasars are found in regions of similar mean overdensity as bluedeep2 galaxies; they differ in environment from the red deep2 galaxy populationat 2 sigma significance. our results imply that quasars do not reside inparticularly massive dark matter halos at these redshifts, with a mean darkmatter halo mass of m_200 ~ 3 10^12 solar masses in a concordance lcdmcosmology.

astro-ph;0607512	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: evolution of the color-density  relation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.35	using a sample of 19,464 galaxies drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey, we study the relationship between galaxy color and environment at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 1.35. we find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence dependsstrongly on local environment out to z &gt; 1, being larger in regions of greatergalaxy density. at all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measuredoverdensity. the observed correlations between the red fraction and localoverdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z &gt; 1 detected at agreater than 5-\sigma level. over the entire redshift regime studied, we findthat the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies morestrongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequencecounterparts at high redshift. at z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weaklycorrelates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to theclustering of ~ l* galaxies at that epoch must be small. our findings addweight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequencehas occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) atz &lt; 1.5. the strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.35suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-densityand color-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms(i.e., "nurture'') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by "nature'') uponthe galaxy population during their epoch of formation.

astro-ph;0608569	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of the blue fraction in  groups and the field	we explore the behavior of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range0.75 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3 in the deep2 survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxiesin groups. the primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in drivingthe evolution of galaxy colour at high z. the colour segregation observedbetween local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: deep2groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. at fixed z,there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, suchthat brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in thefield. in addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction andgroup richness. in terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and thefield remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshiftthe blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field bluefractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. careful tests indicate that thiseffect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. to furtherensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock deep2catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensityrelation observed in deep2 and use these to test our methods. the convergencebetween the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that deep2 galaxygroups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this resultis broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models ofgalaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth.

astro-ph;0702643	the stellar mass tully-fisher relation to z=1.2 from aegis	we combine newly measured rotation velocities, velocity dispersions, andstellar masses to construct stellar mass tully-fisher relations (m*tfrs) for544 galaxies with strong emission lines at 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2 from the all wavelengthextended groth strip international survey (aegis) and the deep extragalacticevolutionary probe 2 survey (deep2). the conventional m*tfr using only rotationvelocity (vrot) shows large scatter (~1.5 dex in velocity). the scatter andresiduals are correlated with morphology in the sense that disturbed, compact,and major merger galaxies have lower velocities for their masses. we constructan m*tfr using the kinematic estimator s_0.5 which is defined as sqrt(0.5vrot^2+ sigma_g^2) and accounts for disordered or non-circular motions through thegas velocity dispersion (sigma_g). the new m*tfr, termed s_0.5/m*tfr, isremarkably tight over 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2 with no detectable evolution of its interceptor slope with redshift. the average best fit relation has 0.47 dex scatter instellar mass, corresponding to ~1.2 'magnitudes,' assuming a constantmass-to-light ratio. interestingly, the s_0.5/m*tfr is consistent with theabsorption-line based stellar mass faber-jackson relation for nearby ellipticalgalaxies in terms of slope and intercept, which might suggest a physicalconnection between the two relations.

astro-ph;0703029	stellar kinematics in the complicated inner spheroid of m31: discovery  of substructure along the southeastern minor axis and its relationship to the  giant southern stream	we present the discovery of a kinematically-cold stellar population along these minor axis of the andromeda galaxy (m31) that is likely the forwardcontinuation of m31's giant southern stream. this discovery was made in thecourse of an on-going spectroscopic survey of red giant branch (rgb) stars inm31 using the deimos instrument on the keck ii 10-m telescope. stellarkinematics are investigated in eight fields located 9-30 kpc from m31's center(in projection). a likelihood method based on photometric and spectroscopicdiagnostics is used to isolate confirmed m31 rgb stars from foreground milkyway dwarf stars: for the first time, this is done without using radial velocityas a selection criterion, allowing an unbiased study of m31's stellarkinematics. the radial velocity distribution of the 1013 m31 rgb stars showsevidence for the presence of two components. the broad (hot) component has avelocity dispersion of 129 km/s and presumably represents m31's virializedspheroid. a significant fraction (19%) of the population is in a narrow (cold)component centered near m31's systemic velocity with a velocity dispersion thatdecreases with increasing radial distance, from 55.5 km/s at r_proj=12 kpc to10.6 km/s at r_proj=18 kpc. the spatial and velocity distribution of the coldcomponent matches that of the "southeast shelf" predicted by the fardal et al.(2007) orbital model of the progenitor of the giant southern stream. themetallicity distribution of the cold component matches that of the giantsouthern stream, but is about 0.2 dex more metal rich on average than that ofthe hot spheroidal component. we discuss the implications of our discovery onthe interpretation of the intermediate-age spheroid population found in thisregion in recent ultra-deep hst imaging studies.

0810.3235	inspiralling supermassive black holes: a new signpost for galaxy mergers	we present a new technique for observationally identifying galaxy mergersspectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. our techniqueexploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (smbhs) powering activegalactic nuclei (agns) in merger-remnant galaxies. because structure in theuniverse is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host acentral smbh, some galaxies should possess two smbhs near their centers as theresult of a recent merger. these smbhs spiral to the center of the resultantmerger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the smbhs may power agns. using thedeep2 galaxy redshift survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91exhibit [o iii] and hbeta emission lines indicative of seyfert 2 activity. ofthese, 32 agns have [o iii] emission-line redshifts significantly differentfrom the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocityoffsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. two of these agns exhibit double-peaked [oiii] emission lines, while the remaining 30 agns each exhibit a single set ofvelocity-offset [o iii] emission lines. after exploring a variety of physicalmodels for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation isinspiralling smbhs in merger-remnant galaxies. based on this interpretation, wefind that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting agns are also mergerremnants, which implies that mergers may trigger agn activity in red galaxies.the agn velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a mergerrate of ~3 mergers/gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 &lt; z &lt; 0.82.
