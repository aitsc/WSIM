0707.2782	mass-selection and the evolution of the morphology-density relation from  z=0.8 to z=0	we examined the morphology-density relations for galaxy samples selected byluminosity and by mass in each of five massive x-ray clusters from z=0.023 to0.83 for 674 spectroscopically-confirmed members. rest-frame optical colors andvisual morphologies were obtained primarily from hubble space telescope images.morphology-density relations (mdr) are derived in each cluster from a complete,luminosity-selected sample of 452 galaxies with a magnitude limit m_v &lt;m^{*}_{v} + 1. the change in the early-type fraction with redshift matchesprevious work for massive clusters of galaxies. we performed a similaranalysis, deriving mdrs for complete, mass-selected samples of 441 galaxieswith a mass-limit of 10^{10.6} m_{\sun}. our mass limit includes faint objects,the equivalent of =~1 mag below l^{*} for the red cluster galaxies, andencompasses =~70% of the stellar mass in cluster galaxies. the mdrs in themass-selected sample at densities of sigma &gt; 50 galaxies mpc^{-2} are similarto those in the luminosity-selected sample but show larger early-typefractions. however, the trend with redshift in the fraction of elliptical ands0 galaxies with masses &gt; 10^{10.6} m_{\sun} differs significantly between themass- and luminosity-selected samples. the clear trend seen in the early-typefraction from z=0 to z=~ 0.8 is not found in mass-selected samples. theearly-type galaxy fraction changes much less, and is consistent with beingconstant at 92% +/- 4% at \sigma&gt; 500 galaxies mpc^{-2} and 83 +/- 3% at 50 &lt;\sigma &lt; 500 galaxies mpc^{-2}. this suggests that galaxies of mass lower than&gt; 10^{10.6} m_{\sun} play a significant role in the evolution of the early-typefraction in luminosity-selected samples.

1009.1423	cluster galaxies in xmmu j2235-2557: galaxy population properties in  most massive environments at z~1.4	we present a multi-wavelength study of galaxy populations in the core of themassive, x-ray luminous cluster xmmu j2235 at z=1.39, based on vlt and hstoptical and near-infrared photometry. luminosity functions in the z, h, and ksbands show a faint-end slope consistent with being flat, and a characteristicmagnitude m* close to passive evolution predictions of m* of local massiveclusters, with a formation redshift z&gt;2. the color-magnitude and color-massdiagrams show evidence of a tight red sequence of massive galaxies, withoverall old stellar populations, generally early-type morphology, typicallyshowing early-type spectral features and rest-frame far-uv emission consistentwith very low star formation rates (sfr&lt;0.2msun/yr). star forming spectroscopicmembers, with sfrs of up to ~100msun/yr, are all located at clustercentricdistances &gt;~250kpc, with the central cluster region already appearingeffectively quenched. massive galaxies in the core of this cluster appear to bein an advanced evolutionary stage in terms of both star formation and massassembly. the high-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function is essentiallyalready in place, and the stellar mass fraction estimated within r500 (~1%,kroupa imf) is already similar to that of local massive clusters. on the otherhand, morphological analysis of the massive red sequence galaxies suggests thatthey are smaller than similarly massive local early-types. while possiblyaffected by systematics and biases, this result might imply that, in spite ofthe overall early assembly of these sources, their evolution is not complete,and processes like minor (and likely dry) merging might still shape theirstructural properties to resemble those of their local counterparts, withoutsubstantially affecting their stellar mass or host stellarpopulations.[abridged]

1009.3986	star formation histories in a cluster environment at z~0.84	we present a spectrophotometric analysis of galaxies belonging to thedynamically young, massive cluster rx j0152.7-1357 at z~0.84, aimed atunderstanding the effects of the cluster environment on the star formationhistory (sfh) of cluster galaxies and the assembly of the red-sequence (rs). weuse vlt/fors spectroscopy, acs/wfc optical and ntt/sofi near-ir data tocharacterize sfhs as a function of color, luminosity, morphology, stellar mass,and local environment from a sample of 134 spectroscopic members. in order toincrease the signal-to-noise, individual galaxy spectra are stacked accordingto these properties. moreover, the d4000, balmer, cn3883, fe4383 and c4668indices are also quantified. the sfh analysis shows that galaxies in the bluefaint-end of the rs have on average younger stars (delta t ~ 2 gyr) than thosein the red bright-end. we also found, for a given luminosity range, differencesin age (delta t ~ 0.5 - 1.3 gyr) as a function of color, indicating that theintrinsic scatter of the rs may be due to age variations. passive galaxies inthe blue faint-end of the rs are preferentially located in the low densityareas of the cluster, likely being objects entering the rs from the "bluecloud". it is likely that the quenching of the star formation of these rsgalaxies is due to interaction with the intracluster medium. furthermore, thesfh of galaxies in the rs as a function of stellar mass reveals signatures of"downsizing" in the overall cluster.

1103.0259	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. ii. masses and ages of early-type galaxies  in different environments and their dependence on stellar population model  assumptions	we have derived masses and ages for 79 early-type galaxies (etgs) indifferent environments at z~1.3 in the lynx supercluster and in the goods/cdf-sfield using multiwavelength (0.6-4.5 $\mu$m; kpno, palomar, keck, hst, spitzer)datasets. at this redshift the contribution of the tp-agb phase is importantfor etgs, and the mass and age estimates depend on the choice of the stellarpopulation model used in the spectral energy distribution fits. we describe indetail the differences among model predictions for a large range of galaxyages, showing the dependence of these differences on age. current models stillyield large uncertainties. while recent models from maraston and charlot &amp;bruzual offer better modeling of the tp-agb phase with respect to less recentbruzual &amp; charlot models, their predictions do not often match. the modeling ofthis tp-agb phase has a significant impact on the derived parameters forgalaxies observed at high-redshift. some of our results do not depend on thechoice of the model: for all models, the most massive galaxies are the oldestones, independent of the environment. when using maraston and charlot &amp; bruzualmodels, the mass distribution is similar in the clusters and in the groups,whereas in our field sample there is a deficit of massive (m $\gtrsim$ 10^11msun) etgs. according to those last models, etgs belonging to the clusterenvironment host on average older stars with respect to group and fieldpopulations. this difference is less significant than the age difference ingalaxies of different masses.

1103.0265	early-type galaxies at z ~ 1.3. iii. on the dependence of formation  epochs and star formation histories on stellar mass and environment	we study the environmental dependence of stellar population properties at z ~1.3. we derive galaxy properties (stellar masses, ages and star formationhistories) for samples of massive, red, passive early-type galaxies in twohigh-redshift clusters, rxj0849+4452 and rxj0848+4453 (with redshifts of z =1.26 and 1.27, respectively), and compare them with those measured for therdcs1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 and with those measured for a similarlymass-selected sample of field contemporaries drawn from the goods-south field.robust estimates of the aforementioned parameters have been obtained bycomparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with extensive8-10 band photometric coverage, from the rest-frame far-ultraviolet to theinfrared. we find no variations of the overall stellar population propertiesamong the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. however, whencomparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, evenif the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxymass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their finalmass. we find that, approximately 1 gyr after the onset of star formation, themajority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (&gt; 80%) of theirfinal mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field etgs have. thus weconclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, theenvironment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories.

1103.5618	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): strong  lensing analysis of abell 383 from 16-band hst wfc3/acs imaging	we examine the inner mass distribution of the relaxed galaxy cluster abell383 in deep 16-band hst/acs+wfc3 imaging taken as part of the clash multi-cycletreasury program. our program is designed to study the dark matter distributionin 25 massive clusters, and balances depth with a wide wavelength coverage tobetter identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. thisinformation together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensinganalysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, sothat a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrainthe inner mass profile, $d\log \sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.6\pm 0.1$ (r&lt;160 kpc).we find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the fullrange spanned by the lensed images, 1.01&lt;z&lt;6.03, with the higher redshiftsources deflected through larger angles as expected. the inner mass profilederived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensinganalysis of wide-field subaru images, with good agreement in the region ofoverlap. the overall mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile withm_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h and a relativelyhigh concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\pm 0.23, which lies above thestandard c-m relation similar to other well-studied clusters. the criticalradius of abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,r_{e}\simeq16\pm2\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number oflensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates ourimaging strategy for the clash survey. in total we aim to provide similarlyhigh-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are x-ray selectedrelaxed clusters, enabling a precise determination of the representative massprofile free from lensing bias.

1105.3186	scaling relations and overabundance of massive clusters at z&gt;~1 from  weak-lensing studies with hst	we present weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 high-redshift (z &gt;~1)clusters based on hubble space telescope images. most clusters in our sampleprovide significant lensing signals and are well detected in theirreconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. combining the current results and ourprevious weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we comparegravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. werevisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in oursample is in tension with the current lambdacdm structure formation paradigm.we find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gastemperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperaturerelation at z &gt;~ 1. for the power law slope of the m-tx relation (m proptot^{\alpha}), we obtain \alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. this is consistent with thetheoretical self-similar prediction \alpha=3/2 and with the results previouslyreported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. however, ournormalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that thenormalization in the m-tx relation might evolve. after correcting for eddingtonbias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we findthat the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides atension with the current lambda cdm model. the combined probability of findingthe four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization overcurrent cosmological parameters is less than 1%.

1105.3470	the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey: v. improving the  dark energy constraints above z&gt;1 and building an early-type-hosted supernova  sample	we present acs, nicmos, and keck ao-assisted photometry of 20 type iasupernovae sne ia from the hst cluster supernova survey. the sne ia werediscovered over the redshift interval 0.623 &lt; z &lt; 1.415. fourteen of these sneia pass our strict selection cuts and are used in combination with the world'ssample of sne ia to derive the best current constraints on dark energy. ten ofour new sne ia are beyond redshift $z=1$, thereby nearly doubling thestatistical weight of hst-discovered sne ia beyond this redshift. our detailedanalysis corrects for the recently identified correlation between sn ialuminosity and host galaxy mass and corrects the nicmos zeropoint at the countrates appropriate for very distant sne ia. adding these supernovae improves thebest combined constraint on the dark energy density \rho_{de}(z) at redshifts1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 by 18% (including systematic errors). for a lambdacdm universe,we find \omega_\lambda = 0.724 +0.015/-0.016 (68% cl including systematicerrors). for a flat wcdm model, we measure a constant dark energyequation-of-state parameter w = -0.985 +0.071/-0.077 (68% cl). curvature isconstrained to ~0.7% in the owcdm model and to ~2% in a model in which darkenergy is allowed to vary with parameters w_0 and w_a. tightening further theconstraints on the time evolution of dark energy will require severalimprovements, including high-quality multi-passband photometry of a sample ofseveral dozen z&gt;1 sne ia. we describe how such a sample could be efficientlyobtained by targeting cluster fields with wfc3 on hst.

1107.2649	clash: new multiple-images constraining the inner mass profile of macs  j1206.2-0847	we present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847($z$=0.44) using uv, optical, and ir, hst/acs/wfc3 data taken as part of theclash multi-cycle treasury program, with vlt/vimos spectroscopy for some of themultiply-lensed arcs. the clash observations, combined with our mass-model,allow us to identify 47 new multiply-lensed images of 12 distant sources. theseimages, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range $1\laz\la5.5$, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and toaccurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass-profile of thiscluster. we find an inner profile slope of $d\log \sigma/d\log \theta\simeq-0.55\pm 0.1$ (in the range [1\arcsec, 53\arcsec], or $5\la r \la300$ kpc), ascommonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. using the manysystems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and einstein radiifor different source redshifts. for a source at $z_{s}\simeq2.5$, the criticalcurve encloses a large area with an effective einstein radius of$\theta_{e}=28\pm3\arcsec$, and a projected mass of $1.34\pm0.15\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. from the current understanding of structure formation inconcordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at$z\sim0.5$, so that detailed studies of the inner mass distribution of clusterssuch as macs j1206.2-0847 can provide stringent tests of the $\lambda$cdmparadigm.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

1307.5867	clash-vlt: the mass, velocity-anisotropy, and pseudo-phase-space density  profiles of the z=0.44 galaxy cluster macs 1206.2-0847	we use an unprecedented data-set of about 600 redshifts for cluster members,obtained as part of a vlt/vimos large programme, to constrain the mass profileof the z=0.44 cluster macs j1206.2-0847 over the radial range 0-5 mpc (0-2.5virial radii) using the mamposst and caustic methods. we then add externalconstraints from our previous gravitational lensing analysis. we invert thejeans equation to obtain the velocity-anisotropy profiles of cluster members.with the mass-density and velocity-anisotropy profiles we then obtain the firstdetermination of a cluster pseudo-phase-space density profile. the kinematicsand lensing determinations of the cluster mass profile are in excellentagreement. this is very well fitted by a nfw model with mass m200=(1.4 +- 0.2)10^15 msun and concentration c200=6 +- 1, only slightly higher than theoreticalexpectations. other mass profile models also provide acceptable fits to ourdata, of (slightly) lower (burkert, hernquist, and softened isothermal sphere)or comparable (einasto) quality than nfw. the velocity anisotropy profiles ofthe passive and star-forming cluster members are similar, close to isotropicnear the center and increasingly radial outside. passive cluster members followextremely well the theoretical expectations for the pseudo-phase-space densityprofile and the relation between the slope of the mass-density profile and thevelocity anisotropy. star-forming cluster members show marginal deviations fromtheoretical expectations. this is the most accurate determination of a clustermass profile out to a radius of 5 mpc, and the only determination of thevelocity-anisotropy and pseudo-phase-space density profiles of both passive andstar-forming galaxies for an individual cluster [abridged]

(2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band hst photometry acquired aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). obtainedas part of the clash-vlt survey, the vimos medium-resolution spectra of thissource show a very faint continuum between ~8700a and ~9300a and a prominentemission line at 8643a, which can be readily identified with lyman-alpha atz=6.110. the emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a morepronounced red wing. the rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ew=79+-10a.after correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (sfr) estimatedfrom the lya line is sfr(lya)=11 m_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the uv datais sfr(uv)=3 m_{sol}/yr. we estimate that the effective radius of the source isr_e&lt;~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density sigma_{sfr}&gt;6m_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the kennicutt-schmidt relation, a gas surface massdensity sigma_{gas}&gt;10^3 m_{sol}/pc^2. our results support the idea that thismagnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 l^* at z=6,with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. future follow-up observationswith alma will provide valuable insight into the sfr and molecular gas contentof this source. in the spirit of the frontier fields initiative, we alsopublish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other backgroundobjects which will help improving the strong lensing model of this galaxycluster.

1403.4979	intra cluster light properties in the clash-vlt cluster macs  j1206.2-0847	we aim at constraining the assembly history of clusters by studying the intracluster light (icl) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction ofbaryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias usingdifferent icl detection techniques. we developed an automated method, galtoicl,based on the software galapagos to obtain a refined version of typical bcg+iclmaps. we applied this method to our test case macs j1206.2-0847, a massivecluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the clash sample. using deepmulti-band subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (sb) profile ofthe bcg+icl and we studied the icl morphology, color, and contribution to f*out to r500. we repeated the same analysis using a different definition of theicl, sblimit method, i.e. a sb cut-off level, to compare the results. the mostpeculiar feature of the icl in macs1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,with an excess in the se direction and extending towards the 2nd brightestcluster galaxy which is a post starburst galaxy. this suggests an interactionbetween the bcg and this galaxy that dates back to t &lt;= 1.5 gyr. the bcg+iclstellar content is 8% of m_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction instars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. thesblimit method provides systematically higher icl fractions and this effect islarger at lower sb limits. this is due to the light from the outer envelopes ofmember galaxies that contaminate the icl. though more time consuming, thegaltoicl method provides safer icl detections that are almost free of thiscontamination. this is one of the few icl study at redshift z &gt; 0.3. atcompletion, the clash/vlt program will allow us to extend this analysis to astatistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6.

1412.0023	constraining the galaxy mass content in the core of a383 using velocity  dispersion measurements for individual cluster members	we use velocity dispersion measurements of 21 individual cluster members inthe core of abell 383, obtained with mmt hectospec, to separate the galaxy andthe smooth dark halo (dh) lensing contributions. while lensing usuallyconstrains the overall, projected mass density, the innovative use of velocitydispersion measurements as a proxy for masses of individual cluster membersbreaks inherent degeneracies and allows us to (a) refine the constraints onsingle galaxy masses and on the galaxy mass-to-light scaling relation and, as aresult, (b) refine the constraints on the dm-only map, a high-end goal of lensmodelling. the knowledge of cluster member velocity dispersions improves thefit by 17% in terms of the image reproduction $\chi^2$, or 20% in terms of therms. the constraints on the mass parameters improve by ~10% for the dh, whilefor the galaxy component, they are refined correspondingly by ~50%, includingthe galaxy halo truncation radius. for an l$^*$ galaxy with m$^*_b$=-20.96, forexample, we obtain best fitting truncation radius r$^*_{tr}=20.5^{+9.6}_{-6.7}$kpc and velocity dispersion $\sigma^*=324\pm17 km/s$. moreover, by performingthe surface brightness reconstruction of the southern giant arc, we improve theconstraints on r$_{tr}$ of two nearby cluster members, which have measuredvelocity dispersions, by more than ~30%. we estimate the stripped mass forthese two galaxies, getting results that are consistent with numericalsimulations. in the future, we plan to apply this analysis to other galaxyclusters for which velocity dispersions of member galaxies are available.

astro-ph;0001166	a definitive optical detection of a supercluster at z = 0.91	we present the results from a multi-band optical imaging program which hasdefinitively confirmed the existence of a supercluster at z = 0.91. two massiveclusters of galaxies, cl1604+4304 at z = 0.897 and cl1604+4321 at z = 0.924,were originally observed in the high-redshift cluster survey of oke, postman &amp;lubin (1998). they are separated by 4300 km/s in radial velocity and 17arcminutes on the plane of the sky. their physical and redshift proximitysuggested a promising supercluster candidate. deep bri imaging of the regionbetween the two clusters indicates a large population of red galaxies. thispopulation forms a tight, red sequence in the color--magnitude diagram at (r-i)= 1.4. the characteristic color is identical to that of thespectroscopically-confirmed early-type galaxies in the two member clusters. thered galaxies are spread throughout the 5 mpc region between cl1604+4304 andcl1604+4321. their spatial distribution delineates the entire large scalestructure with high concentrations at the cluster centers. in addition, wedetect a significant overdensity of red galaxies directly between cl1604+4304and cl1604+4321 which is the signature of a third, rich cluster associated withthis system. the strong sequence of red galaxies and their spatial distributionclearly indicate that we have discovered a supercluster at z = 0.91.

astro-ph;0002420	shellflow. i. the convergence of the velocity field at 6000 km/s	we present the first results from the shellflow program, an all-skytully-fisher (tf) peculiar velocity survey of 276 sb-sc galaxies with redshiftsbetween 4500 and 7000 km/s. shellflow was designed to minimize systematicerrors between observing runs and between telescopes, thereby removing thepossibility of a spurious bulk flow caused by data inhomogeneity. a fit to thedata yields a bulk flow amplitude v_bulk = 70{+100}{-70} km/s (1 sigma error)with respect to the cosmic microwave background, i.e., consistent with being atrest. at the 95% confidence level, the flow amplitude is &lt; 300 km/s. ourresults are insensitive to which galactic extinction maps we use, and to theparameterization of the tf relation. the larger bulk motion found in analysesof the mark iii peculiar velocity catalog are thus likely to be due tonon-uniformities between the subsamples making up mark iii. the absence of bulkflow is consistent with the study of giovanelli and collaborators and flowfield predictions from the observed distribution of iras galaxies.

astro-ph;0004091	cfht optical pdcs survey ii: evolution in the space density of clusters  of galaxies	we present the first dynamical study of the optically selected palomardistant cluster survey (pdcs). we show that eleven out of twelve pdcs clusterswe observed are real over-densities of galaxies. most clusters have velocitydispersions appropriate for clusters of galaxies. however, we find a fraction(1/3) of objects in the pdcs which have velocity dispersions in the range ofgroups of galaxies (200 +/- 100 km/s) but have richnesses appropriate forclusters of galaxies.  we measure the richness function, x-ray luminosity function (using both thedetections and upper limits), and the mass function derived from our velocitydispersions. we confirm that the space density, as a function of richness, ofclusters of galaxies in the pdcs is ~5 times that of the abell catalog.excluding the above fraction of 1/3 of objects with low velocity dispersions,we measure a space density ~3 times that of the abell catalog for equivalentmass clusters of galaxies. our space density estimates are in agreement withother low-redshift, optically-selected cluster surveys such as the edcc, apmand edcc2, which raises the possibility that the abell catalog is incomplete.our x-ray luminosity function agrees with other measurements based on bothx-ray and optically selected samples, so we find that the pdcs does not missclusters of galaxies that would be found in an x-ray selected survey. ourresulting mass function, centered around 10e14 msun/h, agrees with theexpectations from such surveys as the canadian network for observationalcosmology cluster survey, though errors on our mass measurements are too largeto constrain cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0210407	automated object classification with classx	classx is a project aimed at creating an automated system to classify x-raysources and is envisaged as a prototype of the virtual observatory. as asystem, classx integrates into a pipeline a network of classifiers and anengine that searches and retrieves for a given target multi-wavelengthcounterparts from the worldwide data storage media. it applies machine learningmethods to `train' different classifiers using different `training' data sets.in classx, each classifier can make its own class (object type) assignment andis optimized for handling different tasks and/or different object types. a userwould generally select a certain classifier to make, for instance, a mostcomplete list of candidate qsos, but a different classifier would be used tomake a most reliable list of candidate qsos. still different classifiers wouldbe selected to make similar lists for other object types. along with the classname assignment, a network classifier outputs the probability for a source tobelong to the assigned class as well as probabilities that the source belongsin fact to other classes. we illustrate the current capabilities of classx andthe concept of a classifiers network with the results obtained with classifierstrained using rosat data. ~

astro-ph;0211371	advanced camera for surveys observations of young star clusters in the  interacting galaxy ugc 10214	we present the first advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations of youngstar clusters in the colliding/merging galaxy ugc 10214. the observations weremade as part of the early release observation (ero) program for the newlyinstalled acs during service mission sm3b for the hubble space telescope (hst).many young star clusters can be identified in the tails of ugc 10214, with agesranging from ~3 myr to 10 myr. the extreme blue v-i (f606w-f814w) colors of thestar clusters found in the tail of ugc 10214 can only be explained if strongemission lines are included with a young stellar population. this has beenconfirmed by our keck spectroscopy of some of these bright blue stellar knots.the most luminous and largest of these blue knots has an absolute magnitude ofm_v = -14.45, with a half-light radius of 161 pc, and if it is a single starcluster, would qualify as a super star cluster (ssc). alternatively, it couldbe a superposition of multiple scaled ob associations or clusters. with anestimated age of ~ 4-5 myr, its derived mass is &lt; 1.3 x 10^6 solar masses. thusthe young stellar knot is unbound and will not evolve into a normal globularcluster. the bright blue clusters and associations are much younger than thedynamical age of the tail, providing strong evidence that star formation occursin the tail long after it was ejected. ugc 10214 provides a nearby example ofprocesses that contributed to the formation of halos and intra-cluster media inthe distant and younger universe.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0309036	advanced camera for surveys photometry of the cluster rdcs1252.9-2927:  the color-magnitude relation at z=1.24	we investigate the color-magnitude (cm) relation of galaxies in the distantx-ray selected cluster rdcs1252.9-2927 at z=1.24 using images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope in the f775wand f850lp bandpasses. we select galaxies based on morphologicalclassifications extending about 3.5 mag down the galaxy luminosity function,augmented by spectroscopic membership information. at the core of the clusteris an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair ofgalaxies that show signs of dynamical interaction. the early-type populationdefines a tight sequence in the cm diagram, with an intrinsic scatter inobserved (i-z) of $0.029\pm0.007$ mag based on 52 galaxies, or $0.024\pm0.008$mag for $\sim30$ ellipticals. simulations using the latest stellar populationmodels indicate an age scatter for the ellipticals of about 34%, with a meanage $\taul\gta2.6$ gyr (corresponding to $z_l\gta2.7$), and the last starformation occurring at $z_{end}\gta1.5$. transforming to rest-frame $(u-b)$, weconclude that the slope and scatter in the cm relation for morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies show little or no evidence for evolution out to$z\approx1.2$. thus, elliptical galaxies were already well established in x-rayluminous clusters when the universe was a third of its present age.

astro-ph;0408165	the evolutionary status of clusters of galaxies at z ~ 1	combined hst, x-ray, and ground-based optical studies show that clusters ofgalaxies are largely "in place" by $z \sim 1$, an epoch when the universe wasless than half its present age. high resolution images show that elliptical,s0, and spiral galaxies are present in clusters at redshifts up to $z \sim1.3$. analysis of the cmds suggest that the cluster ellipticals formed theirstars several gyr earlier, near redshift 3. the morphology--density relation iswell established at $z\sim1$, with star-forming spirals and irregulars residingmostly in the outer parts of the clusters and e/s0s concentrated in denseclumps. the intracluster medium has already reached the metallicity ofpresent-day clusters. the distributions of the hot gas and early-type galaxiesare similar in $z\sim1$ clusters, indicating both have largely virialized inthe deepest potentials wells. in spite of the many similarities between$z\sim1$ and present-day clusters, there are significant differences. themorphologies revealed by the hot gas, and particularly the early-type galaxies,are elongated rather than spherical. we appear to be observing the clusters atan epoch when the sub-clusters and groups are still assembling into a singleregular cluster. support for this picture comes from cl0152 where the gasappears to be lagging behind the luminous and dark mass in two mergingsub-components. moreover, the luminosity difference between the first andsecond brightest cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$ is smaller than in 93% ofpresent-day abell clusters, which suggests that considerable luminosityevolution through merging has occurred since that epoch. evolution is also seenin the bolometric x-ray luminosity function.

astro-ph;0501224	the morphology - density relation in z ~ 1 clusters	we measure the morphology--density relation (mdr) and morphology-radiusrelation (mrr) for galaxies in seven z ~ 1 clusters that have been observedwith the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope.simulations and independent comparisons of ourvisually derived morphologiesindicate that acs allows one to distinguish between e, s0, and spiralmorphologies down to zmag = 24, corresponding to l/l* = 0.21 and 0.30 at z =0.83 and z = 1.24, respectively. we adopt density and radius estimation methodsthat match those used at lower redshift in order to study the evolution of themdr and mrr. we detect a change in the mdr between 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 and thatobserved at z ~ 0, consistent with recent work -- specifically, the growth inthe bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, f_e+so, with increasing density proceedsless rapidly at z ~ 1 than it does at z ~ 0. at z ~ 1 and density &lt;= 500galaxies/mpc^2, we find &lt;f_e+s0&gt; = 0.72 +/- 0.10. at z ~ 0, an e+s0 populationfraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. theevolution in the mdr is confined to densities &gt;= 40 galaxies/mpc^2 and appearsto be primarily due to a deficit of s0 galaxies and an excess of spiral+irrgalaxies relative to the local galaxy population. the elliptical fraction -density relation exhibits no significant evolution between z = 1 and z = 0. wefind mild evidence to suggest that the mdr is dependent on the bolometric x-rayluminosity of the intracluster medium. implications for the evolution of thedisk galaxy population in dense regions are discussed in the context of theseobservations.

astro-ph;0503365	evolution in the cluster early-type galaxy size-surface brightness  relation at z =~ 1	we investigate the evolution in the distribution of surface brightness, as afunction of size, for elliptical and s0 galaxies in the two clusters rdcsj1252.9-2927, z=1.237 and rx j0152.7-1357, z=0.837. we use multi-color imagingwith the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope to determinethese sizes and surface brightnesses. using three different estimates of thesurface brightnesses, we find that we reliably estimate the surface brightnessfor the galaxies in our sample with a scatter of &lt; 0.2 mag and with systematicshifts of \lesssim 0.05 mag. we construct samples of galaxies with early-typemorphologies in both clusters. for each cluster, we use a magnitude limit in aband which closely corresponds to the rest-frame b, to magnitude limit of m_b =-18.8 at z=0, and select only those galaxies within the color-magnitudesequence of the cluster or by using our spectroscopic redshifts. we measureevolution in the rest-frame b surface brightness, and find -1.41 \+/- 0.14 magfrom the coma cluster of galaxies for rdcs j1252.9-2927 and -0.90 \+/- 0.12 magof evolution for rx j0152.7-1357, or an average evolution of (-1.13 \+/- 0.15)z mag. our statistical errors are dominated by the observed scatter in thesize-surface brightness relation, sigma = 0.42 \+/- 0.05 mag for rxj0152.7-1357 and sigma = 0.76 \+/- 0.10 mag for rdcs j1252.9-2927. we find nostatistically significant evolution in this scatter, though an increase in thescatter could be expected. overall, the pace of luminosity evolution we measureagrees with that of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies, implying thatthe majority of massive early-type galaxies observed at z =~ 1 formed at highredshifts.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.

astro-ph;0509650	imprints of environment on cluster and field late-type galaxies at z~1	we present a comparison of late-type galaxies (sa and later) in intermediateredshift clusters and the field using acs imaging of four cluster fields:cl0152-1357, cl1056-0337 (ms1054), cl1604+4304, and cl1604+4321. concentration,asymmetry, and clumpiness parameters are calculated for each galaxy in blue(f606w or f625w) and red (f775w or f814w) filters. galaxy half-light radii,disk scale lengths, color gradients, and overall color are compared. we findmarginally significant differences in the asymmetry distributions of spiral andirregular galaxies in the x-ray luminous and x-ray faint clusters. the massiveclusters contain fewer galaxies with large asymmetries. the physical sizes ofthe cluster and field populations are similar; no significant differences arefound in half-light radii or disk scale lengths. the most significantdifference is in rest-frame $u-b$ color. late-type cluster galaxies aresignificantly redder, $\sim 0.3$ magnitudes at rest-frame $u-b$, than theirfield counterparts. moreover, the intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies tendto have blue inward color gradients, in contrast to the field galaxies, butsimilar to late-type galaxies in low redshift clusters. these blue inward colorgradients are likely to be the result of enhanced nuclear star formation ratesrelative to the outer disk. based on the significant rest-frame colordifference, we conclude that late-type cluster members at $z\sim0.9$ are not apristine infalling field population; some difference in past and/or currentstar formation history is already present. this points to high redshift``groups'', or filaments with densities similar to present-day groups, as thesites where the first major effects of environment are imprinted.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.

0811.1986	the ellipticities of cluster early-type galaxies from z~1 to z~0: no  evolution in the overall distribution of bulge-to-disk ratios	we have compiled a sample of early-type cluster galaxies from 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 andmeasured the evolution of their ellipticity distributions. our sample contains487 galaxies in 17 z&gt;0.3 clusters with high quality space-based imaging and acomparable sample of 210 galaxies in 10 clusters at z&lt;0.05. we selectearly-type galaxies (elliptical and s0 galaxies) that fall within the clusterr_{200}, and which lie on the red-sequence in the magnitude range -19.3 &gt; m_b &gt;-21, after correcting for luminosity evolution. our ellipticity measurementsare made in a consistent manner over our whole sample. we perform extensivesimulations to quantify the systematic and statistical errors, and find that itis crucial to use psf-corrected model fits. we find that neither the medianellipticity, nor the shape of the ellipticity distribution of clusterearly-type galaxies evolves with redshift from z ~ 0 to z &gt; 1. these resultsare strongly suggestive of an unchanging overall bulge-to-disk ratiodistribution for cluster early-type galaxies over the last ~8gyr. this resultcontrasts with that from visual classifications which show that the fraction ofmorphologically-selected disk-dominated early-type galaxies, or s0s, issignificantly lower at z&gt;0.4 than at z~0. taking the ellipticity measurementsand assuming, as in all previous studies, that the intrinsic ellipticitydistribution of both elliptical and s0 galaxies remains constant, then weconclude from the lack of evolution in the observed early-type ellipticitydistribution that the relative fractions of ellipticals and s0s do not evolvefrom z~1 to z=0 for a red-sequence selected samples of galaxies in the cores ofclusters of galaxies.
