0901.2177	modeling porous dust grains with ballistic aggregates. ii. light  scattering properties	we study the light scattering properties of random ballistic aggregatesconstructed in shen et al. (paper i). using the discrete-dipole-approximation,we compute the scattering phase function and linear polarization for randomaggregates with various sizes and porosities, and with two differentcompositions: 100% silicate and 50% silicate-50% graphite. we investigate thedependence of light scattering properties on wavelength, cluster size andporosity using these aggregate models. we find that while the shape of thephase function depends mainly on the size parameter of the aggregates, thelinear polarization depends on both the size parameter and the porosity of theaggregates, with increasing degree of polarization as the porosity increases.contrary to previous studies, we argue that monomer size has negligible effectson the light scattering properties of ballistic aggregates, as long as theconstituent monomer is smaller than the incident wavelength up to2*pi*a_0/lambda\sim 1.6 where a_0 is the monomer radius. previous claims forsuch monomer size effects are in fact the combined effects of size parameterand porosity. finally, we present aggregate models that can reproduce the phasefunction and polarization of scattered light from the au mic debris disk andfrom cometary dust, including the negative polarization observed for comets atscattering angles 160&lt;theta&lt;180 deg. these aggregates have moderate porosities,p\sim 0.6, and are of sub-micron-size for the debris disk case, or micron-sizefor the comet case.

0903.1658	interstellar dust models and evolutionary implications	the wavelength dependences of interstellar extinction and polarization,supplemented by observed elemental abundances and the spectrum of infraredemission from dust heated by starlight, strongly constrain dust models. onedust model that appears to be consistent with observations is presented. toreproduce the observed extinction, the model consumes the bulk of interstellarmg, si, and fe (in amorphous silicates), and a substantial fraction of c (incarbonaceous material), with size distributions and alignment adjusted to matchobservations.  the composition, structure, and size distribution of interstellar grains isthe result of injection of dust from stellar outflows into the interstellarmedium (ism), followed by destruction, growth, coagulation, and photoprocessingof interstellar grains. the balance among these poorly-understood processes isresponsible for the mix of solid material present in the ism. most interstellargrain material present in the diffuse ism must be grown in the ism. theamorphous silicate and carbonaceous materials that form the bulk ofinterstellar dust must therefore be the result of grain growth in the presenceof ultraviolet radiation. dust in high-z systems such as j1148+5251 is alsoproduced primarily in the ism, with supernova-produced dust contributing only asmall fraction of the total dust mass.

0907.1285	the discovery of vibrationally-excited h_2 in the molecular cloud near  grb 080607	grb 080607 has provided the first strong observational signatures ofmolecular absorption bands toward any galaxy hosting a gamma-ray burst. despitethe identification of dozens of features as belonging to various atomic andmolecular (h_2 and co) carriers, many more absorption features remainedunidentified. here we report on a search among these features for absorptionfrom vibrationally-excited h_2, a species that was predicted to be produced bythe uv flash of a grb impinging on a molecular cloud. following a detailedcomparison between our spectroscopy and static, as well as dynamic, models ofh_2* absorption, we conclude that a column density of 10^{17.5+-0.2} cm^{-2} ofh_2* was produced along the line of sight toward grb 080607. depending on theassumed amount of dust extinction between the molecular cloud and the grb, themodel distance between the two is found to be in the range 230--940 pc. such arange is consistent with a conservative lower limit of 100 pc estimated fromthe presence of mg i in the same data. these distances show that substantialmolecular material is found within hundreds of pc from grb 080607, part of thedistribution of clouds within the grb host galaxy.

0707.0395	warm molecular hydrogen in the spitzer sings galaxy sample	(simplified) results on the properties of warm h2 in 57 normal galaxies arederived from h2 rotational transitions, obtained as part of sings. this studyextends previous extragalactic surveys of h2, the most abundant constituent ofthe molecular ism, to more common systems (l_fir = e7 to 6e10 l_sun) of allmorphological and nuclear types. the s(1) transition is securely detected inthe nuclear regions of 86% of sings galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.5m_sun. the derived column densities of warm h2 (t &gt; ~100 k), even thoughaveraged over kiloparsec-scale areas, are commensurate with those of resolvedpdrs; the median of the sample is 3e20 cm-2. they amount to between 1% and &gt;30%of the total h2. the power emitted in the sum of the s(0) to s(2) transitionsis on average 30% of the [siii] line power, and ~4e-4 of the total infraredpower (tir) within the same area for star-forming galaxies, which is consistentwith excitation in pdrs. the fact that h2 emission scales tightly with pahemission, even though the average radiation field intensity varies by a factorten, can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in pdrs,either dense or diffuse. a large fraction of the 25 liner/sy targets, however,strongly depart from the rest of the sample, in having warmer h2 in the excitedstates, and an excess of h2 emission with respect to pahs, tir and [siii]. wepropose a threshold in h2 to pah power ratios, allowing the identification oflow-luminosity agns by an excess h2 excitation. a dominant contribution fromshock heating is favored in these objects. finally, we detect, in nearly halfthe star-forming targets, non-equilibrium ortho to para ratios, consistent withfuv pumping combined with incomplete ortho-para thermalization by collisions,or possibly non-equilibrium pdr fronts advancing into cold gas.

1003.0474	on radiation pressure in static, dusty hii regions	radiation pressure acting on gas and dust causes hii regions to have centraldensities that are lower than the density near the ionized boundary. hiiregions in static equilibrium comprise a family of similarity solutions,parametrized by 3 parameters: beta, gamma, and the product (q_0 n_rms); betacharacterizes the stellar spectrum, gamma characterizes the dust/gas ratio, q_0is the ionizing output from the star (photons/s), and n_rms is the rms densitywithin the ionized region. adopting standard values for beta and gamma, varying(q_0 n_rms) generates a one-parameter family of density profiles, ranging fromnearly uniform density (small q_0 n_rms), to hollow-sphere hii regions (largeq_0 n_rms). when (q_0 n_rms) exceeds 10^{52} cm^{-3} s^{-1}, dusty hii regionshave conspicuous central cavities, even if no stellar wind is present. forgiven beta, gamma and (q_0 n_rms), a fourth quantity, which can be q_0,determines the overall size and density of the hii region. examples of densityand emissivity profiles are given. we show how quantities of interest -- suchas the peak-to-center emissivity ratio, the rms-to-mean density ratio, theedge-to-rms density ratio, and the fraction of the ionizing photons absorbed bythe gas -- depend on the 3 parameters beta, gamma, and (q_0 n_rms). for dustyhii regions, compression of the gas and dust into an ionized shell results in asubstantial increase in the fraction of the &gt;13.6 ev photons that actuallyionize h (relative to a uniform density hii region with the same dust/gas ratioand density n=n_rms). we discuss the extent to which radial drift of dustgrains in hii regions can alter the dust-to-gas ratio. the applicability ofthese solutions to real hii regions is discussed.

1003.0961	the calibration of monochromatic far-infrared star formation rate  indicators	(abridged) spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based h-alphaimages are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburstgalaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (sfr) indicatorscan be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70and 160 micron. we compare recently published recipes for sfr measures usingcombinations of the 24 micron and observed h-alpha luminosities with thoseusing 24 micron luminosity alone. from these comparisons, we derive a referencesfr indicator for use in our analysis. linear correlations between sfr and the70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for l(70)&gt;=1.4x10^{42} erg/s andl(160)&gt;=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to sfr&gt;=0.1-0.3 m_sun/yr. below thosetwo luminosity limits, the relation between sfr and 70 micron (160 micron)luminosity is non-linear and sfr calibrations become problematic. thedispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasingwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24micron. the increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasingcontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations notassociated with the current star formation. the non-linear relation between sfrand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests thatthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effectivedust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions acrossthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. the sfrcalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)&gt;8.1.at lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the sfrbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

1003.2638	improving the model of emission from spinning dust: effects of grain  wobbling and transient spin-up	observations continue to support the interpretation of the anomalousmicrowave foreground as electric dipole radiation from spinning dust grains asproposed by draine and lazarian (1998ab). in this paper we present a refinementof the original model by improving the treatment of a number of physicaleffects. first, we consider a disk-like grain rotating with angular velocity atan arbitrary angle with respect to the grain symmetry axis and derive therotational damping and excitation coefficients arising from infrared emission,plasma-grain interactions and electric dipole emission. the angular velocitydistribution and the electric dipole emission spectrum for grains is calculatedusing the langevin equation, for cases both with and without fast internalrelaxation. our results show that, the peak emissivity of spinning dust,compared to earlier studies, increases by a factor of ~2 for the warm neutralmedium (wnm), the warm ionized medium (wim), the cold neutral medium (cnm) andthe photodissociation region (pdr), and by a factor ~4 for reflection nebulae(rn). the frequency at the emission peak also increases by factors ~1.4 to ~2for these media. the increased emission and peak frequency result from thenon-sphericity of grain shape and from the anisotropy in damping and excitationalong directions parallel and perpendicular to the grain symmetry axis. second,we provide a detailed numerical study including transient spin-up of grains bysingle-ion collisions. the impulses broaden the emission spectrum and increasethe peak emissivity for the cnm, wnm and wim. in addition, we present animproved treatment of rotational excitation and damping by infrared emission.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1105.2302	spinning dust emission: effects of irregular grain shape, transient  heating and comparison with wmap results	planck is expected to answer crucial questions on the early universe, but italso provides further understanding on anomalous microwave emission. electricdipole emission from spinning dust grains continues to be the favoredinterpretation of anomalous microwave emission. in this paper, we present amethod to calculate the rotational emission from small grains of irregularshape with moments of inertia $i_{1}&gt; i_{2}&gt; i_{3}$. we show that a torque-freerotating irregular grain with a given angular momentum radiates at multiplefrequency modes. the resulting spinning dust spectrum has peak frequency andemissivity increasing with the degree of grain shape irregularity, which isdefined by $i_{1}:i_{2}:i_{3}$. we discuss how the orientation of dipole moment$\bmu$ in body coordinates affects the spinning dust spectrum for differentregimes of internal thermal fluctuations. we show that the spinning dustemissivity for the case of strong thermal fluctuations is less sensitive to theorientation of $\bmu$ than in the case of weak thermal fluctuations. wecalculate spinning dust spectra for a range of gas density and dipole moment.the effect of compressible turbulence on spinning dust emission intensity isinvestigated. we show that the emission intensity in a turbulent mediumincreases by a factor from 1.2-1.4 relative to that in a uniform medium, assonic mach number $m_{s}$ increases from 2-7. finally, spinning dust parametersare constrained by fitting our improved model to five-year {\it wilkinsonmicrowave anisotropy probe} cross-correlation foreground spectra, for both theh$\alpha$-correlated and 100 $\mu$m-correlated emission spectra.

1207.1301	mapping the cold dust temperatures and masses of nearby kingfish  galaxies with herschel	taking advantage of the sensitivity and angular resolution of the herschelspace observatory at far-infrared and submm wavelengths, we aim to characterizethe physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies and study therobustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbodymodels. for a pilot subsample of the kingfish program, we perform 2 temperaturefits of the spitzer and herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warmand a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.at global scales,we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and tc(19.1 to 25.1k).wecompute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustnessof the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. when the emissivityis fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.when theemissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniformfitted emissivities.gathering resolved elements in a tc-beta_c diagramunderlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.it remains difficultto assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, ormixing along the line of sight and in the beam. we finally observe in bothcases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and barends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in theselocations).we also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptionsabout the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverageused in the fits. we show that modified blackbody fits using a shallowemissivity (beta_c &lt; 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared tothe beta_c &lt; 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 forinstance.the working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: massesincrease from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.

1212.1208	the co-to-h2 conversion factor and dust-to-gas ratio on kiloparsec  scales in nearby galaxies	we present kiloparsec (kpc) spatial resolution maps of the co-to-h2conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (dgr) in 26 nearby,star-forming galaxies. we have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and dgr byassuming that the dgr is approximately constant on kpc scales. with thisassumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, co integratedintensity and hi column density to solve for both alpha_co and dgr with noassumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolutionfar-ir maps from the herschel key program kingfish, 12co j=(2-1) maps from theiram 30m large program heracles and hi 21-cm line maps from things. we use afixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co resultson the more typically used 12co j=(1-0) scale and show using literaturemeasurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. intotal, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and dgr. on average,alpha_co = 3.1 msun pc^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standarddeviation of 0.3 dex. within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile ofalpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. however, most galaxies exhibita lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, onaverage. in some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10below the standard milky way (mw) value of alpha_co,mw =4.4 msun pc^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1. while for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,dgr is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriatealpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

1302.4363	calibration of the total infrared luminosity of nearby galaxies from  spitzer and herschel bands	we present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integratedtotal infrared luminosities from spitzer and herschel bands used asmonochromatic or combined tracers. we base our calibrations on resolvedelements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 mpc) observed with herschel. we perform aresolved sed modelling of these objects using the draine and li (2007) dustmodels and investigate the influence of the addition of spire measurements inthe estimation of ltir. we find that using data up to 250 um leads to localltir values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. we then study thedistribution of energy in the resolved seds of our galaxies. the bulk of energy(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. the (24-70 um) fractiondecreases with increasing metallicity. the (160-1100 um) submillimeter band canaccount for up to 25 per cent of the ltir in metal-rich galaxies. weinvestigate the correlation between tir surface brightnesses/luminosities andmonochromatic spitzer and herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. the threepacs bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the ltir, the100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. there is also astrong correlation between the spire 250um and ltir, although with more scatterthan for the pacs relations. we also study the ability of our monochromaticrelations to reproduce integrated ltir of nearby galaxies as well as ltir ofz=1-3 sources. finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used toderive tir surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of spitzer andherschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.

1305.2923	mapping dust through emission and absorption in nearby galaxies	dust has long been identified as a barrier to measuring inherent galaxyproperties. however, the link between dust and attenuation is notstraightforward and depends on both the amount of dust and its distribution.herschel imaging of nearby galaxies undertaken as part of the kingfish projectallows us to map the dust as seen in emission with unprecedented sensitivityand ~1 kpc resolution. we present here new optical integral field unitspectroscopy for eight of these galaxies that provides complementary 100-200 pcscale maps of the dust attenuation through observation of the reddening in boththe balmer decrement and the stellar continuum. the stellar continuumreddening, which is systematically less than that observed in the balmerdecrement, shows no clear correlation with the dust, suggesting that thedistribution of stellar reddening acts as a poor tracer of the overall dustcontent. the brightest hii regions are observed to be preferentially located industy regions, and we do find a correlation between the balmer line reddeningand the dust mass surface density for which we provide an empirical relation.some of the high-inclination systems in our sample exhibit high extinction, butwe also find evidence that unresolved variations in the dust distribution onscales smaller than 500 pc may contribute to the scatter in this relation. wecaution against the use of integrated a_v measures to infer global dustproperties.

0801.1996	modeling porous dust grains with ballistic aggregates i: geometry and  optical properties	we investigate the scattering and absorption of light by random ballisticaggregates of spherical monomers. we present a general measure for the porosityof an irregular particle. three different classes of ballistic aggregates areconsidered, with different degrees of porosity. scattering and absorption crosssections are calculated, using the discrete dipole approximation (dda), forgrains of three compositions (50% silicate and 50% graphite; 50% silicate and50% amorphous carbon; and 100% silicate), for wavelengths from 0.1 micron to 4micron. for fixed particle mass, increased porosity increases the extinction atshort wavelengths, but decreases the extinction at wavelengths long compared tothe overall aggregate size. scattering and absorption cross sections areinsensitive to monomer size as long as the constituent monomers are smallcompared with the incident wavelength. we compare our accurate dda results withtwo other approximations: the analytical multi-layer sphere (mls) model andeffective medium theory (emt). for high porosity and/or absorptive materials,the mls model does not provide a good approximation for scattering andabsorption by ballistic aggregates. the emt method provides a much betterapproximation than the mls model for these aggregates, with a typicaldifference less than 20% in extinction and scattering cross sections comparedwith dda results, for all types, compositions and wavelengths probed in thisstudy.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1501.07279	heating and cooling of the neutral ism in the ngc4736 circumnuclear ring	the manner in which gas accretes and orbits within circumnuclear rings hasdirect implications for the star formation process. in particular, gas may becompressed and shocked at the inflow points, resulting in bursts of starformation at these locations. afterwards the gas and young stars move togetherthrough the ring. in addition, star formation may occur throughout the ring, ifand when the gas reaches sufficient density to collapse under gravity. thesetwo scenarios for star formation in rings are often referred to as the `pearlson a string' and `popcorn' paradigms. in this paper, we use new herschel pacsobservations, obtained as part of the kingfish open time key program, alongwith archival spitzer and ground-based observations from the sings legacyproject, to investigate the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium inthe nearby star-forming ring galaxy, ngc4736. by comparing spatially resolvedestimates of the stellar fuv flux available for heating, with the gas and dustcooling derived from the fir continuum and line emission, we show that whilestar formation is indeed dominant at the inflow points in ngc 4736, additionalstar formation is needed to balance the gas heating and cooling throughout thering. this additional component most likely arises from the general increase ingas density in the ring over its lifetime. our data provide strong evidence,therefore, for a combination of the two paradigms for star formation in thering in ngc4736.

astro-ph;0010117	forces on dust grains exposed to anisotropic interstellar radiation  fields	grains exposed to anisotropic radiation fields are subjected to forces due tothe asymmetric photon-stimulated ejection of particles. these forces act inaddition to the ``radiation pressure'' due to absorption and scattering. herewe model the forces due to photoelectron emission and the photodesorption ofadatoms. the ``photoelectric'' force depends on the ambient conditions relevantto grain charging. we find that it is comparable to the radiation pressure whenthe grain potential is relatively low and the radiation spectrum is relativelyhard. the calculation of the ``photodesorption'' force is highly uncertain,since the surface physics and chemsitry of grain materials are poorlyunderstood at present. for our simple yet plausible model, the photodesorptionforce dominates the radiation pressure for grains with size &gt;~0.1 micronexposed to starlight from ob stars. we find that the anisotropy of theinterstellar radiation field is ~10% in the visible and ultraviolet. weestimate size-dependent drift speeds for grains in the cold and warm neutralmedia and find that micron-sized grains could potentially be moved across adiffuse cloud during its lifetime.

astro-ph;0105237	electron-ion recombination on grains and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons	with the high-resolution spectroscopy now available in the optical andsatellite uv, it is possible to determine the neutral/ionized column densityratios for several different elements in a single cloud. assuming ionizationequilibrium for each element, one can make several independent determinationsof the electron density. for the clouds for which such an analysis has beencarried out, these different estimates disagree by large factors, suggestingthat some process (or processes) besides photoionization and radiativerecombination might play an important role in the ionization balance. onecandidate process is collisions of ions with dust grains.  making use of recent work quantifying the abundances of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon molecules and other grains in the interstellar medium, as well asrecent models for grain charging, we estimate the grain-assisted ionrecombination rates for several astrophysically important elements. we findthat these rates are comparable to the rates for radiative recombination forconditions typical of the cold neutral medium. including grain-assisted ionrecombination in the ionization equilibrium analysis leads to increasedconsistency in the various electron density estimates for the gas along theline of sight to 23 orionis. however, not all of the discrepancies can beeliminated in this way; we speculate on some other processes that might play arole. we also note that grain-assisted recombination of h+ and he+ leads tosignificantly lower electron fractions than usually assumed for the coldneutral medium.

astro-ph;0201060	do the infrared emission features need ultraviolet excitation? the pah  model in uv-poor reflection nebulae	one of the major challenges to identification of the 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and11.3um interstellar ir emission bands with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) molecules has been the recent detection of these bands in regions withlittle uv illumination, since small, neutral pah molecules have little or noabsorption at visible wavelengths and therefore require uv photons forexcitation.  we show here that our "astronomical" pah model, incorporating theexperimental result that the visual absorption edge shifts to longer wavelengthupon ionization and/or as the pah size increases, can closely reproduce theobserved infrared emission bands of vdb 133, a uv-poor reflection nebula.  it is also shown that single-photon heating of ``astronomical'' pahs inreflection nebulae near stars as cool as t_eff=3000k can result in observableemission at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3um. illustrative mid-ir emission spectra arealso calculated for reflection nebulae illuminated by cool stars witht_eff=3500, 4500, 5000k. these will allow comparison with future space infraredtelescope facility (sirtf) observations of vdb 135 (t_eff=3600k), vdb 47(t_eff=4500k), and vdb 101 (t_eff=5000k).  it is also shown that the dependence of the 12um iras emission relative tothe total far-ir emission on the effective temperature of the exciting star isconsistent with the pah model expectation for 3000k &lt; t_eff &lt; 30000k.

astro-ph;0211342	radiative torques on interstellar grains. iii. dynamics with thermal  relaxation	in the previous papers in this series, we found that radiative torques canplay a major role in the alignment of grains with the interstellar magneticfield. since the radiative torques can drive the grains to suprathermalrotational speeds, in previous work we made the simplifying assumption that thegrain principal axis of greatest moment of inertia is always parallel to thegrain angular momentum. this enabled us to describe many of the features of thegrain dynamics. however, this assumption fails when the grains enter periods ofthermal rotation, which occur naturally in the radiative torque alignmentscenario. in the present paper, we relax this assumption and explore theconsequences for the grain dynamics. we develop a treatment to follow the graindynamics including thermal fluctuations and ``thermal flipping'', and showresults for one illustrative example. by comparing with a treatment withoutthermal fluctuations, we see that inclusion of thermal fluctuations can lead toqualitative changes in the grain dynamics. in a future installment in thisseries, we will use the more complete dynamical treatment developed here toperform a systematic study of grain alignment by radiative torques.

astro-ph;0410310	can dust explain variations in the d/h ratio?	the d/h ratio in interstellar gas varies on scales of a few hundred pc in thelocal milky way, with d/h values ranging from ~7 ppm to ~22 ppm. the reductionin d/h relative to the primordial value of d/h (~ 26 ppm) is usually attributedto "astration" -- conversion of d into other elements by nuclear fusion instars. however, it is shown here that astration has difficulty accounting forthe observations because the expected associated variations in o/h are notseen.  the lower d/h values are instead likely due to "depletion" of the d onto dustgrains. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are a possible repository forthe missing d, and it appears possible for gas-grain reactions to achieveextreme deuteration of carbonaceous grain material. grain destruction willrelease d from the grains; the gas phase abundance of d should therefore bepositively correlated with the gas phase abundances of other elements thatexhibit strong depletions, such as mg, si, ti, and fe, which also will bereturned to the gas by grain destruction.

astro-ph;0510227	an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlation within nearby  star-forming galaxies using the spitzer space telescope	(abridged) we present an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlationwithin the star-forming disks of four nearby, nearly face-on galaxies (ngc2403, ngc 3031, ngc 5194, and ngc 6946). using spitzer mips imaging and wsrtradio continuum data, observed as part of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxiessurvey (sings), we are able to probe variations in the logarithmic 24mu/22cm(q_24) and 70mu/22cm (q_70) surface brightness ratios across each disk atsub-kpc scales. we find general trends of decreasing q_24 and q_70 withdeclining surface brightness and with increasing radius. the residualdispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versus surface brightness issmaller than the residual dispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versusradius, on average by ~0.1 dex, indicating that the distribution of starformation sites is more important in determining the infrared/radio diskappearance than the exponential profiles of disks. we have also performedpreliminary phenomenological modeling of cosmic ray electron (cre^-) diffusionusing an image-smearing technique, and find that smoothing the infrared mapsimproves their correlation with the radio maps. exponential kernels tend towork better than gaussian kernels which suggests that additional processesbesides simple random-walk diffusion in three dimensions must affect theevolution of cre^-s. the best fit smoothing kernels for the two less activestar-forming galaxies (ngc 2403 and ngc 3031) have much larger scale-lengthsthan those of the more active star-forming galaxies (ngc 5194 and ngc 6946).this difference may be due to the relative deficit of recent cre^- injectioninto the interstellar medium (ism) for the galaxies having largely quiescentdisks.

astro-ph;0604007	mid-infrared spectral diagnostics of nuclear and extra-nuclear regions  in nearby galaxies	mid-infrared diagnostics are presented for a large portion of the spitzerinfrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample plus archival data from theinfrared space observatory and the spitzer space telescope. our main result isthat these mid-infrared diagnostics effectively constrain a target's dominantpower source. the combination of a high ionization line index and pah strengthserves as an efficient discriminant between agn and star-forming nuclei,confirming progress made with iso spectroscopy on starbursting andultraluminous infrared galaxies. the sensitivity of spitzer allows us to probefainter nuclei and star-forming regions within galaxy disks. we find that bothstar-forming nuclei and extranuclear regions stand apart from nuclei that arepowered by seyfert or liner activity. in fact, we identify areas within fourdiagnostic diagrams containing &gt;90% seyfert/liner nuclei or &gt;90% hiiregions/hii nuclei. we also find that, compared to starbursting nuclei,extranuclear regions typically separate even further from agn, especially forlow-metallicity extranuclear environments. in addition, instead of thetraditional mid-infrared approach to differentiating between agn andstar-forming sources that utilizes relatively weak high-ionization lines, weshow that strong low-ionization cooling lines of x-ray dominated regions like[siii] 34.82 micron can alternatively be used as excellent discrimants.finally, the typical target in this sample shows relatively modest interstellarelectron density (~400 cm^{-3}) and obscuration (a_v ~ 1.0 mag for a foregroundscreen), consistent with a lack of dense clumps of highly obscured gas and dustresiding in the emitting regions.

astro-ph;0604267	the opaque nascent starburst in ngc 1377: spitzer sings observations	we analyze extensive data on ngc1377 from the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). within the category of nascent starbursts, that wepreviously selected by their infrared to radio continuum ratios in large excessof the average and their hot dust, ngc1377 has the largest infrared excess yetmeasured. optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of arecent accretion event. infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaquesource dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micronsilicate band). we provide physical evidence against non-stellar activity beingthe heating source. hii regions are detected through the single [neii] line,probing &lt;1% of the ionizing radiation. not only is the optical depth very high,but &gt;85% of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. the only other detectedemission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excited mainly byshocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. the newobservations support our interpretation in terms of an extremely youngstarburst (&lt;1 myr). more generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron arelikely observed within a few myr of the onset of a starburst and after a longquiescence, prior to the replenishment of the ism with cosmic rays. the similarinfrared-radio properties of ngc1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxiessuggest that ngc1377 constitutes an archetype to better understand starburstevolution. although rare locally because observed in a brief evolutionarystage, nascent starbursts may represent a non-negligible fraction ofmerger-induced starbursts dominating deep infrared counts. since they differdramatically from usual starburst templates, they bear important consequencesfor the interpretation of deep surveys.

astro-ph;0609724	the effect of star formation on the far-infrared--radio correlation  within galaxies	using data obtained for twelve galaxies as part of the {\it spitzer} infrarednearby galaxies survey (sings) and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt)-sings radio continuum survey, we study how star formation activityaffects the far-infrared (fir)--radio correlation {\it within} galaxies bytesting a phenomenological model, which describes the radio image as a smearedversion of the fir image. the physical basis of this description is thatcosmic-ray (cr) electrons will diffuse measurably farther than the mean freepath of dust-heating photons before decaying by synchrotron radiation. thisdescription works well in general. galaxies with higher infrared surfacebrightnesses have best-fit smoothing scale-lengths of a few hundred parsecs,substantially shorter than those for lower surface brightness galaxies. weinterpret this result to suggest that galaxies with higher disk averaged starformation rates have had a recent episode of enhanced star formation and arecharacterized by a higher fraction of young cr electrons that have traveledonly a few hundred parsecs from their acceleration sites in supernova remnantscompared to galaxies with lower star formation activity.

astro-ph;9508067	non-equilibrium photodissociation regions: ionization-dissociation  fronts	we discuss the theory of coupled ionization--dissociation fronts producedwhen molecular clouds are exposed to $\lambda &lt; 1110$\aa\ radiation from hotstars. a steady, composite structure is developed, which generally includes anionized outflow away from the cloud, an ionization front, a layer ofphotodissociated gas, a photodissociation front, and a shock wave preceding thephotodissociation front. we show that the properties of the structure aredetermined by two dimensionless parameters, $\psi$ and $\delta$, and by thealfv\'en speed in the preshock gas. for a broad range of parameters ofinterest, the ionization front and the hydrogen photodissociation front do notseparate, the h$_2$ photodissociation and photoionization take place together,and a classical hydrogen ``photodissociation region'' (pdr) does not exist. wealso show that even when a distinct photodissociation region exists, in manycases the dissociation front propagates too rapidly for the usual stationarymodels of pdrs to be applicable. we discuss several famous pdrs, e.g., in m17and orion and conclude that they cannot be described by equilibrium pdr models.

astro-ph;9605046	radiative torques on interstellar grains: i. superthermal spinup	irregular dust grains are subject to radiative torques when irradiated byinterstellar starlight. it is shown how these radiative torques may becalculated using the discrete dipole approximation. calculations are carriedout for one irregular grain geometry, and three different grain sizes. it isshown that radiative torques can play an important dynamical role in spinup ofinterstellar dust grains, resulting in rotation rates which may exceed eventhose expected from h_2 formation on the grain surface. because the radiativetorque on an interstellar grain is determined by the overall grain geometryrather than merely the state of the grain surface, the resulting superthermalrotation is expected to be long-lived. by itself, long-lived superthermalrotation would permit grain alignment by normal paramagnetic dissipation on the"davis-greenstein" timescale. however, radiative torques arising fromanisotropy of the starlight background can act directly to alter the grainalignment on much shorter timescales, and are therefore central to the processof interstellar grain alignment.  radiative torques depend strongly on the grain size, measured by a_eff, theradius of a sphere of equal volume. in diffuse clouds, radiative torquesdominate the torques due to h2 formation for a_eff=0.2micron grains, but arerelatively unimportant for a_eff&lt;0.05micron grains. this may provide a naturalexplanation for the observation that $a_eff&gt;0.1 micron grains in diffuse cloudsare aligned, while there is little alignment of a_eff &lt; 0.05 micron grains. weshow that radiative torques are ineffective at producing superthermal rotationwithin quiescent dark clouds, but can be very effective in star-forming regionssuch as the m17 molecular cloud.

astro-ph;9612199	disorientation of suprathermally rotating grains and grain alignment  problem	we discuss the dynamics of dust grains subjected to uncompensated torquesarising from h_2 formation. in particular, we discuss grain dynamics when agrain spins down and goes through a ``crossover''. as first pointed out byspitzer &amp; mcglynn (1979), the grain angular momentum before and after acrossover event are correlated, and the degree of this correlation affects thealignment of dust grains by paramagnetic dissipation. we calculate thecorrelation including the important effects of thermal fluctuations within thegrain material. these fluctuations limit the degree to which the grain angularmomentum j is coupled with the grain principal axis a_1 of maximal inertia. weshow that this imperfect coupling of a_1 with j plays a critical role duringcrossovers and can substantially increase the efficiency of paramagneticalignment for grains larger than 10^{-5} cm. as a result, we show that forreasonable choices of parameters, the observed alignment of $a\gtrsim 10^{-5}$cm grains could be produced by paramagnetic dissipation in suprathermallyrotating grains, if radiative torques due to starlight were not present. wealso show that the efficiency of mechanical alignment in the limit of longalignment times is not altered by the thermal fluctuations in the grainmaterial.

astro-ph;9807009	magnetic dipole microwave emission from dust grains	thermal fluctuations in the magnetization of interstellar grains will producemagnetic dipole emission at frequencies below ~100 ghz. we show how tocalculate absorption and emission from small particles composed of magneticmaterials. the kramers-kronig relations for a dusty medium are generalized toinclude the possibility of magnetic grains. the frequency-dependent magneticpermeability is discussed for candidate grain materials, including iron andmagnetite.  we calculate emission spectra for various interstellar grain candidates.while paramagnetic grains or magnetite grains cannot account for the observed"anomalous" emission from dust in the 14-90 ghz range, stronger magnetic dipoleemission will result if a fraction of the grain material is ferromagnetic, ascould be the case given the high fe content of interstellar dust. the observedemission from dust near 90 ghz implies that not more than 5% of interstellar feis in the form of metallic iron grains or inclusions (e.g., in "gems").however, we show that if most interstellar fe is in a moderately ferromagneticmaterial, it could contribute a substantial fraction of the observed 14-90 ghzemission, perhaps comparable to the contribution from spinning ultrasmall dustgrains. the two emission mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring theemission from dark clouds. the expected polarization of magnetic dipoleemission is discussed

astro-ph;9909020	dust sublimation by grbs and its implications	the prompt optical flash recently detected accompanying grb990123 suggeststhat, for at least some grbs, gamma-ray emission is accompanied by promptoptical-uv emission with luminosity l(1-7.5ev)=10^{49}(\delta\omega/4\pi)erg/s,where \delta\omega is the solid angle into which gamma-ray and optical-uvemission is beamed. such an optical-uv flash can destroy dust in the beam bysublimation out to an appreciable distance, approximately 10 pc, and may clearthe dust out of as much as 10^7(\delta\omega/4\pi)m_sun of molecular cloudmaterial on an apparent time scale of 10 seconds. detection of time dependentextinction on this time scale would therefore provide strong constraints on thegrb source environment. dust destruction implies that existing, or future,observations of not-heavily-reddened fireballs are not inconsistent with grbsbeing associated with star forming regions. in this case, however, if gamma-rayemission is highly beamed, the expanding fireball would become reddened on a 1week time scale.  if the optical depth due to dust beyond approximately 8 pc from the grb is0.2&lt;\tau_v&lt;2, most of the uv flash energy is converted to infra-red, \lambda\sim 1 micron, radiation with luminosity \sim 10^{41} erg/s extending over anapparent duration of \sim 20(1+z)(\delta\omega/0.01) day. dust infra-redemission may already have been observed in grb970228 and grb980326, and maypossibly explain their unusual late time behavior.
