0706.2029	the chemical compositions of the type ii cepheids -- the bl her and w  vir variables	abundance analyses from high-resolution optical spectra are presented for 19type ii cepheids in the galactic field. the sample includes both short-period(bl her) and long-period (w vir) stars. this is the first extensive abundanceanalysis of these variables. the c, n, and o abundances with similar spreadsfor the bl her and w vir show evidence for an atmosphere contaminated with$3\alpha$-process and cn-cycling products. a notable anomaly of the bl herstars is an overabundance of na by a factor of about five relative to theirpresumed initial abundances. this overabundance is not seen in the w vir stars.the abundance anomalies running from mild to extreme in w vir stars but notseen in the bl her stars are attributed to dust-gas separation that provides anatmosphere deficient in elements of high condensation temperature, notably al,ca, sc, ti, and $s$-process elements. such anomalies have previously been seenamong rv tau stars which represent a long-period extension of the variabilityenjoyed by the type ii cepheids. comments are offered on how the contrastingabundance anomalies of bl her and w vir stars may be explained in terms of thestars' evolution from the blue horizontal branch.

0704.1237	infrared high-resolution spectroscopy of post-agb circumstellar disks.  i. hr 4049 - the winnowing flow observed?	high-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region isreported for the peculiar a supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary hr4049. lines from the co fundamental and first overtone, oh fundamental, andseveral h2o vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in thenear-infrared spectrum. the spectrum of hr 4049 appears principally in emissionthrough the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.the 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. all thespectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to becircumbinary in origin. the presence of oh and h2o lines confirm theoxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to thepreviously detected carbon-rich material. the emission and absorption lineprofiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layernear the dust disk. the properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk andthe spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, m_ai~0.58 msolarand m_mv~0.34 msolar. gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocityof $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. the severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solarabundances of volatile elements observed in hr 4049 results from abundancewinnowing. the separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and thesubsequent accretion by the star are discussed. contrary to prior reports, thehr 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical agb values:12c/13c=6^{+9}_{-4} and 16o/17o&gt;200.

0910.2288	rubidium in the interstellar medium	we present observations of interstellar rubidium toward o per, zeta per, aeaur, hd 147889, chi oph, zeta oph, and 20 aql. theory suggests that stable 85rband long-lived 87rb are produced predominantly by high-mass stars, through acombination of the weak s- and r-processes. the 85rb/87rb ratio was determinedfrom measurements of the rb i line at 7800 angstroms and was compared to thesolar system meteoritic ratio of 2.59. within 1-sigma uncertainties alldirections except hd 147889 have rb isotope ratios consistent with the solarsystem value. the ratio toward hd 147889 is much lower than the meteoriticvalue and similar to that toward rho oph a (federman et al. 2004); both linesof sight probe the rho ophiuchus molecular cloud. the earlier result wasattributed to a deficit of r-processed 85rb. our larger sample suggests insteadthat 87rb is enhanced in these two lines of sight. when the total elementalabundance of rb is compared to the k elemental abundance, the interstellar rb/kratio is significantly lower than the meteoritic ratio for all the sight linesin this study. available interstellar samples for other s- and r- processelements are used to help interpret these results.

0911.1335	accurate fundamental parameters or a, f, and g-type supergiants in the  solar neighbourhood	the following parameters are determined for 63 galactic supergiants in thesolar neighbourhood: effective temperature teff, surface gravity log g, ironabundance log e(fe), microturbulent parameter vt, mass m/msun, age t anddistance d. a significant improvement in the accuracy of the determination oflog g and, all parameters dependent on it, is obtained through application ofvan leeuwens (2007) re-reduction of the hipparcos parallaxes. the typical errorin the log g values is now +-0.06 dex for supergiants with distances d &lt; 300 pcand +-0.12 dex for supergiants with d between 300 and 700 pc; the mean error inteff for these stars is +-120 k. for supergiants with d &gt; 700 pc parallaxes areuncertain or unmeasurable, so typical errors in their log g values are 0.2-0.3dex.  a new teff scale for a5-g5 stars of luminosity classes ib-ii is presented.spectral subtypes and luminosity classes of several stars are corrected.combining the teff and log g with evolutionary tracks, stellar masses and agesare determined; a majority of the sample has masses between 4 msun and 15 msunand, hence, their progenitors were early to middle b-type main sequence stars.  using fe ii lines, which are insensitive to departures from lte, themicroturbulent parameter vt and the iron abundance log e(fe) are determinedfrom high-resolution spectra. the parameter vt is correlated with gravity: vtincreases with decreasing log g. the mean iron abundance for the 48 supergiantswith distances d &lt; 700 pc is log e(fe)=7.48+-0.09, a value close to the solarvalue of 7.45+-0.05, and thus the local supergiants and the sun have the samemetallicity.

1003.2901	oxygen isotopic ratios in cool r coronae borealis stars	we investigate the relationship between r coronae borealis (rcb) stars andhydrogen-deficient carbon (hdc) stars by measuring precise 16o/18o ratios forfive cool rcb stars. the 16o/18o ratios are derived by spectrum synthesis fromhigh-resolution (r=50,000) k-band spectra. lower limits to the 16o/17o and14n/15}n ratios as well as na and s abundances (when possible) are also given.rcb stars in our sample generally display less 18o than hdc stars - the derived16o/18o ratios range from 3 to 20. the only exception is the rcb star wx cra,which seems to be a hdc-like star with 16o/18o=0.3. our result of a higher16o/18o ratio for the rcb stars must be accounted for by a theory of theformation and evolution of hdc and rcb stars. we speculate that a latedredge-up of products of he-burning, principally 12c and 16o, may convert a18o-rich hdc star into a 18o-poor rcb star as the h-deficient star begins itsfinal evolution from a cool supergiant to the top of the white dwarf coolingtrack.

1008.0358	high resolution optical spectroscopy of the f supergiant proto-planetary  nebula v887 her=iras 18095+2704	an abundance analysis is presented for iras 18095+2704 (v887 her), a post-agbstar and proto-planetary nebula. the analysis is based on high-resolutionoptical spectra from the mcdonald observatory and the special astrophysicalobservatory. standard analysis using a classical kurucz model atmosphere andthe line analysis program moog provides the atmospheric parameters: teff = 6500k, log g = +0.5, and a microturbulent velocity vt = 4.7 km/s and [fe/h] = -0.9.extraction of these parameters is based on excitation of fei lines, ionizationequilibrium between neutral and ions of mg, ca, ti, cr, and fe, and the wingsof hydrogen paschen lines. elemental abundances are obtained for 22 elementsand upper limits for an additional four elements. these results show that thestar's atmosphere has not experienced a significant number of c- and s-processenriching thermal pulses. abundance anomalies as judged relative to thecompositions of unevolved and less-evolved normal stars of a similarmetallicity include al, y, and zr deficiencies with respect to fe of about 0.5dex. judged by composition, the star resembles a rv tauri variable that hasbeen mildly affected by dust-gas separation reducing the abundances of theelements of highest condensation temperature. this separation may occur in thestellar wind. there are indications that the standard 1d lte analysis is notentirely appropriate for iras 18095+2704. these include a supersonicmacroturbulent velocity of 23 km/s, emission in h-alpha and the failure ofpredicted profiles to fit observed profiles of h-beta and h-gamma.

1009.0054	nitrogen enrichment in atmospheres of a- and f- type supergiants	using new accurate fundamental parameters of 30 galactic a and f supergiants,namely their effective temperatures teff and surface gravities log g, weimplemented a non-lte analysis of the nitrogen abundance in their atmospheres.it is shown that the non-lte corrections to the n abundances increase withteff. the nitrogen overabundance as a general feature of this type of stars isconfirmed. a majority of the stars has a nitrogen excess [n/fe] between 0.2 and0.9 dex with the maximum position of the star's distribution on [n/fe] between0.4 and 0.7 dex. the n excesses are discussed in light of predictions forb-type main sequence (ms) stars with rotationally induced mixing and for theirnext evolutionary phase, i.e. a- and f-type supergiants that have experiencedthe first dredge-up. rotationally induced mixing in the ms progenitors of thesupergiants may be a significant cause of the nitrogen excesses. when comparingour results with predictions of the theory developed for stars with the mixing,we find that the bulk of the supergiants (28 of 30) show the n enrichment thatcan be expected (i) either after the ms phase for stars with the initialrotational velocities v0 = 200-400 km s-1, (ii) or after the first dredge-upfor stars with v0 = 50-400 km s-1. the latter possibility is preferred onaccount of the longer lifetime for stars on red-blue loops following the firstdredge-up. two supergiants without a discernible n enrichment, namely hr 825and hr 7876, may be post-ms objects with the relatively low initial rotationalvelocity of about 100 km s-1. the suggested range for v0 is approximatelyconsistent with inferences from the observed projected rotational velocities ofb-type ms stars, progenitors of a and f supergiants.

1303.4853	spectroscopic followup of three bright halo stars selected from sdss and  galex photometry	we aim to reveal the nature of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) stars:sdssj100921.40+375233.9, sdssj015717.04+135535.9, and sdssj171422.43+283657.2,showing apparently high nuv excesses for their g-z colors, as expected forextremely low-metallicity stars. high resolution (r=60 000) spectra of thestars with a wide wavelength coverage were obtained to determine their chemicalcompositions with the tull echelle spectrograph on the 2.7 m telescope at themcdonald observatory. we derived the spectroscopic parameters teff =5820+-125k, log g =3.9+-0.2, and vt =1.1+-0.5 km/s for sdssj100921.40+375233.9,teff=6250+-125 k, log g =3.7+-0.2, and vt =4.0+-0.5 km/s forsdssj015717.04+135535.9, and teff=6320+-125 k, log g =4.1+-0.3, and vt=1.5+-0.5 km/s for sdss j171422.43+283657.2, and elemental abundances werecomputed for 21 elements for j100921 and j171422 and for 19 elements forj015717 for the first time. we find metallicities of [fe/h]= -1.30, -0.94, and-0.80 for sdssj100921.40+375233.9, j015717.04+135535.9, andj171422.43+283657.2, respectively. on the basis of calculated abundance ratiosfor j171422.43+283657.2 and j015717.04+135535.9, we also report that these twoprogram stars have the expected composition of main-sequence halo turnoffstars, but with low-alpha abundances, i.e., the [alpha/fe] ratio is ~0.0 forj171422.43+283657.2 and ~0.1 for j015717.04+135535.9. the latter one showstypical halo or thick-disk alpha-element abundances, but has a substantialrotational line broadening and vsini=40 +- 0.5 km/s.

1411.2722	carbon abundance and the n/c ratio in atmospheres of a-, f- and g-type  supergiants and bright giants	based on our prior accurate determination of fundamental parameters for 36galactic a-, f- and g-type supergiants and bright giants (luminosity classes iand ii), we undertook a non-lte analysis of the carbon abundance in theiratmospheres. it is shown that the non-lte corrections to the c abundancesderived from c i lines are negative and increase with the effective temperatureteff; the corrections are especially significant for the infrared c i lineswith wavelengths 9060-9660 \aa. the carbon underabundance as a general propertyof the stars in question is confirmed; a majority of the stars studied has thecarbon deficiency [c/fe] between -0.1 and -0.5 dex, with a minimum at -0.7 dex.when comparing the derived c deficiency with the n excess found by us for thesame stars earlier, we obtain a pronounced n vs. c anti-correlation, whichcould be expected from predictions of the theory.we found that the ratio [n/c]spans mostly the range from 0.3 to 1.7 dex. both these enhanced [n/c] valuesand the c and n anomalies themselves are an obvious evidence of the presence ona star's surface of mixed material from stellar interiors; so, a majority ofprogramme stars passed through the deep mixing during the main sequence (ms)and/or the first dredge-up (fd) phase. comparison with theoretical predictionsincluding rotationally-induced mixing shows that the stars are either post-msobjects with the initial rotational velocities v0 = 200-300 km/s or post-fdobjects with v0 = 0-300 km/s. the observed n vs. c anti-correlation reflects adependence of the c and n anomalies on the v0 value: on average the higher v0the greater the anomalies. it is shown that an absence of detectable lithium inthe atmospheres of the stars, which is accompanied with the observed n excessand c deficiency, is quite explainable.

1506.01348	early-type stars observed in the eso uves paranal observatory project -  v. time-variable interstellar absorption	the structure and properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) onsmall scales, sub-au to 1 pc, are poorly understood. we compare interstellarabsorption-lines, observed towards a selection of o- and b-type stars at two ormore epochs, to search for variations over time caused by the transverse motionof each star combined with changes in the structure in the foreground ism. twosets of data were used: 83 vlt- uves spectra with approximately 6 yr betweenepochs and 21 mcdonald observatory 2.7m telescope echelle spectra with 6 - 20yr between epochs, over a range of scales from 0 - 360 au. the interstellarabsorption-lines observed at the two epochs were subtracted and searched forany residuals due to changes in the foreground ism. of the 104 sightlinesinvestigated with typically five or more components in na i d, possibletemporal variation was identified in five uves spectra (six components), in caii, ca i and/or na i absorption-lines. the variations detected range from 7\%to a factor of 3.6 in column density. no variation was found in any otherinterstellar species. most sightlines show no variation, with 3{\sigma} upperlimits to changes of the order 0.1 - 0.3 dex in ca ii and na i. thesevariations observed imply that fine-scale structure is present in the ism, butat the resolution available in this study, is not very common at visiblewavelengths. a determination of the electron densities and lower limits to thetotal number density of a sample of the sightlines implies that there is nostriking difference between these parameters in sightlines with, and sightlineswithout, varying components.

astro-ph;0001508	the near-ultraviolet continuum of late-type stars	analyses of the near-ultraviolet continuum of late-type stars have led tocontroversial results regarding the performance of state-of-the-art modelatmospheres. the release of the homogeneous iue final archive and theavailability of the high-accuracy hipparcos parallaxes provide an opportunityto revisit this issue, as accurate stellar distances make it possible tocompare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres.  the near-uv continuum is highly sensitive to teff and [fe/h], and once thegravity is constrained from the parallax, these parameters may be derived fromthe analysis of low-dispersion "long-wavelength" (2000-3000 a) iue spectra forstars previously studied by alonso et al. (1996; a&amp;as 117, 227) using theinfrared flux method (irfm). a second comparison is carried out against thestars spectroscopically investigated by gratton et al. (1996; a&amp;a 314, 191). itis shown that there is a good agreement between teffs obtained from the irfmand from the near-uv continuum, and a remarkable correspondence betweenobserved and synthetic fluxes for stars with 4000 &lt;= teff &lt;= 6000 k of anymetallicity and gravity. these facts suggest that model atmospheres provide anadequate description of the near-uv continuum forming region and that theopacities involved are essentially understood. for cooler stars, the results ofthe irfm are no longer reliable, as shown by alonso et al., but the discrepancynoticed for stars hotter than 6000 k may reflect problems in the modelatmospheres and/or the opacities at these higher temperatures.

(2001), the abundance variations exist even inmain sequence stars. this strongly suggests that the star-to-star abundancevariations are a result of varying degrees of pollution with intermediate massagb stars being likely polluters. even for the least polluted stars, theabundances of 25mg and 26mg relative to 24mg are considerably higher thanpredicted for ejecta from z=0 supernovae. zero metallicity agb stars may beresponsible for these higher abundances. our measured mg isotopic ratios revealanother layer to the globular cluster star-to-star abundance variations thatdemands extensions of our present theoretical knowledge of stellarnucleosynthesis by giant stars.

(2000).  although the observed strength of a c i line is constant from cool to hot rcbstars, the strength is weaker than predicted by an amount equivalent to afactor of four reduction of a line's gf-value. asplund et al. dubbed this 'thecarbon problem' and discussed possible solutions.  the [c i] 9850 a line seen clearly in r crb and su tau confirms the magnitudeof the carbon problem revealed by the c i lines. the [c i] 8727 a line measuredin five stars shows an enhanced carbon problem. the gf-value required to fitthe observed [c i] 8727 a line is a factor of 15 less than the well-determinedtheoretical gf-value. we suggest that the carbon problem for all lines may bealleviated to some extent by a chromospheric-like temperature rise in thesestars. the rise far exceeds that predicted by our non-lte calculations, andrequires a substantial deposition of mechanical energy.

astro-ph;9508001	the abundance of boron in evolved a- and b-type stars	boron abundances in a- and b-type stars may be a successful way to trackevolutionary effects in these hot stars. the light elements -- li, be, and b --are tracers of exposure to temperatures more moderate than those in which theh-burning cn-cycle operates. thus, any exposure of surface stellar layers todeeper layers will affect these light element abundances. li and be are used inthis role in investigations of evolutionary processes in cool stars, but arenot observable in hotter stars. an investigation of boron, however, is possiblethrough the b ii 1362=c5 resonance line.  we have gathered high resolution spectra from the iue database of a- andb-type stars near 10~m$_\odot$ for which nitrogen abundances have beendetermined (by gies &amp; lambert, 1992, and venn 1995). the b ii 1362=c5 line isblended throughout the temperature range of this program, requiring spectrumsyntheses to recover the boron abundances. for no star could we synthesize the1362=c5 region using the meteoritic/solar boron abundance of log(b) =3d 2.88(anders &amp; grevesse 1989); a lower boron abundance was necessary which mayreflect evolutionary effects (e.g., mass loss or mixing near themain-sequence), the natal composition of the star forming regions, or asystematic error in the analyses (e.g., non-lte effects). regardless of theinitial boron abundance, and despite the possibility of non-lte effects, itseems clear that boron is severely depleted in some stars. it may be that thenitrogen and boron abundances are anticorrelated, as would be expected frommixing between the h-burning and outer stellar layers. if, as we suspect, aresidue of boron is present in the a-type supergiants, we may exclude ascenario in which mixing occurs continuously between the surface and the deep

astro-ph;9907099	the 1995-1996 decline of r coronae borealis - high resolution optical  spectroscopy	a set of high-resolution optical spectra of rcrb acquired before, during, andafter its 1995-1996 decline is discussed. all of the components reported fromearlier declines are seen. this novel dataset provides new information on thesecomponents including several aspects not previously seen in declines of rcrband other rcbs. in the latter category is the discovery that the decline'sonset is marked by distortions of absorption lines of high-excitation lines,and quickly followed by emission in these and in low excitation lines. this'photospheric trigger' implies that dust causing the decline is formed close tothe star. these emission lines fade quickly. after 1995 november 2, lowexcitation narrow (fwhm ~12 km s-1) emission lines remain. these appear to be apermanent feature, slightly blue-shifted from the systemic velocity, andunaffected by the decline except for a late and slight decrease of flux atminimum light. the location of the warm, dense gas providing these lines isuncertain. absorption lines unaffected by overlying sharp emission are greatlybroadened, weakened, and red-shifted at the faintest magnitudes when scatteredlight from the star is a greater contributor than direct light transmittedthrough the fresh soot cloud. a few broad lines are seen at and near minimumlight with approxiamately constant flux: prominent among these are the he itriplet series, na i d, and [n ii] lines. these lines are blue-shifted by about30 km s(-1) relative to the systemic velocity with no change in velocity overthe several months for whicht he lines were seen. it is suggested that theselines, especially the he i lines, arise from an accretion disk around an unseencompact companion, which may be a low-mass white dwarf. if so, r crb is similarto the unusual post-agb star 89 her.

astro-ph;9907155	a consistency test of spectroscopic gravities for late-type stars	chemical analyses of late-type stars are usually carried out following theclassical recipe: lte line formation and homogeneous, plane-parallel,flux-constant, and lte model atmospheres. we review different results in theliterature that have suggested significant inconsistencies in the spectroscopicanalyses, pointing out the difficulties in deriving independent estimates ofthe stellar fundamental parameters and hence,detecting systematic errors.  the trigonometric parallaxes measured by the hipparcos mission provideaccurate appraisals of the stellar surface gravity for nearby stars, which areused here to check the gravities obtained from the photospheric iron ionizationbalance. we find an approximate agreement for stars in the metallicity range -1&lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= 0, but the comparison shows that the differences between thespectroscopic and trigonometric gravities decrease towards lower metallicitiesfor more metal-deficient dwarfs (-2.5 &lt;= [fe/h] &lt;= -1.0), which casts a shadowupon the abundance analyses for extreme metal-poor stars that make use of theionization equilibrium to constrain the gravity. the comparison with thestrong-line gravities derived by edvardsson (1988) and fuhrmann (1998a)confirms that this method provides systematically larger gravities than theionization balance. the strong-line gravities get closer to the physical onesfor the stars analyzed by fuhrmann, but they are even further away than theiron ionization gravities for the stars of lower gravities in edvardsson'ssample. the confrontation of the deviations of the iron ionization gravities inmetal-poor stars reported here with departures from the excitation balancefound in the literature, show that they are likely to be induced by the samephysical mechanism(s).

astro-ph;9907368	model photospheres for late-type stars from the inversion of  high-resolution spectroscopic observations. groombridge 1830 and epsilon  eridani	an inversion technique to recover lte one-dimensional model photospheres forlate-type stars, which was previously applied to the sun (allende prieto et al.1998), is now employed to reconstruct, semi-empirically, the photospheres ofcooler dwarfs: the metal-poor gmb1830 and the active star of solar-metallicityeps eri. the model atmospheres we find reproduce satisfactorily all theconsidered weak-to-moderate neutral lines of metals, satisfying in detail theexcitation equilibrium of iron, the wings of strong lines, and the slope of theoptical continuum. the retrieved models show a slightly steeper temperaturegradient than flux-constant model atmospheres in the layers where log tau &lt;=-0.5. we argue that these differences should reflect missing ingredients in theflux-constant models and point to granular-like inhomogeneities as the bestcandidate.  the iron ionization equilibrium is well satisfied by the model for gmb1830,but not for eps eri, for which a discrepancy of 0.2 dex between the logarithmiciron abundance derived from neutral and singly ionized lines may signaldepartures from lte. the chemical abundances of calcium, titanium, chromium,and iron derived with the empirical models from neutral lines do not differmuch from previous analyses based on flux-constant atmospheric structures.

astro-ph;9909081	abundance analyses of field rv stars, v: ds aquarii, uy arae, tw  camelopardis, bt librae, u moncerotis, tt ophiuchi, and rv tauri	abundance analyses are presented and discussed for eight rv tauri variables.the rv b star uy ara shows the abundance anomalies seen in other rv b stars,namely elements that condense into grains at high temperature are underabundantbut elements of low condensation temperature are much less underabundant. thispattern is ascribed to a separation of dust from gas with accretion of gas butnot dust by the atmosphere. abundances for two rv c stars with earlier resultsfor other rv c stars show that these intrinsically metal-poor stars do not showeffects of dust-gas separation. analyses of five rv a stars show that thesecooler stars are very largely unaffected by dust-gas separation. it is proposedthat the deeper convective envelope of cooler stars dilutes anomalies resultingfrom dust-gas separation - the dusty wind off the rv tauri variable or a dustycircumbinary disk - are reviewed and observational tests are suggested.

astro-ph;9911002	fundamental parameters of nearby stars from the comparison with  evolutionary calculations: masses, radii and effective temperatures	the hipparcos mission has made it possible to constrain the positions ofnearby field stars in the colour-magnitude diagram with very high accuracy.these positions can be compared with the predictions of stellar evolutionarycalculations to provide information on the basic parameters of the stars:masses, radii, effective temperatures, ages, and chemical composition.  the degeneracy between mass, age, and metallicity is not so large as toprevent a reliable estimate of masses, radii and effective temperatures, atleast for stars of solar metallicity. the evolutionary models of bertelli etal. (1994) predict those parameters finely, and furthermore, the appliedtransformation from the theoretical (log g-teff) to the observational (mv-b-v)plane is precise enough to derive radii with an uncertainty of ~ 6%, masseswithin ~ 8%, and teffs within ~ 2% for a certain range of the stellarparameters. this is demonstrated by means of comparison with the measurementsin eclipsing binaries and the infrared flux method.  the application of the interpolation procedure in the theoretical isochronesto the stars within 100 pc from the sun observed with hipparcos providesestimates for 17,219 stars
