0904.3975	ionospheric calibration of low frequency radio interferometric  observations using the peeling scheme: i. method description and first  results	calibration of radio interferometric observations becomes increasinglydifficult towards lower frequencies. below ~300 mhz, spatially variantrefractions and propagation delays of radio waves traveling through theionosphere cause phase rotations that can vary significantly with time, viewingdirection and antenna location. in this article we present a description andfirst results of spam (source peeling and atmospheric modeling), a newcalibration method that attempts to iteratively solve and correct forionospheric phase errors. to model the ionosphere, we construct a time-variant,2-dimensional phase screen at fixed height above the earth's surface. spatialvariations are described by a truncated set of discrete karhunen-loeve basefunctions, optimized for an assumed power-law spectral density of freeelectrons density fluctuations, and a given configuration of calibrator sourcesand antenna locations. the model is constrained using antenna-based gain phasesfrom individual self-calibrations on the available bright sources in thefield-of-view. application of spam on three test cases, a simulated visibilitydata set and two selected 74 mhz vla data sets, yields significant improvementsin image background noise (5-75 percent reduction) and source peak fluxes (upto 25 percent increase) as compared to the existing self-calibration andfield-based calibration methods, which indicates a significant improvement inionospheric phase calibration accuracy.

0905.3650	diffuse radio emission in the merging cluster macs j0717.5+3745: the  discovery of the most powerful radio halo	hierarchical models of structure formation predict that galaxy clusters growvia mergers of smaller clusters and galaxy groups, as well as throughcontinuous accretion of gas. macs j0717.5+3745 is an x-ray luminous and complexmerging cluster, located at a redshift of 0.55. here we present giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) radio observations at 610 mhz of this cluster. the mainaim of the observations is to search for diffuse radio emission within thegalaxy cluster macs j0717.5+3745 related to the ongoing merger. these gmrtobservations are complemented by very large array (vla) archival observationsat 1.4, 4.9 and 8.5 ghz. we have discovered a radio halo in the cluster macsj0717.5+3745 with a size of about 1.2 mpc. the radio power p_1.4 ghz is 5 x10^25 w/hz, which makes it the most powerful radio halo known till date. a 700kpc radio structure, which we classify as a radio relic, is located in betweenthe merging substructures of the system. the location of this relic roughlycoincides with regions of the intra-cluster medium (icm) that have asignificant enhancement in temperature as shown by chandra. the major axis ofthe relic is also roughly perpendicular to the merger axis. this shows that therelic might be the result of a merger-related shock wave, where particles areaccelerated via the diffuse shock acceleration (dsa) mechanism. alternatively,the relic might trace an accretion shock of a large-scale galaxy filament tothe south-west. the global spectral index of radio emission within the clusteris found to be -1.24 +/-0.05 between 4.9 ghz and 610 mhz. we derive a value of5.8 microgauss for the equipartition magnetic field strength at the location ofthe radio halo.

0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

0910.2025	unveiling radio halos in galaxy clusters in the lofar era	giant radio halos are mega-parsec scale synchrotron sources detected in afraction of massive and merging galaxy clusters. radio halos provide one of themost important pieces of evidence for non-thermal components in large scalestructure. statistics of their properties can be used to discriminate amongvarious models for their origin. therefore, theoretical predictions of theoccurrence of radio halos are important as several new radio telescopes areabout to begin to survey the sky at low frequencies with unprecedentedsensitivity. in this paper we carry out monte carlo simulations to model theformation and evolution of radio halos in a cosmological framework. we extendprevious works on the statistical properties of radio halos in the context ofthe turbulent re-acceleration model. first we compute the fraction of galaxyclusters that show radio halos and derive the luminosity function of radiohalos. then, we derive differential and integrated number count distributionsof radio halos at low radio frequencies with the main goal to explore thepotential of the upcoming lofar surveys. by restricting to the case of clustersat redshifts &lt;0.6, we find that the planned lofar all sky survey at 120 mhz isexpected to detect about 350 giant radio halos. about half of these halos havespectral indices larger than 1.9 and substantially brighten at lowerfrequencies. if detected they will allow for a confirmation that turbulenceaccelerates the emitting particles. we expect that also commissioning surveys,such as msss, have the potential to detect about 60 radio halos in clusters ofthe rosat brightest cluster sample and its extension (ebcs). these surveys willallow us to constrain how the rate of formation of radio halos in theseclusters depends on cluster mass.

0910.2970	a search for steep spectrum radio relics and halos with the gmrt	context: diffuse radio emission, in the form of radio halos and relics,traces regions in clusters with shocks or turbulence, probably produced bycluster mergers. some models of diffuse radio emission in clusters indicatethat virtually all clusters should contain diffuse radio sources with a steepspectrum. external accretion shocks associated with filamentary structures ofgalaxies could also accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and henceproduce diffuse synchrotron emitting regions. here we report on giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) observations of a sample of steep spectrum sources fromthe 74 mhz vlss survey. these sources are diffuse and not associated withnearby galaxies.  aims: the main aim of the observations is to search for diffuse radioemission associated with galaxy clusters or the cosmic web.  methods: we carried out gmrt 610 mhz continuum observations of unidentifieddiffuse steep spectrum sources.  results: we have constructed a sample of diffuse steep spectrum sources,selected from the 74 mhz vlss survey. we identified eight diffuse radio sourcesprobably all located in clusters. we found five radio relics, one cluster witha giant radio halo and a radio relic, and one radio mini-halo. by complementingour observations with measurements from the literature we find correlationsbetween the physical size of relics and the spectral index, in the sense thatsmaller relics have steeper spectra. furthermore, larger relics are mostlylocated in the outskirts of clusters while smaller relics are located closer tothe cluster center.

0910.4967	the discovery of diffuse steep spectrum sources in abell 2256	context: hierarchical galaxy formation models indicate that during theirlifetime galaxy clusters undergo several mergers. here we report on thediscovery of three diffuse radio sources in the periphery of abell 2256, usingthe gmrt.  aims: the aim of the observations was to search for diffuse ultra-steepspectrum radio sources within the galaxy cluster abell 2256.  methods: we have carried out gmrt 325 mhz radio continuum observations ofabell 2256. v, r and i band images of the cluster were taken with the 4.2m wht.  results: we have discovered three diffuse elongated radio sources locatedabout 1 mpc from the cluster center. two are located to the west of the clustercenter, and one to the southeast. the sources have a measured physical extentof 170, 140 and 240 kpc, respectively. the two western sources are also visiblein deep low-resolution 115-165 mhz wsrt images, although they are blended intoa single source. for the combined emission of the blended source we find anextreme spectral index of -2.05\pm 0.14 between 140 and 351 mhz. the extremelysteep spectral index suggests these two sources are most likely the result ofadiabatic compression of fossil radio plasma due to merger shocks.  conclusions: the discovery of the steep spectrum sources implies theexistence of a population of faint diffuse radio sources in (merging) clusterswith such steep spectra that they have gone unnoticed in higher frequency(\gtrsim 1 ghz) observations. an exciting possibility therefore is that suchsources will determine the general appearance of clusters in low-frequency highresolution radio maps as will be produced by for example lofar or lwa.

1002.4198	a galaxy populations study of a radio-selected protocluster at z~3.1	we present a population study of several types of galaxies within theprotocluster surrounding the radio galaxy mrc0316-257 at z~3.1. in addition tothe known population of ly_alpha emitters (laes) and [oiii] emitters, we usecolour selection techniques to identify protocluster candidates that are lymanbreak galaxies (lbg) and balmer break galaxies (bbgs). the radio galaxy fieldcontains an excess of lbg candidates, with a surface density 1.6\pm0.3 timeslarger than found for comparable blank fields. this surface overdensitycorresponds to an lbg volume overdensity of ~8\pm4. the bbg photometricredshift distribution peaks at the protocluster's redshift, but we detect nosignificant surface overdensity of bbg. this is not surprising because a volumeoverdensity similar to the lbgs would have resulted in a surface density of~1.2 that found in the blank field. this could not have been detected in oursample. masses and star formation rates of the candidate protocluster galaxiesare determined using sed fitting. these properties are not significantlydifferent from those of field galaxies. the galaxies with the highest massesand star formation rates are located near the radio galaxy, indicating that theprotocluster environment influences galaxy evolution at z~3. we conclude thatthe protocluster around mrc0316-257 is still in the early stages of formation.

1101.3865	diffuse steep-spectrum sources from the 74 mhz vlss survey	galaxy clusters grow by a sequence of mergers with other clusters and galaxygroups. during these mergers, shocks and/or turbulence are created within theintracluster medium (icm). in this process, particles could be accelerated tohighly relativistic energies. the synchrotron radiation from these particles isobserved in the form of radio relics and halos that are generally characterizedby a steep radio spectral index. shocks can also revive fossil radio plasmafrom a previous episode of agn activity, creating a so-called radio phoenix.here we present multi-frequency radio observations of diffuse steep-spectrumradio sources selected from the 74 mhz vlss survey. previous gmrt observationsshowed that some of these sources had filamentary and elongated morphologies,which are expected for radio relics.  we carried out radio continuum observations at 325 mhz with the gmrt.observations with the vla and wsrt were taken at 1.4 ghz in full polarizationmode. optical images around the radio sources were taken with the wht and inttelescopes. most of the sources in our sample consist of old radio plasma fromagns located in small galaxy clusters. the sources can be classified as agnrelics or radio phoenices. the spectral indices across most of the radiosources display large variations. we conclude that diffuse steep-spectrum radiosources are not only found in massive x-ray luminous galaxy clusters but alsoin smaller systems. future low-frequency surveys will uncover large numbers ofsteep-spectrum radio relics related to previous episodes of agn activity.[abridged]

1104.1176	a sinfoni view of flies in the spiderweb: a galaxy cluster in the making	the environment of the high-z radio galaxy pks 1138-262 at z~2.2 is a primeexample of a forming galaxy cluster. we use deep sinfoni data to perform adetailed study of the kinematics of the galaxies within 60 kpc of the radiocore and we link this to the kinematics of the protocluster on the megaparsecscale. identification of optical emission lines shows that 11 galaxies are atthe redshift of the protocluster. the density of line emitters is more than anorder of magnitude higher in the core of the protocluster than the larger scaleenvironment. this implies a matter overdensity in the core of delta_m~70 whichis similar to the outskirts of local galaxy clusters. the velocity distributionof the confirmed satellite galaxies shows a broad, double-peaked velocitystructure with sigma=1360+/-206 km/s. a similar broad, double-peakeddistribution was found in a previous study targeting the large scaleprotocluster structure, indicating that a common process is acting on bothsmall and large scales. including all spectroscopically confirmed protoclustergalaxies, a velocity dispersion of 1013+/-87 km/s is found. we show that theprotocluster has likely decoupled from the hubble flow and is a dynamicallyevolved structure. comparison to the millenium simulation indicates that theprotocluster velocity distribution is consistent with that of the most massivehaloes at z~2, but we rule out that the protocluster is a fully virializedstructure based on dynamical arguments and its x-ray luminosity. comparison tomerging haloes in the millennium simulation shows that the structure asobserved in and around the spiderweb galaxy is best interpreted as being theresult of a merger between two massive haloes. we propose that this merger canresult in an increase in star formation and agn activity in the protoclustercore and is possibly an important stage in the evolution of massive cdgalaxies.

1108.1398	using double radio relics to constrain galaxy cluster mergers: a model  of double radio relics in ciza j2242.8+5301	galaxy clusters grow by mergers with other clusters and galaxy groups. thesemergers create shock waves within the intracluster medium (icm) that canaccelerate particles to extreme energies. in the presence of magnetic fields,relativistic electrons form large regions emitting synchrotron radiation,so-called radio relics. behind the shock front, synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) losses cause the radio spectral index to steepen away from the shockfront. an example of such a cluster is ciza j2242.8+5301, where very clearspectral steepening in the downstream region is observed. here we presenthydrodynamical simulations of idealized binary cluster mergers with the aim ofconstraining the merger scenario for this cluster. from our simulations, wefind that ciza j2242.8+5301 is probably undergoing a merger in the plane of thesky (less then 10 deg from edge-on) with a mass ratio of about 2:1, and animpact parameter &lt; 400 kpc. we find that the core passage of the clustershappened about 1 gyr ago. we conclude that double relics relics can setconstraints on the mass ratios, impact parameters, timescales, and viewinggeometry of binary cluster mergers, which is particularly useful when detailedx-ray observations are not available. in addition, the presence of large radiorelics can be used to constrain the degree of clumping in the outskirts of theicm, which is important to constrain the baryon fraction, density and entropyprofiles, around the virial radius and beyond. we find that the amplitude ofdensity fluctuations, with sizes of &lt; 200 kpc, in the relic in cizaj2242.8+5301 is not larger than 30%.

1209.6515	a stringent upper limit to 18cm radio emission from the extrasolar  planet system tau bootis	context: it has been speculated for many years that some extrasolar planetsmay emit strong cyclotron emission at low radio frequencies in the range 10-100mhz. despite several attempts no such emission has yet been seen.  aims: the hot jupiter system tau bootis is one of the nearest (d=15 pc)exoplanets known to date. the gravitational influence of this massive hotjupiter (m=6 m_jup) has locked the star-planet system, making the star rotatein p~3.3 days, similar to the orbital period of the planet. from the wellestablished correlation between stellar rotation and radio luminosity, it isconceivable that the tau bootis system emits strong radio emission atsignificantly higher frequencies than currently probed, which we aimed toinvestigate with this work.  methods: we observed tau bootis with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt) at a frequency of 1.7 ghz. for 12 hours in spectral line mode, reachinga noise level of 42 microjy/beam at the position of the target.  results: no 18cm radio emission is detected from tau bootis, resulting in a 3sigma upper limit of 0.13 mjy, corresponding to a 18cm radio luminosity of&lt;3.7e13 erg/s/hz. we observe tau bootis to be two orders of magnitude fainterthan expected from the stellar relation between radio luminosity and rotationvelocity.  conclusions: this implies that either the tau bootis system is underluminousin the radio compared to similar fast-rotating stars, or that we happened toobserve the target during a low state of radio emission.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

1301.1630	initial deep lofar observations of epoch of reionization windows: i. the  north celestial pole	the aim of the lofar epoch of reionization (eor) project is to detect thespectral fluctuations of the redshifted hi 21cm signal. this signal is weakerby several orders of magnitude than the astrophysical foreground signals andhence, in order to achieve this, very long integrations, accurate calibrationfor stations and ionosphere and reliable foreground removal are essential. oneof the prospective observing windows for the lofar eor project will be centeredat the north celestial pole (ncp). we present results from observations of thencp window using the lofar highband antenna (hba) array in the frequency range115 mhz to 163 mhz. the data were obtained in april 2011 during thecommissioning phase of lofar. we used baselines up to about 30 km. with about 3nights, of 6 hours each, effective integration we have achieved a noise levelof about 100 microjy/psf in the ncp window. close to the ncp, the noise levelincreases to about 180 microjy/psf, mainly due to additional contamination fromunsubtracted nearby sources. we estimate that in our best night, we havereached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by thenoise from our galaxy and the receivers. our continuum images are several timesdeeper than have been achieved previously using the wsrt and gmrt arrays. wederive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to bemainly due to sources at large angular separation from the ncp.

1409.5437	lofar low-band antenna observations of the 3c295 and bootes fields:  source counts and ultra-steep spectrum sources	we present lofar low band observations of the bootes and 3c295 fields. ourimages made at 34, 46, and 62 mhz reach noise levels of 12, 8, and 5 mjybeam$^{-1}$, making them the deepest images ever obtained in this frequencyrange. in total, we detect between 300 and 400 sources in each of these images,covering an area of 17 to 52 deg$^{2}$. from the observations we deriveeuclidean-normalized differential source counts. the 62 mhz source counts agreewith previous gmrt 153 mhz and vla 74 mhz differential source counts, scalingwith a spectral index of $-0.7$. we find that a spectral index scaling of$-0.5$ is required to match up the lofar 34 mhz source counts. this result isalso in agreement with source counts from the 38 mhz 8c survey, indicating thatthe average spectral index of radio sources flattens towards lower frequencies.we also find evidence for spectral flattening using the individual fluxmeasurements of sources between 34 and 1400 mhz and by calculating the spectralindex averaged over the source population. to select ultra-steep spectrum($\alpha &lt; -1.1$) radio sources, that could be associated with massive highredshift radio galaxies, we compute spectral indices between 62 mhz, 153 mhzand 1.4 ghz for sources in the bo\"otes field. we cross-correlate these radiosources with optical and infrared catalogues and fit the spectral energydistribution to obtain photometric redshifts. we find that most of theseultra-steep spectrum sources are located in the $ 0.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.5$range.

(1995). the gas seen inabsorption has a resolved spatial extent of at least 13 kpc (the size of theextended emission line region). we first model the absorption and emission gasas co-spatial components with the same metallicity and degree of excitation.using the information provided by the emission and absorption line ratios ofciv and ly-alpha, we find that the observed quantities are incompatible withphotoionization or collisional ionization of cloudlets with uniform properties.we therefore reject the possibility that the absorption and emission phases areco-spatial and favour the explanation that the absorption gas has lowmetallicity and is located further away from the host galaxy (than the emissionline gas). the estimated low metallicity for the absorption gas in 0943-242 (z\~ 1% solar) and its proposed location -outer halo outside the radio cocoon-suggest that its existence preceeds the observed agn phase and is a vestige ofthe initial starburst at the onset of formation of the parent galaxy.

astro-ph;0111193	the x-ray -- radio alignment in the z = 2.2 radio galaxy pks 1138--262	we present high resolution x-ray observations of the narrow line radio galaxypks 1138-262 at z = 2.156 with the acis-s detector on the chandra observatory.these observations show that the x-ray emission from 1138-262 is dominated byemission from the agn with a (rest frame) 2 to 10 kev luminosity of 4x10^{45}erg/s. the relative x-ray and radio properties of the agn in 1138-262 aresimilar to those seen for the agn in the archetype powerful radio galaxy cygnusa. between 10% and 25% (depending on energy) of the x-ray emission from1138--262 is spatially extended on scales of 10'' to 20''. the extended x-rayemission is elongated, with a major axis aligned with that of the radio source.while the x-ray and radio emissions are elongated on similar scales andposition angles, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the radio andx-ray features in the source. the most likely origin for the extended x-rayemission in 1138-262 is thermal emission from shocked gas, although we cannotrule-out a contribution from inverse compton emission. if the emission is fromhot gas, the gas density is 0.05 cm^{-3} and the gas mass is 2.5x10^{12}m_solar. the pressure in this hot gas is adequate to confine the radio emittingplasma and the optical line emitting gas. we set an upper limit of 1.5x10^{44}erg/s to the 2 to 10 kev luminosity of any normal cluster atmosphere associatedwith 1138-262. no emission was detected from any of the ly alpha emittinggalaxies in the (proto-) cluster around 1138-262, outside of the ly alpha haloof 1138-262 itself, to a 2 to 10kev luminosity limit of 1.2x10^{43}erg/s.

astro-ph;0203249	the most distant structure of galaxies known: a protocluster at z=4.1	imaging and spectroscopy with the very large telescope have revealed 20lyman-alpha emitters within a projected distance of 1.3 mpc and 600 km/s of theluminous radio galaxy tn j1338-1942 at z=4.1. compared to the field density oflyman-alpha emitters, this implies an overdensity on the order of 15. thestructure has a projected size of at least 2.7 mpc x 1.8 mpc and a velocitydispersion of 325 km/s, which makes it the most distant structure known. usingthe galaxy overdensity and assuming a bias parameter b = 3 - 5, the mass isestimated to be ~10^15 m_sun. the radio galaxy itself is surrounded by anuniquely asymmetric lyman-alpha halo. taken together with our previous data onpks 1138-262 at z ~ 2.16, these results suggest that luminous radio sources areexcellent tracers of high density regions in the early universe, which evolveinto present-day clusters. the statistics of bright radio sources and ofconcentrations in the lyman break galaxy population are consistent with thepicture that each of those concentrations harbours an active or passiveluminous radio source.

astro-ph;0208549	deep spectroscopy of z~1 6c radio galaxies - ii. breaking the  redshift-radio power degeneracy	the results of a spectroscopic analysis of 3cr and 6c radio galaxies atredshift z~1 are contrasted with the properties of lower redshift radiogalaxies, chosen to be matched in radio luminosity to the 6c sources studied atz~1, thus enabling the p-z degeneracy to be broken. partial rank correlationsand principal component analysis have been used to determine which of z and pare the critical parameters underlying the observed variation of the ionizationstate andd kinematics of the emission line gas. [oii]/h-beta is shown to be auseful ionization mechanism diagnostic. statistical analysis of the data showsthat the ionization state of the emission line gas is strongly correlated withradio power, once the effects of other parameters are removed. no dependence ofionization state on z is observed, implying that the ionization state of theemission line gas is solely a function of the agn properties rather than thehostt galaxy and/or environment. statistical analysis of the kinematicproperties of the emission line gas shows that these are strongly correlatedindependently withh both p and z. the correlation with redshift is the strongerof the two, suggesting that host galaxy composition or environment may play arole in producing the less extreme gas kinematics observed in the emission lineregions of low redshift galaxies. for both the ionization and kinematicproperties of thee galaxies, the independent correlations observed with radiosize are strongest. radio source age is a determining factor for the extendedemission line regions.

astro-ph;0304160	the spatial clustering of radio sources in nvss and first; implications  for galaxy clustering evolution	we have measured the angular correlation function of radio sources in the 1.4ghz nvss and first surveys. below ~6 arcminutes w(theta) is dominated by thesize distribution of radio galaxies. a model of the size distribution of radiogalaxies can account for this excess signal in w(theta). the amplitude of thecosmological clustering of radio sources is roughly constant at a~0.001 from 3to 40 mjy, but has increased to a~0.007 at 200 mjy. this can be explained ifpowerful (frii) radio galaxies probe more massive structures at z~1 compared toaverage power radio galaxies, consistent with powerful high-z radio galaxiesgenerally having massive (forming) elliptical hosts in rich clusterenvironments. for friis we derive a spatial (comoving) correlation length ofr_0=14\pm3 h^{-1} mpc. this is close to that measured for extremely red objects(eros) associated with a population of old elliptical galaxies at z~1 by daddiet al. (2001). based on their similar clustering properties, we propose thateros and powerful radio galaxies may be the same systems seen at differentevolutionary stages. their r_0 is ~2 times higher than that of qsos at asimilar redshift, and comparable to that of bright ellipticals locally. thissuggests that r_0 (comoving) of these galaxies has changed little from z~1 toz=0, in agreement with current lcdm hierarchical models for clusteringevolution of massive early-type galaxies. alternatively, the clustering ofradio galaxies can be explained by the galaxy conservation model. this thenimplies that radio galaxies of average power are the progenitors of the localearly-type field population, while the most powerful radio galaxies will evolveinto a present-day population with r_0 similar to that of local rich clusters.

astro-ph;0606298	large-scale structure of lyman break galaxies around a radio galaxy  protocluster at z~4	we present broad-band imaging with the subaru telescope of a 25'x25' fieldsurrounding the radio galaxy tn j1338-1942 at redshift z=4.1. the fieldcontains excesses of lyman-alpha emitters (laes) and lyman break galaxies(lbgs) identified with a protocluster surrounding the radio galaxy. our newwide-field images provide information about the boundary of the protoclusterand its surroundings. there are 874 candidate lbgs within our field, havingredshifts in the range z=3.5-4.5. an examination of the brightest of these(with i'&lt; 25.0) shows that the most prominent concentration coincides with thepreviously discovered protocluster. the diameter of this galaxy overdensitycorresponds to ~2 mpc at z=4, consistent with the previous estimation usinglaes. several other concentrations of lbgs are observed in the field, some ofwhich may well be physically connected with the z=4.1 protocluster. theobserved structure in the smoothed lbg distribution can be explained as theprojection of large-scale structure, within the redshift range z=3.5-4.5,comprising compact overdensities and prominent larger voids. if the 5-8observed compact overdensities are associated with protoclusters, the observedprotocluster volume density is ~5x10^-6 mpc^-3, similar to the volume densityof rich clusters in the local universe.

astro-ph;0607289	ionization of large-scale absorbing haloes and feedback events from  high-redshift radio galaxies	we present photoionization calculations for the spatially-extended absorbersobserved towards the extended emission line spectrum of two high-redshift radiogalaxies: 0943-242 (z=2.922) and 0200+015 (z=2.230), with the aim ofreproducing the absorber column ratio, n(civ)/n(hi). we explore the effects ofusing different uv continua in the photoionization calculations. a comparisonis drawn between the absorber in 0200+015 and the two absorbers in the lensedlynx arc nebula at z=3.36, which present similar n(civ)/n(hi) ratios. we findthat hot stars from a powerful starburst, or a metagalactic backgroundradiation (mbr) in which stars dominate over quasars, are equally successful inproducing the observed n(civ)/n(hi), assuming subsolar absorber metallicities.these softer seds eliminate the factor 1000 difference in metallicity betweenthe two absorbers encountered in earlier work assuming a powerlaw sed. thedetected level of continuum flux in 0943-242 is consistent with stellarionization. if the mbr is responsible for the ionization of the radio galaxyabsorbing shells, their radii (if spherical) would be large (&gt; 100 kpc) andtheir mass would be huge (&gt;1e12 m_sun), implying that a feedback event withinthe radiogalaxy has expelled more baryonic material than left within it. if, aswe believe more likely, stellar sources within the radiogalaxy are responsiblefor the absorber's ionization, smaller radii of ~25 kpc and much smaller masses(~1e8-1e10 m_sun) are inferred. this radius is consistent with the observedtransition in radio source size between smaller sources where strong hiabsorption is almost ubiquitous, and the larger sources where it is mostlylacking. finally, we outline additional absorption line diagnostics which couldfurther constrain the properties of the haloes and their ionization sources.

astro-ph;0610596	lofar - opening up a new window on the universe	lofar, the low frequency array, is a next-generation radio telescope that isbeing built in northern europe and expected to be fully operational at the endof this decade. it will operate at frequencies from 15 to 240 mhz(corresponding to wavelengths of 20 to 1.2 m). its superb sensitivity, highangular resolution, large field of view and flexible spectroscopic capabilitieswill represent a dramatic improvement over previous facilities at thesewavelengths. as such, lofar will carry out a broad range of fundamentalastrophysical studies.  the design of lofar has been driven by four fundamental astrophysicalapplications: (i) the epoch of reionisation, (ii) extragalactic surveys andtheir exploitation to study the formation and evolution of clusters, galaxiesand black holes, (iii) transient sources and their association with high energyobjects such as gamma ray bursts, and (iv) cosmic ray showers and theirexploitation to study the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. in thisconference the foreseen lofar work on the epoch of reionisation has beencovered by de bruyn and on cosmic ray showers by falcke.  during this contribution we will first present the lofar project with anemphasis on the challenges faced when carrying out sensitive imaging at lowradio frequencies. subsequently, we will discuss lofar's capabilities to surveythe low-frequency radio sky. main aims for the planned surveys are studies ofz&gt;6 radio galaxies, diffuse emission associated with distant clusters andstarbursting galaxies at z&gt;2.

astro-ph;0610909	the spiderweb galaxy: a forming massive cluster galaxy at z~2	we present a deep image of the radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 taken with thehubble space telescope (hst) at a redshift of z = 2.2. the galaxy is known tohave properties of a cd galaxy progenitor and be surrounded by a 3 mpc-sizedstructure, identified with a protocluster. the morphology shown on the new deephst/acs image is reminiscent of a spider's web. more than 10 individual clumpyfeatures are observed, apparently star-forming satellite galaxies in theprocess of merging with the progenitor of a dominant cluster galaxy 11 gyr ago.there is an extended emission component, implying that star formation wasoccurring over a 50 times 40 kpc region at a rate of more than 100 m_sun/yr. astriking feature of the newly named ``spiderweb galaxy'' is the presence ofseveral faint linear galaxies within the merging structure. the denseenvironments and fast galaxy motions at the centres of protoclusters maystimulate the formation of these structures, which dominate the faint resolvedgalaxy populations in the hubble ultra deep field. the new image provides aunique testbed for simulations of forming dominant cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;0611245	nicmos imaging of drgs in the hdf-s: a relation between star-formation  and size at z ~ 2.5	we present deep, high angular-resolution hst/nicmos imaging in the hubbledeep field south (hdf-s), focusing on a subset of 14 distant red galaxies(drgs) at z ~ 2.5 galaxies that have been pre-selected to have j-k &gt; 2.3. wefind a clear trend between the rest-frame optical sizes of these sources andtheir luminosity-weighted stellar ages as inferred from their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds). galaxies whose seds are consistent withbeing dusty and actively star forming generally show extended morphologies inthe nicmos images (r_e &gt;~ 2 kpc), while the 5 sources which are not vigorouslyforming stars are extremely compact (r_e &lt;~ 1 kpc). this trend suggests adirect link between the mean ages of the stars and the size and density of thegalaxies and supports the conjecture that early events quench star-formationand leave compact remnants. furthermore, the compact galaxies have stellarsurface mass densities which exceed those of local galaxies by more than anorder of magnitude. the existence of such massive dense galaxies presents aproblem for models of early-type galaxy formation and evolution. larger samplesof drgs and higher spatial resolution imaging will allow us to determine theuniversality of the results presented here for a small sample.

astro-ph;9802066	erratum for: an x-ray cluster at redshift 2.156?	a third possible explanation for the x-ray emission from the z=2.156 radiogalaxy 1138-262 is thermal emission from a very dense, sub-cluster `halo',perhaps associated with the (forming) cd galaxy on a scale &lt; 100 kpc. forinstance, increasing the gas density from 0.01 cm^{-3} to 0.1 cm^{-3} woulddecrease the required hot gas mass by the same factor, and could possiblyalleviate constraints on cosmological structure formation models. the pressurein this gas would be very high (10^{-9} dynes cm^{-2}), comparable to thepressure in the optical line emitting nebulosity and to the minimum pressure inthe radio source, and the cooling time would be short (&lt; fewx10^{8} years).circumstantial evidence for such very dense, hot gas enveloping some high zradio sources has been reviewed by fabian et al. (1986). fabian (1991) suggeststhat in some cases the `inferred pressures are close to the maximum that can beobtained by gas cooling in a potential well of a galaxy' (ie. the cooling time= gravitational free-fall time), and he designates such systems as `maximalcooling flows', with implied cooling flow rates up to 2000 m_solar year^{-1}.high resolution x-ray imaging with axaf should be able to test whether 1138-262has a normal cluster atmosphere, a `maximal cooling flow', or an unusuallyx-ray loud agn.

astro-ph;9803140	a new sample of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum radio sources	the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss) has been used to select a sampleof gigahertz peaked spectrum (gps) radio sources at flux densities one to twoorders of magnitude lower than bright gps sources investigated in earlierstudies. sources with inverted spectra at frequencies above 325 mhz have beenobserved with the wsrt at 1.4 and 5 ghz and with the vla at 8.6 and 15 ghz toselect genuine gps sources. this has resulted in a sample of 47 gps sourceswith peak frequencies ranging from ~500 mhz to &gt;15 ghz, and peak flux densitiesranging from ~40 to ~900 mjy. counts of gps sources in our sample as a functionof flux density have been compared with counts of large scale sources fromwenss scaled to 2 ghz, the typical peak frequency of our gps sources. thecounts can be made similar if the number of large scale sources at 2 ghz isdivided by 250, and their flux densities increase by a factor of 10. on thescenario that all gps sources evolve into large scale radio sources, theseresults show that the lifetime of a typical gps source is ~250 times shorterthan a typical large scale radio source, and that the source luminosity mustdecrease by a factor of ~10 in evolving from gps to large scale radio source.however, we note that the redshift distributions of gps and large scale radiosources are different and that this hampers a direct and straightforwardinterpretation of the source counts. further modeling of radio source evolutioncombined with cosmological evolution of the radio luminosity function for largesources is required.

astro-ph;9809056	hst images and properties of the most distant radio galaxies	we present hubble space telescope images of 11 high redshift radio galaxies(between $z=2.3$ and $z=3.6$). the galaxies were observed with the wfpc2 camerain a broad band filter (f606w or f707w, roughly equivalent to v or r-band), for2 orbits each. we find that on the scale of the hst observations there is awide variety of morphological structures of the hosting galaxies: most objectshave a clumpy, irregular appearance, consisting of a bright nucleus and anumber of smaller components, suggestive of merging systems. some observedstructures could be due (at least partly) to the presence of dust distributedthrough the galaxies. the uv continuum emission is generally elongated andaligned with the axis of the radio sources, however the characteristics of the``alignment effect'' differ from case to case, suggesting that the phenomenoncannot be explained by a single physical mechanism. we compare the propertiesof our radio galaxies with those of the  uv dropout galaxies and conclude that (i) the most massive radio galaxies maywell evolve from an aggregate of uv dropout galaxies and (ii) high redshiftradio galaxies probably evolve into present day brightest cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;9809069	optical and near-infrared imaging of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum  sources	a sample of 47 faint gigahertz peaked spectrum (gps) radio sources selectedfrom the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss, rengelink et al. 1997), hasbeen imaged in the optical and near infrared, resulting in an identificationfraction of 87%. the r-i and r-k colours of the faint optical counterparts areas expected for passively evolving elliptical galaxies, assuming that theyfollow the r band hubble diagram as determined for radio-bright gps galaxies.we have found evidence that the radio spectral properties of the gps quasarsare different from those of gps galaxies: the observed distribution of radiospectral peak frequencies for gps sources optically identified with brightstellar objects (presumably quasars) is shifted compared with gps sourcesidentified with faint or extended optical objects (presumably galaxies), in thesense that a gps quasar is likely to have a higher peak frequency than a gpsgalaxy. this means that the true peak frequency distribution is different forthe gps galaxies and quasars, because the sample selection effects areindependent of optical identification. the correlation between peak frequencyand redshift as has been suggested for bright sources has not been found inthis sample; no correlation exists between r magnitude (and therefore redshift)and peak frequency for the gps galaxies. we therefore believe that the claimedcorrelation is actually caused by the dependence of the peak frequency onoptical host, because the gps galaxies are in general at lower redshifts thanthe quasars. the difference in the peak frequency distributions of the gpsgalaxies and quasars is further evidence against the hypothesis that they forma single class of object.

astro-ph;9810178	the mpc-scale radio source associated with the gps galaxy b1144+352	we present the results of new observations of the enigmatic radio sourceb1144+352 with the wsrt at 1.4 ghz. the wenss and nvss surveys have revealedfaint extended radio structures on mpc-scales. we have investigated theselarge-scale radio components. one of the radio structures has a leading hotspotand we conclude that this structure is a large radio lobe associated with thegps source. the other contains two separate radio sources which are superposedon the sky: a low-power radio source at a similar redshift (z=0.065) to the gpshost galaxy and an extended radio lobe, which we believe is associated with thegps host galaxy. further, the 1.4-ghz flux density of the core has decreased by70 mjy between 1994 and 1997. we have also retrieved and analysed unpublishedarchival rosat hri data of b1144+352. the source has been detected and appearsto be slightly extended in x-rays. the rosat data have not detected a largeextended x-ray halo surrounding the host galaxy, limiting the luminosity of theintra-cluster gas within a radius of 250 kpc to &lt; 2.3 x 10^42 erg/s. b1144+352is the second gps galaxy known to be associated with a mpc-sized radio source,the other being b1245+676. we argue that the observed structures must be theresult of an interrupted central jet-activity, and that as such these sourcesmay well be the progenitors of double-double radio galaxies.

astro-ph;9903226	optical spectroscopy of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum sources	we present spectroscopic observations of a sample of faint gigahertz peakedspectrum (gps) radio sources drawn from the westerbork northern sky survey(wenss). redshifts have been determined for 19 (40%) of the objects. theoptical spectra of the gps sources identified with low redshift galaxies showdeep stellar absorption features. this confirms previous suggestions that theiroptical light is not significantly contaminated by agn-related emission, but isdominated by a population of old (&gt;9 gyr) and metal-rich (&gt;0.2 [fe/h]) stars,justifying the use of these (probably) young radio sources as probes of galaxyevolution. the optical spectra of gps sources identified with quasars areindistinguishable from those of flat spectrum quasars, and clearly differentfrom the spectra of compact steep spectrum (css) quasars. the redshiftdistribution of the gps quasars in our radio-faint sample is comparable to thatof the bright samples presented in the literature, peaking at z ~ 2-3. it isunlikely that a significant population of low redshift gps quasars is misseddue to selection effects in our sample. we therefore claim that there is agenuine difference between the redshift distributions of gps galaxies andquasars, which, because it is present in both the radio-faint and brightsamples, can not be due to a redshift-luminosity degeneracy. it is thereforeunlikely that the gps quasars and galaxies are unified by orientation, unlessthe quasar opening angle is a strong function of redshift. we suggest that thegps quasars and galaxies are unrelated populations and just happen to haveidentical observed radio-spectral properties, and hypothesise that gps quasarsare a sub-class of flat spectrum quasars.

astro-ph;9908286	co(4-3) and dust emission in two powerful high-z radio galaxies, and co  lines at high redshifts	we report the detection of sub-mm emission from dust at 850 microns and ofthe 12co j=4-3 line in the two distant powerful radio galaxies 4c 60.07(z=3.79) and 6c 1909+722 (z=3.53). in the case of 4c 60.07 the dust emission isalso detected at 1.25 mm. the estimated molecular gas masses are large, of theorder of ~(0.5-1)x10^{11} solar. the large fir luminosities (l_fir ~ 10^{13}solar) suggest that we are witnessing two major starburst phenomena, while theobserved large velocity widths (fwhm &gt; 500 km/sec) are characteristic ofmergers. in the case of 4c 60.07 the co emission extends over ~30 kpc and spansa velocity range of &gt;1000 km/sec. it consists of two distinct features withfwhm of &gt;= 550 km/sec and ~150 km/sec and line centers separated by &gt;=700km/sec the least massive of these components is probably very gas-rich withpotentially &gt;=60% of its dynamical mass in the form of molecular gas. theextraordinary morphology of the co emission in this object suggests that it isnot just a scaled-up version of a local ultra luminous infrared galaxy, and itmay be a formative stage of the elliptical host of the residing radio-loud agn.  finally we briefly explore the effects of the wide range of gas excitationconditions expected for starburst environments on the luminosity of high-j colines. we conclude that in unlensed objects, co (j+1--&gt;j), j+1&gt;3 lines can besignificantly weak with respect to co j=1-0 and this can hinder their detectioneven in the presence of substantial molecular gas masses.

astro-ph;9912141	radio galaxies with a `double-double' morphology: i - analysis of the  radio properties and evidence for interrupted activity in active galactic  nuclei	we present four mpc-sized radio galaxies which consist of a pair ofdouble-lobed radio sources, aligned along the same axis, and with a coincidingradio core. we have called these peculiar radio sources `double-double' radiogalaxies (ddrg) and propose a general definition of such sources: a`double-double' radio galaxy consists of a pair of double radio sources with acommon centre. furthermore, the two lobes of the inner radio source must have aclearly extended, edge-brightened radio morphology. adopting this definition wefind several other candidate ddrgs in the literature. we find that in allsources the smaller (inner) pair of radio lobes is less luminous than thelarger (outer) pair, and that the ratio of 1.4-ghz flux density of these twopairs appears to be anti-correlated with the projected linear size of the innersource. also, the outer radio structures are large, exceeding 700 kpc. wediscuss possible formation scenarios of the ddrgs, and we conclude that aninterruption of the jet-forming central activity is the most likely mechanism.for one of our sources (b 1834+620) we have been able to observationallyconstrain the length of time of the interruption to a few myr. we discussseveral scenarios for the cause of the interruption and suggest multipleencounters between interacting galaxies as a possibility. finally, we discusswhether such interruptions help the formation of extremely large radio sources.

astro-ph;9912142	radio galaxies with a `double-double' morphology: ii - the evolution of  double-double radio galaxies and implications for the alignment effect in  frii sources	a double-double radio galaxy (ddrg) is defined as consisting of a pair ofdouble radio sources with a common centre. in this paper we present ananalytical model in which the peculiar radio structure of ddrgs is caused by aninterruption of the jet flow in the central agn. the new jets emerging from therestarted agn give rise to an inner source structure within the region of theold, outer cocoon. standard models of the evolution of frii sources predict gasdensities within the region of the old cocoon that are insufficient to explainthe observed properties of the inner source structure. therefore, additionalmaterial must have passed from the environment of the source through the bowshock surrounding the outer source structure into the cocoon. we propose thatthis material is warm clouds ($\sim\!10^4$ k) of gas embedded in the hot igmwhich are eventually dispersed over the cocoon volume by surface instabilitiesinduced by the passage of cocoon material. the derived lower limits for thevolume filling factors of these clouds are in good agreement with resultsobtained from optical observations. the long time scales for the dispersion ofthe clouds ($\sim\!10^7$ yr) are consistent with the apparently exclusiveoccurrence of the ddrg phenomenon in large ($\ga 700$ kpc) radio sources andwith the observed correlation of the strength of the optical/uv alignmenteffect in $z\!\sim\!1$ frii sources with their linear size.

astro-ph;9912143	the radio source b 1834+620: a double-double radio galaxy with  interesting properties	we present a study of the peculiar radio galaxy b 1834+620. it ischaracterised by the presence of a 420-kpc large edge-brightened radio sourcewhich is situated within, and well aligned with, a larger (1.66 mpc) radiosource. both sources apparently originate in the same host galaxy, which has ar_s-magnitude of 19.7 and a redshift of 0.5194, as determined from the strongemission-lines in the spectrum. we have determined the rotation measurestowards this source, as well as the radio spectral energy distribution of itscomponents. the radio spectrum of the large outer source is steeper than thatof the smaller inner source. the radio core has a spectrum that peaks at afrequency of a few ghz. the rotation measures towards the four main componentsare quite similar, within $\sim\!2$ rad m$^{-2}$ of 58 rad m$^{-2}$. they areprobably largely galactic in origin. we have used the presence of a brighthotspot in the northern outer lobe to constrain the advance velocity of theinner radio lobes to the range between 0.19c and 0.29c, depending on theorientation of the source. this corresponds to an age of this structure in therange between 2.6 and 5.8 myr. we estimate a density of the ambient medium ofthe inner lobes of $\la 1.6 \times 10^{-30}$ gr\,cm$^{-3}$ (particle density$\la 8 \times 10^{-7}$ cm$^{-3}$). a low ambient density is further supportedby the discrepancy between the large optical emission-line luminosity of thehost galaxy and the relatively low radio power of the inner lobes.
