0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0903.3415	galaxy zoo: a sample of blue early-type galaxies at low redshift	we report the discovery of a population of nearby, blue early-type galaxieswith high star formation rates (0.5 &lt; sfr &lt; 50 msun/yr). they are identified bytheir visual morphology as provided by galaxy zoo for sdss dr6 and their u-rcolour. we select a volume-limited sample in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt;0.05, corresponding to luminosities of approximately l* and above, and with u-rcolours significantly bluer than the red sequence. we confirm the early-typemorphology of the objects in this sample and investigate their environmentaldependence and star formation properties. blue early-type galaxies tend to livein lower-density environments than `normal' red sequence early-types and makeup 5.7 +/-0.4% of the low-redshift early-type galaxy population. we find thatsuch blue early-type galaxies are virtually absent at high velocity dispersionsabove 200 km/s. our analysis uses emission line diganostic diagrams and we findthat ~25% of them are actively starforming, while another ~25% host both starformation and an agn. another ~12% are agn. the remaining 38% show no strongemission lines. when present and uncontaminated by an agn contribution, thestar formation is generally intense. we consider star formation rates derivedfrom halpha, u-band and infrared luminosities, and radial colour profiles, andconclude that the star formation is spatially extended. of those objects thatare not currently undergoing star formation must have ceased doing so recentlyin order to account for their blue optical colours. the gas phase metallicityof the actively starforming blue early-types galaxies is supersolar in allcases. we discuss the place of these objects in the context of galaxyformation. a catalogue of all 204 blue early-type galaxies in our sample,including star formation rates and emission line classification, is provided.

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1002.3424	demography of sdss early-type galaxies from the perspective of radial  color gradients	we have investigated the radial g-r color gradients of early-type galaxies inthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr6 in the redshift range 0.00&lt;z&lt;0.06. themajority of massive early-type galaxies show a negative color gradient(red-cored) as generally expected for early-type galaxies. on the other hand,roughly 30 per cent of the galaxies in this sample show a positive colorgradient (blue-cored). these "blue-cored" galaxies often show strong h betaabsorption line strengths and/or emission line ratios that are indicative ofthe presence of young stellar populations. combining the optical data withgalaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv photometry, we find that all blue-coredgalaxies show uv-optical colors that can only be explained by young stellarpopulations. this implies that most of the residual star formation inearly-type galaxies is centrally concentrated. blue-cored galaxies arepredominantly low velocity dispersion systems. a simple model shows that theobserved positive color gradients (blue-cored) are visible only for a billionyears after a star formation episode for the typical strength of recent starformation. the observed effective radius decreases and the mean surfacebrightness increases due to this centrally-concentrated star formation episode.as a result, the majority of blue-cored galaxies may lie on different regionsin the fundamental plane from red-cored ellipticals. however, the position ofthe blue-cored galaxies on the fundamental plane cannot be solely attributed torecent star formation but require substantially lower velocity dispersion. weconclude that a low-level of residual star formation persists at the centers ofmost of low-mass early-type galaxies, whereas massive ones are mostly quiescentsystems with metallicity-driven red cores.

0708.2631	intrinsic axis ratio distribution of early-type galaxies from sloan  digital sky survey	using sloan digital sky survey data release 5, we have investigated theintrinsic axis ratio distribution (ard) for early-type galaxies. we haveconstructed a volume-limited sample of 3,922 visually-inspected early-typegalaxies at $0.05 \leq z \leq 0.06$ carefully considering sampling biasescaused by the galaxy isophotal size and luminosity. we attempt to de-projectthe observed ard into three-dimensional types (oblate, prolate, and triaxial),which are classified in terms of triaxiality. we confirm that no linearcombination of $randomly$-distributed axis ratios of the three types canreproduce the observed ard. however, using gaussian intrinsic distributions, wehave found reasonable fits to the data with preferred mean axis ratios foroblate, prolate, and triaxial (triaxials in two axis ratios), $\mu_o=0.44,\mu_p=0.72, \mu_{t,\beta}=0.92, \mu_{t,\gamma}=0.78$ where the fractions ofoblate, prolate and triaxial types are\textrm{o:p:t}=0.29^{\pm0.09}:0.26^{\pm0.11}:0.45^{\pm0.13}$. we have alsofound that the luminous sample ($-23.3 &lt; m_r \leq -21.2$) tends to have moretriaxials than the less luminous ($-21.2 &lt; m_r &lt;-19.3$) sample does. oblate isrelatively more abundant among the less luminous galaxies. interestingly, thepreferences of axis ratios for triaxial types in the two luminosity classes areremarkably similar. we have not found any significant influence of the localgalaxy number density on ard. we show that the results can be seriouslyaffected by the details in the data selection and type classification scheme.caveats and implications on galaxy formation are discussed.

0709.0300	decoding the spectra of sdss early-type galaxies: new indicators of age  and recent star formation	(abridged) we apply principal component analysis (pca) to a sample ofearly-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) in order to inferdifferences in their star formation histories. out of the first few principalcomponents (pc), we study four which give information about stellar populationsand velocity dispersion. we construct two parameters (eta and zeta) as linearcombinations of pc1 and pc2. we find zeta to be most sensitive to recentepisodes of star formation, and eta to be strongly dependent on the average ageof the stellar populations. the distribution of the eta component of thecomposites appear to be indistinguishable between high and low density regions,whereas the distribution of zeta parameters have a significant skew towardslower values for galaxies in low density regions. this result suggests thatgalaxies in lower density environments are less likely to present weak episodesof recent star formation. in contrast, a significant number of galaxies fromour high density subsample -- which includes clusters (both outer regions andcentres) and groups -- underwent small but detectable recent star formation athigh metallicity, in agreement with recent estimates targeting ellipticalgalaxies in hickson compact groups and in the field (ferreras et al.).

1011.5504	anatomy of a post-starburst minor merger: a multi-wavelength wfc3 study  of ngc 4150	(abridged) we present a spatially-resolved near-uv/optical study of ngc 4150,using the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on board the hubble space telescope.previous studies of this early-type galaxy (etg) indicate that it has a largereservoir of molecular gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (likelyindication of recent merging) and strong, central h_b absorption (indicative ofyoung stars). the core of ngc 4150 shows ubiquitous near-uv emission andremarkable dusty substructure. our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in thenear-uv green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow rangeof near-uv/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby e+a(post-starburst) galaxies. we parametrise the properties of the recent starformation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in thengc 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-uv/optical photometry to stellarmodels. the typical age of the recent star formation (rsf) is around 0.9 gyrs,consistent with the similarity of the near-uv colours to post-starburstsystems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports theproposed merger scenario. the rsf metallicity, representative of themetallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 zsun.assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly fromthe infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phasemetallicity (gpm) of the accreted satellite. comparison to the local mass-gpmrelation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around3x10^8 msun, making ngc 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. a summation of the pixel rsfmass fractions indicates that the rsf contributes about 2-3 percent of thestellar mass. this work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play asignificant role in the evolution of etgs at late epochs.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.3511	early-type host galaxies of type ii and ib supernovae	recent studies find that some early-type galaxies host type ii or ibcsupernovae (sne ii, ibc). this may imply recent star-formation activities inthese sne host galaxies, but a massive star origin of the sne ib so farobserved in early-type galaxies has been questioned because of their intrinsicfaintness and unusually strong ca lines shown in the nebular phase. to addressthe issue, we investigate the properties of early-type sne host galaxies usingthe data with galaxy evolution explore(galex) ultraviolet photometry, and thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) optical data. our sample includes eight sne iiand one peculiar sn ib (sn 2000ds) host galaxies as well as 32 sn ia hostgalaxies. the host galaxy of sn 2005cz, another peculiar sn ib, is alsoanalysed using the galex data and the nasa/ipac extragalactic database (ned)optical data. we find that the nuv-optical colors of sn ii/ib host galaxies aresystematically bluer than those of sn ia host galaxies, and some sn ii/ib hostgalaxies with nuv-r colors markedly bluer than the others exhibit strong radioemission. we perform a stellar population synthesis analysis and find a clearsignature of recent star-formation activities in most of the sn ii/ib hostgalaxies. our results generally support the association of the sne ii/ib hostedin early-type galaxies with core-collapse of massive stars. we briefly discussimplications for the progenitors of the peculiar sne ib 2000ds and 2005cz.

0709.3015	observational evidence for agn feedback in early-type galaxies	a major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is theinclusion of so-called agn feedback. the energy input from an active centralmassive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxiesat later epochs. a major problem is that this process is poorly understood, andcompelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. insearch for signatures of agn feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 from the sdss database.key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterionthrough visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased againstrecent star formation and nuclear activity. the objects with emission (~20 percent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in thecolour-mass diagram. star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, whileearly-types with agn are located considerably closer to and almost on the redsequence. star formation-agn composites are found right between these twoextremes. we further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novelmethod that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-uv to near-ir andstellar absorption indices. we find that in those objects deviating from thered sequence star formation occurred several 100 myr in the past involving 1-10per cent of the total stellar mass. we identify an evolutionary sequence fromstar formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. this transition processlasts about 1 gyr, and the peak agn phase occurs roughly half a gyr after thestarburst. the most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressedby nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.

1107.0005	the uv upturn in elliptical galaxies and environmental effects	it is suspected that the ultraviolet (uv) upturn phenomenon in ellipticalgalaxies and extended horizontal-branch stars in globular clusters have acommon origin. an extremely high abundance of helium (y~0.4) allows for aworking hypothesis, but its origin is unclear. peng &amp; nagai (2009) proposedthat primordial helium sedimentation in dark haloes over cosmic timescales maylead to extreme helium abundances in galaxy cluster centers. in this scenariouv upturn should be restricted to brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) only. thisis a clear and testable prediction. we present tests of this hypothesis usinggalaxy clusters from yoon et al. (2008) that were detected by both the sloandigital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer medium imaging survey.using a new uv classification scheme based on far-uv, near-uv, and opticalphotometry we found only 5% of cluster elliptical galaxies show a uv upturn,while 27% and 68% are classified as "recent star-formation" and "uv-weak"ellipticals, respectively. the data reveal a modest positive dependence of theuv upturn fraction on galaxy velocity dispersion, which is in agreement withthe earlier findings of burstein et al. (1988) and possibly with the heliumsedimentation theory. however, we do not see any dependency on rank orluminosity of galaxies. besides, bcgs do not show any marked difference in uvupturn fraction or strength, which is inconsistent with the prediction. weconclude that the aforementioned helium sedimentation theory and its inferredenvironmental effects are not supported by the available data.

1111.3623	bar effects on central star formation and agn activity	galactic bars are often suspected to be a channel of gas inflow to thegalactic center and trigger central star formation and active galactic nuclei(agn) activity. however, the current status on this issue based on empiricalstudies is unsettling, especially on agn. we investigate this question based onthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7. from the nearby (0.01 &lt; z &lt;0.05) bright (mr &lt; -19) database, we have constructed a sample of 6,658relatively face-on late-type galaxies through visual inspection. we found 36%of them to have a bar. bars are found to be more common in galaxies withearlier morphology. this makes sample selection critical. parameter-basedselections would miss a large fraction of barred galaxies of early morphology.bar effects on star formation or agn are difficult to understand properlybecause multiple factors (bar frequency, stellar mass, black-hole mass, gascontents, etc.) seem to contribute to them in intricate manners. in the hope ofbreaking these degeneracies, we inspect bar effects for fixed galaxyproperties. bar effects on central star formation seem higher in reddergalaxies. bar effects on agn on the other hand are higher in bluer and lessmassive galaxies. these effects seem more pronounced with increasing barlength. we discuss possible implications in terms of gas contents, barstrength, bar evolution, fueling time-scale, and the dynamical role ofsupermassive black hole.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1207.5266	post-merger signatures of red-sequence galaxies in rich abell clusters  at $z\lesssim 0.1$	we have investigated the post-merger signatures of red-sequence galaxies inrich abell clusters at $z \lesssim$ 0.1: a119, a2670, a3330 and a389. deepimages in u', g', r' and medium-resolution galaxy spectra were taken usingmosaic 2 ccd and hydra mos mounted on a blanco 4-m telescope at ctio.post-merger features are identified by visual inspection based on asymmetricdisturbed features, faint structures, discontinuous halo structures, rings anddust lanes. we found that ~ 25% of bright (m_r &lt; -20) cluster red-sequencegalaxies show post-merger signatures in four clusters consistently. most (~71%) of the featured galaxies were found to be bulge-dominated, and for thesubsample of bulge-dominated red-sequence galaxies, the post-merger fractionrises to ~ 38%. we also found that roughly 4% of bulge-dominated red-sequencegalaxies interact (on-going merger). a total of 42% (38% post-merger, 4%on-going merger) of galaxies show merger-related features. compared to a fieldgalaxy study with a similar limiting magnitude (van dokkum 2005), our clusterstudy presents a similar post-merger fraction but a markedly lower on-goingmerger fraction. the merger fraction derived is surprisingly high for the highdensity of our clusters, where the fast internal motions of galaxies arethought to play a negative role in galaxy mergers. the fraction of post-mergerand on-going merger galaxies can be explained as follows. most of thepost-merger galaxies may have carried over their merger features from theirprevious halo environment, whereas interacting galaxies interact in the currentcluster in situ. according to our semi-analytic calculation, massive clusterhaloes may very well have experienced tens of halo mergers over the last 4-5gyr; post-merger features last that long, allowing these features to bedetected in our clusters today.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

0711.4823	the uv-optical color magnitude diagram ii: physical properties and  morphological evolution on and off of a star-forming sequence	we use the uv-optical color magnitude diagram in combination withspectroscopic and photometric measurements derived from the sdss spectroscopicsample to measure the distribution of galaxies in the local universe (z&lt;0.25)and their physical properties as a function of specific star formation rate(ssfr) and stellar mass. throughout this study our emphasis is on theproperties of galaxies on and off of a local "star-forming sequence." wediscuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence arerelated to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of differentmorphological types. we find, among other trends that our measure of the starformation rate surface density is nearly constant along this sequence. wediscuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. for thefirst time, we report on measurements of the local uv luminosity functionversus galaxy structural parameters as well as inclination. we also split oursample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i-bandsersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus inssfr vs. stellar mass space while bulge-dominated galaxies display a muchlarger spread of ssfr at fixed stellar mass. a significant fraction of galaxieswith ssfr and sf surface density above those on the "star-forming sequence" arebulge-dominated. we can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether asignificant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode ofstar formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to bequenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate ofthe non-star-forming galaxies on the "red sequence."

1302.1588	on ths assembly history of stellar components in massive galaxies	matsuoka &amp; kawara (2010) showed that the number density of the most massivegalaxies (log m/m_sun=11.5-12.0) increases faster than that of the next massivegroup (log m/m_sun=11.0-11.5) during 0 &lt; z &lt; 1. this appears to be incontradiction to the apparent "downsizing effect". we attempt to understand thetwo observational findings in the context of the hierarchical merger paradigmusing semi-analytic techniques. our models closely reproduce the result ofmatsuoka &amp; kawara (2010). downsizing can also be understood as larger galaxieshave, on average, smaller assembly ages but larger stellar ages. our fiducialmodels further reveal details of the history of the stellar mass growth ofmassive galaxies. the most massive galaxies (log m/m_sun=11.5-12.0 at z=0),which are mostly brightest cluster galaxies, obtain roughly 70% of theirstellar components via merger accretion. the role of merger accretionmonotonically declines with galaxy mass: 40% for log m/m_sun=11.0-11.5 and 20%for log m/m_sun=10.5-11.0 at z=0. the specific accreted stellar mass rates viagalaxy mergers decline very slowly during the whole redshift range, whilespecific star formation rates sharply decrease with time. in the case of themost massive galaxies, merger accretion becomes the most important channel forthe stellar mass growth at z~2. on the other hand, in-situ star formation isalways the dominant channel in l* galaxies.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1307.1472	on the nature of sodium excess objects. i. data and observed trends	several studies have reported the presence of sodium excess objects that haveneutral atomic absorption lines at 5895a (nad) and 8190a that are deeper thanexpected based on stellar population models. van dokkum &amp; conroy proposed thatlow-mass stars are more prevalent in massive early-type galaxies, which maylead to a strong nai8190 line strength. it is, however, necessary to test thisprediction against other prominent line indices in optical wavelengths. wenewly identified roughly a thousand nad excess objects (neos) based on the nadline strength in the redshift range 0.00&lt;z&lt;0.08 from the sdss dr7. the noveltyof this work is that galaxies were carefully identified through direct visualinspection of sdss images, and we systematically compared the properties ofneos and those of a control sample of normal galaxies. note that the majorityof galaxies with high velocity dispersion (&gt;250km/s) show nad excess. mostlate-type neos have strong hb line strengths and significant emission lines.this implies that the presence of ism and/or dust contributes to the increasein nad line strengths observed for these galaxies. in contrast, the majority ofearly-type neos are predominantly luminous and massive systems. however, wefind that models used to reproduce the nai8190 line strengths that adopt abottom-heavy imf are not able to reproduce the observed nad line strengths. bycomparing the observed nad, mgb and fe5270 line strengths with those of themodels, we identify a plausible range of parameters. in these models, themajority of early-type neos are alpha-enhanced ([a/fe]~0.3), metal-rich([z/h]~0.3) and especially na-enhanced ([na/fe]~0.3). enhanced na abundance isa particularly compelling hypothesis for the increase in the strength of thenad line index in our early-type neos that appear devoid of dust, both in theirsdss images and spectra.

1307.3577	sussing merger trees: the merger trees comparison project	merger trees follow the growth and merger of dark-matter haloes over cosmichistory. as well as giving important insights into the growth of cosmicstructure in their own right, they provide an essential backbone tosemi-analytic models of galaxy formation. this paper is the first in a seriesto arise from the sussing merger trees workshop in which ten differenttree-building algorithms were applied to the same set of halo catalogues andtheir results compared. although many of these codes were similar in nature,all algorithms produced distinct results. our main conclusions are that auseful merger-tree code should possess the following features: (i) the use ofparticle ids to match haloes between snapshots; (ii) the ability to skip atleast one, and preferably more, snapshots in order to recover subhaloes thatare temporarily lost during merging; (iii) the ability to cope with (andideally smooth out) large, temporary flucuations in halo mass. finally, toenable different groups to communicate effectively, we defined a commonterminology that we used when discussing merger trees and we encourage othersto adopt the same language. we also specified a minimal output format to recordthe results.

1311.3038	the relationship between radio power at 22 and 43 ghz and black hole  properties of agn in elliptical galaxies	we investigate the relationship between radio power and properties related toactive galactic nuclei (agns). radio power at 1.4 or 5 ghz, which has been usedin many studies, can be affected by synchrotron self-absorption and free-freeabsorption in a dense region. on the other hand, these absorption effects getsmaller at higher frequencies. thus, we performed simultaneous observations at22 and 43 ghz using the korean vlbi network (kvn) radio telescope based on asample of 305 agn candidates residing in elliptical galaxies from the overlapbetween the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 and faint images ofthe radio sky at twenty-centimeters (first). about 37% and 22% of the galaxiesare detected at 22 and 43 ghz, respectively. assuming no flux variabilitybetween the first and kvn observation, spectral indices were derived from firstand kvn data and we found that over 70% of the detected galaxies have flat orinverted spectra, implying the presence of optically thick compact regions nearthe centres of the galaxies. core radio power does not show a clear dependenceon black hole mass at either low (1.4 ghz) or high (22 and 43 ghz) frequencies.however, we found that the luminosity of the [oiii] $\lambda$5007 emission lineand the eddington ratio correlate with radio power more closely at highfrequencies than at low frequencies. this suggests that radio observation athigh frequencies can be an appropriate tool for unveiling the innermost region.in addition, the luminosity of the [oiii] $\lambda$5007 emission line and theeddington ratio can be used as a tracer of agn activity. our study suggests acausal connection between high frequency radio power and optical properties ofagns.

1402.4814	the green valley is a red herring: galaxy zoo reveals two evolutionary  pathways towards quenching of star formation in early- and late-type galaxies	we use sdss+\textit{galex}+galaxy zoo data to study the quenching of starformation in low-redshift galaxies. we show that the green valley between theblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxiesin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through whichmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. rather, an analysis that takesmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blueearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologiesare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.in contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation ratesdecline very slowly. we summarize a range of observations that lead to theseconclusions, including uv-optical colours and halo masses, which both show astriking dependence on morphological type. we interpret these results in termsof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. we conclude thatlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply ofgas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustionof the remaining gas over several gyr, driven by secular and/or environmentalprocesses. in contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gassupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapidquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.this gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, andmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly agnfeedback.

1405.1807	on the lifetime of merger features of equal-mass disk mergers	detecting post-merger features of merger remnants is highly dependent on thedepth of observation images. however, it has been poorly discussed how long thepost-merger features are visible under different observational conditions. weinvestigate a merger-feature time useful for understanding the morphologicaltransformation of galaxy mergers via numerical simulations. we usen-body/hydrodynamic simulations, including gas cooling, star formation, andsupernova feedback. we run a set of simulations with various initial orbitalconfigurations and with progenitor galaxies having different morphologicalproperties mainly for equal-mass mergers. as reference models, we ranadditional simulations for non-equal mass mergers and mergers in a large halopotential. mock images using the sdss $r$ band are synthesized to estimate amerger-feature times and compare it between the merger simulations. the mockimages suggest that the post-merger features involve a small fraction of stars,and the merger-feature time depends on galaxy interactions. in an isolatedenvironment, the merger-feature time is, on average, $\sim$ 2 times the finalcoalescence time for a shallow surface bright limit of 25 mag/arcsec^2. for adeeper surface brightness limit of 28 mag/arcsec^2, however, the merger-featuretime is a factor of two longer, which is why the detection of post-mergerfeatures using shallow surveys has been difficult. tidal force of a clusterpotential is effective in stripping post-merger features out and reduces themerger-feature time.

1409.0860	effects of large-scale environment on the assembly history of central  galaxies	we examine whether large-scale environment affects the mass assembly historyof their central galaxies. to facilitate this, we constructed dark matter halomerger trees from a cosmological n-body simulation and calculated the formationand evolution of galaxies using a semi-analytic method. we confirm earlierresults that smaller halos show a notable difference in formation time with amild dependence on large-scale environment. however, using a semi-analyticmodel, we found that on average the growth rate of the stellar mass of centralgalaxies is largely insensitive to large-scale environment. although ourresults show that the star formation rate (sfr) and the stellar mass of centralgalaxies in smaller halos are slightly affected by the assembly bias of halos,those galaxies are faint, and the difference in the sfr is minute, andtherefore it is challenging to detect it in real galaxies given the currentobservational accuracy. future galaxy surveys, such as the bigboss experimentand the large synoptic survey telescope, which are expected to provideobservational data for fainter objects, will provide a chance to test our modelpredictions.

1410.1241	sussing merger trees : the impact of halo merger trees on galaxy  properties in a semi-analytic model	a halo merger tree forms the essential backbone of a semi-analytic model forgalaxy formation and evolution. recent studies have pointed out that extractingmerger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial;different tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. thesedifferences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used asinput for models of galaxy formation. we investigate the impact of differenthalo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. we find that the z=0 galaxyproperties in our model show differences between trees when using a commonparameter set. the star formation history of the universe and the properties ofsatellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with differentconstruction methods. independently calibrating the semi-analytic model foreach tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z=0 global galaxyproperties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionaryhistories of galaxies. furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary,resulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differingby factors of 2. such a change alters the regimes where star formation isprimarily suppressed by supernovae. therefore, halo merger trees extracted froma common halo catalogue using different, but reliable, algorithms can result ina difference in the semi-analytic model. given the uncertainties in galaxyformation physics, however, these differences may not necessarily be viewed assignificant.

1411.5689	on the importance of using appropriate spectral models to derive  physical properties of galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.8	interpreting observations of distant galaxies in terms of constraints onphysical parameters - such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (sfr) and dustoptical depth - requires spectral synthesis modelling. we analyse thereliability of these physical parameters as determined under commonly adopted`classical' assumptions: star-formation histories assumed to be exponentiallydeclining functions of time, a simple dust law and no emission-linecontribution. improved modelling techniques and data quality now allow us touse a more sophisticated approach, including realistic star-formationhistories, combined with modern prescriptions for dust attenuation and nebularemission (pacifici et al. 2012). we present a bayesian analysis of the spectraand multi-wavelength photometry of 1048 galaxies from the 3d-hst survey in theredshift range 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.8 and in the stellar mass range 9&lt;log(m/mo)&lt;12. we findthat, using the classical spectral library, stellar masses are systematicallyoverestimated (~0.1 dex) and sfrs are systematically underestimated (~0.6 dex)relative to our more sophisticated approach. we also find that the simultaneousfit of photometric fluxes and emission-line equivalent widths helps break adegeneracy between sfr and optical depth of the dust, reducing theuncertainties on these parameters. finally, we show how the biases of classicalapproaches can affect the correlation between stellar mass and sfr forstar-forming galaxies (the `star-formation main sequence'). we conclude thatthe normalization, slope and scatter of this relation strongly depend on theadopted approach and demonstrate that the classical, oversimplified approachcannot recover the true distribution of stellar mass and sfr.

astro-ph;0208175	the yy isochrones for alpha-element enhanced mixtures	we present a new set of isochrones in which the effect of the alpha-elementenhancement is fully incorporated. these isochrones are an extension of thealready published set of yy isochrones (yi et al. 2001: paper 1), constructedfor the scaled-solar mixture. as in paper 1, helium diffusion and convectivecore overshoot have been taken into account.the range of chemical compositionscovered is 0.00001 &lt; z &lt; 0.08. the models were evolved from thepre-main-sequence stellar birthline to the onset of helium burning in the core.the age range of the full isochrone set is 0.1 -- 20 gyr, while youngerisochrones of age 1 -- 80 myr are also presented up to the main-sequenceturn-off. combining this set with that of paper 1 for scaled-solar mixtureisochrones, we provide a consistent set of isochrones which can be used toinvestigate populations of any value of alpha-enhancement. we confirm theearlier results of paper 1 that inclusion of alpha-enhancement effects furtherreduces the age estimates of globular clusters by approximately 8 percent if[alpha/fe]=+0.3. it is important to note the metallicity dependence of thechange in age estimates (larger age reductions in lower metallicities). thisreduces the age gap between the oldest metal-rich and metal-poor galacticstellar populations and between the halo and the disk populations. theisochrone tables, together with interpolation routines have been made availablevia internet; http://www.astro.yale.edu/demarque/yyiso.htmlhttp://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~yi/yyiso.htmlhttp://csaweb.yonsei.ac.kr/~kim/yyiso.html

astro-ph;0401126	the elliptical colour-magnitude relation as a discriminant between the  monolithic and merger paradigms: the importance of progenitor bias	the colour-magnitude relation (cmr) of cluster ellipticals has been widelyused to constrain their star formation histories (sfhs) and to discriminatebetween the monolithic and merger paradigms of elliptical galaxy formation. weinvestigate the elliptical cmr predicted in the merger paradigm by using a lcdmhierarchical merger model. we first highlight sections of the literature whichindicate that the traditional use of fixed apertures to derive colours gives adistorted view of the cmr due to the presence of colour gradients in galaxies.fixed aperture observations make the cmr steeper and tighter than it really is.we then show that the star formation history (sfh) of cluster ellipticalspredicted by the model is quasi-monolithic, with over 95 percent of the totalstellar mass formed before a redshift of 1. the quasi-monolithic sfh produces apredicted cmr that agrees well at all redshifts with its observed counterpartonce the fixed aperture effect is removed. more importantly, we presentarguments to show that the elliptical-only cmr can be used to constrain thesfhs of present-day cluster ellipticals only if we believe a priori in themonolithic collapse model. it is not a meaningful tool for constraining the sfhin the merger paradigm, because a progressively larger fraction of theprogenitor set of present-day cluster ellipticals is contained in late-typestar forming systems at higher redshift, which cannot be ignored when derivingthe sfhs. hence, the elliptical-only cmr is not a useful discriminant betweenthe two competing theories of elliptical galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0501500	super helium-rich population and the origin of extreme horizontal-branch  stars in globular clusters	recent observations for the color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of the massiveglobular cluster omega centauri have shown that it has a striking double mainsequence (ms), with a minority population of bluer and fainter ms wellseparated from a majority population of ms stars. here we confirm, with themost up-to-date y2 isochrones, that this special feature can only be reproducedby assuming a large variation (delta y = 0.15) of primordial helium abundanceamong several distinct populations in this cluster. we further show that thesame helium enhancement required for this special feature on the ms can byitself reproduce the extreme horizontal-branch (hb) stars observed in omegacen, which are hotter than normal hb stars. similarly, the complex features onthe hbs of other globular clusters, such as ngc 2808, are explained by largeinternal variations of helium abundance. supporting evidence for thehelium-rich population is also provided by the far-uv (fuv) observations ofextreme hb stars in these clusters, where the enhancement of helium cannaturally explain the observed fainter fuv luminosity for these stars. thepresence of super helium-rich populations in some globular clusters suggeststhat the third parameter, other than metallicity and age, also influences cmdmorphology of these clusters.

0809.1096	destruction of molecular gas reservoirs in early-type galaxies by active  galactic nucleus feedback	residual star formation at late times in early-type galaxies and theirprogenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red,passively evolving systems we see today. likewise, residual or newly accretedreservoirs of molecular gas that are fuelling star formation must be destroyed.this suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonlyattributed to agn feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelledduring a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. however,direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of thismolecular gas and an agn phase has been missing so far. we present newmm-wavelength observations from the iram 30m telescope of a sample of lowredshift sdss early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process ofquenching of late-time star formation. our observations show that thedisappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 myr with theonset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to starformation alone. since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerfulquasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity agn episodes aresufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. this`suppression mode' of agn feedback is very different from the `truncation mode'linked to powerful quasar activity during early phases of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0603458	uv upturn in elliptical galaxies: theory	the uv upturn is the rising flux with decreasing wavelength between the lymanlimit and 2500\aa found virtually in all bright spheroidal galaxies. it hasbeen a mystery ever since it was first detected by the oao-2 space telescope(code &amp; welch 1979) because such old metal-rich populations were not expectedto contain any substantial number of hot stars. it was confirmed by followingspace missions, ans (de boer 1982), iue (bertola et al. 1982) and hut (brown etal. 1997). the positive correlation between the uv-to-optical colour (i.e., thestrength of the uv upturn) and the mg2 line strength found by burstein et al.(1987) through iue observations has urged theorists to construct novelscenarios in which metal-rich ($\gtrsim z_{\odot}$) old ($\gtrsim$ a few gyr)stars become uv bright (greggio &amp; renzini 1990; horch et al. 1992). alsointeresting was to find using hut that, regardless of the uv strength, the uvspectral slopes at 1000--2000\aa in the six uv bright galaxies were nearlyidentical suggesting a very small range of temperatures of the uv sources inthese galaxies (brown et al. 1997), which corresponds to $t_{\rm eff} \approx20,000 \pm 3,000$ k. this, together with other evidence, effectively ruled outyoung stars as the main driver of the uv upturn. a good review on theobservational side of the story is given in the next article by tom brown, aswell as in the recent articles of greggio &amp; renzini (1999) and o'connell(1999).

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0611193	first stars as a possible origin for the helium-rich population in omega  centauri	the most massive galactic globular cluster omega cen appears to have two, orperhaps more, distinct main sequences. its bluest main sequence is at thecentre of debate because it has been suggested to have an extremely high heliumabundance of y ~ 0.4. the same helium abundance is claimed to explain thepresence of extreme horizontal branch stars of omega cen as well. this demandsa relative helium to metal enrichment of deltay/deltaz ~ 70; that is, more thanone order of magnitude larger than the generally accepted value. candidatesolutions, namely, agb stars, massive stars, and supernovae, have beensuggested; but in this study, we show that none of them is a viable channel, interms of reproducing the high value of deltay/deltaz for the constrained agedifference between the red and blue populations. essentially no populationswith an ordinary initial mass function, including those candidates, can producesuch a high deltay/deltaz because they all produce metals as well as helium. asan alternative, we investigate the possibility of the stochastic ``first star''contamination to the gas from which the younger generation of omega cen formed.this requires the assumption that population iii star formation episodeoverlaps with that of population ii. while the required condition appearsextreme, very massive objects in the first star generation provide a solutionthat is at least as plausible as any other suggestions made before.

astro-ph;0612203	galex ultraviolet photometry of globular clusters in m31: three year  results and a catalog	we present ultraviolet (uv) photometry of m31 globular clusters (gcs) foundin 23 galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images covering the entirety of m31. wedetect 485 and 273 gcs (and gc candidates) in the near-ultraviolet (nuv; 2267a) and far-ultraviolet (fuv; 1516 a), respectively. comparing m31 data withthose of galactic gcs in the uv with the aid of population models, we find thatthe age ranges of old gcs in m31 and the galactic halo are similar. threemetal-rich ([fe/h]&gt;-1) gcs in m31 produce significant fuv flux making theirfuv-v colors unusually blue for their metallicities. these are thought to beanalogs of the two peculiar galactic gcs ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 with extendedblue hb stars. based on the models incorporating helium enriched subpopulationsin addition to the majority of the population that have a normal heliumabundance, we suggest that even small fraction of super-helium-richsubpopulations in gcs can reproduce the observed uv bright metal-rich gcs.young clusters in m31 show distinct uv and optical properties from gcs in milkyway. population models indicate that their typical age is less than ~ 2 gyrs. alarge fraction of young gcs have the kinematics of the thin, rapidly rotatingdisk component. however, a subset of the old gcs also shares the thin-diskkinematics of the younger clusters. the existence of young gcs on the outskirtsof m31 disk suggests the occurrence of a significant recent star formation inthe thin-disk of m31. old thin-disk gcs may set constraints on the epoch ofearly formation of the m31 thin-disk. we detect 12 (10) intermediate-age gccandidates in nuv (fuv). we suggest that some of spectroscopically identifiedintermediate-age gcs may not be truly intermediate in age, but rather older gcsthat possess developed hb.

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

astro-ph;0703503	the look-back time evolution of far-ultraviolet flux from the brightest  cluster elliptical galaxies at z &lt; 0.2	we present the galex uv photometry of the elliptical galaxies in abellclusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) for the study of the look-back timeevolution of the uv upturn phenomenon. the brightest elliptical galaxies (m_r &lt;-22) in 12 remote clusters are compared with the nearby giant ellipticalgalaxies of comparable optical luminosity in the fornax and virgo clusters. thesample galaxies presented here appear to be quiescent without signs of massivestar formation or strong nuclear activity, and show smooth, extended profilesin their uv images indicating that the far-uv (fuv) light is mostly produced byhot stars in the underlying old stellar population. compared to theircounterparts in nearby clusters, the fuv flux of cluster giant ellipticalgalaxies at moderate redshifts fades rapidly with ~ 2 gyrs of look-back time,and the observed pace in fuv - v color evolution agrees reasonably well withthe prediction from the population synthesis models where the dominant fuvsource is hot horizontal-branch stars and their progeny. a similar amount ofcolor spread (~ 1 mag) in fuv - v exists among the brightest cluster ellipticalgalaxies at z ~ 0.1, as observed among the nearby giant elliptical galaxies ofcomparable optical luminosity.

0810.2794	the correlation of star formation quenching with internal galaxy  properties and environment	we investigate the correlation of star formation quenching with internalgalaxy properties and large scale environment (halo mass) in empirical data andtheoretical models. we make use of the halo-based group catalog of yang andcollaborators, which is based on the sloan digital sky survey. data from thegalaxy evolution explorer (galex) are also used to extract the recent starformation rate. in order to investigate the environmental effects, we examinethe properties of "central" and "satellite" galaxies separately. for centralgalaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching isprimarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these twoquantities are themselves strongly correlated. for satellite galaxies, a nearlyequally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. we make thesame comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on threeindependently developed codes. we find that the models with agn feedbackreproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red andpassive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. however, for satellitegalaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passivegalaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halomass. this {\em satellite overquenching problem} is caused by the too-rapidstripping of the satellites' hot gas halos, which leads to rapid strangulationof star formation.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
