0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0903.4175	supernova feedback efficiency and mass loading in the starburst and  galactic superwind exemplar m82	we measure the net energy efficiency of supernova and stellar wind feedbackin the starburst galaxy m82 and the degree of mass-loading of the hot gaspiston driving its superwind by comparing a large suite of 1 and 2-dimensionalhydrodynamical models to a set of observational constraints derived from hardx-ray observations of the starburst region (the fluxes of the he-alpha andly-alpha-like lines of s, ar, ca and fe, along with the total diffuse e=2--8kev x-ray luminosity). these are the first direct measurements of the feedbackefficiency and mass-loading of supernova heated and enriched plasma in astarburst galaxy. all the models that satisfy the existing observationalconstraints have medium to high thermalization efficiencies (30% &lt;= epsilon &lt;=100$%) and the volume-filling wind fluid that flows out of the starburst regionis only mildly centrally mass loaded (1.0 &lt;= beta &lt;= 2.8). these results implya temperature of the plasma within the starburst region in the range 30--80million kelvin, a mass flow rate of the wind fluid out of the starburst regionof mdot_tot ~ 1.4--3.6 msol/yr and a terminal velocity of the wind in the rangev_infinity = 1410--2240 km/s. this velocity is considerably larger than theescape velocity from m82 (v_esc &lt;~ 460 km/s) and the velocity of the h-alphaemitting clumps and filaments within m82's wind (v_h-alpha ~ 600 km/s). drawingon these results we provide a prescription for implementing starburst-drivensuperwinds in cosmological models of galaxy formation and evolution.

0706.3424	keck/deimos spectroscopy of a galex uv selecte sample from the medium  imaging survey	we report results from a pilot program to obtain spectroscopy for objectsdetected in the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium imaging survey (mis).our study examines the properties of galaxies detected by galex fainter thanthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic survey. this is the firststudy to extend the techinques of salim et al. 2005 to estimate stellar masses,star formation rates (sfr) and the b (star formation history) parameter forstar-forming galaxies out to z~0.7. we obtain redshifts for 50 galex missources reaching nuv=23.9 (ab mag), having counterparts in the sdss datarelease 4 (dr4). of our sample, 43 are starforming galaxies with z&lt;0.7, 3 haveemission line ratios indicative of agn with z&lt;0.7, and 4 objects with z~1 areqsos, 3 of which are not previously cataloged. we compare our sample to a muchlarger sample of ~50,000 matched galex/sdss galaxies with sdss spectroscopy;while our survey is shallow, the optical counterparts to our sources reach ~3magnitudes fainter in sdss r magnitude than the sdss spectroscopic sample. weuse emission line diagnostics for the galaxies to determine that the samplecontains mostly star-forming galaxies. the galaxies in the sample populate theblue sequence in the nuv-r vs m_r color-magnitude diagram. our sample has sfrs,luminosities, and velocity dispersions that are similar to the samples of faintcompact blue galaxies studied previously in the same redshift range by koo et.al 1995, guzman et. al 1996 &amp; phillips et. al 1997. however, our sample is ~2mag fainter in surface brightness than the compact blue galaxies. we find thatthe star-formation histories for a majority of the galaxies are consistent witha recent starburst within the last 100 myr.

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0909.2279	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in galaxies at z~0.1: the effect of  star formation and agn	we present the analysis of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) spectraof a sample of 92 typical star forming galaxies at 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 observed withthe spitzer irs. we compare the relative strengths of pah emission featureswith sdss optical diagnostics to probe the relationship between pah grainproperties and star formation and agn activity. short-to-long wavelength pahratios, and in particular the 7.7-to-11.3 micron feature ratio, are stronglycorrelated with the star formation diagnostics d_n(4000) and h-alpha equivalentwidth, increasing with younger stellar populations. this ratio also shows asignificant difference between active and non-active galaxies, with the activegalaxies exhibiting weaker 7.7 micron emission. a hard radiation field asmeasured by [oiii]/h-beta and [neiii]_15.6/[neii]_12.8 affects pah ratiosdifferently depending on whether this field results from starburst activity oran agn. our results are consistent with a picture in which larger pah moleculesgrow more efficiently in richer media and in which smaller pah molecules arepreferentially destroyed by agn.

0909.3044	xmm-newton observations of a complete sample of optically selected type  2 seyfert galaxies	(abridged)the majority of active galactic nuclei (agn) suffer fromsignificant obscuration by surrounding dust and gas. x-ray surveys in the 2-10kev band will miss the most heavily-obscured agn in which the absorbing columndensity exceeds $\sim10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ (the compton-thick agn). it is thereforevital to know the fraction of agn that are missed in such x-rays surveys and todetermine if these agn represent some distinct population in terms of thefundamental properties of agn and/or their host galaxies. in this paper wepresent the analysis of \textit{xmm-newton} x-ray data for a complete sample of17 low-redshift type 2 seyfert galaxies chosen from the sloan digital skysurvey based solely on the high observed flux of the [oiii]$\lambda$5007emission-line. this line is formed in the narrow line region hundreds ofparsecs away from the central engine. thus, unlike the x-ray emission, it isnot affected by obscuration due to the torus surrounding the black hole. ittherefore provides a useful isotropic indicator of the agn luminosity. asadditional indicators of the intrinsic agn luminosity, we use the spitzer spacetelescope to measure the luminosities of the mid-infrared continuum and the[oiv]25.89$\mu$m narrow emission-line. we then use the ratio of the 2-10 kevx-ray luminosity to the [oiii], [oiv], and mid-infrared luminosities to assessthe amount of x-ray obscuration and to distinguish between compton-thick andcompton-thin objects. we find that the majority of the sources suffersignificant amounts of obscuration: the observed 2-10 kev emission is depressedby more than an order-of-magnitude in 11 of the 17 cases (as expected forcompton-thick sources).

0707.1878	the young and the dustless: interpreting radio observations of  ultraviolet luminous galaxies	ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) have been identified as intenselystar-forming, nearby galaxies. a subset of these, the supercompact uvlgs, arebelieved to be local analogs of high redshift lyman break galaxies. here weinvestigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for thefirst time. we have observed 42 supercompact uvlgs with the vla, all of whichhave extensive coverage in the uv/optical by galex and sdss. our analysisincludes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the spitzer first looksurvey and from the sdss-galex matched catalogs. in addition we have spitzermips data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-fircorrelation of normal star-forming galaxies. we find that our galaxies havelower radio-to-uv ratios and lower balmer decrements than other local galaxieswith similar (high) star formation rates. optical spectra show they have lowerdn(4000) and hdeltaa indices, higher hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,and higher [oiii]5007/hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forminggalaxies. comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models weconclude that supercompact uvlgs are distinguished from normal star forminggalaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. moreover,compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, theyhave significantly less dust attenuation. in both regards they are similar tolyman break galaxies. this suggests that the process that causes star formationin the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies, butmay be similar to lyman break galaxies.

0910.3667	clustering of radio galaxies and quasars	we compute the cross-correlation between a sample of 14,000 radio-loud agn(rlagn) with redshifts between 0.4 and 0.8 selected from the sloan digital skysurvey and a reference sample of 1.2 million luminous red galaxies in the sameredshift range. we quantify how the clustering of radio-loud agn depends onhost galaxy mass and on radio luminosity. radio-loud agn are clustered morestrongly on all scales than control samples of radio-quiet galaxies with thesame stellar masses and redshifts, but the differences are largest on scalesless than 1 mpc. in addition, the clustering amplitude of the rlagn variessignificantly with radio luminosity on scales less than 1 mpc. this proves thatthe gaseous environment of a galaxy on the scale of its dark matter halo, playsa key role in determining not only the probability that a galaxy is radio-loudagn, but also the total luminosity of the radio jet. next, we compare theclustering of radio galaxies with that of radio-loud quasars in the sameredshift range. unified models predict that both types of active nuclei shouldcluster in the same way. our data show that most rlagn are clustered morestrongly than radio-loud qsos, even when the agn and qso samples are matched inboth black hole mass and radio luminosity. only the most extreme rlagn andrlqsos in our sample, with radio luminosities in excess of 10^26 w/hz, havesimilar clustering properties. the majority of the strongly evolving rlagnpopulation at z~0.5 are found in different environments to the quasars, andhence must be triggered by a different physical mechanism.

0911.0690	the local hosts of type ia supernovae	we use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from galex,sdss and the rc3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxieshosting 168 well-observed type ia supernovae (sne ia). our data corroboratewell-known features that have been seen in other sn ia samples. specifically,hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower sne ia on average,and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 gyr produce on averagemore faint, fast and fewer bright, slow sne ia than younger hosts. new resultsinclude that in our sample, the faintest and fastest sne ia occur only ingalaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 m_sun, indicating thattheir progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metalrich than the general sn ia population. a low host extinction sub-sample hintsat a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting forlight-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produceless-extincted sne ia on average. this has implications for cosmologicalfitting of sne ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter inthe fitting. converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56ni mass fromthe supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with amodel that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56nimass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.we measure a correlation between 56ni mass and host age in the local universethat is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. thedetails of the age -- 56ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply aluminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 gyr for sn ia hosts, above which theyare less likely to produce sne ia with 56ni masses above ~0.5 m_sun.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

1005.1825	the accretion of gas onto galaxies as traced by their satellites	we have compiled a large sample of isolated central galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey, which do not have a neighbour of comparable brightnesswithin a projected distance of 1 mpc. we use the colours, luminosities andsurface brightnesses of satellite galaxies in the vicinity of these objects toestimate their atomic gas content and to derive the average total mass of higas contained in satellites as a function of projected radius from the primary.recent calibrations of merging timescales from n-body simulations are used toestimate the rate at which this gas will accrete onto the primaries. ourestimated accretion rates fall short of those needed to maintain the observedlevel of star formation in these systems by nearly two orders of magnitude.nevertheless, there are strong correlations between the total mass of gas insatellites and the colours and specific star formation rates of centralgalaxies of all stellar masses. the correlations are much weaker if we considerthe total stellar mass in the satellites, rather than their total gas mass. weask why star formation in the central galaxies should be correlated with gascontained in satellites at projected separations of a mpc or more, well outsidethe virial radius of the dark matter halos of these systems. we suggest thatgas-rich satellites trace an underlying reservoir of ionized gas that isaccreted continuously, and that provides the fuel for ongoing star formation ingalaxies in the local universe.

1006.5447	the galex arecibo sdss survey ii: the star formation efficiency of  massive galaxies	we use measurements of the hi content, stellar mass and star formation ratesin ~190 massive galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun, obtainedfrom the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) described in paper i (catinella etal. 2010) to explore the global scaling relations associated with thebin-averaged ratio of the star formation rate over the hi mass, which we callthe hi-based star formation efficiency (sfe). unlike the mean specific starformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surfacedensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across thesample with a value close to sfe = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gasconsumption timescale of ~3 gyr). specifically, we find little variation in sfewith stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, nuv-r color and concentration.we interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedbackmechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating starformation in massive galaxies. an investigation into the detailed distributionof sfes reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencieswith sfe &gt; 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to adeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate. conversely,we also find a similar fraction of galaxies that appear to be gas-rich fortheir given specific star-formation rate, although these galaxies show both ahigher than average gas fraction and lower than average specific star formationrate. both of these populations are plausible candidates for "transition"galaxies, showing potential for a change (either decrease or increase) in theirspecific star formation rate in the near future. we also find that 36+/-5% ofthe total hi mass density and 47+/-5% of the total sfr density is found ingalaxies with stellar mass greater than 10^10 msun.

1007.0900	indicators of intrinsic agn luminosity: a multi-wavelength approach	we consider five indicators for intrinsic agn luminosity: the luminosities ofthe [oiii]$\lambda$5007 line, the [oiv]25.89$\mu$m line, the mid-infrared (mir)continuum emission by the torus, and the radio and hard x-ray (e $&gt;$ 10kev)continuum emission. we compare these different proxies using two completesamples of low-redshift type 2 agn selected in a homogeneous way based ondifferent indicators: an optically selected [oiii] sample and a mid-infraredselected 12$\mu$m sample. we examine the correlations between all fivedifferent proxies, and find better agreement for the [oiv], mir, and [oiii]luminosities than for the hard x-ray and radio luminosities. next, we comparethe ratios of the fluxes of the different proxies to their values in unobscuredtype 1 agn. the agreement is best for the ratio of the [oiv] and mir fluxes,while the ratios of the hard x-ray to [oiii], [oiv], and mir fluxes aresystematically low by about an order-of-magnitude in the type 2 agn, indicatingthat hard x-ray selected samples do not represent the full type 2 agnpopulation. in a similar spirit, we compare different optical and mirdiagnostics of the relative energetic contributions of agn and star formationprocesses in our samples of type 2 agn. we find good agreement between thevarious diagnostic parameters, such as the equivalent width of the mirpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features, the ratio of the mir [oiv]/[neii]emission-lines, the spectral index of the mir continuum, and the commonly usedoptical emission-line ratios. finally, we test whether the presence of cold gasassociated with star-formation leads to an enhanced conversion efficiency ofagn ionizing radiation into [oiii] or [oiv] emission. we find that nocompelling evidence exists for this scenario for the luminosities representedin this sample (l$_{bol}$ $\approx$ 10$^{9}$ - 8 $\times$ 10$^{11}$l$_{\sun}$).

1009.4309	alfalfa hi data stacking i. does the bulge quench ongoing star formation  in early-type galaxies?	we have carried out an hi stacking analysis of a volume-limited sample of~5000 galaxies with imaging and spectroscopic data from galex and the sloandigital sky survey, which lie within the current footprint of the arecibolegacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey. our galaxies are selected to have stellarmasses greater than 10^10 msun and redshifts in the range 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05. weextract a sub-sample of 1833 "early-type" galaxies with inclinations less than70deg, with concentration indices c&gt;2.6 and with light profiles that are wellfit by a de vaucouleurs model. we then stack hi line spectra extracted from thealfalfa data cubes at the 3-d positions of the galaxies from these two samplesin bins of stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, central velocitydispersion, and nuv-r colour. we use the stacked spectra to estimate theaverage hi gas fractions m_hi/m_* of the galaxies in each bin.  our main result is that the hi content of a galaxy is not influenced by itsbulge. the average hi gas fractions of galaxies in both our samples correlatemost strongly with nuv-r colour and with stellar surface density. the relationbetween average hi fraction and these two parameters is independent ofconcentration index c. we have tested whether the average hi gas content ofbulge-dominated galaxies on the red sequence, differs from that of late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find no evidence that galaxies with asignificant bulge component are less efficient at turning their available gasreservoirs into stars. this result is in contradiction with the "morphologicalquenching" scenario proposed by martig et al. (2009).

1011.0385	an ultraviolet spectroscopic atlas of local starbursts and star-forming  galaxies: the legacy of fos and ghrs	we present 46 rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) spectra of 28 local starburst andstar-forming galaxies which were observed with the faint object spectrograph(fos) and the goddard high resolution spectrograph (ghrs) of the hubble spacetelescope (hst) at a spectral resolution of a few 100 km/s. we compare the hstspectra with lower resolution international ultraviolet explorer (iue) spectraof the same galaxies and find systematic differences: the bright star clusterstargeted in hst's ~1 arcsec apertures provide about 15% of the starburstluminosity traced by iue's 10 arcsec by 20 arcsec aperture; they are bluer andhave stronger stellar-wind features suggesting that the hst apertures havepreferentially been placed on the youngest areas of the burst. in contrast,lines arising from the interstellar medium (ism) show similar equivalent widthsin both the large and small aperture observations, suggesting similar ismproperties from larger to smaller scales. in order to quantify the uv spectralmorphology of star-forming galaxies, we created a set of uv line indicessimilar to the standard optical lick indices. we discuss the relation betweenthe uv spectral morphology and the properties of the galaxy host. we presentour atlas of fos and ghrs spectra both in print and electronically. the dataset is useful as a baseline for comparisons with observations of the rest-frameuv spectra of star-forming galaxies at high redshift.

1011.0829	the galex arecibo sdss survey: iii. evidence for the inside-out  formation of galactic disks	we analyze a sample of galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}m_{\odot}$ and with redshifts in the range $0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05$ for which hi massmeasurements are available from the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) or fromthe arecibo legacy fast alfa survey (alfalfa). at a given value of $m_*$, oursample consists primarily of galaxies that are more hi-rich than average. weconstructed a series of three control samples for comparison with these hi-richgalaxies. as expected, hi-rich galaxies differ strongly from galaxies of samestellar mass that are selected without regard to hi content. the majority ofthese differences are attributable to the fact that galaxies with more gas arebluer and more actively star-forming. in order to identify those galaxyproperties that are causally connected with hi content, we compare resultsderived for the hi sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellarmass, size and nuv-$r$ colour. the only photometric property that is clearlyattributable to increasing hi content, is the colour gradient of the galaxy.galaxies with larger hi fractions have bluer, more actively star-forming outerdisks compared to the inner part of the galaxy. hi-rich galaxies also havelarger $g$-band radii compared to $i$-band radii. our results are consistentwith the "inside-out" picture of disk galaxy formation, which has commonlyserved as a basis for semi-analytic models of the formation of disks in thecontext of cold dark matter cosmologies. the lack of any intrinsic connectionbetween hi fraction and galaxy asymmetry suggests that gas is accreted smoothlyonto the outer disk.

1011.3512	the extreme hosts of extreme supernovae	we use galex ultraviolet (uv) and optical integrated photometry of the hostsof seventeen luminous supernovae (lsne, having peak m_v &lt; -21) and compare themto a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the sdss dr4 spectralcatalog and galex interim release 1.1. we place the lsne hosts on the galaxynuv-r versus m_r color magnitude diagram (cmd) with the larger sample toillustrate how extreme they are. the lsn hosts appear to favor low-densityregions of the galaxy cmd falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward thelow luminosity end. from the uv-optical photometry, we estimate the starformation history of the lsn hosts. the hosts have moderately low starformation rates (sfrs) and low stellar masses (m_*) resulting in high specificstar formation rates (ssfr). compared with the larger sample, the lsn hostsoccupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting ssfr versus m_* in the areahaving higher ssfr and lower m_*. this preference for low m_*, high ssfr hostsimplies the lsne are produced by an effect having to do with their localenvironment. the correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhapswind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents lsne from arising inhigher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. the massive progenitors of the lsne(&gt;100 m_sun), by appearing in low-sfr hosts, are potential tests for theoriesof the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on thesfr.

0709.0730	the star formation and extinction co-evolution of uv-selected galaxies  over 0.05&lt;z&lt;1.2	we use a new stacking technique to obtain mean mid ir and far ir to far uvflux ratios over the rest near-uv/near-ir color-magnitude diagram. we employcombo-17 redshifts and combo-17 optical, galex far and near uv, spitzer iracand mips mid ir photometry. this technique permits us to probe infrared excess(irx), the ratio of far ir to far uv luminosity, and specific star formationrate (ssfr) and their co-evolution over two orders of magnitude of stellar massand redshift 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2. we find that the ssfr and the characteristic mass (m_0)above which the ssfr drops increase with redshift (downsizing). at any givenepoch, irx is an increasing function of mass up to m_0. above this mass irxfalls, suggesting gas exhaustion. in a given mass bin below m_0 irx increaseswith time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. we interpret these trendsusing a simple model with a schmidt-kennicutt law and extinction that tracksgas density and enrichment. we find that the average irx and ssfr follows agalaxy age parameter which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and timesince formation. we conclude that blue sequence galaxies have properties whichshow simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady build-upof heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and theexhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. the irxrepresents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution.

1101.4219	extreme feedback and the epoch of reionization: clues in the local  universe	the source responsible for reionizing the universe at z &gt; 6 remainsuncertain. while an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxiesmay be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of theirionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. attempts tomeasure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lowerredshifts have largely yielded upper limits. in this paper we present new hstcos and archival fuse far-uv spectroscopy of a sample of eleven lyman breakanalogs (lbas), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble thehigh-z lyman break galaxies. we combine these data with sdss optical spectraand spitzer photometry. we also analyze archival fuse observations of fifteentypical uv-bright local starbursts. we find evidence of small covering factorsfor optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. this is based on two independentpieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of thestrongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratioof extinction-corrected h-alpha to uv plus far-ir luminosities. these objectsrepresent three of the four lbas that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),and highly massive (~10^9 mo) dominant central object (dco). these threeobjects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount ofblueshifted ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factorof neutral gas. all four lbas with dcos in our sample show extremely highvelocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s. we show thatthese properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburstthat is exceptionally compact. we speculate that such extreme feedback may berequired to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies.

1102.2539	evidence for black hole growth in local analogs to lyman break galaxies	we have used xmm-newton to observe six lyman break analogs (lbas): members ofthe rare population of local galaxies that have properties that are verysimilar to distant lyman break galaxies. our six targets were specificallyselected because they have optical emission-line properties that areintermediate between starbursts and type 2 (obscured) agn. our new x-ray dataprovide an important diagnostic of the presence of an agn. we find x-rayluminosities of order 10^{42} erg/s and ratios of x-ray to far-ir luminositiesthat are higher than values in pure starburst galaxies by factors ranging from~ 3 to 30. this strongly suggests the presence of an agn in at least some ofthe galaxies. the ratios of the luminosities of the hard (2-10 kev) x-ray to [oiii]\lambda 5007 emission-line are low by about an order-of-magnitude comparedto type 1 agn, but are consistent with the broad range seen in type 2 agn.either the agn hard x-rays are significantly obscured or the [o iii] emissionis dominated by the starburst. we searched for an iron emission line at ~ 6.4kev, which is a key feature of obscured agn, but only detected emission at the~ 2\sigma level. finally, we find that the ratios of the mid-infrared (24\mu m)continuum to [o iii]\lambda 5007 luminosities in these lbas are higher than thevalues for type 2 agn by an average of 0.8 dex. combining all these clues, weconclude that an agn is likely to be present, but that the bolometricluminosity is produced primarily by an intense starburst. if these black holesare radiating at the eddington limit, their masses would lie in the range of10^5 to 10^6 m_{sun}. these objects may offer ideal local laboratories toinvestigate the processes by which black holes grew in the early universe.

1103.1642	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  i. relations between h2, hi, stellar content and structural properties	we are conducting cold gass, a legacy survey for molecular gas in nearbygalaxies. using the iram 30m telescope, we measure the co(1-0) line in a sampleof ~350 nearby (d=100-200 mpc), massive galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10.0). thesample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides anunbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. by combining the iram datawith sdss photometry and spectroscopy, galex imaging and high-quality arecibohi data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars,atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10l* galaxies. in this paper, we present columinosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. theoverall co detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence ofsharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surfacedensity and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurablecold gas component but above which the detection rate of the co line dropssuddenly. the mean molecular gas fraction mh2/m* of the co detections is0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is astrong function of nuv-r colour. through stacking, we set a firm upper limit ofmh2/m*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with nuv-r&gt;5.0. the averagemolecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, withsignificant scatter from one galaxy to the next. the existence of strongdetection thresholds in both the hi and co lines suggests that "quenching"processes have occurred in these systems. intriguingly, atomic gas stronglydominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie abovethese thresholds. this suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still bepossible following the quenching event.

0709.2911	radio jets in galaxies with actively accreting black holes: new insights  from the sdss	the majority of nearby radio-loud agn are found in massive, old ellipticalgalaxies with weak emission lines. at high redshifts,however, most known radioagn have strong emission lines. in this paper, we examine a subset of radio agnwith emission lines selected from the sloan digital sky survey. the probabilityfor a nearby radio agn to have emission lines is a strongly decreasing functionof galaxy mass and an increasing function of radio luminosity above 10^25 w/hz.emission line and radio luminosities are correlated, but with large dispersion.at a given radio power, agn with small black holes have higher [oiii]luminosities (which we interpret as higher accretion rates) than agn with bigblack holes. however, if we scale both radio and emission line luminosities bythe black hole mass, we find a correlation between normalized radio power andaccretion rate in eddington units that is independent of black hole mass. thereis also a clear correlation between normalized radio power and the age of thestellar population in the galaxy. present-day agn with the highest normalizedradio powers are confined to galaxies with small black holes. high-redshift,high radio-luminosity agn could be explained if big black holes were similarlyactive at earlier cosmic epochs. to investigate why only a small fraction ofemission line agn become radio loud, we create matched samples of radio-loudand radio-quiet agn and compare their host galaxy properties and environments.the main difference lies in their environments; our local density estimates area factor 2 larger around the radio-loud agn. we propose a scenario in whichradio-loud agn with emission lines are located in galaxies where accretion ofboth cold and hot gas can occur simultaneously.

1104.0019	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  ii. the non-universality of the molecular gas depletion timescale	we study the relation between molecular gas and star formation in avolume-limited sample of 222 galaxies from the cold gass survey, withmeasurements of the co(1-0) line from the iram 30m telescope. the galaxies areat redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05 and have stellar masses in the range10.0&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;11.5. the iram measurements are complemented by deep arecibohi observations and homogeneous sdss and galex photometry. a reference samplethat includes both uv and far-ir data is used to calibrate our estimates ofstar formation rates from the seven optical/uv bands. the mean molecular gasdepletion timescale, tdep(h2), for all the galaxies in our sample is 1 gyr,however tdep(h2) increases by a factor of 6 from a value of ~0.5 gyr forgalaxies with stellar masses of 10^10 msun to ~3 gyr for galaxies with massesof a few times 10^11 msun. in contrast, the atomic gas depletion timescaleremains contant at a value of around 3 gyr. this implies that in high massgalaxies, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales are comparable, but inlow mass galaxies, molecular gas is being consumed much more quickly thanatomic gas. the strongest dependences of tdep(h2) are on the stellar mass ofthe galaxy (parameterized as log tdep(h2)= (0.36+/-0.07)(log m* -10.70)+(9.03+/-0.99)), and on the specific star formation rate. a singletdep(h2) versus ssfr relation is able to fit both "normal" star-forminggalaxies in our cold gass sample, as well as more extreme starburst galaxies(lirgs and ulirgs), which have tdep(h2) &lt; 10^8 yr. normal galaxies at z=1-2 aredisplaced with respect to the local galaxy population in the tdep(h2) versusssfr plane and have molecular gas depletion times that are a factor of 3-5times longer at a given value of ssfr due to their significantly larger gasfractions.

0709.3304	hst morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs i: evidence for  starbursts triggered by merging	heckman et al. (2005) used the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv imagingsurvey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compactuv-luminous galaxies (uvlgs) that closely resembles high redshift lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). we present hst images in the uv, optical, and ha, andresimulate them at the depth and resolution of the goods/udf fields to showthat the morphologies of uvlgs are also similar to those of lbgs. our sample of8 lbg analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between starformation and lbg morphology. faint tidal features or companions can be seen inall of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are theresult of a merger or interaction. the uv/optical light is dominated byunresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (ssbs). a detailed comparisonwith the galaxies haro 11 and vv 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the ssbsthemselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. the structuralfeatures revealed by the new hst images occur on very small physical scales andare thus not detectable in images of high redshift lbgs, except in a few caseswhere they are magnified by gravitational lensing. we propose, therefore, thatlbgs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 msun) systems, andthat the mergers trigger the formation of ssbs. if galaxies at high redshiftsare dominated by ssbs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function ispredicted to have slope alpha~2. our results are the most direct confirmationto date of models that predict that the main mode of star formation in theearly universe was highly collisional.

1104.4501	the space density of extended ultraviolet (xuv) disks in the local  universe and implications for gas accretion on to galaxies	we present results of the first unbiased search for extended uv (xuv)-diskgalaxies undertaken to determine the space density of such galaxies. our samplecontains 561 local (0.001 &lt; z &lt; 0.05) galaxies that lie in the intersection ofavailable galex deep imaging (exposure time &gt; 1.5 x 10^4 s) and sdss dr7footprints. we explore modifications to the standard classification scheme forour sample that includes both disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies. visualclassification of each galaxy in the sample reveals an xuv-disk frequency of upto 20% for the most nearby portion of our sample. on average over the entiresample (out to z=0.05) the frequency ranges from a hard limit of 4% to 14%. thegalex imaging allows us to detect xuv-disks beyond 100 mpc. the xuv regionsaround xuv-disk galaxies are consistently bluer than the main bodies. we find asurprisingly high frequency of xuv emission around luminous red (nuv-r &gt; 5) andgreen valley (3 &lt; nuv-r &lt; 5) galaxies. the xuv-disk space density in the localuniverse is &gt; 1.5-4.2 x 10^-3 mpc^-3. using the xuv emission as an indicator ofrecent gas accretion, we estimate that the cold gas accretion rate onto thesegalaxies is &gt; 1.7-4.6 x 10^-3 msun mpc^-3 yr^-1. the number of xuv-disks in thegreen valley and the estimated accretion rate onto such galaxies points to theintriguing possibility that 7%-18% of galaxies in this population aretransitioning away from the red sequence.

0710.0589	the lopsidedness of present-day galaxies: results from the sloan digital  sky survey	large-scale asymmetries in the stellar mass distribution in galaxies arebelieved to trace non-equilibrium situations in the luminous and/or dark mattercomponent. these may arise in the aftermath of events like mergers, accretion,and tidal interactions. these events are key in the evolution of galaxies. inthis paper we quantify the large-scale lopsidedness of light distributions in25155 galaxies at z &lt; 0.06 from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4using the m = 1 azimuthal fourier mode. we show that the lopsided distributionof light is primarily due to a corresponding lopsidedness in the stellar massdistribution. observational effects, such as seeing, poisson noise, andinclination, introduce only small errors in lopsidedness for the majority ofthis sample. we find that lopsidedness correlates strongly with other basicgalaxy structural parameters: galaxies with low concentration, stellar mass,and stellar surface mass density tend to be lopsided, while galaxies with highconcentration, mass, and density are not. we find that the strongest and mostfundamental relationship between lopsidedness and the other structuralparameters is with the surface mass density. we also find, in agreement withprevious studies, that lopsidedness tends to increase with radius. both theseresults may be understood as a consequence of several factors. the outerregions of galaxies and low-density galaxies are more susceptible to tidalperturbations, and they also have longer dynamical times (so lopsidedness willlast longer). they are also more likely to be affected by any underlyingasymmetries in the dark matter halo.

1108.4719	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z=0.6: i. a new method for  physical parameter estimation	we use principal component analysis (pca) to estimate stellar masses, meanstellar ages, star formation histories (sfhs), dust extinctions and stellarvelocity dispersions for ~290,000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than$10^{11}msun and redshifts in the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss). we find the fraction of galaxies with active starformation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens abovea stellar mass of 10^{11.5}msun at z~0.6. this is in striking contrast toz~0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declinesmonotonically with stellar mass. at stellar masses of 10^{12}msun, therefore,the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z~0.6 to thepresent-day reaches a factor of ~10. when we stack the spectra of the mostmassive, star-forming galaxies at z~0.6, we find that half of their [oiii]emission is produced by agns. the black holes in these galaxies are accretingon average at ~0.01 the eddington rate. to obtain these results, we use thestellar population synthesis models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) to generate alibrary of model spectra with a broad range of sfhs, metallicities, dustextinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. the pca is run on this library toidentify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range3700-5500a. we demonstrate that linear combinations of these components canrecover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the4000a break strength and hda, with greatly improved s/n. this method is able torecover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellarage, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low s/n bossspectra. we examine the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the inputparameters in our model library and the different stellar population synthesismodels.

1110.4226	the galex arecibo sdss survey. iv. baryonic mass-velocity-size relations  of massive galaxies	we present dynamical scaling relations for a homogeneous and representativesample of ~500 massive galaxies, selected only by stellar mass (&gt;10^10 msun)and redshift (0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05) as part of the ongoing galex arecibo sdss survey.we compare baryonic tully-fisher (btf) and faber-jackson (bfj) relations forthis sample, and investigate how galaxies scatter around the best fits obtainedfor pruned subsets of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated systems. the bfjrelation is significantly less scattered than the btf when the relations areapplied to their maximum samples, and is not affected by the inclinationproblems that plague the btf. disk-dominated, gas-rich galaxies systematicallydeviate from the bfj relation defined by the spheroids. we demonstrate that byapplying a simple correction to the stellar velocity dispersions that dependsonly on the concentration index of the galaxy, we are able to bring disks andspheroids onto the same dynamical relation -- in other words, we obtain ageneralized bfj relation that holds for all the galaxies in our sample,regardless of morphology, inclination or gas content, and has a scatter smallerthan 0.1 dex. we find that disks and spheroids are offset in the stellardispersion-size relation, and that the offset is removed when correcteddispersions are used instead. the generalized bfj relation represents afundamental correlation between the global dark matter and baryonic content ofgalaxies, which is obeyed by all (massive) systems regardless of morphology.[abridged]

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

1208.1584	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z ~ 0.6: ii. the link between  radio agn activity and star formation	we analyze the optical spectra of massive (log m*/msun &gt; 11.4) radio-loudgalaxies at z~0.2 and z~0.6. by comparing stellar population parameters ofthese radio-loud samples with radio-quiet control samples, we investigate howthe presence of a radio-emitting jet relates to the recent star formationhistory of the host galaxy. we also investigate how the emission-lineproperties of the radio galaxies evolve with redshift by stacking theirspectra. our main results are the following. (1) both at low and at highredshift, half as many radio-loud as radio-quiet galaxies have experiencedsignificant star formation in the past gyr. (2) the balmer absorption lineproperties of massive galaxies that have experienced recent star formation showthat star formation occurred as a burst in many of these systems. (3) both theradio and the emission-line luminosity of radio agn evolve significantly withredshift. however, radio galaxies with similar stellar population parameters,have similar emission-line properties both at high- and at low-redshift. theseresults suggest that massive galaxies experience cyclical episodes of gasaccretion, star formation and black hole growth, followed by the production ofa radio jet that shuts down further activity. the behaviour of galaxies withlog m*/msun &gt; 11.4 is the same at z = 0.6 as it is at z = 0.2, except thathigher redshift galaxies experience more star formation and black hole growthand produce more luminous radio jets during each accretion cycle.

0712.0383	interactions, star formation and agn activity	it has long been known that galaxy interactions are associated with enhancedstar formation. in a companion paper, we explored this connection by applying avariety of statistics to sdss data. in particular, we showed that specific starformation rates of galaxies are higher if they have close neighbours. here weapply exactly the same techniques to agn in the survey, showing that closeneighbours are not associated with any similar enhancement of nuclear activity.star formation is enhanced in agn with close neighbours in exactly the same wayas in inactive galaxies, but the accretion rate onto the black hole, asestimated from the extinction-corrected [o iii] luminosity, is not influencedby the presence or absence of companions. previous work has shown that galaxieswith more strongly accreting black holes contain more young stars in theirinner regions. this leads us to conclude that star formation induced by a closecompanion and star formation associated with black hole accretion are distinctevents. these events may be part of the same physical process, for example amerger, provided they are separated in time. in this case, accretion onto theblack hole and its associated star formation would occur only after the twointeracting galaxies have merged. the major caveat in this work is ourassumption that the extinction-corrected [o iii] luminosity is a robustindicator of the bolometric luminosity of the central black hole. it is thusimportant to check our results using indicators of agn activity at otherwavelengths.

1301.5640	spatially resolved star formation histories of nearby galaxies: evidence  for episodic star formation in discs	we use long-slit spectroscopy from moran et al. to study the radialdependence of the recent star formation histories of nearby galaxies withstellar masses greater than 10^10m_sun. we fit stellar population models to thecombination of ssfr, d4000 and hdelta_a and show that many galaxies have balmerabsorption line equivalent widths that require recent short-lived episodes orbursts of star formation. the fraction of galaxies that have experiencedepisodic rather than continuous star formation is highest for late-typegalaxies with low stellar masses. in these systems, bursts occur both in theinner and outer regions of the galaxy. the fraction of stars formed in a singleburst episode is typically around 15% of the total stellar mass in the innerregions of the galaxy and around 5% of the mass in the outer regions. when weaverage over the population, we find that such bursts contribute around a halfof the total mass in stars formed in the last 2 gyr. in massive galaxies,bursts occur predominantly in the outer disk. around a third of all massive,bulge-dominated galaxies have experienced recent star formation episodes thatare fully confined to their outer (r &gt; 0.7r_90) regions. the fraction of starsformed in a single episode is only 2 - 3 % of the underlying stellar mass, butsuch bursts contribute nearly all the stellar mass formed in the last 2 gyr.recent star formation in outer disks is strongly correlated with the globalatomic gas fraction of the galaxy, but not its global molecular gas fraction.we suggest that outer episodic star formation is triggered by gas accretionevents.

1302.2631	on the star formation-agn connection at $z \lesssim 0.3$	using the spectra of a sample of $\sim$28,000 nearby obscured active galaxiesfrom data release 7 of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we probe theconnection between agn activity and star formation over a range of radialscales in the host galaxy. we use the extinction-corrected luminosity of the[oiii] 5007 \aa\ line as a proxy of intrinsic agn power and supermassive blackhole (smbh) accretion rate. the star formation rates (sfrs) are taken from thempa-jhu value-added catalog and are measured through the 3$^{\prime\prime}$sdss aperture. we construct matched samples of galaxies covering a range inredshifts. with increasing redshift, the projected aperture size encompassesincreasing amounts of the host galaxy. this allows us to trace the radialdistribution of star-formation as a function of agn luminosity. we find thatthe star formation becomes more centrally concentrated with increasing agnluminosity and eddington ratio. this implies that such circumnuclear starformation is associated with agn activity, and that it increasingly dominatesover omnipresent disk star formation at higher agn luminosities, placingcritical constraints on theoretical models that link host galaxy star formationand smbh fueling. we parametrize this relationship and find that the starformation on radial scales $&lt;$1.7 kpc, when including a constant diskcomponent, has a sub-linear dependence on smbh accretion rate: $sfr \propto\dot{m}^{0.36}$, suggesting that angular momentum transfer through the disklimits accretion efficiency rather than the supply from stellar mass loss.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1507.05622	the systematic properties of the warm phase of starburst-driven galactic  winds	using ultra-violet absorption-lines, we analyze the systematic properties ofthe warm ionized phase of starburst-driven winds in a sample of 39 low-redshiftobjects that spans broad ranges in starburst and galaxy properties. totalcolumn densities for the outflows are $\sim$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. the outflowvelocity (v$_{out}$) correlates only weakly with the galaxy stellar mass(m$_*$), or circular velocity (v$_{cir}$), but strongly with both sfr andsfr/area. the normalized outflow velocity (v$_{out}/v_{cir}$) correlates wellwith both sfr/area and sfr/m$_*$. the estimated outflow rates of warm ionizedgas ($\dot{m}$) are $\sim$ 1 to 4 times the sfr, and the ratio $\dot{m}/sfr$does not correlate with v$_{out}$.  we show that a model of a population of clouds accelerated by the combinedforces of gravity and the momentum flux from the starburst matches the data. wefind a threshold value for the ratio of the momentum flux supplied by thestarburst to the critical momentum flux needed for the wind to overcome gravityacting on the clouds ($r_{crit}$). for $r_{crit} &gt;$ 10 (strong-outflows) theoutflow momentum flux is similar to the total momentum flux from the starburstand the outflow velocity exceeds the galaxy escape velocity. neither is thecase for the weak-outflows ($r_{crit} &lt;$ 10). for the weak-outflows, the dataseverely disagree with many prescriptions in numerical simulations orsemi-analytic models of galaxy evolution. the agreement is better for thestrong-outflows, and we advocate the use of $r_{crit}$ to guide futureprescriptions.

1511.00013	star formation in quasar hosts and the origin of radio emission in  radio-quiet quasars	radio emission from radio-quiet quasars may be due to star formation in thequasar host galaxy, to a jet launched by the supermassive black hole, or torelativistic particles accelerated in a wide-angle radiatively-driven outflow.in this paper we examine whether radio emission from radio-quiet quasars is abyproduct of star formation in their hosts. to this end we use infraredspectroscopy and photometry from spitzer and herschel to estimate or placeupper limits on star formation rates in hosts of ~300 obscured and unobscuredquasars at z&lt;1. we find that low-ionization forbidden emission lines such as[neii] and [neiii] are likely dominated by quasar ionization and do not providereliable star formation diagnostics in quasar hosts, while pah emissionfeatures may be suppressed due to the destruction of pah molecules by thequasar radiation field. while the bolometric luminosities of our sources aredominated by the quasars, the 160 micron fluxes are likely dominated by starformation, but they too should be used with caution. we estimate median starformation rates to be 6-29 msun/year, with obscured quasars at the high end ofthis range. this star formation rate is insufficient to explain the observedradio emission from quasars by an order of magnitude, with log(l_radio,observed/l_radio, sf)=0.6-1.3 depending on quasar type and star formationestimator. although radio-quiet quasars in our sample lie close to the 8-1000micron infrared / radio correlation characteristic of the star-forminggalaxies, both their infrared emission and their radio emission are dominatedby the quasar activity, not by the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0002526	absorption-line probes of gas and dust in galactic superwinds	we discuss moderate resolution spectra of the nad absorption-line in a sampleof 32 far-ir-bright starburst galaxies. in 18 cases, the line is producedprimarily by interstellar gas, and in 12 of these it is blueshifted by over 100km/s relative to the galaxy systemic velocity. the absorption-line profiles inthese outflow sources span the range from near the galaxy systemic velocity toa maximum blueshift of 400 to 600 km/s. the outflows occur in galaxiessystematically viewed more nearly face-on than the others. we therefore arguethat the absorbing material consists of ambient interstellar gas acceleratedalong the minor axis of the galaxy by a hot starburst-driven superwind. the nadlines are optically-thick, but indirect arguments imply total hydrogen columndensities of n_h = few x 10^{21} cm^{-2}. this implies that the superwind isexpelling matter at a rate comparable to the star-formation rate. thisoutflowing material is very dusty: we find a strong correlation between thedepth of the nad profile and the line-of-sight reddening (e(b-v) = 0.3 to 1over regions several-to-ten kpc in size). the estimated terminal velocities ofsuperwinds inferred from these data and extant x-ray data are typically 400 to800 km/s, are independent of the galaxy rotation speed, and are comparable to(substantially exceed) the escape velocities for $l_*$ (dwarf) galaxies. theresulting loss of metals can establish the mass-metallicity relation inspheroids, produce the observed metallicity in the icm, and enrich a generaligm to 10$^{-1}$ solar metallicity. if the outflowing dust grains survive theirjourney into the igm, their effect on observations of cosmologically-distantobjects is significant.

astro-ph;0008182	chandra observations of ngc 253: new insights into the nature of  starburst-driven superwinds	arcsecond-resolution x-ray imaging of the nucleus of the nearby starburstgalaxy ngc 253 with chandra reveals a well-collimated, stronglylimb-brightened, kiloparsec-scale conical outflow from the central starburstregion. the outflow is very similar in morphology to the known h-alpha outflowcone, on scales down to &lt;= 20 pc. this provides, for the first time, robustevidence that both x-ray and h-alpha emission come from low volume fillingfactor regions of interaction between the fast energetic wind of sn-ejecta andthe denser ambient interstellar medium (ism), and not from the wind fluiditself. we provide estimates of the (observationally and theoreticallyimportant) filling factor of the x-ray emitting gas, of between 4 and 40 percent, consistent with an upper limit of ~40 per cent based directly on theobserved limb-brightened morphology of the outflow. only &lt;= 20 per cent of theobserved x-ray emission can come from the volume-filling, metal-enriched, windfluid itself. spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the soft diffuse thermal x-rayemission reveals that the predominant source of spectral variation along theoutflow cones is due to strong variation in the absorption, on scales of &lt; 60pc, there being little change in the characteristic temperature of theemission. we show that these observations are easily explained by, and fullyconsistent with, the standard model of a superwind driven by a starburst of ngc253's observed power. if these results are typical of all starburst-drivenwinds, then we do not directly see all the energy and gas (in particular thehot metal-enriched gas) transported out of galaxies by superwinds, even inx-ray emission.

astro-ph;0009075	galactic superwinds at low and high redshift	in this contribution i summarize our current knowledge of the nature andsignificance of starburst-driven galactic superwinds. these flows are drivenprimarily by the kinetic energy supplied by supernovae. superwinds are complex,multiphase phenomena requiring a panchromatic observational approach. they areubiquitous in galaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit areaexceeds roughly 10$^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ (a conditionsatisfied by local starbursts and high-z lyman break galaxies). data on x-rayemission, optical line-emission, and optical/uv interstellar absorption-linestogether imply that the mass outflow rates are comparable to thestar-formation-rates and that the conversion of kinetic energy from supernovaeto superwind is quite efficient ($\sim$ 30 to 100%). measured/inferred outflowspeeds range from a few $\times 10^2$ to 10$^3$ km/s and appear to beindependent of the rotation speed of the ``host'' galaxy. the outflows aredusty (dust/gas ratios of $\sim$ 1% by mass). these properties imply thatsuperwinds may have established the mass-metallicity relation in elliptical andbulges, polluted the inter-galactic medium to a metallicity of $\sim$ 10 to 30%solar, heated the inter-galactic medium by up to $\sim$1 kev per baryon, andejected enough dust into the inter-galactic medium to have potentiallyobservable consequences.

astro-ph;0107438	galactic superwinds circa 2001	in this contribution i summarize our current knowledge of the nature andsignificance of starburst-driven galactic winds (``superwinds''). superwindsare complex multiphase outflows of cool, warm, and hot gas, dust, andmagnetized relativistic plasma. the observational manifestations of superwindsresult from the hydrodynamical interaction between the primary energy-carryingwind fluid and the ambient interstellar medium. superwinds are ubiquitous ingalaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit area exceeds roughly10$^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. this criterion is met by localstarbursts and the high-z lyman break galaxies. several independent datasetsand techniques imply that the total mass and energy outflow rates in asuperwind are comparable to the starburst's star-formation-rate and mechanicalenergy injection rate, respectively. outflow speeds in interstellar matterentrained in the wind range from $\sim 10^2$ to $10^3$ km/s, but the primarywind fluid itself may reach velocities as high as $\sim$3000 km s$^{-1}$. theavailable x-ray and far-uv ($fuse$) data imply that radiative losses insuperwinds are not significant. superwinds may have established themass-metallicity relation in ellipticals and bulges, polluted the present-dayinter-galactic medium to a metallicity of $\sim$ 10 to 30% solar, heated theinter-galactic medium, and ejected enough dust into the inter-galactic mediumto have potentially observable consequences.

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

astro-ph;0402030	the environmental dependence of the relations between stellar mass,  structure, star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies	we use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the sdss to study howstructure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and onstellar mass. local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixedabsolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 mpc in projected radius and +-500km/s in depth. the stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by nearly afactor of two towards higher masses between low and high density regions. atfixed stellar mass, both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly onlocal density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration arealmost independent of it. the galaxy property most sensitive to environment isspecific star formation rate. for galaxies with stellar masses less than 3 x10^10 m_sun, the median sfr/m* decreases by more than a factor of 10 from lowto high densities. this decrease is less marked for massive galaxies. at fixedstellar mass, twice as many galaxies host agn with strong [oiii] emission inlow density regions as in high. massive galaxies in low-density environmentsalso contain more dust. we have analyzed correlations between spectroscopicindicators that probe sfh on different timescales (d4000, hdelta_a and sfr/m*).the correlations do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease instar formation has ocurred over long (&gt;1 gyr) timescales. since structure doesnot depend on environment for more massive galaxies, trends in recent sfh, dustand agn for these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure,e.g. mergers. the sfh-density correlation is strongest for small scale (&lt; 1mpc) estimates of local density. finally, we highlight a striking similaritybetween changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as afunction of redshift and we interpret this using n-body simulations.

astro-ph;0403669	chandra &amp; xmm-newton observations of ngc5253. analysis of the x-ray  emission from a dwarf starburst galaxy	we present chandra and xmm-newton x-ray data of ngc5253, a local starburstingdwarf elliptical galaxy, in the early stages of a starburst episode.contributions to the x-ray emission come from discrete point sources andextended diffuse emission, in the form of what appear to be multiplesuperbubbles, and smaller bubbles probably associated with individual starclusters. chandra detects 17 sources within the optical extent of ngc5253 downto a completeness level corresponding to a luminosity of 1.5e37 erg/s.the slopeof the point source x-ray luminosity function is -0.54, similar to that ofother nearby dwarf starburst galaxies. several different types of source aredetected within the galaxy, including x-ray binaries and the emissionassociated with star-clusters.  comparison of the diffuse x-ray emission with the observed halpha emissionshows similarities in their extent. the best spectral fit to the diffuseemission is obtained with an absorbed, two temperature model givingtemperatures for the two gas components of ~0.24kev and ~0.75kev.the derivedparameters of the diffuse x-ray emitting gas are as follows: a total mass of\~1.4e6 f^{1/2} msun, where f is the volume filling factor of the x-rayemitting gas, and a total thermal energy content for the hot x-ray emitting gasof \~3.4e54 f^{1/2} erg. the pressure in the diffuse gas is p/k ~1e6f^{-1/2}k/cm3. we find that these values are broadly commensurate with themass and energy injection from the starburst population. analysis of thekinematics of the starburst region suggest that the stellar ejecta containedwithin it can escape the gravitational potential well of the galaxy, andpollute the surrounding igm.

astro-ph;0406218	present-day growth of black holes and bulges: the sdss perspective	we investigate the accretion-driven growth of supermassive black holes in thelow-redshift universe using 23,000 ``type 2'' agn and the complete sample of123,000 galaxies in the sdss from which they were drawn. we use the stellarvelocity dispersions of the early type galaxies and agn hosts to estimate theirblack hole masses and we use the agn [oiii]5007 emission line luminosities toestimate black hole accretion rates. we find that most present-day accretionoccurs onto black holes with masses &lt; 10e8 msun that reside in moderatelymassive galaxies (m ~ 10e10 to 10e11.5 msun) with high stellar densities(~10e8.5 to 10e9.5 msun/kpc^2) and young stellar populations. thevolume-averaged accretion rates of low mass black holes (&lt;10e7.5 msun) implythat this population is growing on a timescale that is comparable to the age ofthe universe. around half this growth takes place in agn that are radiatingwithin a factor of five of the eddington luminosity. such systems are rare,making up only 0.2% of the low mass black hole population at the present day.the rest of the growth occurs in lower luminosity agn. the growth timescale ismore than two orders of magnitude longer for the population of the most massiveblack holes in our sample. the volume averaged ratio of star formation to blackhole accretion in bulge-dominated galaxies is ~1000, in remarkable agreementwith the observed ratio of stellar mass to black hole mass in nearby galaxybulges. we conclude: a) that bulge formation and black hole formation aretightly coupled, even in present-day galaxies; and b) that the evolution of theagn luminosity function documented in recent optical and x-ray surveys isdriven by a decrease in the characteristic mass scale of accreting black holes.

astro-ph;0411302	the galaxy evolution explorer: a space ultraviolet survey mission	we give an overview of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex), a nasa explorermission launched on april 28, 2003. galex is performing the first space uvsky-survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750angstroms and 1750-2750 angstroms). the surveys include an all-sky imagingsurvey (m[ab] ~ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 square degrees (m[ab] ~23), a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees (m[ab] ~ 25), and a nearbygalaxy survey. spectroscopic grism surveys (r=100-200) are underway withvarious depths and sky coverage. many targets overlap existing or plannedsurveys. we will use the measured uv properties of local galaxies, along withcorollary observations, to calibrate the uv-global star formation raterelationship in local galaxies. we will apply this calibration to distantgalaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map thehistory of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5,and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. the galex missionincludes a guest investigator program supporting the wide variety of programsmade possible by the first uv sky survey.

astro-ph;0411319	uv emission and star formation in stephan's quintet	we present the first galex uv images of the well known interacting group ofgalaxies, stephan's quintet (sq). we detect widespread uv emission throughoutthe group. however, there is no consistent coincidence between uv structure andemission in the optical, h\alpha, or hi. excluding the foreground galaxyngc7320 (sd), most of the uv emission is found in regions associated with thetwo spiral members of the group, ngc7319 and ngc7318b, and the intragroupmedium starburst sq-a. the extinction corrected uv data are analyzed toinvestigate the overall star formation activity in sq. it is found that thetotal star formation rate (sfr) of sq is 6.69+-0.65 m_\sun/yr. among this,1.34+-0.16 m_sun/yr is due to sq-a. this is in excellent agreement with thatderived from extinction corrected h\alpha luminosity of sq-a. the sfr inregions related to ngc 7319 is 1.98+-0.58 m_\sun/yr, most of which(68%) iscontributed by the disk. the contribution from the 'young tail' is only 15%. inthe uv, the 'young tail' is more extended (~100 kpc) and shows a loop-likestructure, including the optical tail, the extragalactic hii regions recentlydiscovered in h\alpha, and other uv emission regions discovered for the firsttime. the uv and optical colors of the 'old tail' are consistent with a singlestellar population of age t ~10^{8.5+-0.4} yrs. the uv emission associated withngc 7318b is found in a very large (~80 kpc) disk, with a net sfr of 3.37+-0.25m_sun/yr. several large uv emission regions are 30 -- 40 kpc away from thenucleus of ngc7318b. although both ngc7319 and ngc7318b show peculiar uvmorphology, their sfr is consistent with that of normal sbc galaxies,indicating that the strength of star formation activity is not enhenced byinteractions.

astro-ph;0411354	new constraints on the star formation histories and dust attenuation of  galaxies in the local universe from galex	we derive a variety of physical parameters including star formation rates(sfrs), dust attenuation and burst mass fractions for 6472 galaxies observed bythe galaxy evolution explorer (galex) and present in the sdss dr1 mainspectroscopic sample. parameters are estimated in a statistical way bycomparing each observed broad-band sed (two galex and five sdss bands) with anextensive library of model galaxy seds, which cover a wide range of starformation histories and include stochastic starbursts. we compare theconstraints derived using sdss bands only with those derived using thecombination of sdss and galex photometry. we find that the addition of thegalex bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dustoptical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 myr to 1 gyrin a galaxy. we are sensitive to sfrs as low as 10^{-3} m_sun/yr, and we findthat low levels of star formation (sf) are mostly associated with early-type,red galaxies. the least massive galaxies have ratios of current topast-averaged sf rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant sf over a hubbletime. for late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. wefind that b correlates tightly with nuv-r color, implying that the sf historyof a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the nuv-r color alone. thefraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode withinthe last 1 gyr steeply declines with mass-from ~20% for galaxies with ~10^8m_sun to ~5% for ~10^11 m_sun galaxies.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0501042	active galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey: ii.  emission-line luminosity function	the emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (agn) ismeasured from about 3000 agn included in the main galaxy sample of the sloandigital sky survey within a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.15$. the $\ha$ and[oiii]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for seyferts cover luminosity rangeof $10^{5-9}$$l_\odot$ in h$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken powerlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. assuming a universalconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred bband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the agn luminosityfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity functionderived from the 2df redshift survey. the inferred agn number density isapproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the totallight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. the numbersof seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at highluminosity, seyfert 1s outnumber seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. in making theluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity isindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it aposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. given the relationshipbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack ofcorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variablethat determines the agn luminosity is the eddington ratio, not the black holemass. this appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likelyto be shining near the eddington limit.

astro-ph;0502022	local starbursts in a cosmological context	in this contribution i introduce some of the major issues that motivate theconference, with an emphasis on how starbursts fit into the ``big picture''. ibegin by defining starbursts in several different ways, and discuss the meritsand limitations of these definitions. i will argue that the most physicallyuseful definition of a starburst is its ``intensity'' (star formation rate perunit area). this is the most natural parameter to compare local starbursts withphysically similar galaxies at high redshift, and indeed i will argue thatlocal starbursts are unique laboratories to study the processes at work in theearly universe. i will describe how nasa's galex mission has uncovered a rarepopulation of close analogs to lyman break galaxies in the local universe. iwill then compare local starbursts to the lyman-break and sub-mm galaxies highredshift populations, and speculate that the multidimensional ``manifold'' ofstarbursts near and far can be understood largely in terms of theschmidt/kennicutt law and galaxy mass-metallicity relation. i will brieflysummarize he properties of starburst-driven galactic superwinds and theirpossible implications for the evolution of galaxies and the igm. these complexmultiphase flows are best studied in nearby starbursts, where we can study thethe hot x-ray gas that contains the bulk of the energy and newly producedmetals.

astro-ph;0502117	the colours of elliptical galaxies	we have compiled a sample of 2728 nearby ($z&lt;0.08$) elliptical galaxies withphotometry in the $g,r,i,z$ bands from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and$j,h,k$ photometry from the two micron all sky survey (2mass). stellar masses,stellar velocity dispersions and structural parameters such as sizes andsurface mass densities are also available for these objects. in order tocorrect the aperture mismatch between sdss and 2mass, we correct the sdssmagnitudes to the isophotal circular radius where the 2mass magnitudes aremeasured. we compare the correlations between optical, optical-infrared andinfrared colours and galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, velocity dispersion andsurface mass density. we find that all galaxy colours correlate more stronglywith stellar mass and velocity dispersion than with any other structuralparameter. the dispersion about these two relations is also smaller.  we also study the correlations between a variety of stellar absorption lineindices and the same set of galaxy parameters and we reach very similarconclusions. finally, we analyze correlations between absorption line indicesand colour. our results suggest that the optical colours of elliptical galaxiesare sensitive to a combination of age, metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement,while the optical-infrared colours are sensitive to metallicity and to$\alpha$-enhancement, but are somewhat less sensitive to age.

astro-ph;0504489	the galex ultraviolet variability (guvv) catalog	we present version 1.0 of the nasa galaxy evolution explorer (galex)ultraviolet variability catalog (guvv) that contains information on 84time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and farultraviolet photometric observations. these time-variable sources wereserendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently beingsurveyed by the galex satellite in two ultraviolet bands (nuv 1750-2750a, fuv1350-1750a) with limiting ab magnitudes of 23-25. the largest-amplitudevariable objects presently detected by galex are m-dwarf flare stars, which canbrighten by 5-10 mag in both the nuv and fuv bands during short duration (&lt;500s) outbursts. other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objectsinclude ab-type rr lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in thegalex fuv band. this first guvv catalog lists galactic positions and possiblesource identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with alist of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at otherwavelengths. we expect the total number of time-variable source detections toincrease as the galex mission progresses, such that later version numbers ofthe guvv catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.

astro-ph;0507396	galex observations of an energetic ultraviolet flare on the dm4e star gj  3685a	the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite has obtained high timeresolution ultraviolet photometry during a large flare on the m4 dwarf star gj3685a. simultaneous nuv (1750 - 2800a) and fuv (1350 - 1750a) time-taggedphotometry with time resolution better than 0.1 s shows that the overallbrightness in the fuv band increased by a factor of 1000 in 200 s. under theassumption that the nuv emission is mostly due to a stellar continuum, and thatthe fuv flux is shared equally between emission lines and continuum, then thereis evidence for two distinct flare components for this event. the first flaretype is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or noincrease in temperature. the other involves rapid increases in both temperatureand flux. while the decay time for the first flare component may be severalhours, the second flare event decayed over less than 1 minute, suggesting thatthere was little or no confinement of the heated plasma.

astro-ph;0510405	gas infall and stochastic star formation in galaxies in the local  universe	we study the recent star formation histories of local galaxies by analyzingthe scatter in their colours and spectral properties. we present evidence thatthe distribution of star formation histories changes qualitatively above acharacteristic stellar surface mass density of 3x10^8 m_sol kpc^-2,corresponding to the transition between disk-dominated and bulge-dominatedgalaxies. when we average over subpopulations of galaxies with densities belowthis value, we find that subpopulations of all masses form their stars at thesame average rate per unit stellar mass. however, the scatter in galaxy coloursand emission line strengths is larger for more compact galaxies of a givenmass. this suggests that star formation occurs in shorter, higher amplitudeevents in galaxies with smaller sizes. above the characteristic density, galaxygrowth through star formation shuts down. we propose that star formation eventsare triggered when cold gas is accreted onto a galaxy. we have used the newhigh resolution millennium simulation of structure formation in a concordancelcdm universe to quantify the incidence of these accretion events and we showthat the observational data are well fit by a model in which the consumptiontime of accreted gas decreases with the surface density of the galaxy as t_cons\propto mu*^-1. the dark matter halos hosting massive galaxies with highdensities are also expected to grow through accretion, but the observationsindicate that star formation in bulge- dominated galaxies is no longer coupledto the hierarchical build-up of their surrounding dark matter halos.

astro-ph;0607492	the clustering of narrow-line agn in the local universe	we have analyzed the clustering of ~ 90,000 narrow-line agn drawn from thedata release 4 (dr4) of the sdss. we compute the cross-correlation between agnand a reference sample of galaxies, and compare this to results for controlsamples of inactive galaxies matched simultaneously in redshift,stellarmass,concentration, velocity dispersion and the 4000a break strength. we alsocompare near-neighbour counts around agn and around the control galaxies. onscales larger than a few mpc, agn have almost the same clustering amplitude asthe control sample. this demonstrates that agn host galaxies and inactivegalaxies populate dark matter halos of similar mass.on scales between 100kpcand 1mpc,agn are clustered more weakly than the control galaxies. we use mockcatalogues constructed from high-resolution n-body simulations to interpretthis anti-bias, showing that the observed effect is easily understood if agnare preferentially located at the centres of their dark matter halos. on scalesless than 70 kpc, agn cluster marginally more strongly than the control sample,but the effect is weak. when compared to the control sample, we find that onlyone in a hundred agn has an extra neighbour within a radius of 70 kpc. thisexcess increases as a function of the accretion rate onto the black hole, butit does not rise above the few percent level. although interactions betweengalaxies may be responsible for triggering nuclear activity in a minority ofnearby agn, some other mechanism is required to explain the activity seen inthe majority of the objects in our sample.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

astro-ph;9708115	on the dynamical and physical state of the `diffuse ionized medium' in  nearby spiral galaxies	we have analyzed deep narrow-band h$\alpha$ images and high-resolutionlong-slit spectra for a sample of the nearest and brightest late-type galaxiesto study the morphology, physical state, and kinematics of the `diffuse ionizedmedium' (`dim'). we find that the dim covers most of the star-forming disk, andis morphologically related to the presence of the giant hii regions. inaddition, the dim and the giant hii regions differ systematically in theirphysical and dynamical state. the dim is characterized by enhanced emission inthe low-ionization forbidden lines ([oi], [nii], and [sii]), and even thehigh-ionization [oiii]$\lambda$5007 line is moderately strong in the dim. weverify the inference made by lehnert &amp; heckman that the dim contributessignificantly to the global emission-line ratios measured in late-typegalaxies. we also find that the dim is more disturbed kinematically than thegas in the giant hii regions. the intrinsic fwhms of the h$\alpha$ and[nii]$\lambda$6584 lines range from 30 to 100 km s$^{-1}$ in the dim comparedto 20-50 km s$^{-1}$ in hii regions. the high-ionization gas in the dim is evenmore kinematically disturbed than the low-ionization gas: the[oiii]$\lambda$5007 lines have intrinsic fwhms of 70-150 km s$^{-1}$. thediffering kinematics implies that `the dim' is not a single monolithic phase ofthe ism. instead, it may consist of a `quiescent dim' with a lowionization-state and small scale-height (few hundred pc) and a `disturbed dim'with a high ionization state and moderate scale-height (0.5 to 1 kpc). we arguethat the quiescent dim is most likely photoionized by radiation leaking out ofgiant hii regions, while the disturbed dim is most likely heated by themechanical energy supplied by supernovae and stellar winds.

astro-ph;9708263	starbursts: lessons for the origin and evolution of galaxies and the  inter-galactic medium	starbursts are episodes of intense star-formation that occur in the centralregions of galaxies, and dominate the integrated emission from the galaxy. theyare a significant component of the present- day universe, being the site of$\sim$ 25% of the high-mass star- formation. they offer unique `laboratories'for testing our ideas about star-formation, the evolution of high-mass stars,and the physics of the interstellar medium. they serve as local analogs of theprocesses that were important in the origin and early evolution of galaxies andin the heating and chemical enrichment of the inter-galactic medium. in thiscontribution i review starbursts from this broad cosmogonical perspective,stressing several key lessons we have learned from starbursts: 1) violent,transient events play a significant role in the origin and evolution ofgalaxies. 2) galaxies do not evolve as `island universes': starbursts aretriggered by galaxy interactions and produce outflows of hotchemically-enriched gas that `pollute' the inter- galactic medium. 3) dustdramatically affects of view of high-mass star-formation in starbursts and(probably) in high-redshift galaxies. throughout this review i emphasize theimportance of space-based observations in understanding starbursts.

astro-ph;9801155	starbursts and the high-redshift universe	starbursts are important because they can serve as local analogs of theprocesses that were important in the origin and early evolution of galaxies andin the heating and chemical enrichment of the inter-galactic medium. they mayalso play an important role in the agn phenomenon. in this contribution ireview the use of uv spectroscopic diagnostics that can be `calibrated' atlow-redshift and then applied at high redshift. from the analysis of the uvproperties of local starbursts we have learned: 1) dust dramatically affectsour view of high-mass star-formation 2) more metal-rich starbursts are redderand more heavily extincted in the uv, more luminous, have stronger vacuum- uvabsorption-lines, and occur in more massive and optically-brighter hostgalaxies 3) the strong interstellar absorption-lines directly reflect thehydrodynamical consequences of the starburst. these results suggest that thehigh-redshift `lyman drop-out' galaxies are are typically highly extincted bydust (average factor of 5 to 10), may have moderately high metallicities (0.1to 1 times solar?), are probably building galaxies with stellarsurface-mass-densities similar to present-day ellipticals, and may be sufferingsubstantial losses of metal-enriched gas that can `pollute' the inter-galacticmedium. i also discuss uv observations of the nuclei of type 2 seyfertgalaxies. these show that compact (100-pc-scale) heavily-reddened starburstsare the source of most of the `featureless continuum' in uv-bright seyfert 2nuclei, and are an energetically significant component in these objects.

astro-ph;9803185	the ultraviolet spectroscopic properties of local starbursts:  implications at high-redshift	we report the results of a systematic study of the vacuum-ultraviolet spectraof 45 starburst and related galaxies observed with the iue satellite. thesespan broad ranges in metallicity, bolometric luminosity, and galaxy properties.the projected size of the iue spectroscopic aperture is typically one toseveral kpc and therefore usually encompasses the entire starburst and issimilar to the aperture-sizes used for spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies.our principal conclusion is that local starbursts occupy a very smallfractional volume in the multi-dimensional manifold defined by such fundamentalparameters as the extinction, metallicity, and vacuum-uv line strengths (bothstellar and interstellar) of the starburst and the rotation speed (mass) andabsolute magnitude of the starburst's `host' galaxy. more metal-rich starburstsare redder and more heavily extinguished in the uv, more luminous, havestronger vacuum-uv lines, and occur in more massive and optically-brighter hostgalaxies. the results on local starbursts suggest that the high-redshift `lymandrop-out' galaxies are typically highly reddened and extinguished by dust(average factor of 5 to 10 in the uv), may have moderately high metallicities(0.1 to 1 times solar?), are probably building galaxies with stellar surface-mass-densities similar to present-day ellipticals, and may be sufferingsubstantial losses of metal-enriched gas that can `pollute' the igm.

0809.3310	the lopsidedness of present-day galaxies: connections to the formation  of stars, the chemical evolution of galaxies, and the growth of black holes	we have used the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to undertake aninvestigation of lopsidedness in a sample of ~25,000 nearby galaxies (z &lt;0.06). we use the m=1 azimuthal fourier mode between the 50% and 90% lightradii as our measure of lopsidedness. the sdss spectra are used to measure theproperties of the stars, gas, and black hole in the central-most few-kpc-scaleregion. we show that there is a strong link between lopsidedness in the outerparts of the galactic disk and the youth of the stellar population in thecentral region. this link is independent of the other structural properties ofthe galaxy. these results provide a robust statistical characterization of theconnections between accretion/interactions/mergers and the resulting starformation. we also show that residuals in the galaxy mass-metallicity relationcorrelate with lopsidedness (at fixed mass, the more metal-poor galaxies aremore lopsided). this suggests that the events causing lopsidedness and enhancedstar formation deliver lower metallicity gas into the galaxy's central region.finally, we find that there is a trend for the more powerful active galacticnuclei to be hosted by more lopsided galaxies (at fixed galaxy mass, density,or concentration). however if we compare samples matched to have both the samestructures and central stellar populations, we then find no difference inlopsidedness between active and non-active galaxies. this leads to thefollowing picture. the presence of cold gas in the central region of a galaxy(irrespective of its origin) is essential for both star-formation and blackhole growth. the delivery of cold gas is aided by the processes that producelopsidedness. other processes on scales smaller than we can probe with our dataare required to transport the gas to the black hole.

astro-ph;9807323	towards a unified model for the `diffuse ionized medium' in normal and  starburst galaxies	we analyze h$\alpha$ images and long-slit spectra of samples of normal andstarburst galaxies to better understand the nature of the diffuse,low-surface-brightness gas in these galaxies. we find that in both samplesthere is a strong inverse correlation between the h$\alpha$ surface-brightness($\sigma_{h\alpha}$) and the [sii]/h$\alpha$ line ratio at a given location inthe galaxy. however, the correlation for the starbursts is offset brightward byan order-of-magnitude in h$\alpha$ surface-brightness at a given line ratio. incontrast, we find that all the galaxies (starburst and normal alike) define auniversal relation between line ratio and the relative h$\alpha$ surfacebrightness ($\sigma_{h\alpha}/\sigma_e$, where $\sigma_e$ is the mean h$\alpha$surface brightness within the galaxy half-light radius). we show that such auniversal correlation is a natural outcome of a model in which the dim isphotoionized gas that has a characteristic thermal pressure ($p$) that isproportional to the mean rate of star-formation per unit area in the galaxy($\sigma_{sfr}$). good quantitative agreement with the data follows if werequire the constant of proportionality to be consistent with the values of $p$and $\sigma_{sfr}$ in the local disk of the milky way. such a scaling between$p$ and $\sigma_{sfr}$ may arise either because feedback from massive starsheats the ism or because $\sigma_{sfr}$ is determined (or limited) by the meangas pressure.

astro-ph;9903054	dust absorption and the ultraviolet luminosity density at z \approx 3 as  calibrated by local starburst galaxies	we refine a technique to measure the absorption corrected ultraviolet (uv)luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest frame uv quantities alone, andapply it to u-dropouts at z ~ 3 found in the hubble deep field. the method isbased on an observed correlation between the ratio of far infrared (fir) to uvfluxes with spectral slope \beta (a uv color). a simple fit to this relationallows the uv flux absorbed by dust to be calculated, and hence the dust-freeuv luminosity to be determined. iue spectra and iras fluxes of local starburstsare used to calibrate the ratio in terms of 1600 angstrom absorption a_{1600},and the transformation from broad band color to \beta. we show that the recentmarginal and non-detections of hdf u-dropouts in the radio and sub-mm areconsistent with our calculated a_{1600}. this is also true of observations ofthe ratio of optical emission line flux to uv flux density in the brightestu-dropouts. this latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dustextinction. in u-dropouts, absolute magnitude correlates with \beta: brightergalaxies are redder, as is observed in local starburst galaxies. this suggeststhat a mass-metallicity relationship is in place by z ~ 3. the uv luminosityfunction of u-dropouts extends up to m_{1600,0} ~ -24 abmag corresponding to astar formation rate ~ 200 \msun/yr (h_0 = 50 km/s/mpc, q_0 = 0.5). theabsorption-corrected uv luminosity density at z ~ 3 is \rho_{1600,0} =&gt;1.4x10^{27} erg/s/hz/mpc^3; still a lower limit since completeness correctionshave not been done and because only galaxies with a_{1600} &lt; ~3.6 mag are blueenough to be selected as u-dropouts. the luminosity weighted mean dustabsorption factor of our sample is 5.4 +/- 0.9$ at 1600\aa (abridged).

astro-ph;9904089	the taxonomy of blue amorphous galaxies: ii. structure and evolution	dwarf galaxies play an important role in our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution, and starbursts are believed to strongly affect theirstructure and evolution. here we present a study of 12 of the nearest dwarfgalaxies thought to be undergoing starbursts as selected primarily bymorphology. we show that these "blue amorphous galaxies" are not physicallydistinguishable from dwarfs selected as starbursting by other methods, such asblue compact dwarfs and hii galaxies. all these classes exhibit exponentialsurface brightness profiles in their outer regions but often have a centralblue excess. typically, these starbursting "cores" are young (0.01 - 0.1 gyr)events compared to the older (1 - 10 gyr) enveloping galaxy. the ratio of thecore-to-envelope blue fluxes ranges from essentially zero to about two. thesestarbursts are therefore modest events involving only a few percent of thestellar mass. the envelopes have surface-brightnesses that are much higher thantypical dwarf irregular (di) galaxies, so it is unlikely that there is astraightforward evolutionary relation between typical dis and dwarf starburstgalaxies. instead bags may repeatedly cycle through starburst and quiescentphases, corresponding to the galaxies with strong and weak/absent coresrespectively. once bags use up the available gas (either through star-formationor galactic winds) so that star-formation is shut off, the faded remnants wouldstrongly resemble dwarf elliptical (de) galaxies. however, in the currentcosmological epoch this is a slow process that is the aftermath of a series ofmany weak, recurring bursts. present-day des must have experienced more rapidand intense evolution than this in the distant past.

astro-ph;9909513	b stars as a diagnostic of star-formation at low and high redshift	we have extended the evolutionary synthesis models by leitherer et al.(1999b) by including a new library of b stars generated from the iuehigh-dispersion spectra archive. we present the library and show how thestellar spectral properties vary according to luminosity classes and spectraltypes. we have generated synthetic uv spectra for prototypical young stellarpopulations varying the imf and the star formation law. clear signs of ageeffects are seen in all models. the contribution of b stars in the uv linespectrum is clearly detected, in particular for greater ages when o stars haveevolved. with the addition of the new library we are able to investigate thefraction of stellar and interstellar contributions and the variation in thespectral shapes of intense lines. we have used our models to date the spectrumof the local super star cluster ngc1705-1. photospheric lines of ciii1247,siiii1417, and sv1502 were used as diagnostics to date the burst of ngc 1705-1at 10 myr. we have selected the star-forming galaxy 1512-cb58 as a firstapplication of the new models to high-z galaxies. this galaxy is at z=2.723, itis gravitationally lensed, and its high signal-to-noise keck spectrum showfeatures typical of local starburst galaxies, such as ngc 1705-1. models withcontinuous star formation were found to be more adequate for 1512-cb58 sincethere are spectral features typical of a composite stellar population of o andb stars. a model with z =0.4z_solar and an imf with alpha=2.8 reproduces thestellar features of the 1512-cb58 spectrum.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.

0812.1224	feast and famine: regulation of black hole growth in low redshift  galaxies	we analyze the observed distribution of eddington ratios as a function ofsupermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn fromthe sloan digital sky survey. we demonstrate that there are two distinctregimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. the first is associated withgalaxies with significant star formation in their central kiloparsec regions,and is characterized by a broad log-normal distribution of accretion ratespeaked at about one percent of the eddington limit. in this regime, theeddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole andshows no further dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy.the second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellarpopulations, and is characterized by a power-law distribution function ofeddington ratios. in this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate ontoblack holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with aconstant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars.this result is once again independent of black hole mass. we show that both theslope of the power-law and the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holesin old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions ofthe decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. ourresults lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the localuniverse. if the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the blackhole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on theproperties of the interstellar medium. once the gas runs out, black hole growthis regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.
