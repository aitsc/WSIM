0907.0101	pulsar simulations for the fermi large area telescope	pulsars are among the prime targets for the large area telescope (lat) aboardthe recently launched fermi observatory. the lat will study the gamma-rayuniverse between 20 mev and 300 gev with unprecedented detail. increasingnumbers of gamma-ray pulsars are being firmly identified, yet their emissionmechanisms are far from being understood. to better investigate and exploit thelat capabilities for pulsar science, a set of new detailed pulsar simulationtools have been developed within the lat collaboration. the structure of thepulsar simulator package pulsarspectrum is presented here. starting from photondistributions in energy and phase obtained from theoretical calculations orphenomenological considerations, gamma rays are generated and their arrivaltimes at the spacecraft are determined by taking into account effects such asbarycentric effects and timing noise. pulsars in binary systems also can besimulated given orbital parameters. we present how simulations can be used forgenerating a realistic set of gamma rays as observed by the lat, focusing onsome case studies that show the performance of the lat for pulsar observations.

0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

0911.0872	probing millisecond pulsar emission geometry using light curves from the  fermi large area telescope	an interesting new high-energy pulsar sub-population is emerging followingearly discoveries of gamma-ray millisecond pulsars (msps) by the fermi largearea telescope (lat). we present results from 3d emission modeling, includingthe special relativistic effects of aberration and time-of-flight delays andalso rotational sweepback of b-field lines, in the geometric context of polarcap (pc), outer gap (og), and two-pole caustic (tpc) pulsar models. in contrastto the general belief that these very old, rapidly-rotating neutron stars (nss)should have largely pair-starved magnetospheres due to the absence ofsignificant pair production, we find that most of the light curves are best fitby tpc and og models, which indicates the presence of narrow accelerating gapslimited by robust pair production -- even in these pulsars with very lowspin-down luminosities. the gamma-ray pulse shapes and relative phase lags withrespect to the radio pulses point to high-altitude emission being dominant forall geometries. we also find exclusive differentiation of the current gamma-raymsp population into two msp sub-classes: light curve shapes and lags acrosswavebands impose either pair-starved pc (pspc) or tpc / og-type geometries. inthe first case, the radio pulse has a small lag with respect to the singlegamma-ray pulse, while the (first) gamma-ray peak usually trails the radio by alarge phase offset in the latter case. finally, we find that the fluxcorrection factor as a function of magnetic inclination and observer angles istypically of order unity for all models. our calculation of light curves andflux correction factor for the case of msps is therefore complementary to the"atlas paper" of watters et al. for younger pulsars.

0912.1800	unraveling the emission geometry of the fermi millisecond pulsars	the nine millisecond pulsars (msps) that have now been detected by fermi-latare providing an excellent opportunity to probe the emission geometry of theseancient compact objects. as they are radio-loud, one may use the relative phaselags across wavebands to obtain constraints on the orientation, size, andlocation of their radio and gamma-ray beams. we model the gamma-ray lightcurves using geometric outer gap (og) and two-pole caustic (tpc) models, inaddition to a pair-starved polar cap (pspc) model which incorporates the fullgeneral relativistic e-field. we find that most msp light curves are fit by ogand tpc models, while pspc is more appropriate for two others. the light curvesof the newest discovery, psr j0034-0534, are best modeled using outermagnetosphere og / tpc models of limited extension for both radio and gamma-raybeams. we model the radio emission of the other eight msps using afixed-altitude conal model at lower altitude. we lastly deduce values forinclination and observer angles (alpha and zeta), as well as the fluxcorrection factor, in each case.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1006.2134	eight gamma-ray pulsars discovered in blind frequency searches of fermi  lat data	we report the discovery of eight gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequencysearches using the lat, onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. five ofthe eight pulsars are young (tau_c&lt;100 kyr), energetic (edot&gt;10^36 erg/s), andlocated within the galactic plane (|b|&lt;3 deg). the remaining three are older,less energetic, and located off the plane. five pulsars are associated withsources included in the lat bright gamma-ray source list, but only one, psrj1413-6205, is clearly associated with an egret source. psr j1023-5746 has thesmallest characteristic age (tau_c=4.6 kyr) and is the most energetic(edot=1.1e37 erg/s) of all gamma-ray pulsars discovered so far in blindsearches. psrs j1957+5033 and j2055+25 have the largest characteristic ages(tau_c~1 myr) and are the least energetic (edot~5e33 erg/s) of thenewly-discovered pulsars. we present the timing models, light curves, anddetailed spectral parameters of the new pulsars. we used recent xmmobservations to identify the counterpart of psr j2055+25 as xmmuj205549.4+253959. in addition, publicly available archival chandra x-ray dataallowed us to identify the likely counterpart of psr j1023-5746 as a faint,highly absorbed source, cxou j102302.8-574606. the large x-ray absorptionindicates that this could be among the most distant gamma-ray pulsars detectedso far. psr j1023-5746 is positionally coincident with the tev source hessj1023-575, located near the young stellar cluster westerlund 2, while psrj1954+2836 is coincident with a 4.3 sigma excess reported by milagro at amedian energy of 35 tev. deep radio follow-up observations of the eight pulsarsresulted in no detections of pulsations and upper limits comparable to thefaintest known radio pulsars, indicating that these can be included among thegrowing population of radio-quiet pulsars in our galaxy being uncovered by thelat, and currently numbering more than 20.

1010.4230	psrs j0248+6021 and j2240+5832: young pulsars in the northern galactic  plane. discovery, timing, and gamma-ray observations	pulsars psr j0248+6021 (rotation period p=217 ms and spin-down power edot =2.13e35 erg/s) and psr j2240+5832 (p=140 ms, edot = 2.12e35 erg/s) werediscovered in 1997 with the nancay radio telescope during a northern galacticplane survey, using the navy-berkeley pulsar processor (nbpp) filter bank. gevgamma-ray pulsations from both were discovered using the fermi large areatelescope. twelve years of radio and polarization data allow detailedinvestigations. the two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and ingamma-ray data. both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset farfrom the radio peak. the high dispersion measure for psr j0248+6021 (dm = 370pc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant hii region w5in the perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the galaxy asobtained from models of average electron distributions. its high transversevelocity and the low magnetic field along the line-of-sight favor this smalldistance. neither gamma-ray, x-ray, nor optical data yield evidence for apulsar wind nebula surrounding psr j0248+6021. the gamma-ray luminosity for psrj0248+6021 is l_ gamma = (1.4 \pm 0.3)\times 10^34 erg/s. for psr j2240+5832,we find either l_gamma = (7.9 \pm 5.2) \times 10^34 erg/s if the pulsar is inthe outer arm, or l_gamma = (2.2 \pm 1.7) \times 10^34 erg/s for the perseusarm. these luminosities are consistent with an l_gamma ~ sqrt(edot) rule.comparison of the gamma-ray pulse profiles with model predictions, includingthe constraints obtained from radio polarization data, favor emission in thefar magnetosphere. these two pulsars differ mainly in their inclination anglesand acceleration gap widths, which in turn explains the observed differences inthe gamma-ray peak widths.

1102.0648	discovery of millisecond pulsars in radio searches of southern fermi lat  sources	using the parkes radio telescope we have carried out deep observations ofeleven unassociated gamma-ray sources. periodicity searches of these data havediscovered two millisecond pulsars, psr j1103-5403 (1fgl j1103.9-5355) and psrj2241-5236 (1fgl j2241.9-5236), and a long period pulsar, psr j1604-44 (1fglj1604.7-4443). in addition we searched for but did not detect any radiopulsations from six gammaray pulsars discovered by the fermi satellite to alevel of - 0.04 mjy (for pulsars with a 10% duty cycle). timing of themillisecond pulsar psr j1103-5403 has shown that its position is 9' from thecentroid of the gamma-ray source. since these observations were carried out,independent evidence has shown that 1fgl j1103.9-5355 is associated with theflat spectrum radio source pks 1101-536. it appears certain that the pulsar isnot associated with the gamma-ray source, despite the seemingly low probabilityof a chance detection of a radio millisecond pulsar. we consider that psrj1604-44 is a chance discovery of a weak, long period pulsar and is unlikely tobe associated with 1fgl j1604.7-4443. psr j2241-5236 has a spin period of 2.2ms and orbits a very low mass companion with a 3.5 hour orbital period. therelatively high flux density and low dispersion measure of psr j2241-5236 makesit an excellent candidate for high precision timing experiments. the gamma-raysof 1fgl j2241.9-5236 have a spectrum that is well modelled by a power law withexponential cutoff, and phasebinning with the radio ephemeris results in amulti-peaked gamma-ray pulse profile. observations with chandra have identifieda coincident x-ray source within 0.1" of the position of the pulsar obtained byradio timing

1111.1248	modeling light curves of the phase-aligned gamma-ray millisecond pulsar  subclass	the gamma-ray population of millisecond pulsars (msps) detected by the fermilarge area telescope (lat) has been steadily increasing. a number of the morerecent detections, including psr j0034-0534, psr j1939+2134 (b1937+21; thefirst msp ever discovered), psr j1959+2048 (b1957+20; the first black widowsystem), and psr j2214+3000 exhibit an unusual phenomenon: nearly phase-alignedradio and gamma-ray light curves (lcs). to account for the phase alignment, weexplore geometric models where both the radio and gamma-ray emission originateeither in the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder (r_lc) or near thepolar caps (pcs). we obtain reasonable fits for the first three of these mspsin the context of "altitude-limited" outer gap (alog) and two-pole caustic(altpc) geometries. the outer magnetosphere phase-aligned models differ fromthe standard outer gap (og) / two-pole caustic (tpc) models in two respects:first, the radio emission originates in caustics at relatively high altitudescompared to the usual low-altitude conal radio beams; second, we allow themaximum altitude of the gamma-ray emission region as well as both the minimumand maximum altitudes of the radio emission region to vary within a limitedrange. alternatively, there also exist phase-aligned lc solutions for emissionoriginating near the stellar surface in a slot gap (sg) scenario ("low-altitudeslot gap" (lasg) models). we find best-fit lcs using a markov chain monte carlo(mcmc) maximum likelihood approach. our fits imply that the phase-aligned lcsare likely of caustic origin, produced in the outer magnetosphere, and that theradio emission may come from close to r_lc. we lastly constrain the emissionaltitudes with typical uncertainties of ~0.3r_lc. our results describe a thirdgamma-ray msp subclass, in addition to the two (with non-aligned lcs)previously found.

1112.3165	what can we learn from phase alignment of gamma-ray and radio pulsar  light curves?	the fermi large area telescope (lat) has revolutionized high-energy (he)astronomy, and is making enormous contributions particularly to gamma-raypulsar science. as a result of the many new pulsar discoveries, the gamma-raypulsar population is now approaching 100. some very famous millisecond pulsars(msps) have also been detected: j1939+2134 (b1937+21), the first msp everdiscovered, as well as j1959+2048 (b1957+20), the first black widow pulsarsystem. these, along with other msps such as psr j0034-0534 and j2214+3000, arerare among the pulsar population in that they exhibit nearly phase-alignedradio and gamma-ray light curves (lcs). traditionally, pulsar lcs have beenmodelled using standard he models in conjunction with low-altitude conal beamradio models. however, a different approach is needed to account forphase-aligned lcs. we explored two scenarios: one where both the radio andgamma-ray emission originate in the outer magnetosphere, and one where theemission comes from near the polar caps (pcs) on the stellar surface. we findbest-fit lcs using a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) technique for the firstclass of models. the first scenario seems to be somewhat preferred, as is alsohinted at by the radio polarization data. this implies that the phase-alignedlcs are possibly of caustic origin produced in the outer magnetosphere, incontrast to the usual lower-altitude conal beam radio models. lastly, weconstrain the emission altitudes with typical uncertainties of ~10% of thelight cylinder radius. the modelled pulsars are members of a third gamma-raymsp subclass, in addition to two others with non-aligned radio and gamma-raylcs.

1201.4272	constraining viewing geometries of pulsars with single-peaked gamma-ray  profiles using a multiwavelength approach	since the launch of the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermispacecraft in june 2008, the number of observed gamma-ray pulsars has increaseddramatically. a large number of these are also observed at radio frequencies.constraints on the viewing geometries of 5 of 6 gamma-ray pulsars exhibitingsingle-peaked gamma-ray profiles were derived using high-quality radiopolarization data (weltevrede et al., 2010). we obtain independent constraintson the viewing geometries of 6 by using a geometric emission code to model thefermi lat and radio light curves (lcs). we find fits for the magneticinclination and observer angles by searching the solution space by eye. ourresults are generally consistent with those previously obtained (weltevrede etal., 2010), although we do find small differences in some cases. we willindicate how the gamma-ray and radio pulse shapes as well as their relativephase lags lead to constraints in the solution space. values for the fluxcorrection factor corresponding to the fits are also derived (with errors).

1202.1128	discovery of the millisecond pulsar psr j2043+1711 in a fermi source  with the nancay radio telescope	we report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar psr j2043+1711 in a searchof a fermi large area telescope (lat) source with no known associations, withthe nancay radio telescope. the new pulsar, confirmed with the green banktelescope, has a spin period of 2.38 ms, is relatively nearby (d &lt;~ 2 kpc), andis in a 1.48 day orbit around a low mass companion, probably a he-type whitedwarf. pulsed gamma-ray emission was detected in the data recorded by the fermilat. the gamma-ray light curve and spectral properties are typical of othergamma-ray millisecond pulsars seen with fermi. x-ray observations of the pulsarwith suzaku and the swift/xrt yielded no detection. at 1.4 ghz we observestrong flux density variations because of interstellar diffractivescintillation, however a sharp peak can be observed at this frequency duringbright scintillation states. at 327 mhz the pulsar is detected with a muchhigher signal-to-noise ratio and its flux density is far more steady. however,at that frequency the arecibo instrumentation cannot yet fully resolve thepulse profile. despite that, our pulse time-of-arrival measurements have apost-fit residual rms of 2 \mus. this and the expected stability of this systemhas made psr j2043+1711 one of the first new fermi-selected millisecond pulsarsto be added to pulsar gravitational wave timing arrays. it has also allowed asignificant measurement of relativistic delays in the times of arrival of thepulses due to the curvature of space-time near the companion, but not yet withenough precision to derive useful masses for the pulsar and the companion. amass for the pulsar between 1.7 and 2.0 solar masses can be derived if astandard millisecond pulsar formation model is assumed. in this article we alsopresent a comprehensive summary of pulsar searches in fermi lat sources withthe nancay radio telescope to date.

1202.3157	sgr j1550-5418 bursts detected with the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor  during its most prolific activity	we have performed detailed temporal and time-integrated spectral analysis of286 bursts from sgr j1550-5418 detected with the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor(gbm) in january 2009, resulting in the largest uniform sample of temporal andspectral properties of sgr j1550-5418 bursts. we have used the combination ofbroadband and high time-resolution data provided with gbm to performstatistical studies for the source properties. we determine the durations,emission times, duty cycles and rise times for all bursts, and find that theyare typical of sgr bursts. we explore various models in our spectral analysis,and conclude that the spectra of sgr j1550-5418 bursts in the 8-200 kev bandare equally well described by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung (ottb), apower law with an exponential cutoff (comptonized model), and two black-bodyfunctions (bb+bb). in the spectral fits with the comptonized model we find amean power-law index of -0.92, close to the ottb index of -1. we show thatthere is an anti-correlation between the comptonized epeak and the burstfluence and average flux. for the bb+bb fits we find that the fluences andemission areas of the two blackbody functions are correlated. thelow-temperature bb has an emission area comparable to the neutron star surfacearea, independent of the temperature, while the high-temperature blackbody hasa much smaller area and shows an anti-correlation between emission area andtemperature. we compare the properties of these bursts with bursts observedfrom other sgr sources during extreme activations, and discuss the implicationsof our results in the context of magnetar burst models.

1206.5634	constraining gamma-ray pulsar gap models with a simulated pulsar  population	with the large sample of young gamma-ray pulsars discovered by the fermilarge area telescope (lat), population synthesis has become a powerful tool forcomparing their collective properties with model predictions. we synthesised apulsar population based on a radio emission model and four gamma-ray gap models(polar cap, slot gap, outer gap, and one pole caustic) normalizing to thenumber of detected radio pulsars in select group of surveys. the luminosity andthe wide beams from the outer gaps can easily account for the number of fermidetections in 2 years of observations. the wide slot-gap beams requires anincrease by a factor of ~10 of the predicted luminosity to produce a reasonablenumber of gamma-ray pulsars. such large increases in the luminosity may beaccommodated by implementing offset polar caps. the narrow polar-cap beamscontribute at most only a handful of lat pulsars. standard distributions inbirth location and pulsar spin-down power (edot) fail to reproduce the latfindings: all models under-predict the number of lat pulsars with high edot,and they cannot explain the high probability of detecting both the radio andgamma-ray beams at high edot. the beaming factor remains close to 1 over 4decades in edot evolution for the slot gap whereas it significantly decreaseswith increasing age for the outer gaps. the evolution of the slot-gapluminosity with edot is compatible with the large dispersion of gamma-rayluminosity seen in the lat data. the stronger evolution predicted for the outergap, which is linked to the polar cap heating by the return current, isapparently not supported by the lat data. the lat sample of gamma-ray pulsarstherefore provides a fresh perspective on the early evolution of the luminosityand beam width of the gamma-ray emission from young pulsars, calling for thinand more luminous gaps.

1303.7352	fermi lat pulsed detection of psr j0737-3039a in the double pulsar  system	we report the fermi large area telescope discovery of gamma-ray pulsationsfrom the 22.7 ms pulsar a in the double pulsar system j0737-3039a/b. this isthe first mildly recycled millisecond pulsar (msp) detected in the gev domain.the 2.7 s companion object psr j0737-3039b is not detected in gamma rays. psrj0737-3039a is a faint gamma-ray emitter, so that its spectral properties areonly weakly constrained; however, its measured efficiency is typical of othermsps. the two peaks of the gamma-ray light curve are separated by roughly halfa rotation and are well offset from the radio and x-ray emission, suggestingthat the gev radiation originates in a distinct part of the magnetosphere fromthe other types of emission. from the modeling of the radio and the gamma-rayemission profiles and the analysis of radio polarization data, we constrain themagnetic inclination $\alpha$ and the viewing angle $\zeta$ to be close to90$^\circ$, which is consistent with independent studies of the radio emissionfrom psr j0737-3039a. a small misalignment angle between the pulsar's spin axisand the system's orbital axis is therefore favored, supporting the hypothesisthat pulsar b was formed in a nearly symmetric supernova explosion as has beendiscussed in the literature already.

1309.1982	modeling the non-recycled fermi gamma-ray pulsar population	we use fermi gamma-ray space telescope detections and upper limits onnon-recycled pulsars obtained from the large area telescope (lat) to constrainhow the gamma-ray luminosity l depends on the period p and the periodderivative \dot{p}. we use a bayesian analysis to calculate a best-fitluminosity law, or dependence of l on p and \dot{p}, including differentmethods for modeling the beaming factor. an outer gap (og) magnetospheregeometry provides the best-fit model, which is l \propto p^{-a} \dot{p}^{b}where a=1.36\pm0.03 and b=0.44\pm0.02, similar to but not identical to thecommonly assumed l \propto \sqrt{\dot{e}} \propto p^{-1.5} \dot{p}^{0.5}. givenupper limits on gamma-ray fluxes of currently known radio pulsars and using theog model, we find that about 92% of the radio-detected pulsars have gamma-raybeams that intersect our line of sight. by modeling the misalignment of radioand gamma-ray beams of these pulsars, we find an average gamma-ray beamingsolid angle of about 3.7{\pi} for the og model, assuming a uniform beam. usinglat-measured diffuse fluxes, we place a 2{\sigma} upper limit on the averagebraking index and a 2{\sigma} lower limit on the average surface magnetic fieldstrength of the pulsar population of 3.8 and 3.2 x 10^{10} g, respectively. wethen predict the number of non-recycled pulsars detectable by the lat based onour population model. using the two-year sensitivity, we find that the lat iscapable of detecting emission from about 380 non-recycled pulsars, including150 currently identified radio pulsars. using the expected five-yearsensitivity, about 620 non-recycled pulsars are detectable, including about 220currently identified radio pulsars. we note that these predictionssignificantly depend on our model assumptions.

1403.3849	light-curve modelling constraints on the obliquities and aspect angles  of the young fermi pulsars	in more than four years of observation the large area telescope on board thefermi satellite has identified pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission from more than 80young pulsars, providing light curves with high statistics. fitting theobservations with geometrical models can provide estimates of the magneticobliquity $\alpha$ and aspect angle $\zeta$, yielding estimates of theradiation beaming factor and luminosity. using $\gamma$-ray emission geometries(polar cap, slot gap, outer gap, one pole caustic) and radio emission geometry,we fit $\gamma$-ray light curves for 76 young pulsars and we jointly fit their$\gamma$-ray plus radio light curves when possible. we find that a joint radioplus $\gamma$-ray fit strategy is important to obtain ($\alpha$, $\zeta$)estimates that can explain simultaneous radio and $\gamma$-ray emission. theintermediate-to-high altitude magnetosphere models, slot gap, outer gap, andone pole caustic, are favoured in explaining the observations. we find noevolution of $\alpha$ on a time scale of a million years. for all emissiongeometries our derived $\gamma$-ray beaming factors are generally less than oneand do not significantly evolve with the spin-down power. a more pronouncedbeaming factor vs. spin-down power correlation is observed for slot gap modeland radio-quiet pulsars and for the outer gap model and radio-loud pulsars. forall models, the correlation between $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spin-down poweris consistent with a square root dependence. the $\gamma$-ray luminositiesobtained by using our beaming factors not exceed the spin-down power. thissuggests that assuming a beaming factor of one for all objects, as done inother studies, likely overestimates the real values. the data show a relationbetween the pulsar spectral characteristics and the width of the acceleratorgap that is consistent with the theoretical prediction for the slot gap model.

1404.2264	constraints on the emission geometries and spin evolution of gamma-ray  millisecond pulsars	millisecond pulsars (msps) are a growing class of gamma-ray emitters. pulsedgamma-ray signals have been detected from more than 40 msps with the fermilarge area telescope (lat). the wider radio beams and more compactmagnetospheres of msps enable studies of emission geometries over a broaderrange of phase space than non-recycled radio-loud gamma-ray pulsars. we havemodeled the gamma-ray light curves of 40 lat-detected msps using geometricemission models assuming a vacuum retarded-dipole magnetic field. we modeledthe radio profiles using a single-altitude hollow-cone beam, with a corecomponent when indicated by polarimetry; however, for msps with gamma-ray andradio light curve peaks occurring at nearly the same rotational phase we assumethat the radio emission is co-located with the gamma rays and caustic innature. the best-fit parameters and confidence intervals are determined using amaximum likelihood technique. we divide the light curves into three modelclasses, with gamma-ray peaks trailing (class i), aligned (class ii) or leading(class iii) the radio peaks. outer gap and slot gap (two-pole caustic) modelsbest fit roughly equal numbers of class i and ii, while class iii areexclusively fit with pair-starved polar cap models. distinguishing between themodel classes based on typical derived parameters is difficult. we explore theevolution of magnetic inclination angle with period and spin-down power,finding possible correlations. while the presence of significant off-peakemission can often be used as a discriminator between outer gap and slot gapmodels, a hybrid model may be needed.

1410.6462	the contribution of millisecond pulsars to the galactic cosmic-ray  lepton spectrum	pulsars are believed to be sources of relativistic electrons and positrons.the abundance of detections of gamma-ray millisecond pulsars by fermi largearea telescope coupled with their light curve characteristics that implycopious pair production in their magnetospheres, motivated us to investigatethis old pulsar population as a source of galactic electrons and positrons andtheir contribution to the enhancement in cosmic-ray positron flux at gevenergies. we use a population synthesis code to predict the source properties(number, position, and power) of the present-day galactic millisecond pulsars,taking into account the latest fermi and radio observations to calibrate themodel output. next, we simulate pair cascade spectra from these pulsars using amodel that invokes an offset-dipole magnetic field. we assume free escape ofthe pairs from the pulsar environment. we then compute the cumulative spectrumof transported electrons and positrons at earth, following their diffusion andenergy losses as they propagate through the galaxy. our results indicate thatthe predicted particle flux increases for non-zero offsets of the magneticpolar caps. comparing our predicted spectrum and positron fraction tomeasurements by ams-02, pamela, and fermi, we find that millisecond pulsars areonly modest contributors at a few tens of gev, after which this leptonicspectral component cuts off. the positron fraction is therefore only slightlyenhanced above 10 gev relative to a background flux model. this implies thatalternative sources such as young, nearby pulsars and supernova remnants shouldcontribute additional primary positrons within the astrophysical scenario.

1411.0881	modelling the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves of the double pulsar  system	guillemot et al. recently reported the discovery of $\gamma$-ray pulsationsfrom the 22.7ms pulsar (pulsar a) in the famous double pulsar systemj0737-3039a/b. the $\gamma$-ray light curve (lc) of pulsar a has two peaksseparated by approximately half a rotation, and these are non-coincident withthe observed radio and x-ray peaks. this suggests that the $\gamma$-rayemission originates in a part of the magnetosphere distinct from where theradio and x-ray radiation is generated. thus far, three different methods havebeen applied to constrain the viewing geometry of pulsar a (its inclination andobserver angles $\alpha$ and $\zeta$): geometric modelling of the radio and$\gamma$-ray light curves, modelling of the position angle sweep in phase seenin the radio polarisation data, and independent studies of the time evolutionof the radio pulse profile of pulsar a. these three independent, complementarymethods have yielded consistent results: pulsar a's rotation axis is likelyperpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system, and its magnetic axisclose to lying in the orbital plane (making this pulsar an orthogonal rotator).the observer is furthermore observing emission close to the magnetic axis. thusfar, however, current models could not reproduce all the characteristics of theradio and $\gamma$-ray light curves, specifically the large radio-to-$\gamma$phase lag. in this paper we discuss some preliminary modelling attempts toaddress this problem, and offer ideas on how the lc fits may be improved byadapting the standard geometric models in order to reproduce the profilepositions more accurately.

1508.00779	psr j1906+0722: an elusive gamma-ray pulsar	we report the discovery of psr j1906+0722, a gamma-ray pulsar detected aspart of a blind survey of unidentified fermi large area telescope (lat) sourcesbeing carried out on the volunteer distributed computing system, einstein@home.this newly discovered pulsar previously appeared as the most significantremaining unidentified gamma-ray source without a known association in thesecond fermi-lat source catalog (2fgl) and was among the top ten mostsignificant unassociated sources in the recent third catalog (3fgl). psrj1906+0722 is a young, energetic, isolated pulsar, with a spin frequency of$8.9$ hz, a characteristic age of $49$ kyr, and spin-down power $1.0 \times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. in 2009 august it suffered one of the largest glitchesdetected from a gamma-ray pulsar ($\delta f / f \approx 4.5\times10^{-6}$).remaining undetected in dedicated radio follow-up observations, the pulsar islikely radio-quiet. an off-pulse analysis of the gamma-ray flux from thelocation of psr j1906+0722 revealed the presence of an additional nearbysource, which may be emission from the interaction between a neighboringsupernova remnant and a molecular cloud. we discuss possible effects which mayhave hindered the detection of psr j1906+0722 in previous searches and describethe methods by which these effects were mitigated in this survey. we alsodemonstrate the use of advanced timing methods for estimating the positional,spin and glitch parameters of difficult-to-time pulsars such as this.

1511.06778	the 1st fermi lat supernova remnant catalog	to uniformly determine the properties of supernova remnants (snrs) at highenergies, we have developed the first systematic survey at energies from 1 to100 gev using data from the fermi large area telescope. based on the spatialoverlap of sources detected at gev energies with snrs known from radio surveys,we classify 30 sources as likely gev snrs. we also report 14 marginalassociations and 245 flux upper limits. a mock catalog in which the positionsof known remnants are scrambled in galactic longitude, allows us to determinean upper limit of 22% on the number of gev candidates falsely identified assnrs. we have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatialsystematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a keycomponent of all galactic fermi lat analyses. by studying remnants uniformly inaggregate, we measure the gev properties common to these objects and provide acrucial context for the detailed modeling of individual snrs. combining our gevresults with multiwavelength (mw) data, including radio, x-ray, and tev,demonstrates the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple modelsdescribing the gev and radio emission from these objects. we model the gev andmw emission from snrs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution toobserved galactic cosmic rays.

astro-ph;0307251	on the methods of determining the radio emission geometry in pulsar  magnetospheres	we present a modification of the relativistic phase shift method ofdetermining the radio emission geometry from pulsar magnetospheres proposed bygangadhara &amp; gupta (2001). our modification provides a method of determiningradio emission altitudes which does not depend on the viewing geometry and doesnot require polarization measurements. we suggest application of the method tothe outer edges of averaged radio pulse profiles to identify magnetic fieldlines associated with the edges of the pulse and, thereby, to test thegeometric method based on the measurement of the pulse width at the lowestintensity level. we show that another relativistic method proposed byblaskiewicz et al. (1991) provides upper limits for emission altitudesassociated with the outer edges of pulse profiles. a comparison of these limitswith the altitudes determined with the geometric method may be used to probethe importance of rotational distortions of magnetic field and refractioneffects in the pulsar magnetosphere. we provide a comprehensive discussion ofthe assumptions used in the relativistic methods.

astro-ph;0308215	pulsar populations and unidentified gamma-ray sources	the egret telescope on the compton gamma-ray observatory detected over 200sources and the majority of these are still unidentified. at least threesubpopulations of egret sources have been associated with the galaxy: brightsources lying along the galactic plane, weaker sources spatially correlatedwith the gould belt and a high-latitude, halo population. many of these sourcesmay be pulsars and there are more than two-dozen radio pulsars in or near egretsource error boxes, most of them recently discovered in the parkes multibeamsurvey. we present results from several population synthesis studies of pulsarsin the galaxy, which predict the number of pulsars detected by gamma-ray andradio surveys assuming models for the high-energy emission beam and itsrelation to the radio beam. future gamma-ray pulsar detections by agile andglast together with the recent large rise in the radio pulsar population willgive greatly improved statistics. the relative numbers of radio and gamma-raypulsars detected in the plane and in the gould belt populations will provide animportant discriminator between models of high-energy emission and willprofoundly affect the numbers and birth rate of pulsars in the galaxy.

astro-ph;0401255	relativistic effects and polarization in three high-energy pulsar models	we present the influence of the special relativistic effects of aberrationand light travel time delay on pulsar high-energy lightcurves and polarizationcharacteristics predicted by three models: the two-pole caustic model, theouter gap model, and the polar cap model. position angle curves and degree ofpolarization are calculated for the models and compared with the optical dataon the crab pulsar. the relative positions of peaks in gamma-ray and radiolightcurves are discussed in detail for the models. we find that the two-polecaustic model can reproduce qualitatively the optical polarizationcharacteristics of the crab pulsar - fast swings of the position angle andminima in polarization degree associated with both peaks. the anticorrelationbetween the observed flux and the polarization degree (observed in the opticalband also for b0656+14) naturally results from the caustic nature of the peakswhich are produced in the model due to the superposition of radiation from manydifferent altitudes, ie. polarized at different angles. the two-pole causticmodel also provides an acceptable interpretation of the main features in thecrab's radio profile. neither the outer gap model nor the polar cap model areable to reproduce the optical polarization data on the crab. although the outergap model is very successful in reproducing the relative positions of gamma-rayand radio peaks in pulse profiles, it can reproduce the high-energy lightcurvesonly when photon emission from regions very close to the light cylinder isincluded.

astro-ph;0402507	rotational sweepback of magnetic field lines in geometrical models of  pulsar radio emission	we study the rotational distortions of the vacuum dipole magnetic field inthe context of geometrical models of the radio emission from pulsars. we findthat at low altitudes the rotation deflects the local direction of the magneticfield by at most an angle of the order of r_n^2, where r_n = r/rlc, r is theradial distance of the radio emission and rlc is the light cylinder radius. tothe second order in r_n, this distortion is symmetrical with respect to theplane containing the dipole axis and the rotation axis (omega-mu plane). thelowest order distortion which is asymmetrical with respect to the omega-muplane is third order in r_n. we show, however, that the influence of thesweepback on the outer boundary of the open field line region (open volume) isa much larger effect, of the order of r_n^1/2. the open volume is shiftedbackwards with respect to the rotation direction by an angle delta_ov ~ 0.2sin(alpha) r_n^1/2 where alpha is the dipole inclination with respect to therotation axis. the associated phase shift of the pulse profile delta_phi_ov ~0.2 r_n^1/2 can easily exceed the shift due to combined effects of aberrationand propagation time delays (=~ 2r_n). this strongly affects the misalignmentof the center of the pa curve and the center of the pulse profile, therebymodifying the delay-radius relation. contrary to intuition, the effect ofsweepback dominates over other effects when emission occurs at low altitudes.for r_n &lt;~ 0.003 the shift becomes negative, ie. the center of the positionangle curve precedes the profile center. with the sweepback effect included,the modified delay-radius relation predicts larger emission radii and is inmuch better agreement with the other methods of determining r_n.

astro-ph;9506130	photon splitting in magnetar models of soft gamma repeaters	the recent association of soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) with counterparts inother wavebands has sparked much interest in these sources. one of the recentmodels for these objects is that they originate in the environs of neutronstars with fields much stronger than the quantum critical field\teq{b_{cr}=4.413\times 10^{13}} gauss. near such neutron stars, dubbedmagnetars, the exotic quantum process of magnetic photon splitting becomesprolific. its principal effect is to degrade photon energies and thereby softengamma-ray spectra from neutron stars; it has recently been suggested thatsplitting may be responsible for limiting the hardness of emission in sgrs, ifthese sources originate in neutron stars with supercritical surface fields.seed photons in supercritical fields efficiently generate soft gamma-rayspectra, typical of repeaters. in this paper, the influence of the curveddipole field geometry of a neutron star magnetosphere on the photon splittingrate is investigated. the dependence of the attenuation length on the locationand angular direction of the seed photons is explored.

astro-ph;9606074	cylotron line models for the x-ray pulsar a0535+26	the spectrum of the transient x-ray binary pulsar a0535+26 obtained by ossein february 1994 shows an absorption feature at 110 kev but does not confirm afeature at around 55 kev, as previously reported by other instruments. if the110 kev feature is due to cyclotron scattering at the first harmonic, then themagnetic field required is about $10^{13}$ gauss, the highest observed in anx-ray pulsar. conversely, if this strong feature is a second harmonic and theline formation process is such that an extremely weak fundamental results at$\simeq$ 55 kev, the estimate of the field strength is halved. we presentresults of detailed cyclotron line transfer models from two source geometriesto explore the theoretical contraints on the line shapes in this source. it isfound that while a fundamental harmonic line at $\sim$ 55 kev may be partiallyfilled-in by angle redistribution in cylindrical geometries, the requiredviewing angles give a second harmonic line shape inconsistent with theobservation. interpretation of the feature at 110 kev as a first harmonic seenat small angles to the field yields more consistent line shapes.

astro-ph;9806207	rxte observation of psr b1706-44 and implications for theoretical models  of pulsar emission	we report on results of an observation with the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte) of psr b1706-44 with a live time of 132 ks, to search for pulsed x-rayemission. psr b1706-44 is a radio and high-energy gamma-ray pulsar (detected byegret), but no pulsed emission has been detected in the x-ray band. since mostof the other known gamma-ray pulsars emit pulsed x-rays, it is expected thatpsr b1706-44 would also be an x-ray pulsar. however, while the rosat pspcdetected a source at the pulsar position, it did not detect pulsations, givinga pulsed fraction upper limit of 18%. the rxte observations to search formodulation at the pulsar period were carried out in november 1996 and may 1997,during the low states of the nearby x-ray binary 4u1705-44. no significantmodulation was detected at the pulsar period, giving an upper limit of 10^{-6}photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} kev^{-1} in the interval 9 kev &lt; e &lt; 18.5kev. theimplications of this upper limit of the pulsed flux from the rxte observation,taken together with multiband observations of this pulsar are examined in thecontext of theoretical models of pulsar particle acceleration zones.

astro-ph;9904357	an rxte observation of the vela pulsar: filling in the x-ray gap	we have detected pulsed emission from the vela pulsar at 2 - 30 kev during a93 ks observation with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). the rxte pulseprofile shows two peaks, that are roughly in phase with the egret peaks, butdoes not show any significant interpeak emission. the phase of peak 2 is energydependent, moving to higher phase with increasing energy in the rxte band, inphase alignment with the second optical pulse in the lowest energy band of 2 -8 kev and in phase alignment with the second egret pulse in the highest energyband of 16-30 kev. the average pulse spectrum joins smoothly to the high energyspectrum of osse, comptel and egret, although the spectrum of peak 1 issignificantly harder than that of peak 2. a break or turnover in the spectrumaround 50 kev, previously suggested by osse data, is now clearly defined. therxte spectrum falls several orders of magnitude below the rosat emission in the0.1 - 2 kev band, suggesting a thermal origin for the rosat pulse.

0810.1637	pulsar timing for the fermi gamma-ray space telescope	we describe a comprehensive pulsar monitoring campaign for the large areatelescope (lat) on the {\em fermi gamma-ray space telescope} (formerly glast).the detection and study of pulsars in gamma rays give insights into thepopulations of neutron stars and supernova rates in the galaxy, into particleacceleration mechanisms in neutron star magnetospheres, and into the "engines"driving pulsar wind nebulae. lat's unprecedented sensitivity between 20 mev and300 gev together with its 2.4 sr field-of-view makes detection of manygamma-ray pulsars likely, justifying the monitoring of over two hundred pulsarswith large spin-down powers. to search for gamma-ray pulsations from most ofthese pulsars requires a set of phase-connected timing solutions spanning ayear or more to properly align the sparse photon arrival times. we describe thechoice of pulsars and the instruments involved in the campaign. attention ispaid to verifications of the lat pulsar software, using for example giant radiopulses from the crab and from psr b1937+21 recorded at nan\c{c}ay, and usingx-ray data on psr j0218+4232 from xmm-newton. we demonstrate accuracy of thepulsar phase calculations at the microsecond level. data table 1 is onlyavailable in electronic form at the cds via anonymous ftp tocdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or viahttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?j/a+a/ .
