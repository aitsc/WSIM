0901.3723	jet-lag in sgr a*: what size and timing measurements tell us about the  central black hole in the milky way	the black hole at the galactic center, sgr a*, is the prototype of a galacticnucleus at a very low level of activity. its radio through submm-wave emissionis known to come from a region close to the event horizon, however, the sourceof the emission is still under debate. a successful theory explaining theemission is based on a relativistic jet model scaled down from powerfulquasars. we want to test the predictive power of this established jet modelagainst newly available measurements of wavelength-dependent time lags and thesize-wavelength structure in sgr a*. using all available closure amplitude vlbidata from different groups, we again derived the intrinsic wavelength-dependentsize of sgr a*. this allowed us to calculate the expected frequency-dependenttime lags of radio flares, assuming a range of in- and outflow velocities.moreover, we calculated the time lags expected in the previously publishedpressure-driven jet model. the predicted lags are then compared to radiomonitoring observations at 22, 43, and 350 ghz. the combination of time lagsand size measurements imply a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk outflowspeeds of gamma*beta ~ 0.5-2. the newly measured time lags are reproduced wellby the jet model without any major fine tuning. the results further strengthenthe case for the cm-to-mm wave radio emission in sgr a* as coming from a mildlyrelativistic jet-like outflow. the combination of radio time lag and vlbiclosure amplitude measurements is a powerful new tool for assessing the flowspeed and direction in sgr a*. future vlbi and time lag measurements over arange of wavelengths will reveal more information about sgr a*, such as theexistence of a jet nozzle, and measure the detailed velocity structure of arelativistic jet near its launching point for the first time.

0906.3285	the fundamental plane of accretion onto black holes with dynamical  masses	black hole accretion and jet production are areas of intensive study inastrophysics. recent work has found a relation between radio luminosity, x-rayluminosity, and black hole mass. with the assumption that radio and x-rayluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,respectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jetproduction is implied. in an effort to refine these links and enhance theirpower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes withdirect, dynamical mass-measurements. this approach not only eliminatessystematic errors incurred through the use of secondary mass measurements, butalso effectively restricts the range of distances considered to avolume-limited sample. further, we have exclusively used archival data from thechandra x-ray observatory to best isolate nuclear sources. we find log(l_r) =(4.80 +/- 0.24) + (0.78 +/- 0.27) log(m_bh) + (0.67 +/- 0.12) log(l_x), inbroad agreement with prior efforts. owing to the nature of our sample, theplane can be turned into an effective mass predictor. when the full sample isconsidered, masses are predicted less accurately than with the well-knownm-sigma relation. if obscured agn are excluded, the plane is potentially abetter predictor than other scaling measures.

0911.0739	a time-dependent jet model for the emission from sagittarius a*	the source of emission from sgr a*, the supermassive black hole at thegalactic center, is still unknown. flares and data from multiwavelengthcampaigns provide important clues about the nature of sgr a* itself. here weattempt to constrain the physical origin of the broadband emission and theradio flares from sgr a*. we developed a time-dependent jet model, which forthe first time allows one to compare the model predictions with flare data fromsgr a*. taking into account relevant cooling mechanisms, we calculate thefrequency-dependent time lags and photosphere size expected in the jet model.the predicted lags and sizes are then compared with recent observations. boththe observed time lags and size-frequency relationships are reproduced well bythe model. the combined timing and structural information strongly constrainthe speed of the outflow to be mildly relativistic, and the radio flares arelikely to be caused by a transient increase in the matter channelled into thejets. the model also predicts light curves and structural information at otherwavelengths which could be tested by observations in the near future. we showthat a time-dependent relativistic jet model can successfully reproduce: (1)the quiescent broadband spectral energy distribution of sgr a*, (2) theobserved 22 and 43 ghz light curve morphologies and time lags, and (3) thefrequency-size relationship. the results suggest that the observed emission atradio frequencies from sgr a* is most easily explained by a stratified,optically thick, mildly relativistic jet outflow. frequency-dependentmeasurements of time-lags and intrinsic source size provide strong constraintson the bulk motion of the jet plasma.

1007.2191	is the plateau state in grs 1915+105 equivalent to canonical hard  states?	grs1915+105 is a very peculiar black hole binary that exhibitsaccretion-related states that are not observed in any other stellar-mass blackhole system. one of these states, however -- referred to as the plateau state-- may be related to the canonical hard state of black hole x-ray binaries.both the plateau and hard state are associated with steady, relatively lowerx-ray emission and flat/inverted radio emission, that is sometimes resolvedinto compact, self-absorbed jets. however, while generally black hole binariesquench their jets when the luminosity becomes too high, grs1915+105 seems tosustain them despite the fact that it accretes at near- or super-eddingtonrates. in order to investigate the relationship between the plateau and thehard state, we fit two multi-wavelength observations using a steady-stateoutflow-dominated model, developed for hard state black hole binaries. the datasets consist of quasi-simultaneous observations in radio, near-infrared andx-ray bands. interestingly, we find both significant differences between thetwo plateau states, as well as between the best-fit model parameters and thoserepresentative of the hard state. we discuss our interpretation of theseresults, and the possible implications for grs 1915+105's relationship tocanonical black hole candidates.

1105.3211	using the fundamental plane of black hole activity to distinguish x-ray  processes from weakly accreting black holes	the fundamental plane of black hole activity is a relation between x-rayluminosity, radio luminosity, and black hole mass for hard state galactic blackholes and their supermassive analogs. the fundamental plane suggests that, atlow-accretion rates, the physical processes regulating the conversion of anaccretion flow into radiative energy could be universal across the entire blackhole mass scale. however, there is still a need to further refine thefundamental plane in order to better discern the radiative processes and theirgeometry very close to the black hole, in particular the source of hard x-rays.further refinement is necessary because error bars on the best-fit slopes ofthe fundamental plane are generally large, and also the inferred coefficientscan be sensitive to the adopted sample of black holes. in this work, we regressthe fundamental plane with a bayesian technique. our approach shows thatsub-eddington black holes emit x-ray emission that is predominantly opticallythin synchrotron radiation from the jet, provided that their radio spectra areflat or inverted. x-ray emission dominated by very radiatively inefficientaccretion flows are excluded at the &gt;3\sigma\ level. we also show that it isdifficult to place fr i galaxies onto the fundamental plane because their x-rayjet emission is highly affected by synchrotron cooling. on the other hand, bllac objects fit onto the fundamental plane. including a uniform subset ofhigh-energy peaked bl lac objects from the sdss, we find sub-eddington blackholes with flat/inverted radio spectra follow log l_x=(1.45\pm0.04)logl_r-(0.88\pm0.06)\logm_{bh}-6.07\pm1.10, with \sigma_{int}=0.07\pm0.05 dex.finally, we discuss how the effects of synchrotron cooling of jet emission fromthe highest black hole masses can bias fundamental plane regressions, perhapsleading to incorrect inferences on x-ray radiation mechanisms.

1110.6872	sgr a* flares: tidal disruption of asteroids and planets?	it is theoretically expected that a supermassive black hole (smbh) in thecentre of a typical nearby galaxy disrupts a solar-type star every ~ 10^5years, resulting in a bright flare lasting for months. sgr a*, the residentsmbh of the milky way, produces (by comparison) tiny flares that last onlyhours but occur daily. here we explore the possibility that these flares couldbe produced by disruption of smaller bodies - asteroids. we show that asteroidspassing within an au of sgr a* could be split into smaller fragments which thenvaporise by bodily friction with the tenuous quiescent gas accretion flow ontosgr a*. the ensuing shocks and plasma instabilities may create a transientpopulation of very hot electrons invoked in several currently popular modelsfor sgr a* flares, thus producing the required spectra. we estimate thatasteroids larger than ~ 10 km in size are needed to power the observed flares,with the maximum possible luminosity of the order 10^39 erg s^-1. assuming thatthe asteroid population per parent star in the central parsec of the milky wayis not too dissimilar from that around stars in the solar neighbourhood, weestimate the asteroid disruption rates, and the distribution of the expectedluminosities, finding a reasonable agreement with the observations. we alsonote that planets may be tidally disrupted by sgr a* as well, also veryinfrequently. we speculate that one such disruption may explain the putativeincrease in sgr a* luminosity ~ 300 yr ago.

0802.3357	broadband x-ray spectra of gx 339-4 and the geometry of accreting black  holes in the hard state	a major question in the study of black hole binaries involves ourunderstanding of the accretion geometry when the sources are in the hard state.in this state, the x-ray energy spectrum is dominated by a hard power-lawcomponent and radio observations indicate the presence of a steady and powerfulcompact jet. although the common hard state picture is that the accretion diskis truncated, perhaps at hundreds of gravitational radii from the black hole,recent results for the recurrent transient gx 339-4 by miller and co-workersshow evidence for optically thick material very close to the black hole'sinnermost stable circular orbit. that work focused on an observation of gx339-4 at a luminosity of about 5% of the eddington limit and used parametersfrom a relativistic reflection model and the presence of a soft, thermalcomponent as diagnostics. in this work, we use similar diagnostics, but extendthe study to lower luminosities (2.3% and 0.8% ledd) using swift and rxteobservations of gx 339-4. we detect a thermal component with an inner disktemperature of ~0.2 kev at 2.3% ledd. we detect broad features due to ironkalpha that are likely related to reflection of hard x-rays off the opticallythick material. if these features are broadened by relativistic effects, theyindicate that optically thick material resides within 10 rg down to 0.8% ledd,and the measurements are consistent with the inner radius of the disk remainingat ~4 rg down to this level. however, we also discuss an alternative model forthe broadening, and we note that the evolution of the thermal component is notentirely consistent with the constant inner radius interpretation. finally, wediscuss the results in terms of recent theoretical work on the possibility thatmaterial may condense to maintain an inner optically thick disk.

1411.2973	constraints on relativistic jets in quiescent black hole x-ray binaries  from broadband spectral modeling	the nature of black hole jets at the lowest detectable luminosities remainsan open question, largely due to a dearth of observational constraints. here,we present a new, nearly-simultaneous broadband spectrum of the black holex-ray binary (bhxb) xte j1118+480 at an extremely low eddington ratio(l_x~1e-8.5 l_edd). our new spectral energy distribution (sed) includes theradio, near-infrared, optical, ultraviolet, and x-ray wavebands. xte j1118 isnow the second bhxb at such a low eddington ratio with a well-sampled sed,providing new constraints on highly sub-eddington accretion flows and jets, andopening the door for comparison studies. we apply a multi-zone jet model to thenew broadband sed, and we compare our results to previous fits to the samesource using the same model at 4-5 decades higher luminosity. we find thatafter a bhxb transitions to the so-called quiescent spectral state, the jetbase becomes more compact (by up to an order of magnitude) and slightly cooler(by at least a factor of two). our preferred model fit indicates that jetparticle acceleration is weaker after the transition into quiescence. that is,accelerated non-thermal particles no longer reach high enough lorentz factorsto contribute significant amounts of synchrotron x-ray emission. instead, thex-ray waveband is dominated by synchrotron self-compton emission from apopulation of mildly relativistic electrons with a quasi-thermal velocitydistribution associated with the jet base. the corresponding (thermal)synchrotron component emits primarily in the infrared through ultravioletwavebands. our results on xte j1118 are consistent with broadband modeling fora0620-00 and for sgr a*. the above could therefore represent a canonicalbaseline geometry for accreting black holes in quiescence. we conclude withsuggestions for future studies to further investigate the above scenario.

1510.02244	as above, so below: exploiting mass scaling in black hole accretion to  break degeneracies in spectral interpretation	over the last decade, the evidence is mounting that several aspects of blackhole accretion physics proceed in a mass-invariant way. one of the bestexamples of this scaling is the empirical "fundamental plane of black holeaccretion" relation linking mass, radio and x-ray luminosity over eight ordersof magnitude in black hole mass. the currently favored theoreticalinterpretation of this relation is that the physics governing power output inweakly accreting black holes depends more on relative accretion rate than onmass. in order to test this theory, we explore whether a mass-invariantapproach can simultaneously explain the broadband spectral energy distributionsfrom two black holes at opposite ends of the mass scale but at similareddington accretion fractions. we find that the same model, with the same valueof several fitted physical parameters expressed in mass-scaling units toenforce self-similarity, can provide a good description of two datasets fromv404 cyg and m81*, a stellar and supermassive black hole, respectively.furthermore, only one of several potential emission scenarios for the x-rayband is successful, suggesting it is the dominant process driving thefundamental plane relation at this accretion rate. this approach thus holdspromise for breaking current degeneracies in the interpretation of black holehigh-energy spectra, and for constructing better prescriptions of black holeaccretion for use in various local and cosmological feedback applications.

astro-ph;0010560	a jet model for the broadband spectrum of xte j1118+480: synchrotron  emission from radio to x-rays in the low/hard spectral state	observations have revealed strong evidence for powerful jets in the low/hardstates of black hole candidate x-ray binaries. correlations, both temporal andspectral, between the radio -- infrared and x-ray bands suggest that jetsynchrotron as well as inverse compton emission could also be significantlycontributing at higher frequencies. we show here that, for reasonableassumptions about the jet physical parameters, the broadband spectrum fromradio through x-rays can be almost entirely fit by synchrotron emission. weexplore a relatively simple model for a relativistic, adiabatically expandingjet combined with a truncated thermal disk conjoined by an adaf, in the contextof the recently discovered black hole binary xte j1118+480. in particular, thex-ray power-law emission can be explained as optically thin synchrotronemission from a shock acceleration region in the innermost part of the jet,with a cutoff determined by cooling losses. for synchrotron cooling-limitedparticle acceleration, the spectral cutoff is a function only of dimensionlessplasma parameters and thus should be around a ``canonical'' value for sourceswith similar plasma properties. it is therefore possible that non-thermal jetemission is important for xte j1118+480 and possibly other x-ray binaries inthe low/hard state.

astro-ph;0111356	the power of jets: new clues from radio circular polarization and x-rays	jets are ubiquitous in accreting black holes. often ignored, they may be amajor contributor to the emitted spectral energy distribution for sub-eddingtonblack holes. for example, recent observations of radio-to-x-ray correlationsand broad band spectra of x-ray binaries in the low/hard state can be explainedby a significant synchrotron contribution from jets also to their ir-to-x-rayspectrum as proposed by markoff, falcke, fender 2001. this model can alsoexplain state-transitions from low/hard to high/soft states. relativisticbeaming of the jet x-ray emission could lead to the appearance of seeminglysuper-eddington x-rays sources in other galaxies. we show that a simplepopulation synthesis model of x-ray binaries with relativistic beaming can wellexplain the currently found distribution of off-nucleus x-ray point sources innearby galaxies. specifically we suggest that the so-called ultra-luminousx-ray sources (ulxs, also ixos) could well be relativistically beamedmicroblazars. the same model that can be used to explain x-ray binaries alsofits low-luminosity agn (llagn) and especially sgr a* in the galactic center.the recent detection of significant circular polarization in agn radio cores,ranging from bright quasars down to low-luminosity agn like m81*, sgr a* andeven x-ray binaries, now places additional new constraints on the mattercontents of such jets. the emerging picture are powerful jets with a mix of hotand cold matter, a net magnetic flux, and a stable magnetic north pole.

astro-ph;0403468	constraining x-ray binary jet models via reflection	although thermal disk emission is suppressed or absent in the hard state ofx-ray binaries, the presence of a cold, thin disk can be inferred fromsignatures of reprocessing in the ~2-50 kev band. the strength of thissignature is dependent on the source spectrum and flux impinging on the disksurface, and is thus very sensitive to the system geometry. the generalweakness of this feature in the hard state has been attributed to either atruncation of the thin disk, large ionization, or beaming of the corona regionaway from the disk with \beta~0.3. this latter velocity is comparable to jetnozzle velocities, so we explore whether a jet can account for the observedreflection fractions. it has been suggested that jets may contribute to thehigh-energy spectra of x-ray binaries, via either synchrotron from around100-1000 r_g along the jet axis or from inverse compton (synchrotronself-compton and/or external compton) from near the base. here we calculate thereflection fraction from jet models wherein either synchrotron or comptonprocesses dominate the emission. using as a guide a data set for gx 339-4,where the reflection fraction previously has been estimated as ~10%, we studythe results for a jet model. we find that the synchrotron case gives &lt; 2%reflection, while a model with predominantly synchrotron self-compton in thebase gives ~10-18%. this shows for the first time that an x-ray binary jet iscapable of significant reflection fractions, and that extreme values of thereflection may be used as a way of discerning the dominant contributions to thex-ray spectrum.

astro-ph;0412140	sgr a* in context: daily flares as a probe of the fundamental x-ray  emission process in accreting black holes	our central galactic supermassive black hole, sgr a*, exists mostly in a verystable, extremely low-luminosity (~10^{-9} l_edd), thermal quiescent state,which is interrupted roughly daily by a brief, nonthermal x-ray flare. becausethey are not accompanied by significant changes in the radio wavelengths, theflares make sgr a* unusual in the context of black holes accreting at slightlyhigher rates. those sources display a radio/x-ray luminosity correlation whosenormalization scales with central mass, and that holds over orders of magnitudein accretion power. there is significant scatter in this correlation, due inpart to measurement uncertainties and intrinsic variability. by studying thecorrelation in sources bracketing sgr a* in radio luminosity and whose physicalparameters are well measured, we can derive a statistical measure of this localscatter. we find that sgr a* in quiescence and the lower intensity flares fallwell below the correlation in x-ray luminosity. the brightest flares areconsistent within the scatter, which may indicate an upper bound on the x-rayluminosity. this trend is suggestive of a state transition at the extreme lowend of accretion activity, only above which the radio/x-ray correlation istracked. this scenario is easily testable because it must fulfill three uniqueobservational predictions: 1) as long as sgr a* remains at its current radioluminosity, no x-ray flare will be seen which statistically exceeds theprediction of the correlation, 2) no source already on the correlation will beseen to flare in the x-rays similar to sgr a* (i.e., without correspondingincreases in the radio luminosity), and 3) sources below a critical accretionrate or luminosity will show similar flares as sgr a*, on timescalesappropriate to their masses.

astro-ph;0501349	multi-wavelength observations of the 2002 outburst of gx 339-4: two  patterns of x-ray-optical/near-infrared behavior	(abridged) we report on rxte and optical/near-infrared (nir) observations ofthe black hole transient gx 339-4, made over a time span of 8 months in 2002and covering the initial rise and transition from a hard to a soft spectralstate. two patterns of correlated x-ray-optical/nir behavior were found. duringthe hard state the optical/nir and x-ray fluxes correlated well, with a nir vs.x-ray flux relation similar to the relation between x-ray and radio fluxesfound in previous studies of gx 339-4 and other black hole binaries. as gx339-4 went through an intermediate state the optical/nir fluxes decreasedrapidly and once it had entered the spectrally soft state, the optical/nirspectrum was much bluer and the ratio of x-ray to nir flux was higher by afactor of more than 10 compared to the hard state. in the spectrally soft statenir-changes preceded those in the x-rays by more than 2 weeks, indicating adisk origin of the nir. we present seds, including radio data, and discusspossible sources for the optical/nir emission. we conclude that in the hardstate this emission probably originates in the optically thin part of a jet andthat in none of the x-ray states x-ray reprocessing is the dominant source ofoptical/nir emission. finally, comparing the light curves from the asm and pcainstruments, we find that the x-ray/nir delay depends critically on thesensitivity of the x-ray detector, with the delay inferred from the pca (ifpresent at all) being a factor of 3-6 times shorter than the delay inferredfrom the asm; this may be important in interpreting previously reportedx-ray-optical/nir lags.

astro-ph;0702637	how to hide large scale outflows: size constraints on the jets of sgr a*	despite significant strides made towards understanding accretion, outflow,and emission processes in the galactic center supermassive black holesagittarius a*, the presence of jets has neither been rejected nor proven. weinvestigate here whether the combined spectral and morphological properties ofthe source at radio through near infrared wavelengths are consistent with thepredictions for inhomogeneous jets. in particular, we construct images of jetsat a wavelength of 7mm based on models that are consistent with the spectrum ofsgr a*. we then compare these models through closure quantities with dataobtained from the very long baseline array at 7mm. we find that the best-fitjet models give comparable or better fits than best-fit gaussian models for theintrinsic source found in previous analyses. the best fitting jet models arebipolar, are highly inclined to the line of sight ($\theta \ge$ 75 degrees),may favor a position angle on the sky of 105 degrees, and have compact baseswith sizes of a few gravitational radii.

0810.2543	probing the accretion disk and central engine structure of ngc4258 with  suzaku and xmm-newton observations	[abridged] we present an x-ray study of the low-luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in ngc4258 using data from suzaku, xmm-newton, and the swift/batsurvey. we find that signatures of x-ray reprocessing by cold gas are very weakin the spectrum of this seyfert-2 galaxy; a weak, narrow fluorescent-kalphaemission line of cold iron is robustly detected in both the suzaku andxmm-newton spectra but at a level much below that of most other seyfert-2galaxies. we conclude that the circumnuclear environment of this agn is very"clean" and lacks the compton-thick obscuring torus of unified seyfert schemes.  from the narrowness of the iron line, together with evidence for line fluxvariability between the suzaku and xmm-newton observations, we constrain theline emitting region to be between $3\times 10^3r_g$ and $4\times 10^4r_g$ fromthe black hole. we show that the observed properties of the iron line can beexplained if the line originates from the surface layers of a warped accretiondisk. in particular, we present explicit calculations of the expected iron linefrom a disk warped by lens-thirring precession from a misaligned central blackhole. finally, the suzaku data reveal clear evidence for large amplitude2-10kev variability on timescales of 50ksec as well as smaller amplitude flareson timescales as short as 5-10ksec. if associated with accretion diskprocesses, such rapid variability requires an origin in the innermost regionsof the disk ($r\approx 10r_g$ or less).

0811.3601	looking to the future: using ir interferometry to study microquasars	infrared interferometry is currently in a rapid development phase, with newinstrumentation soon achieving milliarcsecond spatial resolutions for faintsources and astrometry on the order of 10 microarcseconds. for jet studies inparticular, the next generation of instruments will bring us closer to theevent horizon of supermassive black holes such as sgr a*, and the region wherejet launching must occur. but a new possibility to study microquasars ingeneral and jet physics in particular may also arise, using techniques similarto those employed for finding faint exoplanets around stars. the compact,steady jets observed in the hard state of x-ray binaries display aflat/inverted spectrum from the lower radio wavelengths up through at least thefar-ir band. somewhere above this band, a turnover is predicted where the jetsbecome optically thin, revealing a power-law spectrum. this break may have beenobserved directly in gx339-4, but in most sources such a feature is likelyhidden under bright emission from the stellar companion or accretion diskcomponents. detecting the exact location of this break would provide a newconstraint on our models of jet physics, since the break frequency is dependenton the total power, as well as internal density and magnetic field.furthermore, knowing the break location combined with the spectral index of thepower-law would help constrain the amount of synchrotron emission contributedby the jets to the x-ray bands. along with a summary of some potentialobservations requiring less optimal instrumental specifications, i will discussa technique which may enable us to discern the jet break, and the chances ofsuccess based on theoretical models applied to some potential target sources.
