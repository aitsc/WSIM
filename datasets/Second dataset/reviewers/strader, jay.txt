0901.1693	an ultra compact dwarf around the sombrero galaxy (m104): the nearest  massive ucd	we report the discovery of an ultra compact dwarf (ucd) associated with thesombrero galaxy (m104). this is the closest massive ucd known and the firstspectroscopically verified massive ucd which is located in a low densityenvironment.  the object, we name sucd1, was identified in hst/acs imaging and confirmed tobe associated with the sombrero galaxy by its recession velocity obtained fromkeck spectra. the light profile is well fitted by a wilson model. we measure ahalf light size of 14.7 +/- 1.4 pc, an absolute magnitude of m_v = -12.3 mag(m_k = -15.1 mag) and an internal velocity dispersion of 25.0 +/- 5.6 km/s.such values are typical of ucds. from lick spectral indices we measure aluminosity-weighted central age of 12.6 +/- 0.9 gyrs, [fe/h] of -0.08 +/- 0.08dex and [alpha/fe] of 0.06 +/- 0.07 dex. the lack of colour gradients suggeststhese values are representative of the entire ucd. the derived stellar andvirial masses are the same, within errors, at ~3.3 x 10e7 msun. thus we find nostrong evidence for dark matter or the need to invoke a non-standard imf.  we also report arguably the first x-ray detection of a bona fide ucd, whichwe attribute to the presence of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). the x-rayluminosity of l_x = 0.56 x 10e38 erg/s is consistent with the values observedfor gcs of the same metallicity. overall we find sucd1 has properties similarto other known ucds and massive gcs.

0903.4364	evidence for the disky origin of luminous virgo dwarf ellipticals from  the kinematics of their globular cluster systems	we report evidence for dynamically significant rotation in the globularcluster systems of two luminous virgo dwarf ellipticals, vcc1261 and vcc1528.including previous results for vcc1087, the globular cluster systems of allthree virgo dwarf ellipticals studied in detail to date exhibit v_rot/sigma &gt;1. taking the rotation seen in the globular clusters as maximal disk rotation,we find all three des lie on the r-band tully-fisher relation. we argue thatthese data support the hypothesis that luminous des are the remnants oftransformed disk galaxies. we also obtained deep, longslit data for the starsin vcc1261 and vcc1528. both these galaxies show rapid rotation in their innerregions, with spatial scales of ~0.5 kpc. these rotation velocities are similarto those seen in the gc systems. since our longslit data for virgo des extendout to 1-2 effective radii (typical of deep observations), whereas the globularclusters extend out to 4--7 effective radii, we conclude that non-detections ofrotation in many luminous des may simply be due to a lack of radial coverage inthe stellar data, and that globular clusters represent singularly sensitiveprobes of the dynamics of des. based on these data, we suggest that gas disksare significant sites of globular cluster formation in the early universe.

0905.4424	probing the 2-d kinematic structure of early-type galaxies out to 3  effective radii	we detail an innovative new technique for measuring the 2-d velocity moments(rotation velocity, velocity dispersion and gauss-hermite coefficients h$_3$and h$_4$) of the stellar populations of galaxy halos using spectra from keckdeimos multi-object spectroscopic observations. the data are used toreconstruct 2-d rotation velocity maps.  here we present data for five nearby early-type galaxies to ~3 effectiveradii. we provide significant insights into the global kinematic structure ofthese galaxies, and challenge the accepted morphological classification inseveral cases. we show that between 1-3 effective radii the velocity dispersiondeclines very slowly, if at all, in all five galaxies. for the two galaxieswith velocity dispersion profiles available from planetary nebulae data we findvery good agreement with our stellar profiles. we find a variety of rotationprofiles beyond 1 effective radius, i.e rotation speed remaining constant,decreasing \emph{and} increasing with radius. these results are of particularimportance to studies which attempt to classify galaxies by their kinematicstructure within one effective radius, such as the recent definition of fast-and slow- rotator classes by the sauron project. our data suggests that therotator class may change when larger galacto-centric radii are probed. this hasimportant implications for dynamical modeling of early-type galaxies. the datafrom this study are available on-line.

1002.1107	deriving metallicities from the integrated spectra of extragalactic  globular clusters using the near-infrared calcium triplet	the ca triplet (cat) feature in the near-infrared has been employed as ametallicity indicator for individual stars as well as integrated light ofgalactic globular clusters (gcs) and galaxies with varying degrees of success,and sometimes puzzling results. using the deimos multi-object spectrograph onkeck we obtain a sample of 144 integrated light spectra of gcs around thebrightest group galaxy ngc 1407 to test whether the cat index can be used as ametallicity indicator for extragalactic gcs. different sets of single stellarpopulation models make different predictions for the behavior of the cat as afunction of metallicity. in this work, the metallicities of the gcs around ngc1407 are obtained from cat index values using an empirical conversion. themeasured cat/metallicity distributions show unexpected features, the mostremarkable being that the brightest red and blue gcs have similar cat valuesdespite their large difference in mean color. suggested explanations for thisbehavior in the ngc 1407 gc system are: 1) the cat may be affected by apopulation of hot blue stars, 2) the cat may saturate earlier than predicted bythe models, and/or 3) color may not trace metallicity linearly. until thesepossibilities are understood, the use of the cat as a metallicity indicator forthe integrated spectra of extragalactic gcs will remain problematic.

1012.4802	direct evidence for an enhancement of helium in giant stars in omega  centauri	the double main sequence identified in the globular cluster omega centaurihas been interpreted using isochrones to indicate a large variation in theabundance of helium. if true, a helium enhancement carries strong implicationsfor the chemical and stellar evolutionary history of this cluster. however,only indirect measures currently support this conjecture. we report thediscovery of a variation in the line strength of the near-infrared he i 10830 atransition in twelve similar red giants in omega centauri observed with phoenixon gemini-s. abundances of these stars derived from magellan/mike spectra takenat las campanas observatory show that the helium transition is not detected inthe most metal-poor population ([fe/h] &lt; -1.8), yet is present in the majorityof stars with [fe/h] &gt;= -1.8. these observations give the first direct evidencefor an enhancement of helium in omega centauri. the appearance of heliumappears better correlated with increased [al/fe] and [na/fe] abundances than asa function of [fe/h], giving observational support to the presence ofhigh-temperature h-burning in a prior generation of stars.

1101.3575	evidence for two phases of galaxy formation from radial trends in the  globular cluster system of ngc 1407	here we present the colours of individual globular clusters (gcs) around themassive elliptical galaxy ngc 1407 out to a projected galactocentric radius of140 kpc or 17 galaxy effective radii (r$_e$). such data are a proxy for thehalo metallicity. we find steep, and similar, metallicity gradients of ~ -0.4dex per dex for both the blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) gcsubpopulations within 5-8.5 r_e (40-70 kpc). at larger radii the mean gccolours (metallicity) are constant. a similar behaviour is seen in a wide-fieldstudy of m87's gc system, and in our own galaxy. we interpret these radialmetallicity trends to indicate an inner region formed by early in-situdissipative processes and an outer halo formed by ongoing accretion of low massgalaxies and their gcs. these results provide observational support for themodel of galaxy formation whereby massive galaxies form inside-out in twophases. we have also searched the literature for other massive early-typegalaxies with reported gc metallicity gradients in their inner regions. noobvious correlation with galaxy mass or environment is found but the sample iscurrently small.

1104.4649	star clusters in m31: v. internal dynamical trends: some troublesome,  some reassuring	we present internal velocity dispersions and precise radial velocities for200 globular clusters (gcs) in m31 that are derived using new high-resolutionspectra from mmt/hectochelle. of these, 163 also have king model structuralparameters that allow us to estimate their mass-to-light ratios. this is, byfar, the largest such dataset available for any galaxy, including the milkyway. these data strongly confirm earlier suggestions that the optical andnear-infrared mass-to-light ratios of m31 gcs decline with increasingmetallicity. this behavior is the opposite of that predicted by stellarpopulation models for a standard initial mass function. we show that thisphenomenon does not appear to be caused by standard dynamical evolution. ashallower mass function for metal-rich gcs (with dn/dm ~ m^-0.8 to m^-1.3 belowone solar mass) can explain the bulk of extant observations. we also observe aconsistent, monotonic correlation between mass-to-light ratio and cluster mass.this correlation, in contrast to the correlation with metallicity, iswell-explained by the accepted model of dynamical evolution of gcs through masssegregation and the preferential loss of low-mass stars, and these data areamong the best available to constrain this process.

1112.2213	evidence for inhomogeneous reionization in the local universe from  metal-poor globular cluster systems	exploiting a fundamental characteristic of galaxy assembly in the{\lambda}cdm paradigm, the observed spatial biasing and kinematics ofmetal-poor globular star clusters are used to constrain the local reionizationepoch around individual galaxies. selecting three galaxies located in differentenvironments, the first attempt at constraining the environmental propagationof reionization in the local universe is carried out. the joint constraint fromthe three galaxies (z_reion = 10.5^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) agrees remarkably well withthe latest wmap constraint on z_reion for a simple instantaneous reionizationmodel. more importantly, the range of z_reion values found here are consistentwith the global range of z_reion estimates from other observations. wefurthermore find a 1.7{\sigma} indication that reionization completed inlow-density environments before the intergalactic medium in high-densityenvironments was reionized. this is consistent with certain theoretical modelsthat predict that reionization was globally prolonged in duration, with neutralhydrogen pockets surviving in high-density environments, even after thesurrounding regions were reionized. more generally, this work provides a usefulconstraint on the formation history of galaxy stellar halos.

1203.2608	"galaxy," defined	a growing number of low luminosity and low surface brightness astronomicalobjects challenge traditional notions of both galaxies and star clusters. toaddress this, we propose a definition of galaxy independent of the cold darkmatter model of the universe: a galaxy is a gravitationally bound set of starswhose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and newton'slaws of gravity. after exploring observational diagnostics of this definition,we examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters,ultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. while kinematic studies provide aneffective galaxy diagnostic in many regimes, they can be less useful forcompact or faint systems. to explore the use of [fe/h] spread as acomplementary diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [fe/h] measurements of16 milky way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to calculate their [fe/h] spreadsand uncertainties. our principal results are: (i) no old star cluster lessluminous then m_v = -10 has a significant (&gt; 0.1 dex) spread in iron; (ii)known ultra-faint dwarfs can be classified with a combination of kinematics and[fe/h]; (iii) the observed [fe/h] spreads in massive (&gt; 10^6 m_sun) globularclusters do not necessarily imply they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor aneed for dark matter; and (iv) if ultra-compact dwarfs reside in dark matterhalos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, thenthey will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter. we suggestmeasurements that may assist future classification of massive globularclusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and ultra-faint galaxies. our galaxy definitionis designed to be independent of the details of current observations andmodels, while our proposed diagnostics can be refined or replaced as ourunderstanding of the universe evolves.

1209.3188	space-based uv/optical wide-field imaging and spectroscopy: near-field  cosmology and galaxy evolution using globular clusters in nearby galaxies	star formation plays a central role in the evolution of galaxies and of theuniverse as a whole. studies of star-forming regions in the local universe haveshown that star formation typically occurs in a clustered fashion. building acoherent picture of how star clusters form and evolve is therefore critical toour overall understanding of the star formation process. most clusters disruptafter they form, thus contributing to the field star population. however, themost massive and dense clusters remain bound and survive for a hubble time.these globular clusters provide unique observational probes of the formationhistory of their host galaxies. in particular, the age and metallicity can bedetermined for each globular cluster individually, allowing the distribution ofages and metallicities within host galaxies to be constrained. we show howspace-based uv-to-near-ir imaging covering a wide field of view (&gt;= 20 arcminper axis) and deep uv/optical multi-object spectroscopy of globular clustersystems in nearby galaxies would allow one to place important new constraintson the formation history of early-type galaxies and their structuralsubcomponents (e.g., bulge, halo).

1209.4351	the sluggs survey: kinematics for over 2500 globular clusters in twelve  early-type galaxies	we present a spectro-photometric survey of 2522 extragalactic globularclusters (gcs) around twelve early-type galaxies, nine of which have not beenpublished previously. combining space-based and multi-colour wide fieldground-based imaging, with spectra from the keck deimos instrument, we obtainan average of 160 gc radial velocities per galaxy, with a high velocityprecision of 15 km/s per gc. after studying the photometric properties of thegc systems, such as their spatial and colour distributions, we focus on thekinematics of metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) gc subpopulations to anaverage distance of ~8 effective radii from the galaxy centre. our results showthat for some systems the bimodality in gc colour is also present in gckinematics. the kinematics of the red gc subpopulations are strongly coupledwith the host galaxy stellar kinematics. the blue gc subpopulations are moredominated by random motions, especially in the outer regions, and decoupledfrom the red gcs. peculiar gc kinematic profiles are seen in some galaxies: theblue gcs in ngc 821 rotate along the galaxy minor axis, whereas the gc systemof the lenticular galaxy ngc 7457 appears to be strongly rotation supported inthe outer region. we supplement our galaxy sample with data from the literatureand carry out a number of tests to study the kinematic differences between thetwo gc subpopulations. we confirm that the gc kinematics are coupled with thehost galaxy properties and find that the velocity kurtosis and the slope oftheir velocity dispersion profiles is different between the two gcsubpopulations in more massive galaxies.

1209.5390	the sluggs survey: ngc 3115, a critical test case for metallicity  bimodality in globular cluster systems	due to its proximity (9 mpc) and the strongly bimodal color distribution ofits spectroscopically well-sampled globular cluster (gc) system, the early-typegalaxy ngc 3115 provides one of the best available tests of whether the colorbimodality widely observed in gc systems generally reflects a true metallicitybimodality. color bimodality has alternatively been attributed to a stronglynonlinear color--metallicity relation reflecting the influence of hothorizontal branch stars. here we couple subaru suprime-cam gi photometry withkeck/deimos spectroscopy to accurately measure gc colors and a cat index thatmeasures the caii triplet. we find the ngc 3115 gc system to be unambiguouslybimodal in both color and the cat index. using simple stellar populationmodels, we show that the cat index is essentially unaffected by variations inhorizontal branch morphology over the range of metallicities relevant to gcsystems (and is thus a robust indicator of metallicity) and confirm bimodalityin the metallicity distribution. we assess the existing evidence for andagainst multiple metallicity subpopulations in early and late-type galaxies andconclude that metallicity bi/multimodality is common. we briefly discuss howthis fundamental characteristic links directly to the star formation andassembly histories of galaxies.

1210.0901	two stellar-mass black holes in the globular cluster m22	hundreds of stellar-mass black holes likely form in a typical globular starcluster, with all but one predicted to be ejected through dynamicalinteractions. some observational support for this idea is provided by the lackof x-ray-emitting binary stars comprising one black hole and one other star("black-hole/x-ray binaries") in milky way globular clusters, even though manyneutron-star/x-ray binaries are known. although a few black holes have beenseen in globular clusters around other galaxies, the masses of these cannot bedetermined, and some may be intermediate-mass black holes that form throughexotic mechanisms. here we report the presence of two flat-spectrum radiosources in the milky way globular cluster m22, and we argue that these objectsare black holes of stellar mass (each ~ 10-20 times more massive than the sun)that are accreting matter. we find a high ratio of radio-to-x-ray flux forthese black holes, consistent with the larger predicted masses of black holesin globular clusters compared to those outside. the identification of two blackholes in one cluster shows that the ejection of black holes is not as efficientas predicted by most models, and we argue that m22 may contain a totalpopulation of ~ 5-100 black holes. the large core radius of m22 could arisefrom heating produced by the black holes.

1306.5245	filling the gap: a new class of old star cluster?	it is not understood whether long-lived star clusters possess a continuousrange of sizes and masses (and hence densities), or if rather, they should beconsidered as distinct types with different origins. utilizing the hubble spacetelescope (hst) to measure sizes, and long exposures on the keck 10m telescopeto obtain distances, we have discovered the first confirmed star clusters thatlie within a previously claimed size-luminosity gap dubbed the `avoidance zone'by hwang et al (2011). the existence of these star clusters extends the rangeof sizes, masses and densities for star clusters, and argues against currentformation models that predict well-defined size-mass relationships (such asstripped nuclei, giant globular clusters or merged star clusters). the redcolours of these gap objects suggests that they are not a new class of objectbut are related to faint fuzzies observed in nearby lenticular galaxies. wealso report a number of low luminosity ucds with sizes of up to 50 pc. future,statistically complete, studies will be encouraged now that it is known thatstar clusters possess a continuous range of structural properties.

1306.6624	a radio-selected black hole x-ray binary candidate in the milky way  globular cluster m62	we report the discovery of a candidate stellar-mass black hole in the milkyway globular cluster m62. we detected the black hole candidate, which we termm62-vla1, in the core of the cluster using deep radio continuum imaging fromthe karl g. jansky very large array. m62-vla1 is a faint source, with a fluxdensity of 18.7 +/- 1.9 microjy at 6.2 ghz and a flat radio spectrum(alpha=-0.24 +/- 0.42, for s_nu = nu^alpha). m62 is the second milky waycluster with a candidate stellar-mass black hole; unlike the two candidateblack holes previously found in the cluster m22, m62-vla1 is associated with achandra x-ray source, supporting its identification as a black hole x-raybinary. measurements of its radio and x-ray luminosity, while not simultaneous,place m62-vla1 squarely on the well-established radio--x-ray correlation forstellar-mass black holes. in archival hubble space telescope imaging, m62-vla1is coincident with a star near the lower red giant branch. this possibleoptical counterpart shows a blue excess, h alpha emission, and opticalvariability. the radio, x-ray, and optical properties of m62-vla1 are verysimilar to those for v404 cyg, one of the best-studied quiescent stellar-massblack holes. we cannot yet rule out alternative scenarios for the radio source,such as a flaring neutron star or background galaxy; future observations arenecessary to determine whether m62-vla1 is indeed an accreting stellar-massblack hole.

1308.3531	the sluggs survey: outer triaxiality of the fast rotator elliptical ngc  4473	systematic surveys of nearby early type galaxies (etgs) using integral fieldunit spectrograph (ifu) data have revealed that galaxies can hide interestingstructures only visible through kinematic studies. as part of their pioneeringwork, the atlas3d team have shown that most morphologically elliptical galaxiesare centrally kinematically disk-like. hence, while global morphology suggeststhat ellipticals are ellipsoidal/triaxial in shape, their central kinematicsmay be consistent with (inclined) oblate systems.  here we study the fast rotator elliptical galaxy: ngc 4473. using slitlets,we obtain galaxy light kinematics out to unprecedentedly large galactocentricradii (2.5 effective radii). while we confirm the ifu results in the centralregions, we find that at large galactocentric radii ngc 4473 exhibits akinematic transition. in the outskirts, we observe clear minor and major axisrotation, a tell-tale sign of triaxiality, which agrees well with the galaxy'shubble type.  this outer "kinematically distinct halo" (kdh) may be expected fromsimulations of galaxy formation, and in this system contains around one-thirdof the stellar light. while this galaxy may be a special case, it suggestsfurther investigation of the outskirts of galaxies is needed to confirm the newparadigm of galaxy classification.

1405.2338	the sluggs survey: exploring the metallicity gradients of nearby  early-type galaxies to large radii	stellar metallicity gradients in the outer regions of galaxies are a criticaltool for disentangling the contributions of in-situ and ex-situ formed stars.in the two-phase galaxy formation scenario, the initial gas collapse createssteep metallicity gradients, while the accretion of stars formed in satellitestends to flatten these gradients in the outskirts, particularly for massivegalaxies. this work presents the first compilation of extended metallicityprofiles over a wide range of galaxy mass. we use the deimos spectrograph onthe keck telescope in multi-slit mode to obtain radial stellar metallicityprofiles for 22 nearby early-type galaxies. from the calcium triplet lines inthe near-infrared we measure the metallicity of the starlight up to 3 effectiveradii. we find a relation between the outer metallicity gradient and galaxymass, in the sense that lower mass systems show steeper metallicity gradientsthan more massive galaxies. this result is consistent with a picture in whichthe ratio of ex-situ to in-situ formed stars is lower in less massive galaxiesas a consequence of the smaller contribution by accretion. in addition, weinfer a correlation between the strength of the calcium triplet feature in thenear-infrared and the stellar initial mass function slope that is consistentwith recent models in the literature.

1406.6065	the aimss project i: bridging the star cluster - galaxy divide	we describe the structural and kinematic properties of the first compactstellar systems discovered by the aimss project. these spectroscopicallyconfirmed objects have sizes ($\sim$6 $&lt;$ r$_{\rm e}$ [pc] $&lt;$ 500) and masses($\sim$2$\times$10$^{6}$ $&lt;$ m$_*$/m$_\odot$ $&lt;$ 6$\times$10$^{9}$) spanningthe range of massive globular clusters (gcs), ultra compact dwarfs (ucds) andcompact elliptical galaxies (ces), completely filling the gap between starclusters and galaxies.  several objects are close analogues to the prototypical ce, m32. theseobjects, which are more massive than previously discovered ucds of the samesize, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend forcompact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for auniversal "zone of avoidance" for dynamically hot stellar systems in themass-size plane.  overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1)massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. our dataprovide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type ucd/ce populationinto two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by thestripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formedthrough the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues ofclassical ellipticals. we find compact stellar systems around galaxies in lowto high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processesresponsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.

1407.2726	constraining globular cluster formation through studies of young massive  clusters - iii. a lack of gas and dust in massive stellar clusters in the lmc  and smc	scenarios that invoke multiple episodes of star formation within youngglobular clusters (gcs) to explain the observed chemical and photometricanomalies in gcs, require that clusters can retain the stellar ejecta of thestars within them and accrete large amounts of gas from their surroundings.hence, it should be possible to find young massive clusters in the localuniverse that contain significant amounts ($&gt;10$\%) of the cluster mass of gasand/or dust within them. recent theoretical studies have suggested thatclusters in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) with masses in excess of$10^4$\msun\, and ages between $30$ and $\sim300$~myr, should contain such gasreservoirs. we have searched for \hi\ gas within 12 lmc (and 1 smc) clustersand also for dust using {\em spitzer} 70\micron\ and 160\micron\ images. noclusters were found to contain gas and/or dust. while two of the clusters have\hi\ at the same (projected) position and velocity, the gas does not appear tobe centred on the clusters, but rather part of nearby clouds or filaments,suggesting that the gas and cluster are not directly related. this lack of gas($&lt;1$\% of the stellar mass) is in strong tension with model predictions, andmay be due to higher stellar feedback than has been previously assumed or dueto the assumptions used in the previous calculations.

1408.2558	the aimss project ii: dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios across the star  cluster - galaxy divide	the previously clear division between small galaxies and massive starclusters is now occupied by objects called ultra compact dwarfs (ucds) andcompact ellipticals (ces). here we combine a sample of ucds and ces withvelocity dispersions from the aimss project with literature data to exploretheir dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios.  we confirm that the mass ratios of many ucds in the stellar mass range 10$^6$-- 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$ are systematically higher than those for globularclusters which have mass ratios near unity. however, at the very highest massesin our sample, i.e. 10$^9$ -- 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, we find that ce galaxiesalso have mass ratios of close to unity, indicating their central regions aremostly composed of stars.  suggested explanations for the elevated mass ratios of ucds have included avariable imf, a central black hole, and the presence of dark matter. here wepresent another possible explanation, i.e. tidal stripping. under variousassumptions, we find that the apparent variation in the mass ratio with stellarmass and stellar density can be qualitatively reproduced by published tidalstripping simulations of a dwarf elliptical galaxy. in the early stages of thestripping process the galaxy is unlikely to be in virial equilibrium. at latestages, the final remnant resembles the properties of $\sim$10$^7$ m$_{\odot}$ucds. finally, we discuss the need for more detailed realistic modelling oftidal stripping over a wider range of parameter space, and observations tofurther test the stripping hypothesis.

1409.4769	a supermassive black hole in an ultracompact dwarf galaxy	ultracompact dwarf galaxies (ucds) are among the densest stellar systems inthe universe. these systems have masses up to 200 million solar masses, buthalf light radii of just 3-50 parsecs. dynamical mass estimates show that manyucds are more massive than expected from their luminosity. it remains unclearwhether these high dynamical mass estimates are due to the presence ofsupermassive black holes or result from a non-standard stellar initial massfunction that causes the average stellar mass to be higher than expected. herewe present the detection of a supermassive black hole in a massive ucd.adaptive optics kinematic data of m60-ucd1 show a central velocity dispersionpeak above 100 km/s and modest rotation. dynamical modeling of these datareveals the presence of a supermassive black hole with mass of 21 million solarmasses. this is 15% of the object's total mass. the high black hole mass andmass fraction suggest that m60-ucd1 is the stripped nucleus of a galaxy. ouranalysis also shows that m60-ucd1's stellar mass is consistent with itsluminosity, implying many other ucds may also host supermassive black holes.this suggests a substantial population of previously unnoticed supermassiveblack holes.

1409.8676	the sluggs survey: globular cluster stellar population trends from weak  absorption lines in stacked spectra	as part of the sluggs survey, we stack 1137 keck deimos spectra of globularclusters from 10 galaxies to study their stellar populations in detail. thestacked spectra have median signal to noise ratios of $\sim 90$ \aa$^{-1}$.besides the calcium triplet, we study weaker sodium, magnesium, titanium andiron lines as well as the h$\alpha$ and higher order paschen hydrogen lines. ingeneral, the stacked spectra are consistent with old ages and a milky way-likeinitial mass function. however, we see different metal line index strengths atfixed colour and magnitude, and differences in the calcium triplet--colourrelation from galaxy to galaxy. we interpret this as strong evidence forvariations in the globular cluster colour--metallicity relation betweengalaxies. two possible explanations for the colour--metallicity relationvariations are that the average ages of globular clusters vary from galaxy togalaxy or that the average abundances of light elements (i.e. he, c, n and o)differ between galaxies. stacking spectra by magnitude, we see that the coloursbecome redder and metal line indices stronger with brighter magnitudes. thesetrends are consistent with the previously reported `blue tilts' beingmass--metallicity relations.

1411.1763	measuring consistent masses for 25 milky way globular clusters	we present central velocity dispersions, masses, mass to light ratios($m/l$s), and rotation strengths for 25 galactic globular clusters. we deriveradial velocities of 1951 stars in 12 globular clusters from single orderspectra taken with hectochelle on the mmt telescope. to this sample we add ananalysis of available archival data of individual stars. for the full set ofdata we fit king models to derive consistent dynamical parameters for theclusters. we find good agreement between single mass king models and theobserved radial dispersion profiles. the large, uniform sample of dynamicalmasses we derive enables us to examine trends of $m/l$ with cluster mass andmetallicity. the overall values of $m/l$ and the trends with mass andmetallicity are consistent with existing measurements from a large sample ofm31 clusters. this includes a clear trend of increasing $m/l$ with clustermass, and lower than expected $m/l$s for the metal-rich clusters. we find noclear trend of increasing rotation with increasing cluster metallicitysuggested in previous work.

1412.2752	detection of a distinct metal-poor stellar halo in the early-type galaxy  ngc 3115	we present the resolved stellar populations in the inner and outer halo ofthe nearby lenticular galaxy ngc~3115. using deep hst observations, we analyzestars two magnitudes fainter than the tip of the red giant branch (trgb). westudy three fields along the minor axis of this galaxy, 19, 37 and 54 kpc fromits center -- corresponding to 7, 14, 21 effective radii (r_{e}). even at theselarge galactocentric distances, all of the fields are dominated by a relativelyenriched population, with the main peak in the metallicity distributiondecreasing with radius from [z/h] ~ -0.5 to -0.65. the fraction of metal-poorstars ([z/h] &lt; -0.95) increases from 17%, at 16-37 kpc, to 28%, at ~54 kpc. weobserve a distinct low metallicity population (peaked at [z/h] ~ -1.3 and withtotal mass 2*10^{10}m_{\odot} ~ 14% of the galaxy's stellar mass) and arguethat this represents the detection of an underlying low metallicity stellarhalo. such halos are generally predicted by galaxy formation theories and havebeen observed in several late type galaxies including the milky way and m31.the metallicity and spatial distribution of the stellar halo of ngc~3115 areconsistent with the galaxy's globular cluster system, which has a similar lowmetallicity population that becomes dominant at these large radii. this findingsupports the use of globular clusters as bright chemo-dynamical tracers ofgalaxy halos. these data also allow us to make a precise measurement of themagnitude of the trgb, from which we derive a distance modulus of ngc~3115 of30.05\pm0.05\pm0.10_{sys} (10.2\pm0.2\pm0.5_{sys} mpc).

1502.06598	how elevated is the dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of the ultra-compact  dwarf s999?	here we present new keck esi high-resolution spectroscopy and deep archivalhst/acs imaging for s999, an ultra-compact dwarf in the vicinity of m87, whichwas claimed to have an extremely high dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio. our dataincrease the total integration times by a factor of 5 and 60 for spectroscopyand imaging, respectively. this allows us to constrain the stellar populationparameters for the first time (simple stellar population equivalent age$=7.6^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ gyr; $[z/\textrm{h}]=-0.95^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$;$[\alpha/\textrm{fe}]=0.34^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$). assuming a kroupa stellar initialmass function, the stellar population parameters and luminosity($m_{f814w}=-12.13\pm0.06$ mag) yield a stellar mass of$m_*=3.9^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\times10^6 m_{\odot}$, which we also find to beconsistent with near-infrared data. via mass modelling, with our newmeasurements of velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{ap}=27\pm2$ km s$^{-1}$) and size($r_e=20.9\pm1.0$ pc), we obtain an elevated dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio$m_{dyn}/m_*=8.2$ (with a range $5.6\le m_{dyn}/m_* \le 11.2$). furthermore, weanalyse the surface brightness profile of s999, finding only a small excess oflight in the outer parts with respect to the fitted s\'ersic profile, and apositive colour gradient. taken together these observations suggest that s999is the remnant of a much larger galaxy that has been tidally stripped. if so,the observed elevated mass ratio may be caused by mechanisms related to thestripping process: the existence of an massive central black hole or internalkinematics that are out of equilibrium due to the stripping event. given theobserved dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio we suggest that s999 is an idealcandidate to search for the presence of an overly massive central black hole.

1503.00726	radial distributions of sub-populations in the globular cluster m15: a  more centrally concentrated primordial population	we examine the radial distributions of stellar populations in the globularcluster (gc) m15, using hst/wfc3 photometry of red giants in thenitrogen-sensitive f343n-f555w color. surprisingly, we find that giants with"primordial" composition (i.e., n abundances similar to those in field stars)are the most centrally concentrated within the wfc3 field. we then combine ourwfc3 data with sdss u, g photometry and find that the trend reverses for radii&gt;1' (3 pc) where the ratio of primordial to n-enhanced giants increasesoutwards, as already found by lardo et al. the ratio of primordial to enrichedstars thus has a u-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near thehalf-light radius. n-body simulations show that mass segregation might producea trend resembling the observed one, but only if the n-enhanced giants are~0.25 mo less massive than the primordial giants, which requires extreme heenhancement (y~0.40). however, such a large difference in y is incompatiblewith the negligible optical color differences between primordial and enrichedgiants which suggest delta y &lt; 0.03 and thus a difference in turn-off mass ofdelta m &lt; 0.04 mo between the different populations. the radial trends in m15are thus unlikely to be of dynamical origin and presumably reflect initialconditions, a result that challenges all current gc formation scenarios. wenote that population gradients in the central regions of gcs remain poorlyinvestigated and may show a more diverse behavior than hitherto thought.

1504.00075	small scatter and nearly-isothermal mass profiles to four half-light  radii from two-dimensional stellar dynamics of early-type galaxies	we study the total mass-density profile for a sample of 14 fast-rotatorearly-type galaxies (stellar masses $10.2&lt;\log m_\ast/m_\odot&lt;11.7$). wecombine observations from the sluggs and atlas3d surveys to map out the stellarkinematics in two-dimensions, out to a median radius for the sample of fourhalf-light radii $r_e$ (or 10 kpc), and a maximum radius of 2.0-6.2 $r_e$ (or4-21 kpc). we use axisymmetric dynamical models based on the jeans equations,which allow for a spatially varying anisotropy, and employ quite generalprofiles for the dark halos, and in particular do not place any restriction onthe profile slope. this is made possible by the availability of spatiallyextended two-dimensional kinematics. we find that our relatively simple modelsprovide a remarkably good description of the observed kinematics. the resultingtotal density profiles are well described by a nearly-isothermal power law$\rho_{\rm tot}(r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ from $r_e$/10 to at least 4$r_e$, thelargest average deviation being 11%. the average logarithmic slope is$\langle\gamma\rangle=2.19\pm0.03$ with observed rms scatter of just$\sigma_\gamma=0.11$. this scatter out to large radii, where dark matterdominates, is as small as previously reported by lensing studies around$r\approx r_e/2$, where the stars dominate. our bulge-halo conspiracy placesmuch tighter constraints on galaxy formation models. it illustrates the powerof two-dimensional stellar kinematics observations at large radii. it would nowbe important to test the generality of our results for different galaxy typesand larger samples.

1504.03325	the sluggs survey: multi-population dynamical modelling of the  elliptical galaxy ngc 1407 from stars and globular clusters	we perform in-depth dynamical modelling of the luminous and dark matter (dm)content of the elliptical galaxy ngc 1407. our strategy consists of solving thespherical jeans equations for three independent dynamical tracers: stars, bluegcs and red gcs in a self-consistent manner. we adopt a maximum-likelihoodmarkov-chain monte carlo fitting technique in the attempt to constrain theinner slope of the dm density profile (the cusp/core problem), and the stellarinitial mass function (imf) of the galaxy. we find the inner logarithmic slopeof the dm density profiles to be $\gamma = 0.6\pm0.4$, which is consistent witheither a dm cusp ($\gamma = 1$) or with a dm core $(\gamma = 0)$. our findingsare consistent with a salpeter imf, and marginally consistent with a kroupaimf. we infer tangential orbits for the blue gcs, and radial anisotropy for redgcs and stars. the modelling results are consistent with the virialmass--concentration relation predicted by $\lambda$cdm simulations. the virialmass of ngc 1407 is $\log$ $m_{\rm vir} = 13.3 \pm 0.2 m_{\odot}$, whereas thestellar mass is $\log m_* = 11.8 \pm 0.1 m_{\odot}$. the overall uncertaintieson the mass of ngc 1407 are only 5 per cent at the projected stellar effectiveradius. we attribute the disagreement between our results and previous x-rayresults to the gas not being in hydrostatic equilibrium in the central regionsof the galaxy. the halo of ngc 1407 is found be dm dominated, with a dynamicalmass-to-light ratio of $m/l=260_{-100} ^{+174} m_{\odot}/l_{\odot, b}$.however, this value can be larger up to a factor of 3 depending on the assumedprior on the dm scale radius.

1505.04795	the sluggs survey: combining stellar and globular cluster metallicities  in the outer regions of early-type galaxies	the outer halo regions of early-type galaxies carry key information abouttheir past accretion history. however, spectroscopically probing the stellarcomponent at such galactocentric radii is still challenging. using keck/deimos,we have been able to measure the metallicities of the stellar and globularcluster components in 12 early-type galaxies out to more than $10~\rm{r_{e}}$.we find similar metallicity gradients for the metal-poor and metal-richglobular cluster subpopulations, suggesting a common formation process for thetwo subpopulations. this is in conflict with most current theoreticalpredictions, where the metal-poor globular clusters are thought to be purelyaccreted and metal-rich globular clusters mostly formed in-situ. moreover, wefind that the globular cluster metallicity gradients show a trend with galaxymass, being steeper in lower-mass galaxies than in higher-mass galaxies. thisis similar to what we find for the outermost galaxy stars and suggests a moreactive accretion history, with a larger role played by major mergers, in themost massive galaxies. this conclusion is qualitatively consistent withexpectations from two-phase galaxy assembly models. finally, we find that thesmall difference in metallicity between galaxy stars and metal-rich globularclusters at $1~\rm{r_{e}}$ may correlate with galaxy mass. the origin of thisdifference is not currently clear.

1506.06820	the sluggs survey: inferring the formation epochs of metal-poor and  metal-rich globular clusters	we present a novel, observationally-based framework for the formation epochsand sites of globular clusters (gcs) in a cosmological context. measuringdirectly the mean ages of the metal-poor and metal-rich gc subpopulations inour own galaxy, and in other galaxies, is observationally challenging. here weapply an alternative approach utilising the property that the galaxymass-metallicity relation is a strong function of redshift (or look-back age)but is relatively insensitive to galaxy mass for massive galaxies. assumingthat gcs follow galaxy mass-metallicity relations that evolve with redshift,one can estimate the mean formation epochs of the two gc subpopulations byknowing their mean metallicities and the growth in host galaxy mass withredshift. recently, the sluggs survey has measured the spectroscopicmetallicities for over 1000 gcs in a dozen massive early-type galaxies. here weuse these measurements, and our new metallicity matching method, to infer amean age for metal-rich gcs of 11.5 gyr (z = 2.9) and a range of 12.2 to 12.8gyr (4.8 &lt; z &lt; 5.9) for the metal- poor gcs, depending on whether they mostlyformed in accreted satellites or in-situ within the main host galaxy. wecompare our values to direct age measurements for milky way gcs and predictionsfrom cosmological models. our findings suggest that reionisation preceded mostgc formation, and that it is unlikely to be the cause of gc bimodal metallicitydistributions.

1506.07882	the sluggs survey: globular cluster kinematics in a "double sigma"  galaxy - ngc 4473	ngc 4473 is a so--called double sigma (2$\sigma$) galaxy, i.e. a galaxy withrare, double peaks in its 2d stellar velocity dispersion. here, we present theglobular cluster (gc) kinematics in ngc 4473 out to $\sim10\,r_e$ (effectiveradii) using data from combined hst/acs and subaru/suprime--cam imaging andkeck/deimos spectroscopy. we find that the 2$\sigma$ nature of ngc 4473persists up to 3 $r_e$, though it becomes misaligned to the photometric majoraxis. we also observe a significant offset between the stellar and gc rotationamplitudes. this offset can be understood as a co--addition ofcounter--rotating stars producing little net stellar rotation. we identify asharp radial transition in the gc kinematics at $\sim4\,r_e$ suggesting a welldefined kinematically distinct halo. in the inner region ($&lt;4\,r_e$), the bluegcs rotate along the photometric major axis, but in an opposite direction tothe galaxy stars and red gcs. in the outer region ($&gt;4\,r_e$), the red gcsrotate in an opposite direction compared to the inner region red gcs, along thephotometric major axis, while the blue gcs rotate along an axis intermediatebetween the major and minor photometric axes. we also find a kinematicallydistinct population of very red gcs in the inner region with elevated rotationamplitude and velocity dispersion. the multiple kinematic components in ngc4473 highlight the complex formation and evolutionary history of this 2$\sigma$galaxy, as well as a distinct transition between the inner and outercomponents.

1507.03994	limits on thermal variations in a dozen quiescent neutron stars over a  decade	in quiescent low-mass x-ray binaries (qlmxbs) containing neutron stars, theorigin of the thermal x-ray component may be either release of heat from thecore of the neutron star, or continuing low-level accretion. in general, heatfrom the core should be stable on timescales $&lt;10^4$ years, while continuingaccretion may produce variations on a range of timescales. while some quiescentneutron stars (e.g. cen x-4, aql x-1) have shown variations in their thermalcomponents on a range of timescales, several others, particularly those inglobular clusters with no detectable nonthermal hard x-rays (fit with apowerlaw), have shown no measurable variations. here, we constrain the spectralvariations of 12 low mass x-ray binaries in 3 globular clusters over $\sim10$years. we find no evidence of variations in 10 cases, with limits ontemperature variations below 11% for the 7 qlmxbs without powerlaw components,and limits on variations below 20% for 3 other qlmxbs that do show non-thermalemission. however, in 2 qlmxbs showing powerlaw components in their spectra(ngc 6440 cx 1 &amp; terzan 5 cx 12) we find marginal evidence for a 10% decline intemperature, suggesting the presence of continuing low-level accretion. thiswork adds to the evidence that the thermal x-ray component in quiescent neutronstars without powerlaw components can be explained by heat deposited in thecore during outbursts. finally, we also investigate the correlation betweenhydrogen column density (n$_h$) and optical extinction (a$_v$) using our sampleand current models of interstellar x-ray absorption, finding $n_h ({\rmcm}^{-2}) = (2.81\pm0.13)\times10^{21} a_v$.

1511.03264	the aimss project iii: the stellar populations of compact stellar  systems	in recent years, a growing zoo of compact stellar systems (csss) have beenfound whose physical properties (mass, size, velocity dispersion) place thembetween classical globular clusters (gcs) and true galaxies, leading to debatesabout their nature. here we present results using a so far underutiliseddiscriminant, their stellar population properties. based on new spectroscopyfrom 8-10m telescopes, we derive ages, metallicities, and [\alpha/fe] of 29csss. these range from gcs with sizes of merely a few parsec to compactellipticals larger than m32. together with a literature compilation, thisprovides a panoramic view of the stellar population characteristics ofearly-type systems. we find that the csss are predominantly more metal richthan typical galaxies at the same stellar mass. at high mass, the compactellipticals (ces) depart from the mass-metallicity relation of massiveearly-type galaxies, which forms a continuous sequence with dwarf galaxies. atlower mass, the metallicity distribution of ultra-compact dwarfs (ucds) changesat a few times $10^7$ m$_{\odot}$, which roughly coincides with the mass whereluminosity function arguments previously suggested the gc population ends. thehighest metallicities in csss are paralleled only by those of dwarf galaxynuclei and the central parts of massive early types. these findings can beinterpreted as csss previously being more massive and undergoing tidalinteractions to obtain their current mass and compact size. such aninterpretation is supported by csss with direct evidence for tidal stripping,and by an examination of the css internal escape velocities.

astro-ph;0304195	hubble space telescope observations of globular cluster systems along  the hubble sequence of spiral galaxies	we have studied the globular cluster (gc) systems of 7 giant, edge-on spiralgalaxies using hubble space telescope imaging in v and i. the galaxy samplecovers the hubble types sa to sc, allowing us to study the variation of theproperties of gc systems along the hubble sequence. the photometry reaches ~1.5mag beyond the turn-over magnitude of the gc luminosity function for eachgalaxy. specific frequencies (s_n values) of gcs were evaluated by comparingthe numbers of gcs found in our wfpc2 pointings with those in the milky waywhich would be detected in the same metric area. the s_n values of spirals withb/t &lt;= 0.3 (i.e., spirals with a hubble type later than about sb) areconsistent with a value of s_n = 0.55 +- 0.25. we suggest that this populationof gcs represents a `universal', old halo population that is present aroundeach galaxy. most galaxies in our sample have s_n values that are consistentwith a scenario in which gc systems are made up of (i) the aforementioned halopopulation plus (ii) a population that is associated with bulges, which growslinearly with the mass of the bulge. such scenarios include the `mergerscenario' for the formation of elliptical galaxies as well as the `multi-phasecollapse' scenario, but it seems inconsistent with the `secular evolution'scenario of pfenniger &amp; norman (1990), in which bulges are formed from discstars by means of the redistribution of angular momentum through barinstabilities and/or minor perturbations. however, there is one bulge-dominatedspiral galaxy in our sample (ngc 7814) with a low s_n value that is consistentwith those of the latest-type spirals. thus, our results suggest that theformation histories of galaxy bulges of early-type spirals can be significantlydifferent from one galaxy to another.

astro-ph;0310611	revisiting the globular cluster system of the merger remnant elliptical  ngc 3610	we have obtained keck spectra of six candidate globular clusters (gcs) in thedynamically young elliptical galaxy ngc 3610, supplementing our previous keckspectra of eight confirmed gcs (strader et al. 2003). five of our newcandidates are confirmed to be gcs. of the thirteen gcs, eleven are locatedwithin the k band effective radius of 7 kpc. two of these thirteen clusters arefound to be young (~ 2 gyr) and very metal-rich ([z/h] ~ +0.5), three are oldand metal-poor, and the remaining eight clusters are old and metal-rich. theages of the young clusters are consistent with a recent spectroscopic ageestimate of 1.6+/-0.5 gyr for the galaxy itself (denicolo et al. 2003) andsuggest that these clusters formed in the disk-disk merger which likely createdngc 3610. intriguingly, both young gcs have [alpha/fe] ~ +0.3, while themajority of the old clusters are not alpha-enhanced, in contrast to galacticand m31 gcs, and contrary to predictions of nucleosynthetic calculations. thetwo old subpopulations of gcs can be attributed to the merger progenitors. therelative numbers of old and new metal-rich gcs are poorly constrained becauseof the expected differences in radial distributions of the two subpopulations.however, based on our spectroscopic results and a comparison of the hubblespace telescope color magnitude diagram (whitmore et al. 2002) with stellarpopulation models, we argue that more than half of the metal-rich gcs arelikely to be old.

astro-ph;0403136	the globular cluster system of the canis major dwarf galaxy	prompted by the discovery of the accreted canis major dwarf galaxy and itsassociated globular cluster (gc) system (martin etal.), we investigate thecontribution of accreted gcs to the galactic system. the canis major gcs, andthose associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy, exhibit a range ofgalactocentric radii, prograde and retrograde motions, and horizontal branchmorphologies, indicating that such properties are of limited use in identifyingaccreted gcs. by contrast, we find that the age-metallicity relation (amr) ofthese dwarf galaxies is distinct from that of the main galactic gc distributionat intermediate-to-high metallicities ([fe/h] &gt; -1.3). the accretion of gcswith a distinct amr would explain much of the apparent age spread in thegalactic gc system. the canis major and sagittarius amrs are similar to thoseof other local group dwarf galaxies and are consistent with a simple closed-boxchemical enrichment model -- a further indication that these gcs formed outsideof the milky way. the canis major gcs all have smaller-than-average sizes fortheir galactocentric distances, lending further support to their origin outsideof the milky way. our findings suggest that accretion of similar mass dwarfsdoes not appear to have played a major role in building the stellar mass of thethick disk or bulge of the milky way.

astro-ph;0403160	metal-poor globular clusters and galaxy formation	we demonstrate a significant (&gt; 5-sigma) correlation between the mean colorof metal-poor globular cluster (gc) systems and parent galaxy luminosity. abayesian markov chain monte carlo method is introduced to find the mean color,and is easily generalizable to quantify multimodality in other astronomicaldatasets. we derive a gc color--galaxy luminosity relation of the form z ~ l^(0.15 +/- 0.03). when combined with evidence against a single primordial gcmetallicity--galaxy luminosity relation for protogalactic fragments, theexistence of such a correlation is evidence against both accretion and majormerger scenarios as an explanation of the entire metal-poor gc systems ofluminous galaxies. however, our relation arises naturally in an in situ pictureof gc formation, and is consistent with the truncation of metal-poor gcformation by reionization. a further implication is that the ages of metal-poorgcs in dwarf galaxies constrain the main epoch of galaxy formation inhierarchical models. if the ages of old metal-poor gcs in local group dwarfs (&gt;11 gyr) are typical of those in dwarfs elsewhere, then the bulk of galaxyassembly (at least in clusters and groups) must have occurred at z &gt; 2.5,contrary to the predictions of some structure formation models.

(2) many des have metal-rich gc subpopulations. wealso confirm the gc color--galaxy luminosity relations found previously forboth metal-poor and metal-rich gc subpopulations. (3) there are largedifferences in gc specific frequency among des. over -15 &lt; m_b &lt; -18, there islittle correlation between specific frequency (s_n)and m_b. but we do findevidence for two separate s_n classes of des: those with b-band s_n ~ 2, andothers with populous gc systems that have s_n ranging from ~ 5-20 with medians_n ~ 10. together, these points suggest multiple formation channels for des invirgo. (4) the peak of the gc luminosity function (gclf) is the same for bothges and des. this is contrary to expectations of dynamical friction on massivegcs, unless the primordial gclf varies between ges and des. among ges the gclfturnover varies by a surprising small 0.05 mag, an encouraging result for itsuse as an accurate standard candle. (5) de,ns appear bimodal in their nuclearproperties: there are small bright red nuclei consistent with formation bydynamical friction of gcs, and larger faint blue nuclei which appear to haveformed by a dissipative process with little contribution from gcs. the role ofdynamical evolution in shaping the present-day properties of de gc systems andtheir nuclei remains ambiguous.

astro-ph;0510599	an imaging study of the globular cluster systems of ngc 1407 and ngc  1400	we present wide-field keck telescope imaging of the globular cluster (gc)systems around ngc 1407 and ngc 1400 in the eridanus galaxy cloud. this iscomplemented by hubble space telescope images from the advanced camera forsurveys of ngc 1407 and wide field and planetary camera 2 images of ngc 1400.we clearly detect bimodality in the gc colour distribution of ngc 1407. theblue gc subpopulation has a mean colour of b-i = 1.61 and a relativecontribution of around 40%, whereas the red subpopulation with b-i = 2.06contributes 60% to the overall gc system. assuming old ages, this correspondsto [fe/h] = -1.45 and -0.19. both subpopulations are intrinsically broad incolour (indicating a range in ages and/or metallicities), with the redsubpopulation being broader than the blue. the gc colour distribution for ngc1400 is less clear cut than for ngc 1407, however, we also find evidence for abimodal distribution. we find the ngc 1407 red gcs to be 20% smaller in sizethan the blue ones. we find both gc systems to possess a gc surface densitydistribution which is largely constant in these inner galaxy regions. we fitisothermal-like profiles and derive gc system core radii of 9.4 kpc for ngc1407 and 5.8 kpc for ngc 1400. for ngc 1407 we are able to separate the surfacedensity distribution into blue and red subpopulations, giving 17.8 and 7.6 kpcrespectively. outside this central region, the radial profile of the gc surfacedensity is similar to that of the galaxy light for ngc 1407 but it is flatterfor ngc 1400. a fit to the gc luminosity function gives a distance modulus of31.6, which is in good agreement with distances based on the faber-jacksonrelation and the virgo infall corrected velocity.

astro-ph;0510756	the globular cluster system of the virgo dwarf elliptical galaxy vcc  1087	we have analysed the globular cluster (gc) system of the nucleated dwarfelliptical galaxy vcc 1087 in the virgo cluster, based on keck/lrisspectroscopy and archival hst/acs imaging. we estimate vcc 1087 hosts a totalpopulation of 77+/-19 gcs, which corresponds to a relatively high v-bandspecific frequency of 5.8+/-1.4. the g-z color distribution of the gcs shows ablue (metal-poor) peak with a tail of redder (metal-rich) clusters similar incolor to those seen in luminous ellipticals. spectroscopy of a subsample of 12gcs suggests that the gc system is old and coeval (~10 gyr), with a fairlybroad metallicity distribution (-1.8&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.8). in contrast, an integratedspectrum of the underlying galaxy starlight reveals that its optical luminosityis dominated by metal-rich, intermediate-aged stars. radial velocities of thegcs suggest rotation close to the major axis of the galaxy, and this rotationis dynamically significant with (v/sigma)^* &gt;1. a compilation of the kinematicsof the gc systems of 9 early-type galaxies shows surprising diversity in thev/sigma parameter for gc systems. in this context, the gc system of vcc 1087exhibits the most significant rotation to velocity dispersion signature.modeling the velocity dispersion profile of the gcs and galaxy stars suggestfairly constant mass-to-light ratios of ~3 out to 6.5 kpc. the presentobservations can entertain both baryonic and non-baryonic solutions, and gcvelocities at larger radii would be most valuable with regard to this issue. wediscuss the evolution of vcc 1087 in terms of the galaxy ``harassment''scenario, and conclude that this galaxy may well be the remains of a faded,tidally perturbed sc spiral [abridged].

astro-ph;0612415	damp mergers: recent gaseous mergers without significant globular  cluster formation?	here we test the idea that new globular clusters (gcs) are formed in the samegaseous ("wet") mergers or interactions that give rise to the young stellarpopulations seen in the central regions of many early-type galaxies. we comparemean gc colors with the age of the central galaxy starburst. the red gcsubpopulation reveals remarkably constant mean colors independent of galaxyage. a scenario in which the red gc subpopulation is a combination of old andnew gcs (formed in the same event as the central galaxy starburst) can not beruled out; although this would require an age-metallicity relation for thenewly formed gcs that is steeper than the galactic relation. however, the dataare also well described by a scenario in which most red gcs are old, and few,if any, are formed in recent gaseous mergers. this is consistent with the oldages inferred from some spectroscopic studies of gcs in external systems. theevent that induced the central galaxy starburst may have therefore involvedinsufficient gas mass for significant gc formation. we term such gas-poorevents "damp" mergers.

0809.2088	mapping the dark side with deimos: globular clusters, x-ray gas, and  dark matter in the ngc 1407 group	ngc 1407 is the central elliptical in a nearby evolved galaxy groupapparently destined to become a cluster core. we use the kinematics of globularclusters to probe the dynamics and mass profile of the group's center, out to60 kpc (~10 r_eff) -- the most extended data set to date around an early-typegalaxy. this sample consists of 172 gc velocities, most of them newly obtainedusing keck/deimos, with a few additional objects identified as dgtos or asigcs. we find weak rotation in the gc system's outer parts, with the metal-poorand metal-rich gcs misaligned. the rms velocity profile declines rapidly to aradius of ~20 kpc, and then becomes flat or rising to ~60 kpc. there isevidence that the gc orbits have a tangential bias that is strongest for themetal-poor gcs -- possibly contradicting theoretical expectations. we constructcosmologically-motivated galaxy+dark halo dynamical models and infer a masswithin 60 kpc of ~3x10^12 m_sun, extrapolating to a virial mass of ~6x10^13m_sun for a typical lcdm halo -- in agreement with results from group galaxykinematics. we present an independent chandra-based analysis, whose relativelyhigh mass at ~20 kpc disagrees strongly with the gc-based result unless the gcsare assumed to have a peculiar orbit distribution, and we discuss some generalcomparisons between x-ray and optical results. the group's b-band mass-to-lightratio of ~800 is extreme even for a rich galaxy cluster, much less a poor group-- placing it among the most dark matter dominated systems in the universe, andalso suggesting a massive reservoir of baryons lurking in an unseen phase, inaddition to the nonbaryonic dark matter. we compare the kinematical and massproperties of the ngc 1407 group to other nearby groups and clusters, anddiscuss some implications of this system for structure formation.

astro-ph;0703472	stellar populations of globular clusters in the elliptical galaxy  ngc1407	we present high-quality, keck spectroscopic data for a sample of 20 globularclusters (gcs) in the massive e0 galaxy ngc1407. a subset of twentyline-strength indices of the lick/ids system have been measured for both the gcsystem and the central integrated star-light of the galaxy. ages, metallicitiesand [alpha/fe] ratios have been derived using several different approaches. themajority gcs in ngc1407 studied are old, follow a tight metallicity sequencereaching values slightly above solar, and exhibit mean [alpha/fe] ratios of ~0.3 dex. in addition, three gcs are formally derived to be young (~ 4 gyr), butwe argue that they are actually old gcs hosting blue horizontal branches. wereport, for the first time, evidence for the existence of twochemically-distinct subpopulations of metal-rich (mr) gcs. we find some mr gcsexhibit significantly larger [mg/fe] and [c/fe] ratios. different starformation time-scales are proposed to explain the correlation between mg and cabundances. we also find striking cn overabundances over the entire gcmetallicity range. interestingly, the behavior of c and n in metal-poor (mp)gcs clearly deviates from the one in mr gcs. in particular, for mr gcs, nincreases dramatically while c essentially saturates. this may be interpretedas a consequence of the increasing importance of the cno cycle with increasingmetallicity.

0809.2781	the least luminous galaxy: spectroscopy of the milky way satellite segue  1	we present keck/deimos spectroscopy of segue 1, an ultra-low luminosity (m_v= -1.5) milky way satellite companion. while the combined size and luminosityof segue 1 are consistent with either a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, wepresent spectroscopic evidence that this object is a dark matter-dominateddwarf galaxy. we identify 24 stars as members of segue 1 with a meanheliocentric recession velocity of 206 +/- 1.3 kms. we measure an internalvelocity dispersion of 4.3+/-1.2 kms. under the assumption that these stars arein dynamical equilibrium, we infer a total mass of 4.5^{+4.7}_{-2.5} x 10^5msun in the case where mass-follow-light; using a two-component maximumlikelihood model, we determine a similar mass within the stellar radius of 50pc. this implies a mass-to-light ratio of ln(m/l_v) = 7.2^{+1.1}_{-1.2} orm/l_v = 1320^{+2680}_{-940}. the error distribution of the mass-to-light ratiois nearly log-normal, thus segue 1 is dark matter-dominated at a highsignificance. using spectral synthesis modeling, we derive a metallicity forthe single red giant branch star in our sample of [fe/h]=-3.3 +/- 0.2 dex.finally, we discuss the prospects for detecting gamma-rays from annihilation ofdark matter particles and show that segue 1 is the most promising satellite forindirect dark matter detection. we conclude that segue 1 is the least luminousof the ultra-faint galaxies recently discovered around the milky way, and isthus the least luminous known galaxy.
