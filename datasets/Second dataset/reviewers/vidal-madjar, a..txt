0901.0995	the beat cepheids in the magellanic clouds: an analysis from the eros-2  database	a number of microlensing dark-matter surveys have produced tens of millionsof light curves of individual background stars. these data provide anunprecedented opportunity for systematic studies of whole classes of variablestars and their host galaxies. we aim to use the eros-2 survey of themagellanic clouds to detect and study the population of beat cepheids (bcs) inboth clouds. bcs pulsating simultaneously in the first overtone and fundamentalmodes (fo/f) or in the second and first overtone modes (so/fo) are ofparticular interest. using special software designed to search for periodicvariables, we have scanned the eros-2 data base for variables in the typicalperiod range of cepheids. metallicities of fo/f objects were then calculatedfrom linear nonadiabatic convective stellar models. we identify 74 fo/f bcs inthe lmc and 41 in the smc, and 173 and 129 so/fo pulsators in the lmc and smc,respectively; 185 of these stars are new discoveries. for nearly all the fo/fobjects we determine minimum, mean, and maximum values of the metallicity. theeros data have expanded the samples of known bcs in the lmc by 31%, in the smcby 110%. the fo/f objects provide independent measures of metallicities inthese galaxies. the mean value of metallicity is 0.0045 in the lmc and 0.0018in the smc.

0901.1325	the eros2 search for microlensing events towards the spiral arms: the  complete seven season results	the eros-2 project has been designed to search for microlensing eventstowards any dense stellar field. the densest parts of the galactic spiral armshave been monitored to maximize the microlensing signal expected from the starsof the galactic disk and bulge. 12.9 million stars have been monitored during 7seasons towards 4 directions in the galactic plane, away from the galacticcenter. a total of 27 microlensing event candidates have been found. estimatesof the optical depths from the 22 best events are provided. a first orderinterpretation shows that simple galactic models with a standard disk and anelongated bulge are in agreement with our observations. we find that theaverage microlensing optical depth towards the complete eros-cataloged stars ofthe spiral arms is $\bar{\tau} =0.51\pm .13\times 10^{-6}$, a number that isstable when the selection criteria are moderately varied. as the eros catalogis almost complete up to $i_c=18.5$, the optical depth estimated for thesub-sample of bright target stars with $i_c&lt;18.5$ ($\bar{\tau}=0.39\pm&gt;.11\times 10^{-6}$) is easier to interpret. the set of microlensing eventsthat we have observed is consistent with a simple galactic model. a moreprecise interpretation would require either a better knowledge of the distancedistribution of the target stars, or a simulation based on a galactic model.for this purpose, we define and discuss the concept of optical depth for agiven catalog or for a limiting magnitude.

0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0903.1101	is beta pic b the transiting planet of november 1981?	in 1981, beta pictoris showed strong and rapid photometric variations thatwere attributed to the transit of a giant comet or a planet orbiting at severalaus (lecavelier des etangs et al. 1994, 1995, 1997; lamers et al. 1997).recently, a candidate planet has been identified by imagery in thecircumstellar disk of beta pictoris (lagrange et al. 2009). this planet, namedbeta pic b, is observed at a projected distance of 8au from the central star.it is therefore a plausible candidate for the photometric event observed in1981. the coincidence of the observed position of the planet in november 2003and the calculated position assuming that the 1981 transit is due to a planetorbiting at 8 au is intriguing. assuming that the planet that is detected onthe image is the same as the object transiting in november 1981, we estimateranges of possible orbital distances and periods. in the favored scenario, theplanet orbits at about 8 au and was seen close to its quadrature position inthe 2003 images. in this case, most of the uncertainties are related to errorbars on the position in 2003. uncertainties related to the stellar mass andorbital eccentricity are also discussed. we find a semi-major axis in the range[7.6-8.7] au and an orbital period in the range [15.9-19.5] years. we givepredictions for imaging observations at quadrature in the southwest branch ofthe disk in future years (2011-2015). we also estimate possible dates for thenext transits and anti-transits.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

0707.2016	spectropolarimetric observations of the transiting planetary system of  the k dwarf hd 189733	with a jupiter-mass planet orbiting at a distance of only 0.031 au, theactive k2 dwarf hd 189733 is a potential candidate in which to study themagnetospheric interactions of a cool star with its recently-discoveredclose-orbiting giant planet. we decided to explore the strength and topology ofthe large-scale magnetosphere of hd 189733, as a future benchmark forquantitative studies for models of the star/planet magnetic interactions. tothis end, we used espadons, the new generation spectropolarimeter at thecanada-france-hawaii 3.6m telescope, to look for zeeman circular polarisationsignatures in the line profiles of hd 189733 in 2006 june and august. zeemansignatures in the line profiles of hd 189733 are clearly detected in allspectra, demonstrating that a field is indeed present at the surface of thestar. the zeeman signatures are not modulated with the planet's orbital periodbut apparently vary with the stellar rotation cycle. the reconstructedlarge-scale magnetic field, whose strength reaches a few tens of g, issignificantly more complex than that of the sun; it involves in particular asignificant toroidal component and contributions from magnetic multipoles oforder up to 5. the caii h &amp; k lines clearly feature core emission, whoseintensity is apparently varying mostly with rotation phase. our data suggestthat the photosphere and magnetic field of hd 189733 are sheared by asignificant amount of differential rotation. our initial study confirms that hd189733 is an optimal target for investigating activity enhancements induced byclosely orbiting planets. more data are needed, densely covering both theorbital and rotation cycles, to investigate whether and how much the planetcontributes to the overall activity level of hd 189733.

1004.0790	observation of the full 12-hour-long transit of the exoplanet hd80606b.  warm-spitzer photometry and sophie spectroscopy	we present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanethd80606b. using the spitzer space telescope and its irac camera on thepost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation ofhd80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 january 2010. we complement thisphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneouslyperformed with sophie at haute-provence observatory. this provides radialvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previouslyuncovered with spectroscopy. this new data set allows the parameters of thissingular planetary system to be significantly refined. we obtained aplanet-to-star radius ratio r_p/r_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lowerthan the one measured from previous ground observations. we detected a featurein the spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. we also found atransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; thiscould be caused by actual ttvs due to an additional body in the system or byunderestimated systematic uncertainties. the sky-projected angle between thespin-axis of hd80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found tobe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the rossiter-mclaughlinanomaly. this allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitivelyrejected. over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, afew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two differentevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if theyexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. as in the caseof hd80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet aretilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario formassive planets in comparison with jupiter-mass planets.

1309.5261	hst hot jupiter transmission spectral survey: evidence for aerosols and  lack of tio in the atmosphere of wasp-12b	we present hst optical transmission spectra of the transiting hot jupiterwasp-12b, taken with the stis instrument. from the transmission spectra, we areable to decisively rule out prominent absorption by tio in the exoplanet'satmosphere. strong pressure-broadened na and k absorption signatures are alsoexcluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. we compare our combinedbroadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmosphericmodels, though none are satisfactory fits. however, we do find that the fulltransmission spectrum can be described by models which include significantopacity from aerosols: including rayleigh scattering, mie scattering, tholinhaze, and settling dust profiles. the transmission spectrum follows aneffective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with theslope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphat =-3528+/-660 k, where t is the atmospheric temperature. rayleigh scattering(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminatortemperatures near 900 k. sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equallygood fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,and we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol. the presence ofatmospheric aerosols also helps to explain the modestly bright albedo impliedby spitzer observations, as well as the near black body nature of the emissionspectrum. ti-bearing condensates on the cooler night-side is the most naturalexplanation for the overall lack of tio signatures in wasp-12b, indicating theday/night cold-trap is an important effect for very hot jupiters. these findingindicate that aerosols can play a significant atmospheric role for the entirewide range of hot-jupiter atmospheres, potentially affecting their overallspectrum and energy balance.(abridged)

1310.0083	hst hot jupiter transmission spectral survey: a detection of na and  strong optical absorption in hat-p-1b	we present an optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum of the hotjupiter hat-p-1b, based on hst observations, covering the spectral regime from0.29 to 1.027{\mu}m with stis, which is coupled with a recent wfc3 transit(1.087 to 1.687{\mu}m). we derive refined physical parameters of the hat-p-1system, including an improved orbital ephemeris. the transmission spectrumshows a strong absorption signature shortward of 0.55{\mu}m, with a strongblueward slope into the near-ultraviolet. we detect atmospheric sodiumabsorption at a 3.3{\sigma} significance level, but find no evidence for thepotassium feature. the red data implies a marginally flat spectrum with atentative absorption enhancement at wavelength longer than ~0.85{\mu}m. thestis and wfc3 spectra differ significantly in absolute radius level (4.3 +/-1.6 pressure scale heights), implying strong optical absorption in theatmosphere of hat-p-1b. the optical to near-infrared difference cannot beexplained by stellar activity, as simulta- neous stellar activity monitoring ofthe g0v hat-p-1b host star and its identical companion show no significantactivity that could explain the result. we compare the complete stis and wfc3transmission spectrum with theoretical atmospheric mod- els which include haze,sodium and an extra optical absorber. we find that both an optical absorber anda super-solar sodium to water abundance ratio might be a sce- nario explainingthe hat-p-1b observations. our results suggest that strong optical absorbersmay be a dominant atmospheric feature in some hot jupiter exoplanets.

1310.8104	magnesium in the atmosphere of the planet hd209458b: observations of the  thermosphere-exosphere transition region	we report new near ultraviolet hst/stis observations of atmosphericabsorptions during the planetary transit of hd209458b. we detect absorption inatomic magnesium (mgi), while no signal has been detected in the lines ofsingly ionized magnesium (mgii). we measure the mgi atmospheric absorption tobe 6.2+/-2.9% in the velocity range from -62 to -19 km/s. the detection ofatomic magnesium in the planetary upper atmosphere at a distance of severalplanetary radii gives a first view into the transition region between thethermosphere and the exobase, where atmospheric escape takes place. we estimatethe electronic densities needed to compensate for the photo-ionization bydielectronic recombination of mg+ to be in the range of 10^8-10^9 cm^{-3}. ourfinding is in excellent agreement with model predictions at altitudes ofseveral planetary radii.  we observe mgi atoms escaping the planet, with a maximum radial velocity (inthe stellar rest frame) of -60 km/s. because magnesium is much heavier thanhydrogen, the escape of this species confirms previous studies that theplanet's atmosphere is undergoing hydrodynamic escape. we compare ourobservations to a numerical model that takes the stellar radiation pressure onthe mgi atoms into account. we find that the mgi atoms must be present at up to~7.5 planetari radii altitude and estimate an mgi escape rate of ~3x10^7 g/s.compared to previous evaluations of the escape rate of hi atoms, thisevaluation is compatible with a magnesium abundance roughly solar. a hint ofabsorption, detected at low level of significance, during the post-transitobservations, could be interpreted as a mgi cometary-like tail. if true, theestimate of the absorption by mgi would be increased to a higher value of about8.8+/-2.1%.

0802.0587	exoplanet hd 209458b : evaporation strengthened	following re-analysis of hubble space telescope observations of primarytransits of the extrasolar planet hd209458b at lyman-alpha, ben-jaffel (2007,bj007) claims that no sign of evaporation is observed. here we show that, infact, this new analysis is consistent with the one of vidal-madjar et al.(2003, vm003) and supports the detection of evaporation. the apparentdisagreement is mainly due to the disparate wavelength ranges that are used toderive the transit absorption depth. vm003 derives a (15+/-4)% absorption depthduring transit over the core of the stellar lyman-alpha line (from -130 km/s to+100 km/s), and this result agrees with the (8.9+/-2.1)% absorption depthreported by bj007 from a slightly expanded dataset but over a larger wavelengthrange (+/-200 km/s). these measurements agree also with the (5+/-2)% absorptionreported by vidal-madjar et al. (2004) over the whole lyman-alpha line fromindependent, lower-resolution data. we show that stellar lyman-alphavariability is unlikely to significantly affect those detections. the hi atomsmust necessarily have velocities above the escape velocities and/or be outsidethe roche lobe, given the lobe shape and orientation. absorption by hi inhd209458b's atmosphere has thus been detected with different datasets, and nowwith independent analyses. all these results strengthen the concept ofevaporating hot-jupiters, as well as the modelization of this phenomenon.

0802.3228	rayleigh scattering in the transit spectrum of hd 189733b	the transit spectrum of the exoplanet hd 189733b has recently been obtainedbetween 0.55 and 1.05 microns. here we present an analysis of this spectrum. wedevelop first-order equations to interpret absorption spectra. in the case ofhd 189733b, we show that the observed slope of the absorption as a function ofwavelength is characteristic of extinction proportional to the inverse of thefourth power of the wavelength (lambda^-4). assuming an extinction dominated byrayleigh scattering, we derive an atmospheric temperature of 1340+/-150 k. ifmolecular hydrogen is responsible for the rayleigh scattering, the atmosphericpressure at the planetary characteristic radius of 0.1564 stellar radius mustbe 410+/-30 mbar. however the preferred scenario is scattering by condensateparticles. using the mie approximation, we find that the particles must have alow value for the imaginary part of the refraction index. we identify mgsio3 asa possible abundant condensate whose particle size must be between 0.01 and 0.1microns. for this condensate, assuming solar abundance, the pressure at 0.1564stellar radius is found to be between a few microbars and few millibars, andthe temperature is found to be in the range 1340-1540 k, and both depend on theparticle size.

0802.3864	hst/stis optical transit transmission spectra of the hot-jupiter  hd209458b	we present the transmission spectra of the hot-jupiter hd209458b taken withthe space telescope imaging spectrograph aboard the hubble space telescope. ouranalysis combines data at two resolutions and applies a complete pixel-by-pixellimb-darkening correction to fully reveal the spectral line shapes ofatmospheric absorption features. terrestrial-based na i and h i contaminationare identified which mask the strong exoplanetary absorption signature in thena core, which we find reaches total absorption levels of ~0.11% in a 4.4 angband. the na spectral line profile is characterized by a wide absorptionprofile at the lowest absorption depths, and a sharp transition to a narrowabsorption profile at higher absorption values. the transmission spectra alsoshows the presence of an additional absorber at ~6,250 ang, observed at bothmedium and low resolutions. we performed various limb-darkening tests,including using high precision limb-darkening measurements of the sun tocharacterize a general trend of atlas models to slightly overestimate theamount of limb-darkening at all wavelengths, likely due to the limitations ofthe model's one-dimensional nature. we conclude that, despite theselimitations, atlas models can still successfully model limb-darkening in highsignal-to-noise transits of solar-type stars, like hd209458, to a high level ofprecision over the entire optical regime (3,000-10,000 ang) at transit phasesbetween 2nd and 3rd contact.

1404.2120	modeling magnesium escape from hd209458b atmosphere	transit observations in the mgi line of hd209458b revealed signatures ofneutral magnesium escaping the upper atmosphere of the planet, while noatmospheric absorption was found in the mgii doublet. here we present a 3dparticle model of the dynamics of neutral and ionized magnesium populations,coupled with an analytical modeling of the atmosphere below the exobase.theoretical mgi absorption line profiles are directly compared with theabsorption observed in the blue wing of the line during the planet transit.observations are well-fitted with an escape rate of neutral magnesium in therange 2x10^7-3.4x10^7 g/s, an exobase close to the roche lobe (rexo in therange 2.1-4.3 rp, where rp is the planet radius) and a planetary wind velocityat the exobase vpl=25km/s. the observed velocities of the planet-escapingmagnesium up to -60km/s are well explained by radiation pressure acceleration,provided that uv-photoionization is compensated for by electron recombinationup to about 13rp. if the exobase properties are constrained to values given bytheoretical models of the deeper atmosphere (rexo=2rp and vpl=10km/s), the bestfit to the observations is found at a similar electron density and escape ratewithin 2 sigma. in all cases, the mean temperature of the atmosphere below theexobase must be higher than about 6100 k. simulations predict a redwardexpansion of the absorption profile from the beginning to the end of thetransit. the spatial and spectral structure of the extended atmosphere is theresult of complex interactions between radiation pressure, planetary gravity,and self-shielding, and can be probed through the analysis of transitabsorption profiles in the mgi line.

0803.1054	determining atmospheric conditions at the terminator of the hot-jupiter  hd209458b	we present a theoretical model fit to the hst/stis optical transittransmission spectrum of hd209458b. in our fit, we use the sodium absorptionline profile along with the rayleigh scattering by h_2 to help determine theaverage temperature-pressure profile at the planetary terminator, and infer theabundances of atomic and molecular species. the observed sodium line profilespans an altitude range of ~3,500 km, corresponding to pressures between ~0.001and 50 mbar in our atmospheric models. we find that the sodium line profilerequires either condensation into sodium sulfide or ionization, necessary todeplete atomic sodium only at high altitudes below pressures of ~3 mbar. thedepletion of sodium is supported by an observed sudden abundance change, from 2times solar abundance in the lower atmosphere to 0.2 solar or lower in theupper atmosphere. our findings also indicate the presence of a hot atmospherenear stratospheric altitudes corresponding to pressures of 33 mbar, consistentwith that of the observed dayside temperature inversion. in addition, we find aseparate higher altitude temperature rise is necessary within both thecondensation and ionization models, corresponding to pressures below ~0.01mbar. this hot higher altitude temperature indicates that absorption by atomicsodium can potentially probe the bottom of the thermosphere, and is possiblysensitive to the temperature rise linked to atmospheric escape.

1410.7611	hst hot-jupiter transmission spectral survey: detection of potassium in  wasp-31b along with a cloud deck and rayleigh scattering	we present hubble space telescope optical and near-ir transmission spectra ofthe transiting hot-jupiter wasp-31b. the spectrum covers 0.3-1.7 $\mu$m at aresolution $r\sim$70, which we combine with spitzer photometry to cover thefull-optical to ir. the spectrum is dominated by a cloud-deck with a flattransmission spectrum which is apparent at wavelengths $&gt;0.52\mu$m. the clouddeck is present at high altitudes and low pressures, as it covers the majorityof the expected optical na line and near-ir h$_2$o features. while na iabsorption is not clearly identified, the resulting spectrum does show a verystrong potassium feature detected at the 4.2-$\sigma$ confidence level.broadened alkali wings are not detected, indicating pressures below $\sim$10mbar. the lack of na and strong k is the first indication of a sub-solar na/kabundance ratio in a planetary atmosphere (ln[na/k]$=-3.3\pm2.8$), which couldpotentially be explained by na condensation on the planet's night side, orprimordial abundance variations. a strong rayleigh scattering signature isdetected at short wavelengths, with a 4-$\sigma$ significant slope. twodistinct aerosol size populations can explain the spectra, with a smallersub-micron size grain population reaching high altitudes producing a bluerayleigh scattering signature on top of a larger, lower-lying populationresponsible for the flat cloud deck at longer wavelengths. we estimate that theatmospheric circulation is sufficiently strong to mix micron size particlesupward to the required 1-10 mbar pressures, necessary to explain the clouddeck. these results further confirm the importance of clouds in hot-jupiters,which can potentially dominate the overall spectra and may alter the abundancesof key gaseous species.

0804.4761	molecular hydrogen in the circumstellar environments of herbig ae/be  stars probed by fuse	we observed molecular hydrogen around a sample of pre-main sequence stars inorder to better characterize their gaseous cs environments. we analyzed thefuse (far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer) spectra of a sample of herbigae/be stars (haebes) covering a broad spectral range, including themain-sequence a5 star beta-pictoris. to better diagnose the origin of thedetected h2 and its excitation conditions, we used a model of aphotodissociation region. our analysis demonstrates that the excitation of h2is clearly different around most of the haebes compared to the interstellarmedium. moreover, the characteristics of h2 around herbig ae and be stars giveevidence for different excitation mechanisms. for the most massive stars of oursample (b8 to b2 type), the excitation diagrams are reproduced well by a modelof photodissociation regions (pdr). our results favor an interpretation interms of large cs envelopes, remnants of the molecular clouds in which thestars were formed. on the other hand, the group of ae stars (later than b9type) known to possess disks is more inhomogeneous. in most cases, when cs h2is detected, the lines of sight do not pass through the disks. the excitationconditions of h2 around ae stars cannot be reproduced by pdr models andcorrespond to warm and/or hot excited media very close to the stars. inaddition, no clear correlation has been found between the ages of the stars andthe amount of circumstellar h2. our results suggest structural differencesbetween herbig ae and be star environments. herbig be stars do evolve fasterthan ae stars, and consequently, most herbig be stars are younger than ae onesat the time we observe them. it is thus more likely to find remnants of theirparent cloud around them.

0805.0595	rayleigh scattering by h2 in the extrasolar planet hd209458b	transiting planets, such as hd209458b, offer a unique opportunity toscrutinize the planetary atmospheric content. although molecular hydrogen isexpected to be the main atmospheric constituent, h2 remains uncovered becauseof the lack of strong transition from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared. herewe analyse the absorption spectrum of hd209458b obtained by sing et al. (2008a)which provides a measurement of the absorption depth in the 3000-6200 aawavelength range. we show that the rise in absorption depth at shortwavelengths can be interpreted as rayleigh scattering within the atmosphere ofhd209458b. since rayleigh scattering traces the entire atmosphere, thisdetection enables a direct determination of the pressure-altitude relationship,which is required to determine the absolute fraction of other elements such assodium. at the zero altitude defined by the absorption depth of 1.453%, whichcorresponds to a planetary radius of 0.1205 times the stellar radius, we find apressure of 33+/-5 mbar. using the variation of the rayleigh scatteringcross-section as a function of wavelength, we determine the temperature to be2200+/-260 k at 33 mbar pressure.

astro-ph;0006070	no diffuse h2 in the metal deficient galaxy i zw 18	the metal deficient starburst galaxy izw18 has been observed with fuse in asearch for h2 molecules. the spectrum obtained with an aperture covering thefull galaxy shows no absorption lines of diffuse h2 at the radial velocity ofthe galaxy. the upper limit for the diffuse h2 column density is found to bevery low: n(h2) &lt;~ 10^15 cm-2 (10 sigma), unlike our galaxy where h2 isgenerally present for even low hi column densities. although the hi columndensity is here as high as n(hi) ~ 2.10^21 cm-2, we observe 2n(h2)/n(hi)&lt;&lt;10^-6. we cannot exclude the possibility that some h2 could be in very dense,small and discrete clumps which cannot be detected with the presentobservation. however, the remarkable absence of diffuse h2 in this metal-poorgalaxy can be explained by the low abundance of dust grains (needed to formthis molecule from h-atoms), the high ultraviolet flux and the low density ofthe hi cloud surrounding the star-forming regions. thus having eliminateddiffuse h2 as a significant contributor to the total mass, it appears that thegas of the galaxy is dominated by hi, and that the high dynamical mass is notcomposed of cold and diffuse baryonic dark matter.

astro-ph;0607207	limits on the macho content of the galactic halo from the eros-2 survey  of the magellanic clouds	the eros-2 project was designed to test the hypothesis that massive compacthalo objects (the so-called ``machos'') could be a major component of the darkmatter halo of the milky way galaxy. to this end, eros-2 monitored over 6.7years $33\times10^6$ stars in the magellanic clouds for microlensing eventscaused by such objects. in this work, we use only a subsample of $7\times10^6$bright stars spread over $84 \deg^2$ of the lmc and $9 \deg^2$ of the smc. thestrategy of using only bright stars helps to discriminate against backgroundevents due to variable stars and allows a simple determination of the effectsof source confusion (blending). the use of a large solid angle makes the surveyrelatively insensitive to effects that could make the optical depth stronglydirection dependent. using this sample of bright stars, only one candidateevent was found, whereas $\sim39$ events would have been expected if the halowere entirely populated by objects of mass $m\sim0.4m_{\odot}$. combined withthe results of eros-1, this implies that the optical depth toward the largemagellanic cloud (\object{lmc}) due to such lenses is $\tau&lt;0.36\times10^{-7}$(95%cl), corresponding to a fraction of the halo mass of less than 8%. thisoptical depth is considerably less than that measured by the machocollaboration in the central region of the lmc. more generally, machos in themass range $0.6\times10^{-7}m_\odot&lt;m&lt;15m_{\odot}$ are ruled out as the primaryoccupants of the milky way halo.

astro-ph;9505063	eros variable stars : fundamental-mode and first overtone cepheids in  the bar of the large magellanic cloud	we present ccd phase-binned light curves at 490 nm for 97 cepheid variablestars in the bar of the lmc. the photometry was obtained as part of the frencheros project and has excellent phase coverage, permitting accuratedecomposition into fourier components. we identify as `sinusoidal' ors-cepheids those stars with periods less than 5.5 d and small second-harmoniccomponents. these stars comprise $\sim$30% of our sample and most form asequence $\sim$1 mag brighter than the lmc classical cepheids in theperiod-luminosity diagram. they are also generally bluer and havelower-amplitude light curves. we infer that the s-cepheids are first-overtonepulsators because, when their periods are converted to expectedfundamental-mode values, they obey a common period-luminosity-colour relationwith classical cepheids. this also confirms the reality of the colour term inthe cepheid period-luminosity-colour relation. further, the blue edge of theclassical cepheid instability strip agrees well with the theoreticalcalculations for the fundamental mode made by chiosi et al. (1993) for thehertzsprung-russell and period-luminosity diagrams, but we find that ourobserved s-cepheids are $&gt;0.2$ mag brighter and bluer than the chiosi et al.\predictions for the first-overtone. we identify a number of features in plotsof our stars' fourier-component amplitude ratios and phase differences. thesefeatures have been identified with resonances between different pulsationmodes. in the lmc we find these features seem to occur at periods very similarto galactic ones for classical cepheids, but at different periods fors-cepheids. we discover a double-mode cepheid in the lmc, for which $p({\rmfirst overtone})/p({\rm fundamental}) = 0.710 \pm 0.001$, very similar toobserved ratios for galactic double-mode cepheids.

astro-ph;9508035	dust distribution in disks supplied by small bodies: is the beta  pictoris disk a gigantic multi-cometary tail?	we have evaluated the spatial distribution of dust in disks supplied bycolliding or evaporating bodies spread in a small belt. the gradient of thedistribution of dust expelled by radiation pressure is generally steeper thanthe one observed around \bp. it follows that, to generate the \bp\ diskdistribution in such a way, one should extract relatively more small particlesin the production process: thanks to radiation forces, these smaller particleshave large eccentricities and thus could be seen at very large distances fromtheir injection place. the evaporation process of comet-like bodies movingslowly inwards may yield the necessary particle size distribution.  it is interesting to note that this dynamical description is able to accountfor the main observational properties of the \bp\ disk, such as the power lawdistribution with possibly a change in slope, the asymmetry at large distances,and the total mass, all of which have remained unexplained up to now. ifconfirmed, this scenario may indicate that the \bp\ disk could be looked on asa gigantic multi-cometary tail with its natural constituents: gas and dust.

astro-ph;9612215	the effect of metallicity on the cepheid distance scale and its  implications for the hubble constant ($h_0$) determination	recent hst determinations of the expansion's rate of the universe (the hubbleconstant, h_0) assumed that the cepheid period-luminosity relation at v and iare independent of metallicity (freedman, et al., 1996, saha et al., 1996,tanvir et al., 1995). the three groups obtain different vales for h_0. we notethat most of this discrepancy stems from the asumption (by both groups) thatthe period-luminosity relation is independent of metallicity. we come to thisconclusion as a result of our study of the period-luminosity relation of 481cepheids with 3 millions two colour measurements in the large magellanic cloudand the small magellanic cloud obtained as a by-product of the erosmicrolensing survey. we find that the derived interstellar absorptioncorrections are particularly sensitive to the metallicity and when our resultis applied to recent estimates based on hst cepheids observations it makes thelow-h_0 values higher and the high-h_0 value lower, bringing those discrepantestimates into agrement around $h_0 \approx 70 km/s mpc^{-1}$.

astro-ph;9612216	metallicity effects on the cepheid extragalactic distance scale from  eros photometry in lmc and smc	this is an investigation of the period-luminosity relation of classicalcepheids in samples of different metallicity. it is based on 481 cepheids inthe large and small magellanic clouds from the blue and red filter ccdobservations (most similar to v_j &amp; r_j) of the french eros microlensingproject. the data-set is complete and provides an excellent basis for adifferential analysis between lmc and smc. in comparison to previous studies ofeffects on the pl-relation, the eros data-set offers extremely well-sampledlight curves and well-filled instability strips. this allows reliableseparation of cepheids pulsating in the fundamental and the first overtone modeand derivation of differential reddening. our main result concerns thedetermination of distances to galaxies which are inferred by using the lmc as abase and using two color photometry to establish the amount of reddening. wefind a zero-point offset between smc and lmc which amounts to a differencebetween inferred and true distance modulus of 0.14 \pm 0.06 mag in the vi_csystem. the offset is exactly the same in both sets of pl-relations - of thefundamental and of the first overtone mode cepheids. no effect is seen on theslopes of the pl-relations, although the fundamental and the first overtonemode cepheids have different pl slopes. we attribute the color and thezero-point offset to the difference in metallicity between the smc and lmccepheids. a metallicity effect of that small magnitude still has importantconsequencies for the inferred cepheid distances and the determination of h_0.when applied to recent estimates based on hst cepheid observations, ourmetallicity dependence makes the low-h_0 values (sandage et al. 1994) higherand the high-h_0 values (freedman et al. 1994b) lower, thus bringing those

astro-ph;9708001	a high deuterium abundance at z=0.7	of the light elements, the primordial abundance of deuterium, (d/h)_p,provides the most sensitive diagnostic for the cosmological mass densityparameter omega_b. recent high redshift (d/h) measurements are highlydiscrepant, although this may reflect observational uncertainties. the larger(d/h) values, which imply a low omega_b and require the universe to bedominated by non-baryonic matter (dynamical studies indicate a higher totaldensity parameter), cause problems for galactic chemical evolution models sincethey have difficulty in reproducing the large decline down to the lowerpresent-day (d/h). conversely, low (d/h) values imply an omega_b greater thanderived from ^7li and ^4he abundance measurements, and may require a deuteriumabundance evolution that is too low to easily explain. here we report the firstmeasurement at intermediate redshift, where the observational difficulties aresmaller, of a gas cloud with ideal characteristics for this experiment. ouranalysis of the z = 0.7010 absorber toward 1718+4807 indicates (d/h) = 2.0 +/-0.5 x 10^{-4} which is in the high range. this and other independentobservations suggests there may be a cosmological inhomogeneity in (d/h)_p ofat least a factor of ten.

astro-ph;9807004	detection of spatial variations in the (d/h) ratio in the local  interstellar medium	we present high spectral resolution hst-ghrs observations of the white dwarfg191-b2b, and derive the interstellar d/h ratio on the line of sight. we haveobserved and analysed simultaneously the interstellar lines of hi, di, ni, oi,siii, and siiii. we detect three absorbing clouds, and we measure an average(d/h) ratio: n(di)_total / n(hi)_total = 1.12 +/- 0.08 x 10**-5, indisagreement with the value of the d/h ratio as measured toward capella bylinsky et al. (1993, 1995). we re-analyze the ghrs data of the capella line ofsight, and confirm their estimate, as we find: (d/h)_capella = 1.56 +/- 0.1 x10**-5, in the local interstellar cloud in which the sun is embedded. thisshows that the d/h ratio varies by at least 30% within the local interstellarmedium (not to be confused with the local interstellar cloud).  furthermore, the local interstellar cloud is also detected toward our targetg191-b2b, and we show that the d/h ratio in this component, toward g191-b2b,can be made compatible with that derived toward capella. however, this comes atthe expense of a much smaller value for the d/h ratio as averaged over theother two components, of order 0.9 x 10**-5, and in such a way that the d/hratio, as averaged over all three components, remains at the above value, i.e.1.12 x 10**-5.  we thus conclude that, either the d/h ratio varies from cloud to cloud,and/or the d/h ratio varies within the local interstellar cloud in which thesun is embedded, although we note that our observations neither prove nordisprove this latter possibility.

astro-ph;9909061	ultraviolet observations of sirius a and sirius b with hst-ghrs; an  interstellar cloud with a possible low deuterium abundance	we present new observations of the binary sirius a / sirius b performed withhst-ghrs. two interstellar clouds are detected on this sightline, one of thembeing identified as the local interstellar cloud (lic). the interstellarstructure of this sightline is constrained by high spectral resolution data ofthe species oi, ni, siii, cii, feii and mgii. lyman alpha interstellar linesare also observed toward the two stars. but whereas the deuterium lyman alphaline is well detected in the lic with an abundance in agreement with thatobtained by linsky et al. (1993 &amp; 1995), no significant di line is detected inthe other cloud.  however, the lyman alpha lines toward sirius a and sirius b are not trivial.an excess of absorption is seen in the blue wing of the sirius a lyman alphaline and interpreted as the wind from sirius a. in its white dwarf companion,an excess in absorption is seen in the red wing and interpreted as the core ofthe sirius b photospheric lyman alpha line. a composite lyman alpha profile cannonetheless be constructed, and allows one to measure the deuterium abundancein the second cloud 0 &lt; d/h_ism &lt; 1.6 10^-5, which is marginally in agreementwith the linsky et al. (1993 &amp; 1995) value. this sightline appears consequentlyas a good candidate for a low d/h_ism.

0811.3923	stellar activity of planetary host star hd 189733	extra-solar planet search programs require high-precision velocitymeasurements. they need to study how to disentangle radial-velocity variationsdue to doppler motion from the noise induced by stellar activity. we monitoredthe active k2v star hd 189733 and its transiting planetary companion that has a2.2-day orbital period. we used the high-resolution spectograph sophie mountedon the 1.93-m telescope at the observatoire de haute-provence to obtain 55spectra of hd 189733 over nearly two months. we refined the hd 189733b orbitparameters and put limits on the eccentricity and on a long-term velocitygradient. after subtracting the orbital motion of the planet, we compared thevariability of spectroscopic activity indices to the evolution of theradial-velocity residuals and the shape of spectral lines. the radial velocity,the spectral-line profile and the activity indices measured in hei (5875.62\aa), halpha (6562.81 \aa) and the caii h&amp;k lines (3968.47 \aa and 3933.66 \aa,respectively) show a periodicity around the stellar rotation period and thecorrelations between them are consistent with a spotted stellar surface inrotation. we used such correlations to correct for the radial-velocity jitterdue to stellar activity. this results in achieving high precision on the orbitparameters, with a semi-amplitude k = 200.56 \pm 0.88 m.s-1 and a derivedplanet mass of m_{p}=1.13 \pm 0.03 m$_{jup}$.
