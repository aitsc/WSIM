0901.1138	the acs fornax cluster survey. v. measurement and recalibration of  surface brightness fluctuations and a precise value of the fornax--virgo  relative distance	we present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster imaged withhst/acs. these are combined with measurements for virgo cluster galaxies toderive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band sbf absolute magnitude asa function of g-z. in all, we tabulate recalibrated sbf distances for 134galaxies in virgo, fornax, the virgo w' group, and ngc4697 in the virgosouthern extension. the calibration procedure yields a precise relativedistance modulus for fornax with respect to virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or adistance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. the resulting fornax distance modulus is 31.51+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 mpc, where the second set of error barsreflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed virgo distance of 16.5 mpc.the rms distance scatter for the early-type fornax galaxies is0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.this translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or "cosmic",scatter sigma_cosmic in the sbf calibration, unlike in virgo. as a result, weare able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic&lt;0.08 mag, atleast for galaxies with g-z&gt;1.02. we also present an alternative sbfcalibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter nbar, a proxy for galaxymass, which gives a consistent relative distance. finally, we find no evidencefor systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,no current infall); the fornax cluster appears both compact and wellvirialized.[abridged]

0704.1189	the kinematics and dynamics of the globular clusters and the planetary  nebulae of ngc 5128	a new kinematic and dynamic study of the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy,ngc 5128, is presented. from a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotationaxis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for thehalo of ngc 5128. the globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radialdependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular clustersample into 158 metal-rich ([fe/h] &gt; -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -1.0)globular clusters. our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich andmetal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. the kinematics are compared to theplanetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regionsof the halo. the total mass of ngc 5128 is found using the tracer massestimator (evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internalrandom motions, and the spherical component of the jeans equation to determinethe mass supported by rotation. we find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and(1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radiusof 50 kpc. lastly, we present a new and homogeneous catalog of known globularclusters in ngc 5128. this catalog combines all previous definitive clusteridentifications from radial velocity studies and hst imaging studies, as wellas 80 new globular clusters from a study of m.a. beasley et al.

0907.2524	the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor globular clusters in m87:  confirmation from deep hst/acs imaging	metal-poor globular clusters (gcs) are our local link to the earliest epochsof star formation and galaxy building. studies of extragalactic gc systemsusing deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope tothe color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs in a number of galaxies. wepresent a study of the m87 gc system using deep, archival hst/acs imaging withthe f606w and f814w filters, in which we find a significant color-magnituderelation for the metal-poor gcs. the slope of this relation in the i vs. v-icolor-magnitude diagram ($\gamma_i=-0.024\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistentwith expectations based on previously published results using data from the acsvirgo cluster survey. the relation is driven by the most luminous gcs, thosewith $m_i&lt;-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor gcsbrighter than $m_i=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fittedgaussian mean for the luminosity function (lf) of blue, metal-poor gcs (~0.8mag fainter than the mean for all gcs). these results indicate that there is amass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenariowhere self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. we show thatpreviously measured half-light radii of m87 gcs from best-fit psf-convolvedking models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study,and we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs is realand cannot be an artifact of the photometry. we fit gaussian and evolvedschechter functions to the luminosity distribution of gcs across all colors, aswell as divided into blue and red subpopulations, finding that the blue gcshave a brighter mean luminosity and a narrower distribution than the red gcs.finally, we present a catalog of astrometry and photometry for 2250 m87 gcs.

1001.0979	the mass-metallicity relation of globular clusters in the context of  nonlinear color-metallicty relations	two recent empirical developments in the study of extragalactic globularcluster (gc) populations are the color-magnitude relation of the blue gcs (the"blue tilt") and the nonlinearity of the dependence of optical gc colors onmetallicity. the color-magnitude relation, interpreted as a mass-metallicityrelation, is thought to be a consequence of self-enrichment. nonlinearcolor-metallicity relations have been shown to produce bimodal colordistributions from unimodal metallicity distributions. we simulate gcpopulations including both a mass-metallicity scaling relation and nonlinearcolor-metallicity relations motivated by theory and observations. depending onthe assumed range of metallicities and the width of the gc luminosity function(gclf), we find that the simulated populations can have bimodal colordistributions with a "blue tilt" similar to observations, even though themetallicity distribution appears unimodal. the models that produce thesefeatures have the relatively high mean gc metallicities and nearly equal blueand red peaks characteristic of giant elliptical galaxies. the blue tilt isless apparent in the models with metallicities typical of dwarf ellipticals;the narrower gclf in these galaxies has an even bigger effect in reducing thesignificance of their color-magnitude slopes. we critically examine theevidence for nonlinearity versus bimodal metallicities as explanations for thecharacteristic double-peaked color histograms of giant ellipticals and concludethat the question remains open. we discuss the prospects for furthertheoretical and observational progress in constraining the models presentedhere and for uncovering the true metallicity distributions of extragalacticglobular cluster systems.

1004.2883	the acs fornax cluster survey. viii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in virgo and fornax early-type galaxies and its use as a distance  indicator	we use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globularcluster luminosity function (gclf). the globular cluster system of each galaxywas studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic gclfafter accounting for contamination and completeness effects. the resultspresented here update our virgo measurements and confirm our previous resultsshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the gclf and the absolutemagnitude of the parent galaxy. regarding the use of the gclf as a standardcandle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the virgo andfornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distanceestimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived fromsurface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. fromnumerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the valueof the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsicdispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for virgo and fornaxrespectively. all in all, our study shows that the gclf properties varysystematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy betweengiant and dwarf early-type galaxies. these properties may be influenced by thecluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.

1009.3270	surface brightness fluctuations in the hubble space telescope acs/wfc  f814w bandpass and an update on galaxy distances	we measure surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) magnitudes in the f814wfilter and g-i colors for nine bright early-type fornax cluster galaxies imagedwith the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs). the goal isto achieve the first systematic sbf calibration for the acs/f814w bandpass.because of its much higher throughput, f814w is more efficient for sbf studiesof distant galaxies than the acs/f850lp bandpass that has been used to studynearby systems. over the color range spanned by the sample galaxies,1.06&lt;g-i&lt;1.32 (ab mag), the dependence of sbf magnitude mbar_i on g-i is linearto a good approximation, with slope $\sim2$. when the f850lp sbf distancemeasurements from the acs fornax cluster survey are used to derive absolutembar_i magnitudes, the dependence on g-i becomes extremely tight, with a slopeof $1.8\pm0.2$ and scatter of 0.03 mag. the small observed scatter indicatesboth that the estimated random errors are correct, and that the intrinsicdeviations from the sbf-color relation are strongly correlated between thef814w and f850lp bandpasses, as expected. the agreement with predictions fromstellar population models is good, both in slope and zero point, indicatingthat our mean fornax distance of 20 mpc is accurate. the models predictcurvature in the relation beyond the color limits of our sample; thus, thelinear calibration should not be extrapolated naively. in the appendices, wereconsider the tonry ground-based and jensen nicmos sbf distance catalogues; weprovide a correction formula to ameliorate the small apparent bias in theformer, and the offset needed to make the latter consistent with other sbfstudies. we also tabulate two new sbf distances to galaxies observed in the acsvirgo cluster survey.

1009.3950	ucds in the coma cluster	as part of the hst/acs coma cluster treasury survey, we have undertaken akeck/lris spectroscopic campaign to determine membership for faint dwarfgalaxies. in the process, we discovered a population of ultra compact dwarfgalaxies (ucds) in the core region of the coma cluster. at the distance ofcoma, ucds are expected to have angular sizes 0.01 &lt; r_e &lt; 0.2 arcsec. with acsimaging, we can resolve all but the smallest ones with careful fitting.candidate ucds were chosen based on magnitude, color, and degree of resolution.we spectroscopically confirm 27 objects as bona fide ucd members of the comacluster, a 60% success rate for objects targeted with m_r &lt; -12. we attributethe high success rate in part to the high resolution of hst data and to anapparent large population of ucds in coma. we find that the ucds tend to bestrongly clustered around giant galaxies, at least in the core region of thecluster, and have a distribution and colors that are similar to globularclusters. these findings suggest that ucds are not independent galaxies, butrather have a star cluster origin. this current study provides the denseenvironment datapoint necessary for understanding the ucd population.

1012.2634	the acs fornax cluster survey. x. color gradients of globular cluster  systems in early-type galaxies	we use the largest homogeneous sample of globular clusters (gcs), drawn fromthe acsvcs and acsfcs, to investigate the color gradients of gc systems in 76early-type galaxies. we find that most gc systems possess an obvious negativegradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). for gc systems displaying colorbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor gc subpopulations present shallowerbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these twosubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. the fov of acs mainly restrictsus to measuring the inner gradients of gc systems. these gradients, however,can introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of gcsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. inferred correctionsto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the meancolor of metal-poor gcs and their host galaxy luminosity. the gc colorgradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens areweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarfgalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar massof m_stellar~10^10m_sun. we also measure color gradients for field stars in thehost galaxies. we find that gc color gradients are systematically steeper thanfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is thesame for both. if gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse andweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner gcsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidlywith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. the lack ofstrong gradients in the gc systems of dwarfs, which probably have notexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos wereinefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of gc formation.

1109.5178	nonlinear color-metallicity relations of globular clusters. iii. on the  discrepancy in metallicity between globular cluster systems and their parent  elliptical galaxies	one of the conundrums in extragalactic astronomy is the discrepancy inobserved metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) between the two primestellar components of early-type galaxies-globular clusters (gcs) and halofield stars. this is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupledevolutionary histories between gc systems and their parent galaxies. here weshow, however, that new developments in linking the observed gc colors to theirintrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color-to-metallicity conversions,which translate observed color distributions into strongly-peaked, unimodalmdfs with broad metal-poor tails. remarkably, the inferred gc mdfs are similarto the mdfs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and thoseproduced by chemical evolution models of galaxies. the gc mdf shape,characterized by a sharp peak with a metal-poor tail, indicates a virtuallycontinuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale. thecharacteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the hostgalaxy mass, suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment amongvarious gc systems. given that gcs are bluer than field stars within the samegalaxy, it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of gcs ceasedsomewhat earlier than that of field stellar population, and if so, gcspreferentially trace the major, vigorous mode of star formation events ingalactic formation. we further suggest a possible systematic age differenceamong gc systems, in that the gc systems in more luminous galaxies are older.this is consistent with the downsizing paradigm of galaxies and supportsadditionally the similar nature shared by gcs and field stars. our findingssuggest that gc systems and their parent galaxies have shared a more commonorigin than previously thought, and hence greatly simplify theories of galaxyformation.

1201.1031	optical and ir photometry of globular clusters in ngc1399: evidence for  color-metallicity nonlinearity	we combine new wide field camera~3 ir channel (wfc3/ir) f160w (h) imagingdata for ngc1399, the central galaxy in the fornax cluster, with archival f475w(g), f606w (v), f814w (i), and f850lp (z) optical data from the advanced camerafor surveys (acs). the purely optical g-i, v-i, and g-z colors of ngc1399'srich globular cluster (gc) system exhibit clear bimodality, at least formagnitudes $i_814 &gt; 21.5$. the optical-ir i-h color distribution appearsunimodal, and this impression is confirmed by mixture modeling analysis. thev-h colors show marginal evidence for bimodality, consistent with bimodality inv-i and unimodality in i-h. if bimodality is imposed for i-h with a doublegaussian model, the preferred blue/red split differs from that for opticalcolors; these "differing bimodalities" mean that the optical and optical-ircolors cannot both be linearly proportional to metallicity. consistent with thediffering color distributions, the dependence of i-h on g-i for the matched gcsample is significantly nonlinear, with an inflection point near the trough inthe g-i color distribution; the result is similar for the i-h dependence on g-zcolors taken from the acs fornax cluster survey. these g-z colors have beencalibrated empirically against metallicity; applying this calibration yields acontinuous, skewed, but single-peaked metallicity distribution. taken together,these results indicate that nonlinear color-metallicity relations play animportant role in shaping the observed bimodal distributions of optical colorsin extragalactic gc systems.

0711.1358	the acs fornax cluster survey. ii. the central brightness profiles of  early-type galaxies: a characteristic radius on nuclear scales and the  transition from central luminosity deficit to excess	we analyse hst surface brightness profiles for 143 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters. sersic models provide accurate descriptions of theglobal profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviatesystematically inside a characteristic "break" radius of r_b ~ 0.02r_e wherer_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. the sense of the deviation is suchthat bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -20) typically show central light deficits withrespect to the inward extrapolation of the sersic model, while the greatmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 &lt; m_b &lt; -15) showcentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediateluminosities (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.5) are usually well fitted by sersic models overall radii. the slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measuredat fixed fractions of r_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity ina manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. we showthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of thegalaxy selection function used in that study. to provide a more robustcharacterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameterthat describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inwardextrapolation of the outer sersic model. we find that this parameter variessmoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the virgo andfornax sample galaxies, with no evidence for a dichotomy. we argue that thecentral light excesses (nuclei) in m_b &gt; -19 galaxies may be the analogs of thedense central cores that are predicted by some numerical simulations to formvia gas inflows.

1303.1210	the complex nature of the nuclear star cluster in fcc 277	recent observations have shown that compact nuclear star clusters (nscs) arepresent in up to 80% of galaxies. however, detailed studies of their dynamicaland chemical properties are confined mainly to spiral galaxy hosts, where theyare more easily observed. in this paper we present our study of the nsc in fcc277, a nucleated elliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster. we use a combinationof adaptive optics assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopy, hubblespace telescope imaging, and literature long slit data. we show that while thensc does not appear to rotate within our detection limit of ~6 km/s, rotationis detected at larger radii, where the isophotes appear to be disky, suggestingthe presence of a nuclear disk. we also observe a distinct central velocitydispersion drop that is indicative of a dynamically cold rotating sub-system.following the results of orbit-based dynamical modelling, co-rotating as wellas counter-rotating stellar orbits are simultaneously needed to reproduce theobserved kinematics. we find evidence for varying stellar populations, with thensc and nuclear disk hosting younger and more metal rich stars than the mainbody of the galaxy. we argue that gas dissipation and some level of merginghave likely played an important role in the formation of the nucleus of thisintermediate-mass galaxy. this is in contrast to nscs in low-mass early- typegalaxies, which may have been formed primarily through the infall of starclusters.

1303.1222	measuring detailed chemical abundances from co-added medium resolution  spectra i. tests using milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies and globular  clusters	the ability to measure metallicities and {\alpha}-element abundances inindividual red giant branch (rgb) stars using medium-resolution spectra ($r\approx 6000$) is a valuable tool for deciphering the nature of milky way dwarfsatellites and the history of the galactic halo. extending such studies to moredistant systems like andromeda is beyond the ability of the current generationof telescopes, but by co-adding the spectra of similar stars, we can attain thenecessary signal-to-noise ratio to make detailed abundance measurements. inthis paper, we present a method to determine metallicities and {\alpha}-elementabundances using the co-addition of medium resolution spectra. we test themethod of spectral co-addition using high-s/n spectra of more than 1300 rgbstars from milky way globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies obtainedwith the keck ii telescope/deimos spectrograph. we group similar stars usingphotometric criteria and compare the weighted ensemble average abundances([fe/h], [mg/fe], [si/fe], [ca/fe] and [ti/fe]) of individual stars in eachgroup with the measurements made on the corresponding co-added spectrum. wefind a high level of agreement between the two methods, which permits us toapply this co-added spectra technique to more distant rgb stars, like stars inthe m31 satellite galaxies. this paper outlines our spectral co-addition andabundance measurement methodology and describes the potential biases in makingthese measurements.

1407.2263	the next generation virgo cluster survey. v. modelling the dynamics of  m87 with the made-to-measure method	we study the dynamics of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 from the central tothe outermost regions with the made-to-measure (m2m) method. we use a newcatalogue of 922 globular cluster line-of- sight velocities extending to aprojected radius of 180 kpc (equivalent to 25 m87 effective radii), and sauronintegral field unit data within the central 2.4 kpc. 263 globular clusters,mainly located beyond 40 kpc, are newly observed by the next generation virgosurvey (ngvs). for the m2m modelling, the gravitational potential is taken as acombination of a luminous matter potential with a constant stellarmass-to-light ratio and a dark matter potential modelled as a logarithmicpotential. our best dynamical model returns a stellar mass-to-light ratio inthe i band of m/li = 6.0(+ -0.3) m_sun/l_sun with a dark matter potential scalevelocity of 591(+ -50) km/s and scale radius of 42(+ -10) kpc. we determine thetotal mass of m87 within 180 kpc to be (1.5 + - 0.2) 10^13 m_sun. the masswithin 40 kpc is smaller than previous estimates determined using globularcluster kinematics that did not extend beyond 45 kpc. with our new globularcluster velocities at much larger radii, we see that globular clusters around40 kpc show an anomalously large velocity dispersion which affected previousresults. the mass we derived is in good agreement with that inferred from rosatx-ray observation out to 180 kpc. within 30 kpc our mass is also consistentwith that inferred from chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations, while within120 kpc it is about 20% smaller. the model velocity dispersion anisotropy betaparameter for the globular clusters in m87 is small, varying from -0.2 at thecentre to 0.2 at 40 kpc, and gradually decreasing to zero at 120 kpc.

1410.6291	globular cluster systems in brightest cluster galaxies: a near-universal  luminosity function?	we present the first results from our hst brightest cluster galaxy (bcg)survey of seven central supergiant cluster galaxies and their globular cluster(gc) systems. we measure a total of 48000 gcs in all seven galaxies,representing the largest single gc database. we find that a log-normal shapeaccurately matches the observed luminosity function (lf) of the gcs down to thegclf turnover point, which is near our photometric limit. in addition, the lfhas a virtually identical shape in all seven galaxies. our data underscore thesimilarity in the formation mechanism of massive star clusters in diversegalactic environments. at the highest luminosities (log l &gt; 10^7 l_sun) we findsmall numbers of "superluminous" objects in five of the galaxies; theirluminosity and color ranges are at least partly consistent with those of ucds(ultra-compact dwarfs). lastly, we find preliminary evidence that in the outerhalo (r &gt; 20 kpc), the lf turnover point shows a weak dependence on projecteddistance, scaling as l_0 ~ r^-0.2, while the lf dispersion remains nearlyconstant.

1504.03714	the next generation virgo cluster survey. xii. stellar populations and  kinematics of compact, low-mass early-type galaxies from gemini gmos-ifu  spectroscopy	we present gemini gmos-ifu data of eight compact low-mass early-type galaxies(etgs) in the virgo cluster. we analyse their stellar kinematics, stellarpopulation, and present two-dimensional maps of these properties covering thecentral 5"x 7" region. we find a large variety of kinematics: from non- tohighly-rotating objects, often associated with underlying disky isophotesrevealed by deep images from the next generation virgo cluster survey. in halfof our objects, we find a centrally-concentrated younger and more metal-richstellar population. we analyze the specific stellar angular momentum throughthe lambdar parameter and find six fast-rotators and two slow-rotators, onehaving a thin counter-rotating disk. we compare the local galaxy density andstellar populations of our objects with those of 39 more extended low-massvirgo etgs from the smakced survey and 260 massive ($m&gt;10^{10}$\msun) etgs fromthe a3d sample. the compact low-mass etgs in our sample are located in highdensity regions, often close to a massive galaxy and have, on average, olderand more metal-rich stellar populations than less compact low-mass galaxies. wefind that the stellar population parameters follow lines of constant velocitydispersion in the mass-size plane, smoothly extending the comparable trendsfound for massive etgs. our study supports a scenario where low-mass compactetgs have experienced long-lived interactions with their environment, includingram-pressure stripping and gravitational tidal forces, that may be responsiblefor their compact nature.

1507.02270	galaxies at the extremes: ultra-diffuse galaxies in the virgo cluster	we report the discovery of three large (r29 &gt;~ 1 arcminute) extremely lowsurface brightness (mu_(v,0) ~ 27.0) galaxies identified using our deep,wide-field imaging of the virgo cluster from the burrell schmidt telescope.complementary data from the next generation virgo cluster survey do not resolvered giant branch stars in these objects down to i=24, yielding a lower distancelimit of 2.5 mpc. at the virgo distance, these objects have half-light radii3-10 kpc and luminosities l_v=2-9x10^7 lsun. these galaxies are comparable insize but lower in surface brightness than the large ultradiffuse lsb galaxiesrecently identified in the coma cluster, and are located well within virgo'svirial radius; two are projected directly on the cluster core. one objectappears to be a nucleated lsb in the process of being tidally stripped to forma new virgo ultracompact dwarf galaxy. the others show no sign of tidaldisruption, despite the fact that such objects should be most vulnerable totidal destruction in the cluster environment. the relative proximity of virgomakes these objects amenable to detailed studies of their structural propertiesand stellar populations. they thus provide an important new window onto theconnection between cluster environment and galaxy evolution at the extremes.

1508.07334	the next generation virgo cluster survey. x. properties of ultra-compact  dwarfs in the m87, m49 and m60 regions	we use imaging from the next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) topresent a comparative study of ultra-compact dwarf (ucd) galaxies associatedwith three prominent virgo sub-clusters: those centered on the massive,red-sequence galaxies m87, m49 and m60. we show how ucds can be selected withhigh completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location incolor-color diagrams ($u^*ik_s$ or $u^*gz$). although the central galaxies ineach of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellarmasses, we find large differences in the sizes of their ucd populations, withm87 containing ~3.5 and 7.8 times more ucds than m49 and m60, respectively. therelative abundance of ucds in the three regions scales in proportion tosub-cluster mass, as traced by x-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, numberof globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. we find that the ucds arepredominantly blue in color, with ~85% of the ucds having colors similar toblue gcs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. we present evidence that ucdssurrounding m87 and m49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by theprominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately mergingwith the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominencecorrelates with distance from either galaxy. our analysis provides evidencethat tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in theformation of ucds.

1508.07373	the most massive ultra-compact dwarf galaxy in the virgo cluster	we report on the properties of the most massive ultra-compact dwarf galaxy(ucd) in the nearby virgo cluster of galaxies using imaging from the nextgeneration virgo cluster survey (ngvs) and spectroscopy from keck/deimos. thisobject (m59-ucd3) appears to be associated with the massive virgo galaxy m59(ngc 4621), has an integrated velocity dispersion of 78 km/s, a dynamical massof $3.7\times10^8 m_\odot$, and an effective radius ($r_e$) of 25 pc. with aneffective surface mass density of $9.4\times10^{10} m_\odot/kpc^2$, it is thedensest galaxy in the local universe discovered to date, surpassing the densityof the luminous virgo ucd, m60-ucd1. m59-ucd3 has a total luminosity of$m_{g'}=-14.2$ mag, and a spectral energy distribution consistent with an old(14 gyr) stellar population with [fe/h]=0.0 and [$\alpha$/fe]=+0.2. we alsoexamine deep imaging around m59 and find a broad low surface brightness streampointing towards m59-ucd3, which may represent a tidal remnant of the ucdprogenitor. this ucd, along with similar objects like m60-ucd1 and m59co,likely represents an extreme population of tidally stripped galaxies more akinto larger and more massive compact early-type galaxies than to nuclear starclusters in present-day dwarf galaxies.

0806.0374	the nature of ucds: internal dynamics from an expanded sample and  homogeneous database	we have obtained high-resolution spectra of 23 ultra-compact dwarf galaxies(ucds) in the fornax cluster with -10.4&gt;m_v&gt;-13.5 mag (10^6&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8), usingflames/giraffe at the vlt. this is the largest homogeneous data set of ucdinternal dynamics assembled to date. we derive dynamical m/l ratios for 15 ucdscovered by hst imaging. in the m_v-sigma plane, ucds with m_v&lt;-12 mag areconsistent with the extrapolated faber-jackson relation for luminousellipticals, while fainter ucds are closer to the extrapolated globular cluster(gc) relation. at a given metallicity, fornax ucds have on average 30-40% lowerm/l ratios than virgo ucds, suggesting possible differences in age or darkmatter content between fornax and virgo ucds. for our sample of fornax ucds wefind no significant correlation between m/l ratio and mass. we combine our datawith available m/l ratio measurements of compact stellar systems with10^4&lt;m/m_*&lt;10^8, and normalise all m/l estimates to solar metallicity. we findthat ucds (m &gt; 2*10^6 m_*) have m/l ratios twice as large as gcs (m &lt; 2*10^6m_*). we show that stellar population models tend to under-predict dynamicalm/l ratios of ucds and over-predict those of gcs. considering the scalingrelations of stellar spheroids, ucds align well along the 'fundamentalmanifold', constituting the small-scale end of the galaxy sequence. thealignment for ucds is especially clear for r_e &gt;~ 7 pc, which corresponds todynamical relaxation times that exceed a hubble time. in contrast, gcs exhibita broader scatter and do not appear to align along the manifold. we argue thatucds are the smallest dynamically un-relaxed stellar systems, with m &gt; 2*10^6m_* and 7&lt;r_e&lt;100 pc. future studies should aim at explaining the elevated m/lratios of ucds and the environmental dependence of their properties.

1512.00253	evidence for the rapid formation of low mass early-type galaxies in  dense environments	we explore the environmental dependence of star formation timescales in lowmass galaxies using the [$\alpha$/fe] abundance ratio as an evolutionary clock.we present integrated [$\alpha$/fe] measurements for 11 low mass ($m_\star \sim10^9~m_\odot$) early-type galaxies (etgs) with a large range of cluster-centricdistance in the virgo cluster. we find a gradient in [$\alpha$/fe], where thegalaxies closest to the cluster center (the cd galaxy, m87) have the highestvalues. this trend is driven by galaxies within a projected radius of 0.4~mpc(0.26 times the virial radius of virgo~a), all of which have super-solar[$\alpha$/fe]. galaxies in this mass range exhibit a large scatter in the[$\alpha$/fe]--$\sigma$ diagram, and do not obviously lie on an extension ofthe relation defined by massive etgs. in addition, we find a correlationbetween [$\alpha$/fe] and globular cluster specific frequency ($s_n$),suggesting that low-mass etgs that formed their stars over a short period oftime, were also efficient at forming massive star clusters. the innermostlow-mass etgs in our sample have [$\alpha$/fe] values comparable to that ofm87, implying that environment is the controlling factor for star formationtimescales in dense regions. these low-mass galaxies could be the survivingcounterparts of the objects that have already been accreted into the halo ofm87, and may be the link between present-day low-mass galaxies and the old,metal-poor, high-[$\alpha$/fe], high-$s_n$ stellar populations seen in theouter halos of massive etgs.

astro-ph;0111035	extragalactic planetary nebulae	planetary nebulae (pne) can be used to trace intermediate and old stellarpopulations in galaxies and the intracluster medium out to approximately 20mpc. pne can be easily identified with narrow-band surveys, and their chemicalabundances and radial velocities can be measured with multi-slit or multi-fiberspectrographs. we briefly review what has been accomplished to date, andinclude tables (with references) that summarize the observations of pne in 42galaxies and in the intracluster media of the virgo and fornax clusters. thesurveys for intracluster pne suggest that between 20% and 50% of the clusters'total stellar mass is in the intracluster medium! we illustrate the utility ofpne for dynamical studies by presenting results from a recently completedsurvey of cen a (ngc 5128) with the noao mosaic camera on the ctio 4-mtelescope. the pne and globular cluster surveys extend respectively todistances of 80 kpc and 50 kpc. we compare the kinematics of the stars in cen a(736 pn velocities) to the kinematics of the red and blue globular clusters(188 clusters with measured velocities). the latter include 125 newly confirmedglobular clusters from our survey.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

astro-ph;0205070	the dependence of star formation history and internal structure on  stellar mass for 10^5 low-redshift galaxies	we study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size andinternal structure for a complete sample of 122,808 galaxies drawn from thesloan digital sky survey. we show that low-redshift galaxies divide into twodistinct families at a stellar mass of 3 \times 10^10 m_sol. lower massgalaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the lowconcentrations typical of disks. a significant fraction of the lowest massgalaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. at given stellarmass, the sizes of low mass galaxies are log- normally distributed withdispersion sigma(ln r_50) \sim 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea thatthey form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation ina gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. their median stellar surface massdensity scales with stellar mass as mu* propto m_*^0.54, suggesting that thestellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of itshalo mass. this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons intostars in low mass galaxies increases in propor- tion to halo mass, perhaps as aresult of supernova feedback processes. at stellar masses above 3 \times 10^10m_sol, there is a rapidly increasing frac- tion of galaxies with old stellarpopulations, high surface mass densities and high concentrations typical ofbulges. in this regime, the size distribution is log-normal, but its dispersiondecreases rapidly with increasing stellar mass and the median mass surfacedensity is approximately constant. this suggests that the star formationefficiency decreases in the highest mass halos, and that little star formationoccurs in massive galaxies once they have assembled.

astro-ph;0208422	a young blue tidal stream in ngc 5128	stellar streams in galaxy halos are the natural consequence of a history ofmerging and accretion. we present evidence for a blue tidal stream of youngstars in the nearest giant elliptical galaxy, ngc 5128 (centaurus a). usingoptical ubvr color maps, unsharp masking, and adaptive histogram equalization,we detect a blue arc in the northwest portion of the galaxy that traces apartial ellipse with an apocenter of 8 kpc. we also report the discovery ofnumerous young star clusters that are associated with the arc. the brightest ofthese clusters is spectroscopically confirmed, has an age of 350 myr, and maybe a proto-globular cluster. it is likely that this arc, which is distinct fromthe surrounding shell system and the young jet-related stars in the northeast,is a tidally disrupted stellar stream orbiting the galaxy. both the age derivedfrom the integrated optical colors of the stream and its dynamical disruptiontimescale have values of 200-400 myr. we propose that this stream of youngstars was formed when a dwarf irregular galaxy, or similar sized gas fragment,underwent a tidally triggered burst of star formation as it fell into ngc 5128and was disrupted 300 myr ago. the stars and star clusters in this stream willeventually disperse and become part of the main body of ngc 5128, suggestingthat the infall of gas-rich dwarfs plays a role in the building of stellarhalos and globular cluster systems.

astro-ph;0405188	the acs virgo cluster survey iii. chandra and hst observations of  low-mass x-ray binaries and globular clusters in m87	the acis instrument on board the chandra x-ray observatory has been used tocarry out the first systematic study of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in m87.we identify 174 x-ray point-sources, of which ~150 are likely lmxbs. this lmxbcatalog is combined with deep f475w and f850lp images taken with acs on hst toexamine the connection between lmxbs and globular clusters in m87. of the 1688globular clusters in our catalog, f_x = 3.6 +- 0.5% contain a lmxb and we findthat the metal-rich clusters are 3 +- 1 times more likely to harbor a lmxb thantheir metal-poor counterparts. in agreement with previous findings for othergalaxies, we find that brighter, more metal-rich clusters are more likely tocontain a lmxb. for the first time, however, we are able to demonstrate thatthe probability, p_x, that a given cluster will contain a lmxb dependssensitively on the dynamical properties of the host cluster. specifically, weuse the hst images to measure the half-light radius, concentration index andcentral density, \rho_0, for each globular, and define a parameter, \gamma,which is related to the tidal capture and binary-neutron star exchange rate.our preferred form for p_x is then p_x \propto \gamma \rho_0^{-0.42\pm0.11}(z/z_{\odot})^{0.33\pm0.1}. we argue that if the form of p_x is determined bydynamical processes, then the observed metallicity dependence is a consequenceof an increased number of neutron stars per unit mass in metal-rich globularclusters. finally, we find no compelling evidence for a break in the luminositydistribution of resolved x-ray point sources. instead, the lmxb luminosityfunction is well described by a power law with an upper cutoff at l_x ~ 10^39erg/s.

astro-ph;0503566	the acs virgo cluster survey. vii. resolving the connection between  globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	we investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultra-compactdwarf galaxies (ucds) by examining the properties of several compact objectsassociated with m87, all of which were previously classified as globularclusters. combining imaging from the hubble space telescope with ground-basedkeck spectroscopy, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocitydispersions and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictionsof population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately20pc, and have v-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. these objects,which we consider to be ucds, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticalgalaxies in virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities andcolors. these ucds are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations ofgalaxies more closely than those of galactic globular clusters. there appearsto be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of abouttwo million solar masses. if the ucds are gravitationally bound, then wesuggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental propertydistinguishing globular clusters from ucds. more than half of the ucdcandidates uncovered in the acs virgo cluster survey are associated with asingle galaxy -- m87 -- which suggests that proximity to the virgo center maybe of critical importance for the formation of these objects. these resultsshow that distinguishing bonafide ucds from bright globular clusters requires acareful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,particularly their mass-to-light ratios.

astro-ph;0506314	the acs virgo cluster survey v: sbf calibration for giant and dwarf  early-type galaxies	as part of the advanced camera for survey (acs) virgo cluster survey, we havemeasured surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 100 early-typevirgo galaxies. distances derived from these measurements are needed to explorethe three-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster, study the intrinsicparameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, andcompare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosityfunctions. our sbf measurements have been performed in the f850lp bandpass ofthe wide field channel of the acs on the hubble space telescope. these are thefirst measurements of this kind, and we present the first sbf calibration forthis bandpass. the measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar populationvariations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 andz_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the f475w and f850lp acsfilters. we derive the following calibration for the absolute sbf magnitudem_850: m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in therange 1.3 &lt;(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.6, and m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 &lt;=(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.3. physically,the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giantellipticals and s0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. forthe first time in sbf studies, we are able to provide a firm empiricalcalibration of sbf in early-type dwarf galaxies. our results agree with stellarpopulation model predictions from bruzual &amp; charlot (2003).

astro-ph;0509654	the acs virgo cluster survey ix: the color distributions of globular  cluster systems in early-type galaxies	we present the color distributions of globular cluster (gc) systems for 100virgo cluster early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. thecolor distributions of individual gc systems are consistent with continuoustrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. on average, almostall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor gcs, with the average fractionof metal-rich gcs ranging from 15 to 60%. the colors of both subpopulationscorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red gcs having asteeper slope. to convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary(g-z)-[fe/h] relation calibrated to galactic, m49 and m87 gcs. this relation isnonlinear with a steeper slope for [fe/h] &lt; -0.8. as a result, themetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich gcs vary similarly with respectto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [fe/h]_mp ~ l^0.16 ~m_star^0.17 and [fe/h]_mr ~ l^0.26 ~ m_star^0.22, respectively. although theserelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by windmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to themass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. theoffset between the two gc populations varies slowly (~ m_star^0.05) and isapproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting anearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the twopopulations of gcs. we also find that although the metal-rich gcs show a largerdispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor gcs* that have an equal or largerdispersion in metallicity. like the color-magnitude relation, these relationsderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formationand evolution of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0511251	the acs virgo cluster survey xi. the nature of diffuse star clusters in  early-type galaxies	we use hst/acs imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (dscs). compared toglobular clusters (gcs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities(m_v &gt; -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 &lt; r_h &lt; 30 pc), but they areprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can bemore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical gc (mu_g &gt; 20 mag arcsec^-2).the median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 &lt; g-z &lt; 1.6,which is redder than metal-rich gcs and often as red as the galaxy itself. mostdsc systems thus have mean ages older than 5 gyr or else have super-solarmetallicities. we find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significantexcess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (s0s), andfive visibly contain dust. we also find a substantial population of dscs in thehalo of the giant elliptical m49, associated with the companion galaxy vcc1199. most dsc systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light andassociated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do nothost substantial dsc populations. diffuse star clusters in our sample sharesimilar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that dscs preferentially form, survive, andcoevolve with galactic disks. their properties are broadly consistent withthose of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5magnitudes brighter than dscs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surfacebrightnesses. the closest galactic analogs to the dscs are the old openclusters. we suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in thedisk of the milky way, it would be very difficult to find.

astro-ph;0602297	the acs virgo cluster survey. vi. isophotal analysis and the structure  of early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a detailed analysis of the morphology, isophotalparameters and surface brightness profiles for 100 early-type members of thevirgo cluster, from dwarfs (m_b = -15.1 mag) to giants (m_b = -21.8 mag). eachgalaxy has been imaged in two filters, closely resembling the sloan g and zpassbands, using the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble spacetelescope.  dust and complex morphological structures are common, with kiloparsec-scalestellar disks, bars, and nuclear stellar disks seen in 60% of galaxies withintermediate luminosity (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -17), and dust seen in 42% of galaxiesbrighter than m_b = -18.9 mag. dust morphologies range from faint wisps andpatches on tens of parsec scales, to regular, highly organized kpc-scale dustdisks, often showing evidence of recent star formation.  surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters are derived typicallywithin 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for thefaintest systems, with a resolution (fwhm) of 7 pc. based on a parametrizationof the surface brightness profiles in terms of a sersic or core-sersic model,we find that 1) there is no evidence of a bimodal behavior of the slope, gamma,of the profile in the innermost regions; 2) although the brightest galaxieshave shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles (lowest gamma values) arefound in faint dwarf systems; 3) the widely adopted separation of early-typegalaxies between "core" and "power-law" types, which had originally beenprompted by the claim of a clear bimodal distribution of gamma values, isuntenable; and 4) there is no evidence of a structural dichothomy between dwarfand regular ellipticals.

astro-ph;0603252	the acs virgo cluster survey. viii. the nuclei of early-type galaxies	(abridged) the acs virgo cluster survey is an hst program to obtainhigh-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the virgocluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. based on this large,homogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency ofnucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -15 (66 &lt; f_n &lt; 82%), andfind no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center ofvirgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. resolved stellar nuclei are notpresent in galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -20.5, however, there is no clearevidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence ofnucleation, for a change at m_b ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point betweendwarf and giant galaxies. on average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than atypical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. nuclearluminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than m_b ~-17.6, nuclear colors. comparing the nuclei to the "nuclear clusters" found inlate-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosityand overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is ratherinsensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. the meannuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the meansbh-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detectedsupermassive black holes (sbhs). we argue that compact stellar nuclei might bethe low-mass counterparts of the sbhs detected in the bright galaxies, and thatone should think in terms of "central massive objects" -- either sbhs orcompact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-typegalaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.

astro-ph;0603840	a fundamental relation between compact stellar nuclei, supermassive  black holes, and their host galaxies	imaging surveys with the hubble space telescope (hst) have shown that roughly50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellarnucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. wecombine hst imaging for early-type galaxies from the acs virgo cluster surveywith ground-based long-slit spectra from kpno to show that the masses ofcompact stellar nuclei in virgo cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation withthe masses of the host galaxies. the same correlation is obeyed by thesupermassive black holes (sbhs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. thecompact stellar nuclei in the local group galaxies m33 and ngc205 are alsofound to fall along this same scaling relation. these results indicate that ageneric by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a central massiveobject (cmo) -- either a sbh or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains amean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. in galaxies with massesgreater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, sbhs appear to be the dominantmode of cmo formation.

astro-ph;0609079	the acs virgo cluster survey. xiv. analysis of color-magnitude relations  in globular cluster systems	we examine the correlation between globular cluster (gc) color and magnitudeusing hst/acs imaging for a sample of 79 early-type galaxies (-21.7&lt;m_b&lt;-15.2mag) with accurate sbf distances from the acs virgo cluster survey. using thekmm mixture modeling algorithm, we find a highly significant correlation,d(g-z)/dz = -0.037 +- 0.004, between color and magnitude for the subpopulationof blue gcs in the co-added gc color-magnitude diagram of the three brightestvirgo galaxies (m49, m87 and m60): brighter gcs are redder than their faintercounterparts. for the single gc systems of m87 and m60, we find similarcorrelations; m49 does not appear to show a significant trend. there is nocorrelation between (g-z) and m_z for gcs of the red subpopulation. thecorrelation d(g-z)/dg for the blue subpopulation is much weaker than d(g-z)/dz.using monte carlo simulations, we attribute this to the fact that the bluesubpopulation in m_g extends to higher luminosities than the red subpopulation,which biases the kmm fits. the correlation between color and m_z thus is a realeffect. this conclusion is supported by biweight fits to the same colordistributions. we identify two environmental dependencies of thecolor-magnitude relation: (1) the slope decreases in significance withdecreasing galaxy luminosity; and (2) the slope is stronger for gcs at smallergalactocentric distances. we examine several mechanisms that might give rise tothe observed color-magnitude relation: (1) presence of contaminators; (2)accretion of gcs from low-mass galaxies; (3) stochastic effects; (4) capture offield stars by individual gcs; and (5) gc self-enrichment. we conclude thatself-enrichment and field-star capture, or a combination of these processes,offer the most promising means of explaining our observations.

astro-ph;0609371	trends in the globular cluster luminosity function of early-type  galaxies	we present results from a study of the globular cluster luminosity function(gclf) in a sample of 89 early-type galaxies observed as part of the acs virgocluster survey. using a gaussian parametrization of the gclf, we find a highlysignificant correlation between the gclf dispersion, sigma, and the galaxyluminosity, m_b, in the sense that the gc systems in fainter galaxies havenarrower luminosity functions. the gclf dispersions in the milky way and m31are fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation betweensigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions thatgclf shape is a function of galaxy hubble type. we show that the sigma - m_brelation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)cluster masses in fainter galaxies. we further show that this behavior ismirrored by a steepening of the gc mass function for relatively high masses, m&gt;~ 3 x 10^5 m_sun, a mass regime in which the shape of the gclf is not stronglyaffected by dynamical evolution over a hubble time. we argue that this trendarises from variations in initial conditions and requires explanation bytheories of cluster formation. finally, we confirm that in bright galaxies, thegclf "turns over" at the canonical mass scale of m_to ~ 2 x 10^5 m_sun.however, we find that m_to scatters to lower values (~1-2 x 10^5 m_sun) ingalaxies fainter than m_b &gt;~ -18.5, an important consideration if the gclf isto be used as a distance indicator for dwarf ellipticals.

astro-ph;0702496	the acs virgo cluster survey. xii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in early type galaxies	we analyze the luminosity function of the globular clusters (gcs) belongingto the early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. we haveobtained estimates for a gaussian representation of the gc luminosity function(gclf) for 89 galaxies. we have also fit the gclfs with an "evolved schechterfunction", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-massgcs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initialschechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. we find asignificant trend of the gclf dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sensethat smaller galaxies have narrower gclfs. we show that this narrowing of thegclf in a gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the gc massfunction above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. weargue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the gc mass function is mostlikely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster massfunction. the gclf turnover mass m_to is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5m_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with m_b &gt;~ -18.we show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamicalfriction timescales in smaller galaxies. we probe the variation of the gclf toprojected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the virgo giants m49 and m87,finding that m_to is essentially constant over these spatial scales. our fitsof evolved schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (delta) overa hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10^5 &lt;~ (delta/m_sun) &lt; 10^6 per gc.we agree with previous suggestions that if the full gclf is to be understood inmore detail gclf models will have to include self-consistent treatments ofdynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials.
