0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0706.3554	testing gravity with motion of satellites around galaxies: newtonian  gravity against modified newtonian dynamics	the motion of satellite galaxies around normal galaxies at distances 50-500kpc provides a sensitive test for the theories. we study the surface densityand the velocities of satellites around isolated galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey. we find that the surface number-density of satellites declines withthe projected distance as a power law with the slope -1.5-2. the rms velocitiesgradually decline: observations exclude constant velocities at a 10 sigmalevel. we show that observational data strongly favor the standard model: allthree major statistics of satellites - the number-density profile, theline-of-sight velocity dispersion, and the distribution function of thevelocities -- agree remarkably well with the predictions of the standardcosmological model. thus, that the success of the standard model extends toscales (50-500) kpc, much lower than what was previously considered. mond failson these scales for models which assume any single power-law number-densityprofile of satellites and any constant velocity anisotropy by predicting nearlyconstant rms velocities of satellites. satellite data can be fit by fine-tunedmodels, which require (1) specific non-power-law density profile, (2) veryradial orbits at large distances (velocity anisotropy beta =0.6-0.7 at 200-300kpc), and (3) 2-2.5 times more stellar mass than what is found in the galaxies.the external gravity force - a necessary component for mond -- makes thesituation even worse. we argue that a combination of satellite data andobservational constraints on stellar masses make these models very problematic.

0905.3270	hints of the existence of axion-like-particles from the gamma-ray  spectra of cosmological sources	axion like particles (alps) are predicted to couple with photons in thepresence of magnetic fields. this effect may lead to a significant change inthe observed spectra of gamma-ray sources such as agns. here we carry out adetailed study that for the first time simultaneously considers in the sameframework both the photon/axion mixing that takes place in the gamma-ray sourceand that one expected to occur in the intergalactic magnetic fields. anefficient photon/axion mixing in the source always means an attenuation in thephoton flux, whereas the mixing in the intergalactic medium may result in adecrement and/or enhancement of the photon flux, depending on the distance ofthe source and the energy considered. interestingly, we find that decreasingthe value of the intergalactic magnetic field strength, which decreases theprobability for photon/axion mixing, could result in an increase of theexpected photon flux at earth if the source is far enough. we also find a 30%attenuation in the intensity spectrum of distant sources, which occurs at anenergy that only depends on the properties of the alps and the intensity of theintergalactic magnetic field, and thus independent of the agn source beingobserved. moreover, we show that this mechanism can easily explain recentpuzzles in the spectra of distant gamma-ray sources... [abridged] theconsequences that come from this work are testable with the current generationof gamma-ray instruments, namely fermi (formerly known as glast) and imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes like cangaroo, hess, magic and veritas.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1101.4645	magic discovery of vhe emission from the fsrq pks 1222+21	very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission from the flat spectrum radio quasar(fsrq) pks 1222+21 (4c 21.35, z=0.432) was detected with the magic cherenkovtelescopes during a short observation (~0.5 hr) performed on 2010 june 17. themagic detection coincides with high energy mev/gev gamma-ray activity measuredby the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi satellite. the vhespectrum measured by magic extends from about 70 gev up to at least 400 gev andcan be well described by a power law dn/de \propto e^-gamma with a photon indexgamma= 3.75+/-0.27stat +/-0.2syst. the averaged integral flux above 100 gev is(4.56+/-0.46)x10^(-10) cm^-2 s^-1 (~1 crab nebula flux). the vhe flux measuredby magic varies significantly within the 30 min exposure implying a fluxdoubling time of about 10 min. the vhe and mev/gev spectra, corrected for theabsorption by the extragalactic background light (ebl), can be described by asingle power law with photon index 2.72+/-0.34 between 3 gev and 400 gev, andis consistent with emission belonging to a single component in the jet. theabsence of a spectral cutoff constrains the gamma-ray emission region outsidethe broad line region, which would otherwise absorb the vhe gamma-rays.together with the detected fast variability, this challenges present emissionmodels from jets in fsrq. moreover, the combined fermi/lat and magic spectraldata yield constraints on the density of the extragalactic background light inthe uv-optical to near-infrared range that are compatible with recent models.

1103.0477	searches for dark matter annihilation signatures in the segue 1  satellite galaxy with the magic-i telescope	we report the results of the observation of the nearby satellite galaxy segue1 performed by the magic-i ground-based gamma-ray telescope between november2008 and march 2009 for a total of 43.2 hours. no significant gamma-rayemission was found above the background. differential upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived assuming various power-law slopes for the possibleemission spectrum. integral upper limits are also calculated for severalpower-law spectra and for different energy thresholds. the values are of theorder of 10^{-11} ph cm^{-2}$ s^{-1} above 100 gev and 10^{-12} ph cm^{-2}s^{-1} above 200 gev. segue 1 is currently considered one of the mostinteresting targets for indirect dark matter searches. in these terms, theupper limits have been also interpreted in the context of annihilating darkmatter particles. for such purpose, we performed a grid scan over a reasonableportion of the parameter space for the minimal supergravity model and computedthe flux upper limit for each point separately, taking fully into account thepeculiar spectral features of each model. we found that in order to match theexperimental upper limits with the model predictions, a minimum flux boost of10^{3} is required, and that the upper limits are quite dependent on the shapeof the gamma-ray energy spectrum predicted by each specific model. finally wecompared the upper limits with the predictions of some dark matter models ableto explain the pamela rise in the positron ratio, finding that segue 1 data arein tension with the dark matter explanation of the pamela spectrum in the caseof a dark matter candidate annihilating into tau+tau-. a complete exclusionhowever is not possible due to the uncertainties in the segue 1 astrophysicalfactor.

1103.4534	extragalactic background light inferred from aegis galaxy sed-type  fractions	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is of fundamental importance bothfor understanding the entire process of galaxy evolution and for gamma-rayastronomy. however, the overall spectrum of the ebl between 0.1 and 1000microns has never been determined directly neither from observed luminosityfunctions (lfs), over a wide redshift range, nor from any multiwavelengthobservation of galaxy spectral energy distributions (seds). the evolving,overall spectrum of the ebl is derived here utilizing a novel method based onobservations only. the changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forminggalaxies, starburst galaxies and active galactic nucleus (agn) galaxies fromredshift 0.2 to 1 are estimated, and two alternative extrapolations of sedtypes to higher redshifts are considered. this allows calculation of theevolving ebl. the ebl uncertainties in our modelling based directly on the dataare quantified, and their consequences for attenuation of very-high-energygamma-rays due to pair production on the ebl are discussed. it is concludedthat the ebl seems well constrained from the uv to the mid-ir at an intensitylevel roughly matching galaxy count data. independent efforts from ir andgamma-ray astronomy are needed in order to reduce the uncertainties in thefar-ir.

1103.5677	a search for very high energy gamma-ray emission from scorpius x-1 with  the magic telescopes	the acceleration of particles up to gev or higher energies in microquasarshas been the subject of considerable theoretical and observational efforts inthe past few years. sco x-1 is a microquasar from which evidence of highlyenergetic particles in the jet has been found when it is in the so-calledhorizontal branch (hb), a state when the radio and hard x-ray fluxes are higherand a powerful relativistic jet is present. here we present the first very highenergy gamma-ray observations of sco x-1 obtained with the magic telescopes. ananalysis of the whole dataset does not yield a significant signal, with 95% clflux upper limits above 300 gev at the level of 2.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s.simultaneous rxte observations were conducted to search for tev emission duringparticular x-ray states of the source. a selection of the gamma-ray dataobtained during the hb based on the x-ray colors did not yield a signal either,with an upper limit of 3.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s. these upper limits place aconstraint on the maximum tev luminosity to non-thermal x-ray luminosity ofl_{vhe}/l_{ntx}&lt;0.02, that can be related to a maximum tev luminosity to jetpower ratio of l_{vhe}/l_{j}&lt;10^{-3}. our upper limits indicate that theunderlying high-energy emission physics in sco x-1 must be inherently differentfrom that of the hitherto detected gamma-ray binaries.

1104.3530	dark matter searches with cherenkov telescopes: nearby dwarf galaxies or  local galaxy clusters?	in this paper, we compare dwarf galaxies and galaxy clusters in order toelucidate which object class is the best target for gamma-ray dm searches withimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts). we have built a mixeddwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarfgalaxies (draco, ursa minor, wilman 1 and segue 1) and local galaxy clusters(perseus, coma, ophiuchus, virgo, fornax, ngc5813 and ngc5846), and thencompute their dm annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latestmodeling of their dm density profiles. we also include in our calculations theeffect of dm substructure. willman 1 appears as the best candidate in thesample. however, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably othercandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely ursa minorand segue 1, might be better options. as for galaxy clusters, virgo representsthe one with the highest flux. however, its large spatial extension can be aserious handicap for iact observations and posterior data analysis. yet, otherlocal galaxy cluster candidates with more moderate emission regions, such asperseus, may represent good alternatives. after comparing dwarfs and clusters,we found that the former exhibit annihilation flux profiles that, at thecenter, are roughly one order of magnitude higher than those of clusters,although galaxy clusters can yield similar, or even higher, integrated fluxesfor the whole object once substructure is taken into account. even when any ofthese objects are strictly point-like according to the properties of theirannihilation signals, we conclude that dwarf galaxies are best suited forobservational strategies based on the search of point-like sources, whilegalaxy clusters represent best targets for analyses that can deal with ratherextended emissions. finally, we study the detection prospects for iacts[abridged]

1104.5586	clara's view on the escape fraction of lyman-alpha photons in high  redshift galaxies	using clara (code for lyman alpha radiation analysis) we constrain the escapefraction of lyman-alpha radiation in galaxies in the redshift range 5&lt;z&lt;7,based on the marenostrum high-z universe, a sph cosmological simulation withmore than 2 billion particles. we approximate lyman-alpha emitters (laes) asdusty gaseous slabs with lyman-alpha radiation sources homogeneously mixed inthe gas. escape fractions for such a configuration and for different gas anddust contents are calculated using our newly developed radiative transfer codeclara. the results are applied to the marenostrum high-z universe numericalgalaxies. the model shows a weak redshift evolution and good agreement withestimations of the escape fraction as a function of reddening from observationsat z \sim 2.2 and z \sim 3. we extend the slab model by including additionaldust in a clumpy component in order to reproduce the uv con- tinuum luminosityfunction and uv colours at redshifts z&gt;~5. the lae luminosity function (lf)based on the extended clumpy model reproduces broadly the bright end of the lfderived from observations at z \sim 5 and z \sim 6. at z \sim 7 our modelover-predicts the lf by roughly a factor of four, presumably because theeffects of the neutral intergalactic medium are not taken into account. theremaining tension between the observed and simulated faint end of the lf, bothin the uv-continuum and lyman-alpha at redshifts z \sim 5 and z \sim 6 pointstowards an overabundance of simulated laes hosted in haloes of masses1.0x10^10h-1msol &lt; mh &lt; 4.0x10^10h-1msol. given the difficulties in explainingthe observed overabundance by dust absorption, a probable origin of themismatch are the high star formation rates in the simulated haloes around thequoted mass range. a more efficient supernova feedback should be able toregulate the star formation process in the shallow potential wells of thesehaloes.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1109.0228	modelling the fraction of lyman break galaxies with strong lyman alpha  emission at 5 &lt; z &lt; 7	we present theoretical results for the expected fraction of lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) to be detected as strong lyman alpha emitters (laes) in theredshift range 5 &lt; z &lt; 7. we base our analysis on the 2-billion particle sphsimulation marenostrum high-z universe. we approximate galaxies as static dustyslabs with an additional clumpy dust distribution affecting stellar populationsyounger than 25 myr. the model for the lyman alpha escape fraction is based onthe results of our monte-carlo radiative transfer code (clara) for a slabconfiguration. we also fix the transmission of lyman alpha photons through theintergalactic medium to a constant value of 50% at all redshifts. from theresults of this model we calculate xlya, the fraction of lyman break galaxieswith lyman alpha equivalent width (ew) larger than 50 angstrom. we find aremarkable agreement with observational data at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 6. for bright (-22 &lt;muv &lt; -20.5) and faint (-20.5 &lt; muv &lt; -18.5) galaxies our model predicts xlya =0.02 \pm 0.01 and xlya = 0.47 \pm 0.01 while observers report xlya = 0.08 \pm0.02 and xlya = 0.47 \pm 0.16, respectively. additional evolution of theextinction model at redshift z \sim 7, that decreases the intensity oftransmitted lyman alpha radiation by a factor of f_t = 0.4 as to match the laeluminosity function at z \sim 6.5, naturally provides a good match for therecently reported xlya fractions at z &gt; 6.3. exploring different toy models forthe lyman alpha escape fraction, we show that a decreasing lyman alpha escapefraction with increasing uv galaxy luminosity is a key element in our model toexplain the of larger xlya fractions for fainter lbgs.

1110.3305	clues on fermi-lat prospects for the extragalactic detection of munussm  gravitino dark matter	the munussm is a supersymmetric model that has been proposed to solve theproblems generated by other supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ofparticle physics. given that r-parity is broken in the munussm, the gravitinois a natural candidate for decaying dark matter since its lifetime becomes muchlonger than the age of the universe. in this model, gravitino dark matter couldbe detectable through the emission of a monochromatic gamma ray in a two-bodydecay.  we study the prospects of the fermi-lat telescope to detect suchmonochromatic lines in 5 years of observations of the most massive nearbyextragalactic objects.  the dark matter halo around the virgo galaxy cluster is selected as areference case, since it is associated to a particularly high signal-to-noiseratio and is located in a region scarcely affected by the astrophysical diffuseemission from the galactic plane.  the simulation of both signal and background gamma-ray events is carried outwith the fermi science tools, and the dark matter distribution around virgo istaken from a n-body simulation of the nearby extragalactic universe, withconstrained initial conditions provided by the clues project.  we find that a gravitino with a mass range of 0.6 to 2 gev, and with alifetime range of about 3x10^27 to 2x10^28 s would be detectable by thefermi-lat with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3. we also obtain thatgravitino masses larger than about 4 gev are already excluded in the munussm byfermi-lat data of the galactic halo

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

0710.5520	the virialized mass of dark matter haloes	(abridged) virial mass is used as an estimator for the mass of a dark matterhalo. however, the commonly used constant overdensity criterion does notreflect the dynamical structure of haloes. here we analyze dark mattercosmological simulations in order to obtain properties of haloes of differentmasses focusing on the size of the region with zero mean radial velocity. darkmatter inside this region is stationary, and thus the mass of this region is amuch better approximation for the virial mass. we call this mass the staticmass to distinguish from the commonly used constant overdensity mass. we alsostudy the relation of this static mass with the traditional virial mass, and wefind that the matter inside galaxy-size haloes is underestimated by the virialmass by nearly a factor of two. at redshift zero the virial mass is close tothe static mass for cluster-size haloes. the same pattern - large haloes havingm_vir &gt; m_static - exists at all redshifts, but the transition mass m_0 = m_vir= m_static decreases dramatically with increasing redshift. when rescaled tothe same m_0 haloes clearly demonstrate a self-similar behaviour, which in astatistical sense gives a relation between the static and virial mass. to oursurprise we find that the abundance of haloes with a given static mass, i.e.the static mass function, is very accurately fitted by the press &amp; schechterapproximation at z=0, but this approximation breaks at higher redshifts.instead, the virial mass function is well fitted as usual by the sheth &amp; tormenapproximation. we find an explanation why the static radius can be 2-3 timeslarger as compared with the constant overdensity estimate. applying thenon-stationary jeans equation we find that the role of the pressure gradientsis significantly larger for small haloes.

1305.2163	measurement of the expansion rate of the universe from \gamma-ray  attenuation	a measurement of the expansion rate of the universe (that is the hubbleconstant, h0) is derived here using the gamma-ray attenuation observed in thespectra of gamma-ray sources produced by the interaction of extragalacticgamma-ray photons with the photons of the extragalactic background light (ebl).the hubble constant that is determined with our technique, for a lambda cdmcosmology, is h0=71.8_{-5.6}^{+4.6}(stat)_{-13.8}^{+7.2}(syst) km s^{-1}mpc^{-1}. this value is compatible with present-day measurements using wellestablished methods such as local distance ladders and cosmological probes. therecent detection of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon (cgrh) from multiwavelengthobservation of blazars, together with the advances in the knowledge of the ebl,allow us to measure the expansion rate of the universe. this estimate of thehubble constant shows that gamma-ray astronomy has reached a mature enoughstate to provide cosmological measurements, which may become more competitivein the future with the construction of the cherenkov telescope array. we findthat the maximum dependence of the cgrh on the hubble constant is approximatelybetween redshifts 0.04 and 0.1, thus this is a smoking gun for planning futureobservational efforts. other cosmological parameters, such as the total darkmatter density omega_m and the dark energy equation of state w, are explored aswell.

1311.3280	the alhambra survey: evolution of galaxy clustering since $z \sim 1$	we study the clustering of galaxies as function of luminosity and redshift inthe range $0.35 &lt; z &lt; 1.25$ using data from the advanced large homogeneous areamedium band redshift astronomical (alhambra) survey. the alhambra data used inthis work cover $2.38 \mathrm{deg}^2$ in 7 independent fields, after applying adetailed angular selection mask, with accurate photometric redshifts, $\sigma_z\lesssim 0.014 (1+z)$, down to $i_{\rm ab} &lt; 24$. given the depth of thesurvey, we select samples in $b$-band luminosity down to $l^{\rm th} \simeq0.16 l^{*}$ at $z = 0.9$. we measure the real-space clustering using theprojected correlation function, accounting for photometric redshiftsuncertainties. we infer the galaxy bias, and study its evolution withluminosity. we study the effect of sample variance, and confirm earlier resultsthat the cosmos and elais-n1 fields are dominated by the presence of largestructures. for the intermediate and bright samples, $l^{\rm med} \gtrsim0.6l^{*}$, we obtain a strong dependence of bias on luminosity, in agreementwith previous results at similar redshift. we are able to extend this study tofainter luminosities, where we obtain an almost flat relation, similar to thatobserved at low redshift. regarding the evolution of bias with redshift, ourresults suggest that the different galaxy populations studied reside in haloescovering a range in mass between $\log_{10}[m_{\rmh}/(h^{-1}\mathrm{m}_{\odot})] \gtrsim 11.5$ for samples with $l^{\rm med}\simeq 0.3 l^{*}$ and $\log_{10}[m_{\rm h}/(h^{-1}\mathrm{m}_{\odot})] \gtrsim13.0$ for samples with $l^{\rm med} \simeq 2 l^{*}$, with typical occupationnumbers in the range of $\sim 1 - 3$ galaxies per halo.

1311.3637	magic upper limits on the grb 090102 afterglow	indications of a gev component in the emission from grbs are known since theegret observations during the 1990's and they have been confirmed by the dataof the fermi satellite. these results have, however, shown that ourunderstanding of grb physics is still unsatisfactory. the new generation ofcherenkov observatories and in particular the magic telescope, allow for thefirst time the possibility to extend the measurement of grbs from several tensup to hundreds of gev energy range. both leptonic and hadronic processes havebeen suggested to explain the possible gev/tev counterpart of grbs.observations with ground-based telescopes of very high energy photons (e&gt;30gev) from these sources are going to play a key role in discriminating amongthe different proposed emission mechanisms, which are barely distinguishable atlower energies. magic telescope observations of the grb 090102 (z=1.547) fieldand fermi large area telescope (lat) data in the same time interval areanalysed to derive upper limits of the gev/tev emission. we compare theseresults to the expected emissions evaluated for different processes in theframework of a relativistic blast wave model for the afterglow. simultaneousupper limits with fermi and a cherenkov telescope have been derived for thisgrb observation. the results we obtained are compatible with the expectedemission although the difficulties in predicting the he and vhe emission forthe afterglow of this event makes it difficult to draw firmer conclusions.nonetheless, magic sensitivity in the energy range of overlap with space-basedinstruments (above about 40 gev) is about one order of magnitude better withrespect to fermi. this makes evident the constraining power of ground-basedobservations and shows that the magic telescope has reached the requiredperformance to make possible grb multiwavelength studies in the very highenergy range.

1401.0464	magic long-term study of the distant tev blazar pks 1424+240 in a  multiwavelength context	we present a study of the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-rayemission of the blazar pks 1424+240 observed with the magic telescopes. theprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization andmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recentdiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z &gt; 0.6 and makes it a promisingcandidate to be the most distant vhe source. the source has been observed withthe magic telescopes in vhe gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 hfrom 2009 to 2011. the source was marginally detected in vhe gamma rays during2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an opticaloutburst in 2011. the combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2sigma. the differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can bedescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0+/- 1.7. the magic spectra corrected for the absorption due to theextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, withthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the fermi-lat. theabsorption-corrected magic spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to400 gev. the multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio andoptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of thejet. the large separation between the two peaks of the constructednon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely highdoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-compton model is applied. wefind that a two-component synchrotron self-compton model describes the spectralenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7059	discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the blazar 1es  0033+595 by the magic telescopes	the number of known very high energy (vhe) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which isvery small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in otherfrequencies. this situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. moreover,vhe blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that thehigh-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the earth, like theextragalactic background light (ebl) and the intergalactic magnetic field(igmf), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.we present the first vhe detection of 1es\,0033+595 with a statisticalsignificance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. the vhe emission of this object is constantthroughout the magic observations (2009 august and october), and can beparameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 gev of$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon indexof ($3.8\pm0.7$). we model its spectral energy distribution (sed) as the resultof inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons. for the study of the sedwe used simultaneous optical r-band data from the kva telescope, archival x-raydata by \textit{swift} as well as \textit{integral}, and simultaneous highenergy (he, $300$\,mev~--~$10$\,gev) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{fermi}lat observatory. using the empirical approach of prandini et al. (2010) and the\textit{fermi}-lat and magic spectra for this object, we estimate the redshiftof this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. this is a relevant result becausethis source is possibly one of the ten most distant vhe blazars known to date,and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role inblazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the ebl and igmf.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

1509.07121	photometric redshifts and clustering of emission line galaxies selected  jointly by des and eboss	we present the results of the first test plates of the extended baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey. this paper focuses on the emission linegalaxies (elg) population targetted from the dark energy survey (des)photometry. we analyse the success rate, efficiency, redshift distribution, andclustering properties of the targets. from the 9000 spectroscopic redshiftstargetted, 4600 have been selected from the des photometry. the total successrate for redshifts between 0.6 and 1.2 is 71\% and 68\% respectively for abright and faint, on average more distant, samples including redshifts measuredfrom a single strong emission line. we find a mean redshift of 0.8 and 0.87,with 15 and 13\% of unknown redshifts respectively for the bright and faintsamples. in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2, for the most secure spectroscopicredshifts, the mean redshift for the bright and faint sample is 0.85 and 0.9respectively. star contamination is lower than 2\%. we measure a galaxy biasaveraged on scales of 1 and 10~mpc/h of 1.72 \pm 0.1 for the bright sample andof 1.78 \pm 0.12 for the faint sample. the error on the galaxy bias have beenobtained propagating the errors in the correlation function to the fittedparameters. this redshift evolution for the galaxy bias is in agreement withtheoretical expectations for a galaxy population with mb-5\log h &lt; -21.0. wenote that biasing is derived from the galaxy clustering relative to a model forthe mass fluctuations. we investigate the quality of the des photometricredshifts and find that the outlier fraction can be reduced using a comparisonbetween template fitting and neural network, or using a random forestalgorithm.

0806.3021	the alhambra project: a large area multi medium-band optical and nir  photometric survey	(abridged) we describe the first results of the alhambra survey whichprovides cosmic tomography of the evolution of the contents of the universeover most of cosmic history. our approach employs 20 contiguous, equal-width,medium-band filters covering from 3500 to 9700 a, plus the jhks bands, toobserve an area of 4 sqdeg on the sky. the optical photometric system has beendesigned to maximize the number of objects with accurate classification by sedand redshift, and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission lines. theobservations are being carried out with the calar alto 3.5m telescope using thecameras laica and o-2000. the first data confirm that we are reaching theexpected magnitude limits of ab&lt;~25 mag in the optical filters from the blue to8300 a, and from ab=24.7 to 23.4 for the redder ones. the limit in the nir is(vega) k_s~20, h~21, j~22. we expect to obtain accurate redshift values, deltaz/(1+z) &lt;~ 0.03 for about 5x10^5 galaxies with i&lt;~25 (60% complete), andz_med=0.74. this accuracy, together with the homogeneity of the selectionfunction, will allow for the study of the redshift evolution of the large scalestructure, the galaxy population and its evolution with redshift, theidentification of clusters of galaxies, and many other studies, without theneed for any further follow-up. it will also provide targets for detailedstudies with 10m-class telescopes. given its area, spectral coverage and itsdepth, apart from those main goals, the alhambra-survey will also producevaluable data for galactic studies.

astro-ph;0101230	a survey for large separation lensed first quasars	little is known about the statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars atlarge (7''-30'') image separations, which probe masses on the scale of galaxyclusters. we have carried out a survey for gravitationally-lensed objects,among sources in the first 20cm radio survey that have unresolved opticalcounterparts in the digitizations of the palomar observatory sky survey. fromthe statistics of ongoing surveys that search for quasars among first sources,we estimate that there are about 9100 quasars in this source sample, makingthis one of the largest lensing surveys to date. using broad-band imaging, wehave isolated all objects with double radio components separated by 5''-30'',that have unresolved optical counterparts with similar bvi colours. ourcriteria for similar colours conservatively allow for observational error andfor colour variations due to time delays between lensed images. spectroscopy ofthese candidates shows that none of the pairs are lensed quasars. this sets anupper limit (95% confidence) on the lensing fraction in this survey of3.3x10^-4, assuming 9100 quasars. although the source redshift distribution ispoorly known, a rough calculation of the expected lensing frequency and thedetection efficiencies and biases suggests that simple theoretical expectationsare of the same order of magnitude as our observational upper limit. ourprocedure is novel in that our exhaustive search for lensed objects does notrequire prior identification of the quasars in the sample as such.characterization of the first-selected quasar population will enable using ourresult to constrain quantitatively the mass properties of clusters.

astro-ph;0105266	the visible environment of galaxies with counterrotation	in this paper we present a statistical study of the environments of 49galaxies in which there is gas- or stellar- counterrotation. the number ofpossible companions in the field (to apparent magnitude 22), their size andconcentration were considered. all the statistical parameters were analysed bymeans of kolgomorov-smirnov tests, using a control sample of 43 galaxieswithout counterrotation. from our data, no significant differences between thecounter-rotating and control samples appear. this is different to seyfert orradio-loud galaxies which lie in environments with a higher density ofcompanions. on the contrary, if a weak tendency exists, for galaxies with gascounterrotation only, it is discovered in regions of space where the largescale density of galaxies is smaller. our results tend to disprove thehypothesis that counterrotation and polar rings derive from a recentinteraction with a small satellite or a galaxy of similar size. to a firstapproximation, they seem to follow the idea that all galaxies are born througha merger process of smaller objects occurring very early in their life, or thatthey derive from a continuous, non-traumatic infall of gas that formed starslater. whatever the special machinery is which produces counterrotation orpolar rings instead of a co-planar, co-rotating distribution of gas and stars,it seems not to be connected to the present galaxy density of theirenvironments.

astro-ph;0202521	new light and shadows on stephan's quintet	we present deep broad-band r and narrow-band halpha images of stephan'squintet. the observations in the r band show that the diffuse halo of thestephan's quintet is larger than previously thought and extends out to ngc7320c. however, we have not found emission connecting ngc 7331 and ngc 7320 tor ~ 26.7 mag/arcsec^2 (at more than 3-sigma level), so there is no directevidence up to this limiting magnitude of a relation between the peculiarkinematical structure found in ngc 7331 and an ongoing or past interactionbetween this galaxy and ngc 7320. the halpha emission at high-velocity(6000-7000 km/s) is distributed in a diffuse structure running ns between ngc7319 and ngc 7318b and in some other more concentrated features. some of theseare located in the tidal tails produced by the interaction between the galaxiesof the group. with the halpha images we have made a two-dimensional velocitymap which helps to identify the origin of each structure detected. this mapdoes not show features at intermediate velocities between the high- andlow-redshift members of the group. this is in agreement with the standardscenario in which the apparent proximity of ngc 7320 to the rest of thegalaxies of the quintet is merely a projection effect. the only point which isunclear in this interpretation, is an halpha filament which is seen extendingthroughout ngc 7320 with velocity at 6500 km/s instead of the 800 km/s expectedfor this galaxy.

astro-ph;0203367	near-ir spectroscopy of planetary nebulae precursors	we present near-ir spectroscopy of a sample of 30 iras sources recentlyidentified as late agb stars, post-agb stars or early  pne. the spectra obtained are centered at various wavelengths covering themolecular hydrogen v=1-0 s(1) and v=2-1 s(1) emission lines, the recombinationlines of hydrogen br-gamma, pf-gamma and br-alpha, and the co[v=2-0] firstovertone bandhead at 2.294 microns. as a result of these observations we haveincreased from 4 to 13 the total number of proto-pne detected in molecularhydrogen. when the molecular hydrogen is fluorescence-excited the detectionrate is found to be directly correlated with the evolutionary stage of thecentral star, rather than with the nebular morphology. in contrast,shocked-excited molecular hydrogen is detected only in strongly bipolarproto-pne, sometimes even at an early stage in the post-agb phase. the strongcorrelation of shocked-excited molecular hydrogen emission with bipolarityfound confirms the result previously reported by kastner et al. (1996) inevolved pne. however, our results show that this correlation does not exist inthe case of fluorescence-excited molecular hydrogen.

astro-ph;0312553	a catalog of compact groups of galaxies in the sdss commissioning data	compact groups (cgs) of galaxies -- relatively poor groups of galaxies inwhich the typical separations between members is of the order of a galaxydiameter -- offer an exceptional laboratory for the study of dense galaxianenvironments with short (&lt;1gyr) dynamical time-scales. in this paper, wepresent an objectively defined catalog of cgs in 153 sq deg of the sloandigital sky survey early data release (sdss edr). to identify cgs, we applied amodified version of hickson's (1982) criteria aimed at finding the highestdensity cgs and thus reducing the number of chance alignments. our catalogcontains 175 cgs down to a limiting galaxy magnitude of r* = 21. the resultingcatalog has a median depth of approximately z = 0.13, substantially deeper thanprevious cg catalogs. since the sdss will eventually image up to one quarter ofthe celestial sphere, we expect our final catalog, based upon the completedsdss, will contain on the order of 5,000 - 10,000 cgs. this catalog will beuseful for conducting studies of the general characteristics of cgs, theirenvironments, and their component galaxies.

astro-ph;0412419	do the unidentified egret sources trace annihilating dark matter in the  local group?	in a cold dark matter (cdm) framework of structure formation, the dark matterhaloes around galaxies assemble through successive mergers with smaller haloes.this merging process is not completely efficient, and hundreds of survivinghalo cores, or {\it subhaloes}, are expected to remain in orbit within the haloof a galaxy like the milky way. while the dozen visible satellites of the milkyway may trace some of these subhaloes, the majority are currently undetected. alarge number of high-velocity clouds (hvcs) of neutral hydrogen {\it are}observed around the milky way, and it is plausible that some of the hvcs maytrace subhaloes undetected in the optical. confirming the existence ofconcentrations of dark matter associated with even a few of the hvcs wouldrepresent a dramatic step forward in our attempts to understand the nature ofdark matter. supersymmetric (susy) extensions of the standard model of particlephysics currently suggest neutralinos as a natural well-motivated candidate forthe non-baryonic dark matter of the universe. if this is indeed the case, thenit may be possible to detect dark matter indirectly as it annihilates intoneutrinos, photons or positrons. in particular, the centres of subhaloes mightshow up as point sources in gamma-ray observations. in this work we considerthe possibility that some of the unidentified egret $\gamma$-ray sources traceannihilating neutralino dark matter in the dark substructure of the localgroup. we compare the observed positions and fluxes of both the unidentifiedegret sources and the hvcs with the positions and fluxes predicted by a modelof halo substructure, to determine to what extent any of these threepopulations could be associated.

astro-ph;0506432	how far do they go? the outer structure of dark matter halos	we study the density profiles of collapsed galaxy-size dark matter halos withmasses 1e11-5e12 msun focusing mostly on the halo outer regions from the formalvirial radius rvir up to 5-7rvir. we find that isolated halos in this massrange extend well beyond rvir exhibiting all properties of virialized objectsup to 2-3rvir: relatively smooth density profiles and no systematic infallvelocities. the dark matter halos in this mass range do not grow as one naivelymay expect through a steady accretion of satellites, i.e., on average there isno mass infall. this is strikingly different from more massive halos, whichhave large infall velocities outside of the virial radius. we provide accuratefit for the density profile of these galaxy-size halos. for a wide range(0.01-2)rvir of radii the halo density profiles are fit with the approximationrho=rho_s exp(-2n[x^{1/n}-1])+rho_m, where x=r/r_s, rho_m is the mean matterdensity of the universe, and the index n is in the range n=6-7.5. theseprofiles do not show a sudden change of behavior beyond the virial radius. forlarger radii we combine the statistics of the initial fluctuations with thespherical collapse model to obtain predictions for the mean and most probabledensity profiles for halos of several masses. the model give excellent resultsbeyond 2-3 formal virial radii.

astro-ph;0609479	the spherical collapse model with shell crossing	in this work, we study the formation and evolution of dark matter halos bymeans of the spherical infall model with shell-crossing. we present a frameworkto tackle this effect properly based on the numerical follow-up, with time, ofthat individual shell of matter that contains always the same fraction of masswith respect to the total mass. in this first step, we do not include angularmomentum, velocity dispersion or triaxiality. within this framework - named asthe spherical shell tracker (sst) - we investigate the dependence of theevolution of the halo with virial mass, with the adopted mass fraction of theshell, and for different cosmologies. we find that our results are verysensitive to a variation of the halo virial mass or the mass fraction of theshell that we consider. however, we obtain a negligible dependence oncosmology. furthermore, we show that the effect of shell-crossing plays acrucial role in the way that the halo reaches the stabilization in radius andthe virial equilibrium. we find that the values currently adopted in theliterature for the actual density contrast at the moment of virialization,delta_vir, may not be accurate enough. in this context, we stress the problemsrelated to the definition of a virial mass and a virial radius for the halo.the question of whether the results found here may be obtained by tracking theshells with an analytic approximation remains to be explored.

hep-ph;0506204	adiabatic compression and indirect detection of supersymmetric dark  matter	recent developments in the modelling of the dark matter distribution in ourgalaxy point out the necessity to consider some physical processes to satisfyobservational data. in particular, models with adiabatic compression, whichinclude the effect of the baryonic gas in the halo, increase significantly thedark matter density in the central region of the milky way. on the other hand,the non-universality in scalar and gaugino sectors of supergravity models canalso increase significantly the neutralino annihilation cross section. we showthat the combination of both effects gives rise to a gamma-ray flux arisingfrom the galactic center largely reachable by future experiments like glast. wealso analyse in this framework the egret excess data above 1 gev, as well asthe recent data from cangaroo and hess. the analysis has been carried outimposing the most recent experimental constraints, such as the lower bound onthe higgs mass, the \bsg branching ratio, and the muon $g-2$. in addition, therecently improved upper bound on $b(b_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-)$ has also been takeninto account. the astrophysical (wmap) bounds on the dark matter density havealso been imposed on the theoretical computation of the relic neutralinodensity through thermal production.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
