0901.1480	radio recombination lines toward the galactic center lobe	the galactic center lobe is a degree-tall shell seen in radio continuumimages of the galactic center (gc) region. if it is actually located in the gcregion, formation models would require massive energy input (e.g., starburst orjet) to create it. at present, observations have not strongly constrained thelocation or physical conditions of the gc lobe. this paper describes theanalysis of new and archival single-dish observations of radio recombinationlines toward this enigmatic object. the observations find that the ionized gashas a morphology similar to the radio continuum emission, suggesting that theyare associated. we study averages of several transitions from h106alpha toh191epsilon and find that the line ratios are most consistent with gas in localthermodynamic equilibrium. the radio recombination line widths are remarkablynarrow, constraining the typical electron temperature to be less than about4000 k. these observations also find evidence of pressure broadening in thehigher electronic states, implying a gas density of n_e=910^{+310}_{-450}cm^{-3}. the electron temperature, gas pressure, and morphology are allconsistent with the idea that the gc lobe is located in the gc region. if so,the ionized gas appears to form a shell surrounding the central 100 parsecs ofthe galaxy with a mass of roughly 10^5 msun, similar to ionized outflows seenin dwarf starbursts.

0903.3416	evidence for x-ray synchrotron emission from simultaneous mid-ir to  x-ray observations of a strong sgr a* flare	this paper reports measurements of sgr a* made with naco in l' -band (3.80um), ks-band (2.12 um) and h-band (1.66 um) and with visir in n-band (11.88 um)at the eso vlt, as well as with xmm-newton at x-ray (2-10 kev) wavelengths. on4 april, 2007, a very bright flare was observed from sgr a* simultaneously atl'-band and x-ray wavelengths. no emission was detected using visir. theresulting sed has a blue slope (beta &gt; 0 for nul_nu ~ nu^beta, consistent withnul_nu ~ nu^0.4) between 12 micron and 3.8 micron.  for the first time our high quality data allow a detailed comparison ofinfrared and x-ray light curves with a resolution of a few minutes. the ir andx-ray flares are simultaneous to within 3 minutes. however the ir flare lastssignificantly longer than the x-ray flare (both before and after the x-raypeak) and prominent substructures in the 3.8 micron light curve are clearly notseen in the x-ray data. from the shortest timescale variations in the l'-bandlightcurve we find that the flaring region must be no more than 1.2 r_s insize.  the high x-ray to infrared flux ratio, blue nul_nu slope mir to l' -band, andthe soft nul_nu spectral index of the x-ray flare together place strongconstraints on possible flare emission mechanisms. we find that it isquantitatively difficult to explain this bright x-ray flare with inversecompton processes. a synchrotron emission scenario from an electrondistribution with a cooling break is a more viable scenario.

0905.2161	star formation in the central 400 pc of the milky way: evidence for a  population of massive ysos	the central kpc of the milky way might be expected to differ significantlyfrom the rest of the galaxy with regard to gas dynamics and the formation ofysos. we probe this possibility with mid-infrared observations obtained withirac and mips on spitzer and with msx. we use color-color diagrams and sed fitsto explore the nature of yso candidates (including objects with 4.5 micronexcesses possibly due to molecular emission). there is an asymmetry in thedistribution of the candidate ysos, which tend to be found at negative galacticlongitudes; this behavior contrasts with that of the molecular gas,approximately 2/3 of which is at positive longitudes. the small scale height ofthese objects suggests that they are within the galactic center region and aredynamically young. they lie between two layers of infrared dark clouds and mayhave originated from these clouds. we identify new sites for this recent starformation. the methanol masers appear to be associated with young, embeddedysos characterized by 4.5 micron excesses. we use the seds of these sources toestimate their physical characteristics. within the central 400x50 pc(|l|&lt;1.3\degr and |b|&lt;10') the star formation rate based on the identificationof stage i evolutionary phase of yso candidates is about 0.14 solar mass/yr. wesuggest that a recent burst of star formation took place within the last 10^5years. this suggestion is also consistent with estimates of star formationrates within the last ~10^7 years showing a peak around 10^5 years ago. lastly,we find that the schmidt-kennicutt law applies well in the central 400 pc ofthe galaxy. this implies that star formation does not appear to be dramaticallyaffected by the extreme physical conditions in the galactic center region.

0907.3786	simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of sgr a* during 2007 april  1-11	we report the detection of variable emission from sgr a* in almost allwavelength bands (i.e. centimeter, millimeter, submillimeter, near-ir andx-rays) during a multi-wavelength observing campaign. three new moderate flaresare detected simultaneously in both near-ir and x-ray bands. the ratio of x-rayto near-ir flux in the flares is consistent with inverse compton scattering ofnear-ir photons by submillimeter emitting relativistic particles which followscaling relations obtained from size measurements of sgr a*. we also find thatthe flare statistics in near-ir wavelengths is consistent with the probabilityof flare emission being inversely proportional to the flux. at millimeterwavelengths, the presence of flare emission at 43 ghz (7mm) using vlba withmilli-arcsecond spatial resolution indicates the first direct evidence thathourly time scale flares are localized within the inner 30$\times$70schwarzschild radii of sgr a*. we also show several cross correlation plotsbetween near-ir, millimeter and submillimeter light curves that collectivelydemonstrate the presence of time delays between the peaks of emission up tothree hours. the evidence for time delays at millimeter and submillimeterwavelengths are consistent with the source of emission being optically thickinitially followed by a transition to an optically thin regime. in particular,there is an intriguing correlation between the optically thin near-ir and x-rayflare and optically thick radio flare at 43 ghz that occurred on 2007 april 4.this would be the first evidence of a radio flare emission at 43 ghz delayedwith respect to the near-ir and x-ray flare emission.

1003.1519	the underluminous nature of sgr a*	in the last several years, a number of observing campaigns of the massiveblack hole sgr a* has been carried out in order to address two importantissues: one concerns the underluminous nature of sgr a* with its bolometricluminosity being several orders of magnitude less than those of its moremassive counterparts. it turns out that the angular momentum of the ionizedstellar winds from orbiting stars in one or two disks orbiting sgr a* could bea critical factor in estimating accurately the accretion rate unto sgr a*. anet angular momentum of ionized gas feeding sgr a* could lower the bondi rate.furthermore, the recent time delay picture of the peak flare emission can beunderstood in the context of adiabatic expansion of hot plasma. the expansionspeed of the plasma is estimated to be sub-relativistic. however, relativisticbulk motion of the plasma could lead to outflow from sgr a*. significantoutflow from sgr a* could then act as a feedback which could then reduce bondiaccretion rate. these uncertain factors can in part explain the underluminousnature of sgr a*. the other issue is related to the emission mechanism and thecause of flare activity in different wavelength bands. modeling of x-ray andnear-ir flares suggests that inverse compton scattering (ics) of ir flarephotons by the energetic electrons responsible for the submm emission canaccount for the x-ray flares. a time delay of minutes to tens of minutes ispredicted between the peak flaring in the near-ir and x-rays, not due toadiabatic expansion of optically thick hot plasma, but to the time taken for irflare photons to cross the accretion flow before being upscattered.

1004.0380	multi-wavelength study of sgr a*: the short time scale variability	to understand the correlation and the radiation mechanism of flare emissionin different wavelength bands, we have coordinated a number of telescopes toobserve sgra* simultaneously. we focus only on one aspect of the preliminaryresults of our multi-wavelength observing campaigns, namely, the short timescale variability of emission from sgra* in near-ir, x-ray and radiowavelengths. the structure function analysis indicate most of the powerspectral density is detected on hourly time scales in all wavelength bands. wealso report minute time scale variability at 7 and 13mm placing a strongconstraint on the nature of the variable emission. the hourly time scalevariability can be explained in the context of a model in which the peakfrequency of emission shifts toward lower frequencies as a self-absorbedsynchrotron source expands adiabatically near the acceleration site. the shorttime scale variability, on the other hand, places a strong constraint on thesize of the emitting region. assuming that rapid minute time scale fluctuationsof the emission is optically thick in radio wavelength, light travel argumentsrequires relativistic particle energy, thus suggesting the presence of outflowfrom sgra*.

1008.1984	the two states of sgr a* in the near-infrared: bright episodic flares on  top of low-level continuous variability	in this paper we examine properties of the variable source sgr a* in thenear-infrared (nir) using a very extensive ks-band data set from naco/vltobservations taken 2004 to 2009. we investigate the variability of sgr a* withtwo different photometric methods and analyze its flux distribution. we findsgr a* is continuously emitting and continuously variable in the near-infrared,with some variability occurring on timescales as long as weeks. the fluxdistribution can be described by a lognormal distribution at low intrinsicfluxes (&lt;~5 mjy, dereddened with a_{ks}=2.5). the lognormal distribution has amedian flux of approximately 1.1 mjy, but above 5 mjy the flux distribution issignificantly flatter (high flux events are more common) than expected for theextrapolation of the lognormal distribution to high fluxes. we make a generalidentification of the low level emission above 5 mjy as flaring emission and ofthe low level emission as the quiescent state. we also report here thebrightest ks-band flare ever observed (from august 5th, 2008) which reached anintrinsic ks-band flux of 27.5 mjy (m_{ks}=13.5). this flare was a factor 27increase over the median flux of sgr a*, close to double the brightness of thestar s2, and 40% brighter than the next brightest flare ever observed fromsgr~a*.

1008.2229	rapid intrinsic variability of sgr a* at radio wavelengths	sgr a* exhibits flares in radio, millimeter and submm wavelengths withdurations of $\sim 1$ hour. using structure function, power spectrum andautocorrelation function analysis, we investigate the variability of sgr a* ontime scales ranging from a few seconds to several hours and find evidence forsub-minute time scale variability at radio wavelengths. these measurementssuggest a strong case for continuous variability from sub-minute to hourly timescales. this short time scale variability constrains the size of the emittingregion to be less than 0.1\,au. assuming that the minute time scalefluctuations of the emission at 7\,mm arise through the expansion of regions ofoptically thick synchrotron-emitting plasma, this suggests the presence ofexplosive, energetic expansion events at speeds close to $c$. the required rateof mass processing and energy loss of this component are estimated to be $\ga6\times 10^{-10} \msol$ yr$^{-1}$ and 400\,$l_\odot$ respectively. the inferredscale length corresponding to one-minute light travel time is comparable to thetime averaged spatially resolved 0.1au scale observed at 1.3mm emission of sgra*. this steady component from sgr a* is interpreted mainly as an ensembleaverage of numerous weak and overlapping flares that are detected on short timescales. the nature of such short time scale variable emission or quiescentvariability is not understood but could result from fluctuations in theaccretion flow of sgr a* that feed the base of an outflow or jet.

0708.3492	the variability of polarized radiation from sgr a*	sgr a* is variable at radio and submillimeter wavelengths on hourly timescales showing time delays between the peaks of flare emission as well aslinearly polarized emission at millimeter and sub-mm wavelengths. to determinethe polarization characteristics of this variable source at radio frequencies,we present vla observations of sgr a* and report the detection of polarizedemission at a level of 0.77\pm0.01% and 0.2\pm0.01% at 43 and 22 ghz,respectively. the change in the time averaged polarization angle between 22 and43 ghz corresponds to a rm of -2.5\pm0.6 x10^3 rad m{-2} with no phase wrapping(or \sim 5x10^4 rad m^2 with 2\pi phase wrap). we also note a rise and falltime scale of 1.5 -- 2 hours in the total polarized intensity. the light curvesof the degree of linearly polarized emission suggests a a correlation with thevariability of the total intensity at 43 ghz. the available polarization dataat radio and sub-mm wavelengths suggest that the rotation measure decreaseswith decreasing frequency. this frequency dependence, and observed changes inpolarization angle during flare events, may be caused by the reduction inrotation measure associated with the expansion of synchrotron-emitting blobs.

1010.1308	occultation of the quiescent emission from sgr a* by ir flares	we have investigated the nature of flare emission from sgr a* duringmulti-wavelength observations of this source that took place in 2004, 2005 and2006. we present evidence for dimming of submm and radio flux during the peakof near-ir flares. this suggests that the variability of sgr a* across itswavelength spectrum is phenomenologically related. the model explaining thisnew behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically coolingplasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the backgroundquiescent emission from sgr a*. when a flare is launched, the plasma blob ismost compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emissionin radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. absorption in the observedlight curve of sgr a* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects oflower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescentbrightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs. this implies thatplasma blobs are mainly placed in the magnetosphere of a disk-like flow orfurther out in the flow. the depth of the absorption being larger in submm thanin radio wavelengths implies that the intrinsic size of the quiescent emissionincreases with increasing wavelength which is consistent with previous sizemeasurements of sgr a*. lastly, we believe that occultation of the quiescentemission of sgr a* at radio/submm by ir flares can be used as a powerful toolto identify flare activity at its earliest phase of its evolution.

1112.3279	the origin of parsec-scale gaseous and stellar disks in the galactic  center and agns	the galactic center stellar disk and the circumnuclear ring provide a uniqueopportunity to study in detail the dynamics and physical conditions of distantmolecular disks in the nuclei of galaxies. one of the key questions is howthese disks form so close to their host black holes and under what conditionthey form stars in a tidally stressed environment. we argue that disk formationaround a massive black hole is due to partial accretion of extended molecularclouds that temporarily pass through the central region of the galaxy. thecancellation of angular momentum of the gravitationally focused gas naturallycreates a compact gaseous disk. the disk can potentially become gravitationallyunstable and form stars. we apply these ideas to explain the origin ofsub-parsec megamaser disks found in the nuclei of seyfert 2 galaxies. we showthat an empirical scaling relation between the mass of the black hole and thesize of the disk can be understood in the context of the cloud capturescenario. we conclude that the stellar and gas disks found in our galacticcenter act as a bridge to further our understanding of more distant mega-maserdisks in the nuclei of seyfert 2 galaxies.

0712.1245	massive star formation near sgr a* and bimodal star formation in the  nuclear disk	the history of star formation in the strong gravitational potential of thegalactic center has been of much interest, recently. we propose that thesub-parsec-scale disk of massive stars orbiting the massive black hole at thegalactic center can be interpreted in terms of partial accretion of extendedgalactic center clouds, such as the 50 \kms molecular cloud, as these cloudsenvelop sgr a* on their passage through the inner galactic center. the loss ofangular momentum of the captured cloud material by self-interaction subsequentto gravitationally focusing by sgr a* naturally creates a compact gaseous diskof material close to sgr a* in which star formation takes place. on a largerscale the formation of massive clusters such as the arches and quintupletclusters or on-going massive star formation such as sgr b2 could also betriggered by cloud-cloud collisions due to gravitational focusing in the deeppotential of the central bulge.  unlike the violent and high-pressure environment of clustered star formationtriggered by cloud-cloud collision, there are also isolated pockets of starformation and quiescent dense clouds. these sites suggest an inefficient, slowmode of star formation. we propose enhanced cosmic rays in the nuclear disk maybe responsible for inhibiting the process of star formation in this region. inparticular, we argue that the enhanced ionization rate due to the impact ofcosmic-ray particles is responsible for lowering the efficiency of on-goingstar formation in the nuclear disk of our galaxy. the higher ionizationfraction and higher thermal energy due to the impact of these electrons mayalso reduce mhd wave damping which contributes to the persistence of the highvelocity dispersion of the molecular gas in the nuclear disk.

0712.2882	simultaneous chandra, cso and vla observations of sgr a*: the nature of  flaring activity	sgr a*, the massive black hole at the center of the galaxy, varies in radiothrough x-ray emission on hourly time scales. the flare activity is thought toarise from the innermost region of an accretion flow onto sgr a*. we presentsimultaneous light curves of sgr a* in radio, sub-mm and x-rays that show apossible time delay of 110$\pm17$ minutes between x-ray and 850 $\mu$msuggesting that the sub-mm flare emission is optically thick. at radiowavelengths, we detect time lags of of $20.4\pm6.8, 30\pm12$ and 20$\pm6$minutes between the flare peaks observed at 13 and 7 mm (22 and 43 ghz) inthree different epochs using the vla. linear polarization of 1$\pm0.2$% and0.7$\pm0.1$% is detected at 7 and 13 mm, respectively, when averaged over theentire observation on 2006 july 17. a simple model of a bubble of synchrotronemitting electrons cooling via adiabatic expansion can explain the time delaybetween various wavelengths, the asymmetric shape of the light curves, and theobserved polarization of the flare emission at 43 and 22 ghz. the derivedphysical quantities that characterize the emission give an expansion speed ofv$_{exp} \sim 0.003-0.1$c, magnetic field of b$\sim$10-70 gauss and particlespectral index p$\sim$1-2. these parameters suggest that the associated plasmacannot escape from sgr a* unless it has a large bulk motion.

1305.1047	74 mhz nonthermal emission from molecular clouds: evidence for a cosmic  ray dominated region at the galactic center	we present 74 mhz radio continuum observations of the galactic center region.these measurements show nonthermal radio emission arising from molecular cloudsthat is unaffected by free-free absorption along the line of sight. we focus onone cloud, g0.13--0.13, representative of the population of molecular cloudsthat are spatially correlated with steep spectrum(alpha^{74mhz}_{327mhz}=1.3\pm0.3) nonthermal emission from the galactic centerregion. this cloud lies adjacent to the nonthermal radio filaments of the arcnear l~0.2^0 and is a strong source of 74 mhz continuum, sio (2-1) and feikalpha 6.4 kev line emission. this three-way correlation provides the mostcompelling evidence yet that relativistic electrons, here traced by 74 mhzemission, are physically associated with the g0.13--0.13 molecular cloud andthat low energy cosmic ray electrons are responsible for the fei kalpha lineemission. the high cosmic ray ionization rate ~10-13 s-1 h-1 is responsible forheating the molecular gas to high temperatures and allows the disturbed gas tomaintain a high velocity dispersion. lvg modeling of multi-transition sioobservations of this cloud implies h2 densities ~104-5 cm-3 and hightemperatures. the lower limit to the temperature of g0.13-0.13 is ~100k,whereas the upper limit is as high as 1000k. lastly, we used a time-dependentchemical model in which cosmic rays drive the chemistry of the gas toinvestigate for molecular line diagnostics of cosmic ray heating. when thecloud reaches chemical equilibrium, the abundance ratios of hcn/hnc andn2h+/hco+ are consistent with measured values. in addition, significantabundance of sio is predicted in the cosmic ray dominated region of thegalactic center. we discuss different possibilities to account for the originof widespread sio emission detected from galactic center molecular clouds.

0804.4491	the mid-infrared colors of the ism and extended sources at the galactic  center	a mid-infrared (3.6-8 um) survey of the galactic center has been carried outwith the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. this survey covers thecentral 2x1.4 degree (~280x200 pc) of the galaxy. at 3.6 and 4.5 um theemission is dominated by stellar sources, the fainter ones merging into anunresolved background. at 5.8 and 8 um the stellar sources are fainter, andlarge-scale diffuse emission from the ism of the galaxy's central molecularzone becomes prominent. the survey reveals that the 8 to 5.8 um color of theism emission is highly uniform across the surveyed region. this uniform coloris consistent with a flat extinction law and emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs). models indicate that this broadband color should not beexpected to change if the incident radiation field heating the dust and pahs is&lt;10^4 times that of the solar neighborhood. the few regions with unusually redemission are areas where the pahs are underabundant and the radiation field islocally strong enough to heat large dust grains to produce significant 8 umemission. these red regions include compact h ii regions, sgr b1, and widerregions around the arches and quintuplet clusters. in these regions theradiation field is &gt;10^4 times that of the solar neighborhood. other regions ofvery red emission indicate cases where thick dust clouds obscure deeplyembedded objects or very early stages of star formation.

astro-ph;0106190	high spectral and spatial resolution observations of shocked molecular  hydrogen at the galactic center	the presence of oh (1720 mhz) masers, and the absence of counterparts at1665/1667 mhz has proved to be a clear diagnostic of shocked molecular gasassociated with galactic supernova remnants. this suggests that shockedmolecular gas should be associated with the oh (1720 mhz) masers that have beendetected in the circumnuclear disk (cnd) and sgr a east at the galactic center.in order to test this hypothesis, we observed the h$_2$ 1--0 s(1) and br$\gamma$ lines using nicmos on the hst and unswirf on the aat, near the regionswhere oh (1720 mhz) masers are detected in the cnd and sgr a east. we presentthe distribution of h$_2$ in the north and south lobes of the cnd and in sgr aeast. h$_2$ emission accompanies almost all of the maser spots detected at thegalactic center. in particular, we find a striking filamentary structure nearthe northwest of the cnd and evidence that shocked molecular gas is associatedwith the 70 \kms molecular cloud at the galactic center. we argue that theemission from the cnd could arise in gas heated by the dissipation of therandom motion of clumps by collisions or the dissipation of turbulence in amore homogeneous medium. in addition, highly red-shifted gas of up to 140 \kms\close to the eastern edge of the sgr a east shell is detected. theseobservations combined with oh (1720 mhz) results suggest that the h$_2$ gas isshocked and accelerated by the expansion of sgr a east into the 50 and the 70\kms cloud and into the lobes of the cnd.

astro-ph;0202442	the origin of x-ray emission from a galactic center molecular cloud: low  energy cosmic ray electrons	the galactic center region near l$\approx0.2^0$ hosts a mixture of nonthermallinear filaments and thermal radio continuum features associated with the radioarc. chandra observations of this region reveal an x-ray filament and diffuseemission with an extent of roughly 60$''\times2''$ and 5$'\times3'$,respectively. the x-ray filament lies at the edge of the nonthermal radiofilaments and a dense molecular shell g0.13-0.13 that has an unusually highkinetic temperature $\ge$70k. these observations demonstrate that theg0.13--0.13 molecular cloud and the nonthermal radio filaments of the arc areinteracting. the diffuse x-ray emission is correlated with the molecular shelland is fitted either by two-temperature (1 and 10 kev) thermal emission or bypower-law and 1 kev thermal gas. fluorescent 6.4 kev line emission is alsodetected throughout the molecular shell. this cloud coincides within the errorcircle of a steady unidentified egret source 3egj1746--2851. we argue thatlow-energy cosmic ray electrons (lecre) produce the power-law continuum bybremsstrahlung and 6.4 kev line emission from the filament and the diffusecloud with the implication on the origin of the galactic ridge x-ray emission.the strong 6.4 kev fe-line emission seen from other galactic center cloudscould be produced in a similar fashion rather than via fluorescent emissioninduced by a transient hard x-ray source in the galactic center. in addition,heating by ionization induced by lecre are also responsible for the hightemperature of g0.13-0.13. the gamma-ray source is a result of brehmsstrahlungby the high-energy tail of the electron energy distribution.

astro-ph;0209485	thermal oh (1667/65 mhz) absorption and nonthermal oh (1720 mhz)  emission towards the w28 supernova remnant	the w28 supernova remnant is an excellent prototype for observing shocked gasresulting from the interaction of supernova remnants (snrs) and adjacentmolecular clouds (mcs). we present two new signatures of shocked molecular gasin this remnant. one is the detection of main-line extended oh (1667 mhz)absorption with broad linewidths. the column density of oh estimated from theoptical depth profiles is consistent with a theoretical model in which  oh is formed behind a c-type shock front. the second is the detection ofextended, weak oh (1720 mhz) line emission with narrow linewidth distributedthroughout the shocked region of w28. these give observational support to theidea that compact maser sources delineate the brightest component of a muchlarger region of main line oh absorption and nonthermal oh (1720 mhz) emissiontracing the global structure of shocked molecular gas. main line oh (1665/67)absorption and extended oh (1720 mhz) emission line studies can serve aspowerful tools to detect snr-mc interaction even when bright oh (1720 mhz)masers are absent.

astro-ph;0608710	the origin of diffuse x-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission from the galactic  center region: cosmic ray particles	(abridged) the inner couple hundred pcs of our galaxy is characterized bysignificant amount of synchrotron-emitting gas, which appears to co-exist witha large reservoir of molecular gas. the spatial correlation between fluorescentfe k-alpha line emission at 6.4 kev and molecular line emission from galacticcenter molecular clouds has been explained as reflected x-rays from a pastoutburst of sgr a*. here we present multi-wavelength study of a representativegalactic center cloud sgr c using chandra, vla and fcrao. we note a correlationbetween the nonthermal radio filaments in sgr c and the x-ray features,suggesting that the two are related. we account for this distribution in termsof the impact of the relativistic particles from local (nonthermal filaments)and extended sources with diffuse neutral gas producing both a nonthermalbremsstrahlung x-ray continuum emission, as well as diffuse 6.4 kev lineemission. the production rate of fe kalpha photons associated with theinjection of electrons into a cloud as a function of column density iscalculated. the required energy density of low-energy cosmic rays associatedwith the synchrotron emitting radio filaments or extended features is estimatedto be in the range between 20 and $\sim10^3$ ev cm^-3 for sgr c, sgr b1, sgrb2, and ``the 45 and -30 \kms'' clouds. we also generalize this idea to explainthe pervasive production of diffuse kalpha line and tev emission from thegalactic center molecular clouds. in particular, we suggest that ic scatteringof the sub-millimeter radiation from dust by relativistic electrons maycontribute substantially to the large-scale diffuse tev emission observedtowards the central regions of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0612156	flaring activity of sgr a*: expanding hot blobs	sgr a* is considered to be a massive black hole at the galactic center and isknown to be variable in radio, millimeter, near-ir and x-rays. recentmulti-wavelength observing campaigns show a simultaneous x-ray and near-irflare, as well as sub-millimeter and near-ir flares from sgr a*. the flareactivity is thought to be arising from the innermost region of sgr a*. we haverecently argued that the duration of flares in near-ir and submillimeterwavelengths implies that the burst of emission expands and cools on a dynamicaltime scale before the flares leave sgr a*. the detection of radio flares with atime delay in the range of 20 and 40 minutes between 7 and 12mm peak emissionimplies adiabatic expansion of a uniform, spherical hot blob due to flareactivity. we suspect that this simple outflow picture shows some of thecharacteristics that are known to take place in microquasars, thus we may learnmuch from comparative study of sgr a* and its environment vs. microquasars.

astro-ph;9708243	the origin of the high-energy activity at the galactic center	recent x-ray and gamma-ray observations of the galactic center region by theasca and cgro/egret instruments show evidence of 2--10 kev and $&gt;1$ gevcontinuum emission as well as 6.7 and 6.4 kev line emission from the inner$0.2^\circ$ of the galactic center. this region is also known to host a brightnonthermal radio continuum source sgr a east and a dense molecular cloudm--0.02--0.07 known as the 50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. the oval-shaped nonthermal sgra east is physically interacting with m--0.02--0.07 at the galactic center. acomparison between the distribution of ionized, synchrotron and neutral gassuggests a self-consistent interpretation of the high-energy activity at thegalactic center. our preliminary analysis of the data suggest a shock model ofcosmic ray acceleration at the site of the interaction to explain the enhancedgev $\gamma$-ray emission. we also address a number of issues related to thespatial correlation of the diffuse radio and x-ray emitting gas as well as tothe origin of the fluorescent 6.4 and 6.7 kev emission at the galactic center.

astro-ph;9710046	anomalous motion of ionized gas in the sickle (g0.18--0.04) near the  galactic center	we present vla measurements of h92alpha radio recombination line emissionfrom an unusual hii region g0.18--0.04, the ``sickle'', with spatial andspectral resolutions of 27" times 24".9 and 14 km/s, respectively. theseobservations detected two new kinematic components of ionized gas whosevelocities differ greatly from the +25 km/s molecular cloud surrounding thesickle. one component is highly red-shifted with peak velocity of about +150km/s and the other is a blue-shifted velocity feature peaking near -35 km/s.neither of these high-velocity features have molecular counterparts. theblue-shifted feature is forbidden in the sense of galactic rotation andcoincides with the prominent nonthermal filaments crossing the sickle, thussuggesting that they are physically associated with each other. the resultspresented here are interpreted in terms of ionized gas being accelerated awayfrom the surface of the cloud associated with the sickle region, either by themagnetic field associated with the nonthermal filaments or by the stellar windsfrom the hot helium stars near g0.18--0.04.

astro-ph;9803231	proper motions of ionized gas at the galactic center: evidence for  unbound orbiting gas	we present radio continuum observations of the spiral-shaped ionized feature(sgr a west) within the inner pc of the galactic center at three epochsspanning 1986 to 1995. the vla a-configuration was used at $\lambda$2cm(resolution of 0\dasec1$\times$0\dasec2). we detect proper motions of a numberof features in the northern and eastern arms of sgr a west including theionized gas associated with irs 13 with v(ra)= 113 \pm 10, v(dec)=150 \pm15km/s, irs 2 with v(ra)= 122 \pm 11, v(dec)=24 \pm 34 km/s and the norther armv(ra)= 126 \pm 30, v(dec)=--207 \pm 58 km/s. we also report the detection offeatures having transverse velocities &gt; 1000 km/s including a head-tail radiostructure, the ``bullet'', $\approx4''$ northwest of sgr a$^*$ with v(ra)= 722\pm 156, v(dec)=832 \pm 203 km/s, exceeding the escape velocity at the galacticcenter.  the proper motion measurements when combined with previous h92$\alpha$ radiorecombination line data suggest an unambiguous direction of the flow of ionizedgas orbiting the galactic center. the measured velocity distribution suggeststhat the ionized gas in the northern arm is not bound to the galactic centerassuming a 2.5 million solar mass of dark matter residing at the galacticcenter. this implies that the stellar and ionized gas systems are notdynamically coupled, thus, supporting a picture in which the gas features inthe northern arm and its extensions are the result of an energetic phenomenonthat has externally driven a cloud of gas cloud into the galactic center.

astro-ph;9809279	high-resolution observations of oh(1720 mhz) masers toward the galactic  center	high-resolution vla observations of 1720 mhz oh maser emission from sgr aeast and the circumnuclear disk with spatial and spectral resolutions of$\approx$ 2\dasec5 $\times$ 1\dasec3 and 0.27 \kms are reported. this follow-upobservational study focuses on the recent discovery of a number of such ohmaser features and their intense circularly polarized maser lines detectedtoward these galactic center sources. the 1720 mhz maser line of oh arises fromcollisionally excited gas behind a c-type shock and is an important diagnosticof the interaction process that may occur between molecular clouds andassociated x-ray emitting shell-type supernova remnants. the presentobservations have confirmed that the observed stokes $v$ signal is due tozeeman splitting and that the oh masers are angularly broadened by thescattering medium toward the galactic center. the scale length of the magneticfield fluctuations in the scattering medium toward the galactic center isestimated to be greater than 0.1-0.2 pc using the correlation of the positionangles of the scatter-broadened maser spots. in addition, the kinematics of themaser spots associated with sgr a east are used to place a 5 pc displacementbetween this extended radio structure and the galactic center.

astro-ph;9809384	a self-consistent model for the broad-band spectrum of sgr a east at the  galactic center	sgr a east is a very prominent elongated shell structure surrounding (thoughoff-centered from) the galactic nucleus. its energetics (~4x10^52 ergs), basedon the power required to carve out the radio synchrotron remnant within thesurrounding dense molecular cloud, appear to be extreme compared to the totalenergy (~10^51 ergs) released in a typical supernova (sn) explosion. yet itshares several characteristics in common with sn remnants (snrs), the mostsignificant of which is the ~0.1-10 gev gamma-ray spectrum measured by egret,if we associate the galactic center source 2egj1746-2852 with this nonthermalshell. we here show that the highest-energy component in sgr a east's spectrum,like that of snrs, can be fitted with the gamma-rays produced in neutral piondecays. further, we demonstrate in a self-consistent manner that the leptonsreleased in the associated charged pion decays produce an e+e- distributionthat can mimic a power-law with index ~3, like that inferred from the vla datafor this source. these relativistic electrons and positrons also radiate bybremsstrahlung, and inverse compton scattering with the intense ir and uvfields from the nucleus. we show that the overall emissivity calculated in thisway may account for sgr a east's broadband spectrum ranging from ghzfrequencies all the way to tev energies, where whipple has thus far set anupper limit to the flux corresponding to a 2.5-sigma signal above the noise.

astro-ph;9907370	three new supernova remnant oh masers near the galactic center: evidence  for large scale maser emission from supernova remnants	a survey of the inner 8$^\circ \times 1^\circ$ of the galactic plane towardthe galactic center has been carried out at the 1720 mhz transition of ohmolecule using the vla in its d configuration with a resolution of$\approx70''\times45''$. the detection of compact 1720 mhz oh masers associatedwith three supernova remnants g357.7+0.3, g1.13--0.1 (sgr d) and g1.4--0.1 aswell as new extended maser line emission from g357.7+0.3 and g357.7--0.1 (thetornado nebula) were then followed up by a-array observations with spectral andspatial resolutions of 0.3 \kms and $\approx3''\times2''$, respectively.  the 1720 mhz oh maser line emission is considered to be a powerful shockdiagnostic and is collisionally pumped by h$_2$ molecules at the site wherec-type supernova shocks drive into adjacent molecular clouds. the newobservations show clear evidence of extended features coincident with compactand bright masers, the best example of which is a coherent feature over a scaleof about 20 pc surrounding the shell of the snr g357.7+0.3. we argue that thisremarkable feature is an oh maser and is physically associated with theremnant. this implies that the ambient molecular cloud is uniform in itsdensity and temperature with restricted range of pumping conditions andsurvives the passage of a large-scale shock front.
