0902.0483	beryllium abundances and star formation in the halo and in the thick  disk	[abridged] beryllium is a pure product of cosmic ray spallation. this impliesa relatively simple evolution in time of the beryllium abundance and suggestsits use as a time-like observable. we study the evolution of be in the earlygalaxy and its dependence on kinematic and orbital parameters. we investigatethe formation of the halo and the thick disk of the galaxy and the use of be asa cosmochronometer. beryllium abundances are determined from high resolution,high signal to noise uves spectra with spectrum synthesis in the largest sampleof halo and thick disk stars analyzed to date. we present our observationalresults in various diagrams. 1) in a log(be/h) vs [fe/h] diagram we find amarginal statistical detection of a real scatter, above what expected frommeasurement errors, with a larger scatter among halo stars. the detection ofthe scatter is further supported by the existence of pairs of stars withidentical atmospheric parameters and different be abundances. 2) in anlog(be/h) vs [alpha/fe] diagram, the halo stars separate into two components;one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary models, while the other hastoo high alpha and be abundances and is chemically indistinguishable from thickdisk stars. this suggests that the halo is not a single uniform populationwhere a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. 3) in diagrams of rminvs [alpha/fe] and log(be/h) the thick disk stars show a possible decrease of[alpha/fe] with rmin, whereas no dependence of be with rmin is seen. thisanticorrelation suggests that the star formation rate was lower in the outerregions of the thick disc, pointing towards an inside-out formation. the lackof correlation for be indicates that it is insensitive to the local conditionsof star formation.

0903.3924	the helium content of globular clusters: light element abundance  correlations and hb morphology. i. ngc6752	helium has been proposed as the key element to interpret the observedmultiple main sequences (ms), subgiant branches (sgb) and red giant branches(rgb), as well as the complex horizontal branch (hb) morphology in globularclusters (gc). however, up to now, he was never directly measured in suitablegc stars (8500&lt;teff&lt;11500 k) with the purpose of verify this hypothesis. westudied 7 hot blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars (teff&lt;11500 k) in the gc ngc6752 with the purpose to measure their helium content. in additionfe,cr,si,ti,o,na, and ba abundances were measured. we could measure heabundance only for stars warmer than teff=8500 k. all our targets withmeasurable he are zero age hb (zahb) objects and turned out to have ahomogeneous he content with a mean value of y=0.245+-0.012, compatible with themost recent measurements of the primordial he content of the universe (y~0.25).the whole sample of stars have a metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.56+-0.03 and[alpha/fe]=+0.21+-0.03. our hb targets show the same na-o anticorrelationidentified among the to-sgb-rgb stars. this is the first direct measurement ofthe he abundance for a significative sample of gc stars in a temperature regimewhere the he content is not altered by sedimentation processing or extrememixing as suggested for the hottest, late helium flasher hb stars.

0909.2938	na-o anticorrelation and hb. vii. the chemical composition of first and  second-generation stars in 15 globular clusters from giraffe spectra	we present abundances of fe, na, and o for 1409 red giant stars in 15galactic globular clusters, derived from the homogeneous analysis of highresolution flames/giraffe spectra. combining the present data with previousresults, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largestand most homogeneous database of this kind to date. our gcs have [fe/h] from-2.4 to -0.4, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of thehorizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc). for all clusters we find the na-oanticorrelation, the classical signature of proton-capture reactions inh-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,now extinct. using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension ofthe na-o anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar populationin gcs: a primordial component (p) of first-generation stars, and 2 componentsof second-generation stars (intermediate i and extreme e populations from theirdifferent chemical composition). the p component is present in all gcs, and itsfraction is almost constant at about one third. the i component represents thebulk of the cluster population. the e component is not present in all gcs, andit is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. wediscuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in oursample and in two additional clusters (m3 and m13) from the literature. we alsofind that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum o andmaximum na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that isrepresented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity.this second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of pollutersand cluster mass.

0704.1668	a new search for planet transits in ngc 6791	context. searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study theeffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.  aims. considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster ngc 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique.  methods. a ten-night observational campaign was performed using thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (3.6m), the san pedro m\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the loiano telescope (1.5m). to increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  results. should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in ngc 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by bruntt et al. (2003). theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  conclusions. possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. more extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in ngc 6791.

1006.5866	detailed abundances of a large sample of giant stars in m 54 and in the  sagittarius nucleus	homogeneous abundances of light elements, alpha and fe-group elements fromhigh-resolution flames spectra are presented for 76 red giant stars in m54, amassive globular cluster (gc) lying in the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy. we also derived detailed abundances for 27 red giants belonging to thesgr nucleus. our abundances assess the intrinsic metallicity dispersion (~0.19dex, rms scatter) of m54, with the bulk of stars peaking at [fe/h]~-1.6 and along tail extending to higher metallicities, similar to omega cen. the spreadin these probable nuclear star clusters exceeds those of most gcs: thesemassive clusters are located in a region intermediate between normal gcs anddwarf galaxies. m54 shows the na-o anticorrelation, typical signature of gcs,which is instead absent in the sgr nucleus. the light elements (mg, al, si)participating to the high temperature mg-al cycle show that the pattern of(anti)correlations produced by proton-capture reactions in h-burning is clearlydifferent between the most metal-rich and most metal-poor components in the twomost massive gcs in the galaxy, confirming early result based on the na-oanticorrelation. as in omega cen, stars affected by most extreme processing,i.e. showing the signature of more massive polluters, are those of themetal-rich component. this can be understood if the burst of star formationgiving birth to the metal-rich component was delayed by as much as 10-30 myrwith respect to the metal-poor one. the evolution of these massive gcs can bereconciled in the general scenario for the formation of gcs sketched incarretta et al.(2010a) taking into account that omega cen could have alreadyincorporated the surrounding nucleus of its progenitor and lost the rest of thehosting galaxy while the two are still observable as distinct components in m54and the surrounding field.

1007.5299	x-shooter observations of main sequence stars in the globular cluster  ngc 2808: first chemical tagging of a he-normal and a he-rich dwarf	we present the first chemical composition study of two unevolved stars in theglobular cluster ngc 2808, obtained with the spectrograph x-shooter@vlt. ngc2808 shows three discrete, well separated main sequences. the most acceptedexplanation for this phenomenon is that their stars have different heliumcontents. we observed one star on the bluest main sequence, (bms, claimed tohave high helium content, y~0.4), and one on the reddest main sequence (rms,consistent with a canonical helium content, y=0.245). we analyzed features ofnh, ch, na, mg, al, and fe. while fe, ca, and other elements have the sameabundances in the two stars, the bms star shows a huge enhancement of n, adepletion of c, an enhancement of na and al, and small depletion of mg withrespect to the rms star. this is exactly what is expected if stars on the bmsformed from the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar generation in thecomplete cno and mgal cycles whose main product is helium. the elementalabundance pattern differences in these two stars are consistent with thedifferences in helium content suggested by the color-magnitude diagrampositions of the stars.

1007.5301	abundances for a large sample of red giants in ngc 1851: hints for a  merger of two clusters?	we present the abundance analysis of a sample of more than 120 red giants inthe globular cluster (gc) ngc 1851, based on flames spectra. we find a smallbut detectable metallicity spread. this spread is compatible with the presenceof two different groups of stars with a metallicity difference of 0.06-0.08dex, in agreement with earlier photometric studies. if stars are divided intothese two groups according to their metallicity, both components show a na-oanticorrelation (signature of a genuine gc nature) of moderate extension. themetal-poor stars are more concentrated than the metal-rich ones. we tentativelypropose the hypothesis that ngc 1851 formed from a merger of two individual gcswith a slightly different fe and alpha-element content, and possibly an agedifference up to 1 gyr. this is supported also by number ratios of stars on thesplit subgiant and on the bimodal horizontal branches. the distribution ofn-capture process elements in the two components also supports the idea thatthe enrichment must have occurred in each of the structures separately, and notas a continuum of events in a single gc. the most probable explanation is thatthe proto-clusters formed into a (now dissolved) dwarf galaxy and later mergedto produce the present gc.

1010.3879	lithium abundance in the globular cluster m4: from the turn-off to the  rgb bump	we present li and fe abundances for 87 stars in the gc m4,obtained withgiraffe high-resolution spectra. the targets range from the to up to the rgbbump. the li abundance in the to stars is uniform, with an average valuea(li)=2.30+-0.02 dex,consistent with the upper envelope of li content measuredin other gcs and in the halo stars,confirming also for m4 the discrepancy withthe primordial li abundance predicted by wmap+bbns. the iron content of m4 is[fe/h]=-1.10+-0.01 dex, with no systematic offsets between dwarf and giantstars.the behaviour of the li and fe abundance along the entire evolutionarypath is incompatible with models with atomic diffusion, pointing out that anadditional turbulent mixing below the convective region needs to be taken intoaccount,able to inhibit the atomic diffusion.the measured a(li) and itshomogeneity in the to stars allow to put strong constraints on the shape of theli profile inside the m4 to stars. the global behaviour of a(li) with t_{eff}can be reproduced with different pristine li abundances, depending on the kindof adopted turbulent mixing.one cannot reproduce the global trend starting fromthe wmap+bbns a(li) and adopting the turbulent mixing described by richard etal.(2005) with the same efficiency used by korn et al.(2006) to explain the licontent in ngc6397. such a solution is not able to well reproducesimultaneously the li abundance observed in to and rgb stars.otherwise,thewmap+bbns a(li) can be reproduced assuming a more efficient turbulent mixingable to reach deeper stellar regions where the li is burned. the cosmologicalli discrepancy cannot be easily solved with the present,poor understanding ofthe turbulence in the stellar interiors and a future effort to well understandthe true nature of this non-canonical process is needed.

1010.5913	the connection between missing agb stars and extended horizontal  branches	recent surveys confirm early results about a deficiency or even absence ofcn-strong stars on the asymptotic giant branch (agb) of globular clusters(gcs), although with quite large cluster-to-cluster variations. in general,this is at odds with the distribution of cn band strengths among first ascentred giant branch (rgb) stars. norris et al. proposed that the lack of cn-strongstars in some clusters is a consequence of a smaller mass of these stars thatcannot evolve through the full agb phase. in this short paper we found that therelative frequency of agb stars can change by a factor of two between differentclusters. we also find a very good correlation between the minimum mass ofstars along the horizontal branch (gratton et al. 2010) and the relativefrequency of agb stars, with a further dependence on metallicity. we concludethat indeed the stars with the smallest mass on the hb cannot evolve throughthe full agb phase, being agb-manque'. these stars likely had large he and ncontent, and large o-depletion. we then argue that there should not be agbstars with extreme o depletion, and few of them with a moderate one.

1111.2688	na-o anticorrelation and hb. ix. kinematics of the program clusters. a  link between systemic rotation and hb morphology?	we use accurate radial velocities for 1981 member stars in 20 galacticglobular clusters, collected within our large survey aimed at the analysis ofthe na-o anti-correlation, to study the internal kinematics of the clusters. weperformed the first systematic exploration of the possible connections betweencluster kinematics and the multiple populations phenomenon in gcs. we did notfind any significant correlation between na abundance and either velocitydispersion or systemic rotation. we searched for systemic rotation in the eightclusters of our sample that lack such analysis from previous works in theliterature (ngc2808, ngc5904, ngc6171, ngc6254, ngc6397, ngc6388, ngc6441, andngc6838). these clusters are found to span a large range of rotationalamplitudes, from ~0.0 km/s (ngc6397) to ~13.0 km/s (ngc6441). we found asignificant correlation between the ratio of rotational velocity to centralvelocity dispersion (v_{rot}/sigma_0) and the horizontal branch morphologyparameter (b-r)/(b+r+v). v_{rot}/sigma_0 is found to correlate also withmetallicity, possibly hinting to a significant role of dissipation in theprocess of formation of globular clusters. v_{rot} is found to correlate wellwith (b-r)/(b+r+v), m_v, sigma_0 and [fe/h]. all these correlations stronglysuggest that systemic rotation may be intimately linked with the processes thatled to the formation of globular clusters and the stellar populations theyhost.

1201.1772	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. ii. ngc1851	we studied the na-o anti-correlation from moderately high resolution spectrafor 35 stars on the blue hb (bhb), one rr lyrae, and 55 stars are on the red hb(rhb) of ngc1851. we also derived abundances for he and n in bhb stars, and baand upper limits for n in rhb stars. the rhb stars clearly separate into twogroups: the vast majority are o-rich and na-poor, while about 10-15% arena-rich and moderately o-poor. most na-rich rhb stars are also ba-rich andthere is an overall correlation between na and ba abundances within the rhb.the group of ba-rich rhb stars resides on the warmer edge and includes ~10% ofthe rhb stars. we propose that they are the descendant of the stars on the rgbsequence with very red v-y colour. this sequence is known also to consist of baand perhaps cno-rich stars. however, the upper limit we obtain for n([n/fe]&lt;1.55) for one of the ba-rich stars coupled with the low c-abundancesfor rgb ba-rich stars from the literature suggests that the total cno might notbe particularly high ([(c+n+o)/fe]&lt;=0.15). the other na-rich rhb stars are alsoat the warm edge of the rhb and the only rr lyrae is na-rich and moderatelyo-poor. we also find a na-o anticorrelation among bhb stars, partiallyoverlapping that found among rhb stars, though generally bhb stars are morena-rich and o-poor. however, there is no clear correlation between temperatureand na and o abundances within the bhb. the average he abundance in bhb starsis y=0.29+/-0.05. n abundances are quite uniform at [n/fe]=1.16+/-0.14 amongbhb stars, with a small trend with temperature. this value is consistent withnormal cno abundance and excludes that bhb stars are very cno-rich: this leavesan age spread of ~1.5 gyr as the only viable explanation for the split of thesgb.

1205.5719	spectroscopic analysis of the two subgiant branches of the globular  cluster ngc1851	ngc1851 possibly shows a spread in [fe/h], but the relation between thisspread and the division in the sgb is unknown. we obtained blue (3950-4600 a)intermediate resolution (r~8,000) spectra for 47 stars on the bright and 30 onthe faint sgb of ngc 1851 (b-sgb and f-sgb, respectively). the determination ofthe atmospheric parameters to extremely high internal accuracy leads to smallerrors when comparing different stars in the cluster. we found that the b-sgbis slightly more metal-poor than the f-sgb, with [fe/h]=-1.227+/-0.009 and[fe/h]=-1.162+/- 0.012, respectively. this implies that the f-sgb is onlyslightly older by ~0.6 gyr than the b-sgb if the total cno abundance isconstant. there are more c-normal stars in the b-sgb than in the f-sgb. this isconsistent with what is found for hb stars, if b-sgb are the progenitors of redhb stars, and f-sgb those of blue hb ones. the abundances of the n-captureelements sr and ba have a bimodal distribution, reflecting the separationbetween f-sgb (sr and ba-rich) and b-sgb stars (sr and ba-poor). in bothgroups, there is a clear correlation between [sr/fe] and [ba/fe], suggestingthat there is a real spread in the abundances of n-capture elements. there issome correlation between c and ba abundances, while the same correlation for sris much more dubious. we identified six c-rich stars, which have a moderateoverabundance of sr and ba and rather low n abundances. this group of starsmight be the progenitors of these on the anomalous rgb in the (v, v-y) diagram.these results are discussed within different scenarios for the formation ofngc1851. it is possible that the two populations originated in differentregions of an inhomogeneous parent object. however, the striking similaritywith m22 calls for a similar evolution for these two clusters. derivingreliable cno abundances for the two sequences would be crucial.

1406.5069	the metallicity spread and the age-metallicity relation of omega  centauri	omega centauri is a peculiar globular cluster formed by a complex stellarpopulation. to shed light on this, we studied 172 stars belonging to the 5 sgbsthat we can identify in our photometry, in order to measure their [fe/h]content as well as estimate their age dispersion and the age-metallicityrelation. the first important result is that all of these sgbs has adistribution in metallicity with a spread that exceeds the observational errorsand typically displays several peaks that indicate the presence of severalsub-populations. we were able to identified at least 6 of them based on theirmean [fe/h] content. these metallicity-based sub-populations are seen tovarying extents in each of the 5 sgbs. taking advantage of the age-sensitivityof the sgb we showed that, first of all, at least half of the sub-populationshave an age spread of at least 2 gyrs. then we obtained an age-metallicityrelation that is the most complete up to date for this cluster. theinterpretation of the age-metallicity relation is not straightforward, but itis possible that the cluster (or what we can call its progenitor) was initiallycomposed of two populations having different metallicities. because of theirage, it is very unlikely that the most metal-rich derives from the mostmetal-poor by some kind of chemical evolution process, so they must be assumedas two independent primordial objects or perhaps two separate parts of a singlelarger object, that merged in the past to form the present-day cluster.

1410.8378	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. v. ngc 6723	we used flames+giraffe (medusa mode) at the vlt to obtain moderately highresolution spectra for 30 red horizontal branch (rhb) stars, 4 rr lyraevariables, and 17 blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars in the low-concentration,moderately metal-rich globular cluster ngc6723 ([fe/h]=-1.22+/-0.08 from ourpresent sample). the spectra were optimized to derive o and na abundances. inaddition, we obtained abundances for other elements, including n, fe, mg, ca,ni, and ba. we used these data to discuss the evidence of a connection betweenthe distribution of stars along the horizontal branch (hb) and the multiplepopulations that are typically present in globular clusters. we found that allrhb and most (13 out of 17) bhb stars are o-rich, na-poor, and n-poor; thesestars probably belong to the first stellar generation in this cluster. only thefour warmest observed stars are (moderately) o-poor, na-rich, and n-rich, andthey probably belong to the second generation. while our sample is not fullyrepresentative of the whole hb population in ngc6723, our data suggest that inthis cluster only hb stars warmer than ~9000 k, that is one fourth of thetotal, belong to the second generation, if at all. since in many other clustersthis fraction is about two thirds, we conclude that the fraction offirst/second generation in globular clusters may be strongly variable. inaddition, the wide range in colour of chemically homogeneous first-generationhb stars requires a considerable spread in mass loss (&gt;0.10 mo). the reason forthis spread is yet to be understood. finally, we found a high ba abundance,with a statistically significant radial abundance gradient.

1503.05925	lithium abundances in globular cluster giants: ngc 1904, ngc 2808, and  ngc 362	the presence of multiple populations in globular clusters has been wellestablished thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy. it is widely accepted thatdistinct populations are a consequence of different stellar generations:intra-cluster pollution episodes are required to produce the peculiar chemistryobserved in almost all clusters. unfortunately, the progenitors responsiblehave left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. toconstrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminiumabundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: ngc~1904, ngc~2808,and ngc~362. the present investigation along with our previous analysis of m12and m5 affords us the largest database of simultaneous determinations of li andal abundances. our results indicate that li production has occurred in each ofthe three clusters. in ngc~362 we detected an m12-like behaviour, with firstand second-generation stars sharing very similar li abundances favouring aprogenitor that is able to produce li, such as agb stars. multiple progenitortypes are possible in ngc~1904 and ngc~2808, as they possess both anintermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars andalso an extreme population, that is enriched in al but depleted in li. a simpledilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. finally, the internalli variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element isa function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relativelymetal-rich clusters are more adept at producing li.

astro-ph;0103515	metallicities for double mode rr lyrae in the large magellanic cloud	metallicities for six double mode rr lyrae's (rrd's) in the large magellaniccloud have been estimated using the deltas method. the derived [fe/h] valuesare in the range [fe/h] = -1.09 to -1.78 (or -0.95 to -1.58, adopting adifferent calibration of [fe/h] vs deltas). two stars in our sample are at thevery metal rich limit of all rrd's for which metal abundance has beenestimated, either by direct measure (for field objects) or on the basis of thehosting system (for objects in globular clusters or external galaxies). thesemetal abundances, coupled with mass determinations from pulsational models andthe petersen diagram, are used to compare the mass-metallicity distribution offield and cluster rr lyrae variables. we find that field and cluster rrd's seemto follow the same mass-metallicity distribution, within the observationalerrors, strengthening the case for uniformity of properties between field andcluster variables at odds to what is usually assumed, we find no significativedifference in mass for rr lyrae's in globular clusters of different metallicityand oosterhoff types, or there may even be a difference contrary to thecommonly accepted one, depending on the metallicity scale adopted to derivemasses. this ``unusual'' result for the mass-metallicity relation is probablydue, at least in part, to the inclusion of updated opacity tables in thecomputation of metal-dependent pulsation models.

astro-ph;0506206	the metal abundance distribution of the oldest stellar component in the  sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	(abridged): low resolution spectroscopy obtained with fors2 at the very largetelescope (vlt) has been used to measure individual metal abundances ([fe/h])for 107 rr lyrae stars, and trace the metal distribution of the oldest stellarcomponent in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. their metallicities have anaverage value of [fe/h]=-1.83 +/- 0.03 (r.m.s. 0.26 dex) and cover themetallicity range -2.40&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.85 (only 1 star with [fe/h]&gt;-1). thestar-to-star scatter is larger than typical errors on individual metallicities(+/- 0.15-0.16 dex), indicating a real spread in metal abundances. the radialvelocities have a dispersion of 12.9 km/s, consistent with the dispersionderived in sculptor by tolstoy et al. (2004). this along with the metallicitydistribution, suggests that most of the rr lyr's arise from the same burst ofstellar formation that produced the metal-poor component giving origin to thegalaxy blue horizontal branch, and only a few (if any) come from the centrallyconcentrated metal-rich red horizontal branch population. the spectroscopicmetallicities and the apparent luminosities were used to study theluminosity-metallicity relation, for which we derive a shallow slope of 0.09mag/dex. this result can be due to a high level of evolution off the zero agehorizontal branch of the rr lyrae stars in this galaxy, again in agreement withtheir origin from the blue horizontal branch population.

astro-ph;0508096	line bisectors and radial velocity jitter from sarg spectra	we present an analysis of spectral line bisector variations for a few starsobserved in the sarg high precision radial velocity planet survey, and discusstheir relationship with differential radial velocities. the spectra we considerare the same used for determining radial velocities. the iodine cell linesemployed in the measurement of radial velocities were removed before bisectoranalysis. the line bisectors were then computed from average absorptionprofiles obtained by cross correlation of the stellar spectra with a mask madefrom suitable lines of a solar catalog. bisector velocity spans were thendetermined: errors in these quantities compare well with theoreticalexpectations based on resolution, s/n and line shape. the plot of bisectorvelocity span against radial velocity was studied to search for correlationsbetween line asymmetries and radial velocity variations. a correlation was seenfor hd 166435 due to stellar activity, and for hd 8071b due to spectralcontamination by the companion. no correlation was seen for 51 peg and rho crb,stars hosting planets. we conclude that this technique may be useful toseparate radial velocity variations due to barycenter motion from spurioussignals in spectra acquired with the iodine cell.

astro-ph;0603858	na-o anticorrelation and hb. iii. the abundances of ngc 6441 from  flames-uves spectra	the aim of the present work is to determine accurate metallicities for agroup of red giant branch stars in the field of the bulge globular cluster ngc6441. this is the third paper of a series resulting from a large project aimedat determining the extent of the na-o anticorrelation among globular clusterstars and exploring its relationship with hb morphology. we present an lteabundance analysis of these objects, based on data gathered with the flamesfiber facility and the uves spectrograph at vlt2. five of the thirteen starsobserved are members of the cluster. the average fe abundance for these fivestars is [fe/h]=$-0.39\pm 0.04\pm 0.05$~dex, where the first error bar includesthe uncertainties related to star-to-star random errors, and the second one thesystematic effects related to the various assumptions made in the analysis.theoverall abundance pattern is quite typical of globular clusters, with an excessof the $\alpha-$elements and of eu. there is evidence that the stars of ngc6441 are enriched in na and al, while they have been depleted of o and mg, dueto h-burning at high temperatures, in analogy with extensive observations forother globular clusters: in particular, one star is clearly na and al-rich ando and mg-poor. we obtained also quite high v abundances, but it is possiblethat this is an artifact of the analysis, since similar large v abundances arederived also for the field stars. these last are all more metal-rich than ngc6441 and probably belong to the bulge population.

astro-ph;0605207	detecting extrasolar planets with integral field spectroscopy	observations of extrasolar planets using integral field spectroscopy (ifs),if coupled with an extreme adaptive optics system and analyzed with asimultaneous differential imaging technique (sdi), are a powerful tool todetect and characterize extrasolar planets directly; they enhance the signal ofthe planet and, at the same time, reduces the impact of stellar light andconsequently important noise sources like speckles. in order to verify theefficiency of such a technique, we developed a simulation code able to test thecapabilities of this ifs-sdi technique for different kinds of planets andtelescopes, modelling the atmospheric and instrumental noise sources. the firstresults obtained by the simulations show that many significant extrasolarplanet detections are indeed possible using the present 8m-class telescopeswithin a few hours of exposure time. the procedure adopted to simulate ifsobservations is presented here in detail, explaining in particular how weobtain estimates of the speckle noise, adaptive optics corrections, specificinstrumental features, and how we test the efficiency of the sdi technique toincrease the signal-to-noise ratio of the planet detection. the most importantresults achieved by simulations of various objects, from 1 m_j to brown dwarfsof 30 m_j, for observations with an 8 meter telescope, are then presented anddiscussed.

astro-ph;0701179	na-o anticorrelation and horizontal branches. v. the na-o  anticorrelation in ngc 6441 from giraffe spectra	we present an analysis of flames-giraffe spectra for several bright giants inngc 6441, to investigate the presence and extent of the na-o anticorrelation inthis anomalous globular cluster. the field of ngc 6441 is very crowded, withsevere contamination by foreground (mainly bulge) field stars. appropriatemembership criteria were devised to identify a group of 25 likely clustermembers among the about 130 stars observed. combined with the uves dataobtained with the same observations, high dispersion abundance analyses are nowavailable for a total of 30 stars in ngc 6441, 29 of them having data for botho and na. the spectra were analyzed by a standard line analysis procedure; carewas taken to minimize the impact of the differential interstellar reddeningthroughout the cluster, and to extract reliable information from crowded, andmoderately high s/n (30-70), moderately high resolution (r ~ 23,000) spectra.ngc 6441 is very metal-rich ([fe/h]=$-0.34\pm 0.02\pm0.04$ dex). there is noclear sign of star-to-star scatter in the fe-peak elements. the alpha-elementsmg, si, ca, and ti are overabundant by rather large factors, suggesting thatthe cluster formed from material enriched by massive core collapse sne. theo-na anticorrelation is well defined, with about 1/4 of the stars being na-richand o-poor. one of the stars is a ba-rich and moderately c-rich star. thedistribution of [na/o] ratios among rgb stars in ngc 6441 appears similar tothe distribution of colors of stars along the horizontal branch. the fractionof na-poor, o-rich stars found in ngc 6441 agrees well with that of stars onthe red horizontal branch of this cluster (in both cases about 80%), with asloping distribution toward lower values of [o/na] (among rgb stars and bluercolors (among hb stars).

astro-ph;0703208	the multiplicity of the subgiant branch of omega centauri: evidence for  prolonged star formation	we present metallicity measurements based on giraffe@vlt spectra of 80subgiant-branch stars of the galactic globular cluster omega centauri. the vltspectroscopic data are complemented by acs/hst and wfi@eso2.2m high-accuracycolor-magnitude diagrams. we have obtained the [fe/h] abundance for each of the80 target stars, and the abundances of c, n, ca, ti, and ba for a subset ofthem, by comparison with synthetic spectra. we show that stars with[fe/h]&lt;-1.25 have a large magnitude spread on the flat part of the sgb. weinterpret this as empirical evidence for an age spread. we have identified fourdistinct stellar groups within the sgb region: (i) an old, metal-poor group([fe/h]~-1.7); (ii) an old, metal-rich group ([fe/h]~-1.1); (iii) a young (upto 4--5 gyr younger than the old component) metal-poor group ([fe/h]~-1.7);(iv) a young, intermediate-metallicity ([fe/h]~-1.4) group, on average 1--2 gyryounger than the old metal-poor population, and with an age spread that wecannot properly quantify with the present sample. in addition, a group of sgbstars are spread between the intermediate-metallicity and metal-rich branchesof the sgb. the spread in age within each population establishes that theprogenitor of omega cen system must have had a composite nature.

astro-ph;9603011	abundances of light elements in metal-poor stars. i. atmospheric  parameters and a new t_eff scale	we present atmospheric parameters for about 300 stars of different chemicalcomposition, whose spectra will be used to study the galactic enrichment of feand light elements. these parameters were derived using an homogenous iterativeprocedure, which considers new calibrations of colour-\teff\ relations for f, gand k-type stars based on infrared flux method (irfm) and interferometricdiameters for population~i stars, and the kurucz (1992) model atmospheres. wefound that these calibrations yield a self-consistent set of atmosphericparameters for \teff$&gt;4400$~k, representing a clear improvement over resultsobtained with older model atmospheres. using this \teff-scale and feequilibrium of ionization, we obtained very low gravities (implyingluminosities incompatible with that expected for rgb stars) for metal-poorstars cooler than 4400~k; this might be due either to a moderate feoverionization (expected from statistical equilibrium calculations) or toinadequacy of kurucz models to describe the atmospheres of very cool giants.our \teff\ scale is compared with other scales recently used for metal-poorstars; it agrees well with those obtained using kurucz (1992) models, but itgives much larger \teff's than those obtained using osmarcs models (edvardssonet al. 1993). this difference is attributed to the different treatment ofconvection in the two sets of models. for the sun, the kurucz (1992) modelappears to be preferable to the osmarcs ones because it better predicts thesolar limb darkening; furthermore, we find that our photometric \teff's formetal-poor stars agree well with both direct estimates based on the irfm, andwith \teff's derived from h$\alpha$\ wings when using kurucz models.

astro-ph;9607078	abundances for globular cluster giants: i. homogeneous metallicities for  24 clusters	we have obtained high-res, high s/n ratio ccd echelle spectra of 10 brightred giants in 3 gcs (47tuc, ngc6752 and ngc6397) roughly spanning the range ofmetallicities of the galactic gc system; they reveal no evidence of star tostar variation of [fe/h] in these 3 gcs. a large set of high quality literaturedata (ews from high-res ccd spectra) was re-analyzed in a self-consistent wayto integrate our data and derive new [fe/h] for more than 160 bright red giantsin 24 gcs. this set was used to define a new [fe/h] scale for gcs based on highquality, direct spectroscopic data, on updated model atmospheres from the gridof kurucz (1992) and on a careful fine abundance analysis (using a common setof atomic and atmospheric parameters for all stars). given the high internalhomogeneity, our new scale supersedes the discrepancies of previous attempts.the internal uncertainty in [fe/h] is very small: 0.06 dex (24 gcs) on average,that can be interpreted as the mean precision of cluster ranking. compared toour system, metallicities on the widely used zinn and west's scale are about0.10dex higher for [fe/h]$&gt;-1$, 0.23dex lower for $-1&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-1.9$ and 0.11dextoo high for [fe/h]$&lt;-1.9$: the non-linearity is significant at 3$\sigma$level. a quadratic transformation corrects older values to the new scale in therange of our calibrating gcs ($-2.24\le[fe/h]_{zw}\le-0.51$). a minordisagreement is found at low [fe/h] between the metallicity scale based onfield and cluster rr lyrae's (via a new calibration of the $\delta$s index) andour new gcs metallicities, that could be ascribed to non-linearity in the[fe/h]$-\delta$s relationship. the impact of new metallicities on majorastrophysical problems is exemplified through the oosterhoff effect in theclassical pair m3 and m15.

astro-ph;9704150	ages of globular clusters from hipparcos parallaxes of local subdwarfs	we report here initial but still strongly conclusive results on absolute agesof galactic globular clusters (ggcs). this study is based on high precisiontrigonometric parallaxes from the hipparcos satellite coupled with accuratemetal abundances ([fe/h], [o/fe], and [\alpha/fe]) from high resolutionspectroscopy for a sample of about thirty subdwarfs. systematic effects due tostar selection (lutz-kelker corrections to parallaxes) and to the possiblepresence of undetected binaries in the sample of bona fide single stars areexamined, and appropriate corrections are estimated. they are found to be smallfor our sample. the new data allowed us to reliably define the absolutelocation of the main sequence (ms) as a function of metallicity. these resultsare then used to derive distances and ages for a carefully selected sample ofnine globular clusters having metallicities determined from high dispersionspectra of individual giants according to a procedure totally consistent withthat used for the field subdwarfs. very precise and homogeneous reddeningvalues have also been independently determined for these clusters. we find thathipparcos parallaxes are smaller than the corresponding ground-basedmeasurements leading, in turn, to longer distance moduli ($\sim 0.2$ mag) andyounger ages ($\sim 2.8$ gyr). the relation between the zero age hb (zahb)absolute magnitude and metallicity for the nine programme clusters turns out tobe: $m_v(zahb) = (0.22\pm 0.09)([fe/h]+1.5) + (0.49\pm 0.04)$. thecorresponding lmc distance modulus is $(m-m)_0=18.60\pm 0.07$. the age of thebona fide old globular clusters (oosterhoff ii and bhb) based on the absolutemagnitude of the turn-off, a theoretically robust indicator, is: age ={11.8^{+2.1}_{-2.5}} gyr.

astro-ph;9909332	light curves and metal abundances of rr lyrae variables in the bar of  the large magellanic cloud	the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is widely considered a corner-stone of theastronomical distance scale, however a difference of 0.2-0.3 mag exists in itsdistance as predicted by the "short" and "long" distance scales. distances tothe lmc from population ii objects are founded on the rr lyrae variables. wehave undertaken an observational campaign devoted to the definition of theaverage apparent luminosity and to the study of the mass-metallicity relationfor rr lyraes in the bar of the lmc. these are compared with analogousquantities for cluster rr lyraes. the purpose is to see whether an intrinsicdifference in luminosity, possibly due to a difference in mass, might existbetween field and cluster rr lyraes, which could be responsible for thewell-known dichotomy between "short" and "long" distance scales. preliminaryresults are presented on the v and b-v light curves, the average apparentvisual magnitude, and the pulsational properties of 102 rr lyrae in the bar ofthe lmc, observed at eso in january 1999. the photometric data are accuratelytied to the johnson photometric system. comparison is presented with thephotometry of rr lyraes in the bar of the lmc obtained by the machocollaboration (alcock et al. 1996). our sample includes 9 double-mode rr lyraesselected from alcock et al. (1997) for which an estimate of the metal abundancefrom the deltas method is presented.
