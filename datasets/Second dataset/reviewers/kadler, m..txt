0812.3947	mojave: monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments. v. multi-epoch  vlba images	we present images from a long term program (mojave: monitoring of jets in agnwith vlba experiments) to survey the structure and evolution of parsec-scalejet phenomena associated with bright radio-loud active galaxies in the northernsky. the observations consist of 2424 15 ghz vlba images of a completeflux-density limited sample of 135 agn above declination -20 degrees, spanningthe period 1994 august to 2007 september. these data were acquired as part ofthe mojave and 2 cm survey programs, and from the vlba archive. the sampleselection criteria are based on multi-epoch parsec-scale (vlba) flux density,and heavily favor highly variable and compact blazars. the sample includesnearly all the most prominent blazars in the northern sky, and is well-suitedfor statistical analysis and comparison with studies at other wavelengths. ourmulti-epoch and stacked-epoch images show 94% of the sample to have apparentone-sided jet morphologies, most likely due to the effects of relativisticbeaming. of the remaining sources, five have two-sided parsec-scale jets, andthree are effectively unresolved by the vlba at 15 ghz, with essentially all ofthe flux density contained within a few tenths of a milliarcsecond.

0902.2085	on the relation between agn gamma-ray emission and parsec-scale radio  jets	we have compared the radio emission from a sample of parsec-scale agn jets asmeasured by the vlba at 15 ghz, with their associated gamma-ray properties thatare reported in the fermi lat 3-month bright source list. we find in ourradio-selected sample that the gamma-ray photon flux correlates well with thequasi-simultaneously measured compact radio flux density. the lat-detected jetsin our radio-selected complete sample generally have higher compact radio fluxdensities, and their parsec-scale cores are brighter (i.e., have higherbrightness temperature) than the jets in the lat non-detected objects. thissuggests that the jets of bright gamma-ray agn have preferentially higherdoppler-boosting factors. in addition, agn jets tend to be found in a moreactive radio state within several months from lat-detection of their stronggamma-ray emission. this result becomes more pronounced for confirmed gamma-rayflaring sources. we identify the parsec-scale radio core as a likely locationfor both the gamma-ray and radio flares, which appear within typical timescalesof up to a few months of each other.

0902.2087	a connection between apparent vlba jet speeds and initial active  galactic nucleus detections made by the fermi gamma-ray observatory	in its first three months of operations, the fermi gamma-ray observatory hasdetected approximately one quarter of the radio-flux-limited mojave sample ofbright flat-spectrum active galactic nuclei (agns) at energies above 100 mev.we have investigated the apparent parsec-scale jet speeds of 26 mojave agnsmeasured by the very long baseline array (vlba) that are in the lat bright agnsample (lbas). we find that the gamma-ray bright quasars have faster jets onaverage than the non-lbas quasars, with a median of 15 c, and values ranging upto 34 c. the lbas agns in which the lat has detected significant gamma-ray fluxvariability generally have faster jets than the nonvariable ones. thesefindings are in overall agreement with earlier results based on nonuniformegret data which suggested that gamma-ray bright agns have preferentiallyhigher doppler boosting factors than other blazar jets. however, the relativelylow lat detection rates for the full mojave sample (24%) and previously knownmojave egret-detected blazars (43%) imply that doppler boosting is not the solefactor that determines whether a particular agn is bright at gamma-rayenergies. the slower apparent jet speeds of lbas bl lac objects and theirhigher overall lat detection rate as compared to quasars suggest that theformer are being detected by fermi because of their higher intrinsic (unbeamed)gamma-ray to radio luminosity ratios.

0903.3583	spectral analysis of the accretion flow in ngc 1052 with suzaku	we present an analysis of the 101 ks, 2007 suzaku spectrum of the linergalaxy ngc 1052. the 0.5-10 kev continuum is well-modeled by a power-lawmodified by galactic and intrinsic absorption, and it exhibits a soft, thermalemission component below 1 kev. both a narrow core and a broader component offe k emission centered at 6.4 kev are robustly detected. while the narrow lineis consistent with an origin in material distant from the black hole, the broadline is best fit empirically by a model that describes fluorescent emissionfrom the inner accretion disk around a rapidly rotating black hole. we find noevidence in this observation for comptonized reflection of the hard x-raysource by the disk above 10 kev, however, which casts doubt on the hypothesisthat the broad iron line originates in the inner regions of a standardaccretion disk. we explore other possible scenarios for producing this spectralfeature and conclude that the high equivalent width (ew ~ 185 kev) andfull-width-half-maximum velocity of the broad iron line (v ~ 0.37c) necessitatean origin within d ~ 8 gravitational radii of the hard x-ray source. based onthe confirmed presence of a strong radio jet in this galaxy nucleus, the broadiron line may be produced in dense plasma near the base of the jet, implyingthat emission mechanisms in the centralmost portions of active galactic nucleiare more complex than previously thought.

0909.5100	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. vi. kinematics analysis of a complete sample of blazar jets	we discuss the jet kinematics of a complete flux-density-limited sample of135 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) resulting from a 13 year program toinvestigate the structure and evolution of parsec-scale jet phenomena. ouranalysis is based on new 2 cm very long baseline array (vlba) images obtainedbetween 2002 and 2007, but includes our previously published observations madeat the same wavelength, and is supplemented by vlba archive data. in all, wehave used 2424 images spanning the years 1994-2007 to study and determine themotions of 526 separate jet features in 127 jets. the data quality and temporalcoverage (a median of 15 epochs per source) of this complete agn jet samplerepresents a significant advance over previous kinematics surveys. in all butfive agns, the jets appear one-sided, most likely the result of differentialdoppler boosting. in general the observed motions are directed along the jetridge line, outward from the optically thick core feature. we directly observechanges in speed and/or direction in one third of the well-sampled jetcomponents in our survey. while there is some spread in the apparent speeds ofseparate features within an individual jet, the dispersion is about three timessmaller than the overall dispersion of speeds among all jets. this supports theidea that there is a characteristic flow that describes each jet, which we havecharacterized by the fastest observed component speed. the observed maximumspeed distribution is peaked at ~10c, with a tail that extends out to ~50c.this requires a distribution of intrinsic lorentz factors in the parentpopulation that range up to ~50. we also note the presence of some rarelow-pattern speeds or even stationary features in otherwise rapidly flowingjets...

0909.5102	mojave: monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments. vii. blazar jet  acceleration	we discuss acceleration measurements for a large sample of extragalacticradio jets from the mojave program which studies the parsec-scale jet structureand kinematics of a complete, flux-density-limited sample of active galacticnuclei (agn). accelerations are measured from the apparent motion of individualjet features or "components" which may represent patterns in the jet flow. wefind that significant accelerations are common both parallel and perpendicularto the observed component velocities. parallel accelerations, representingchanges in apparent speed, are generally larger than perpendicular accelerationthat represent changes in apparent direction. the trend for larger parallelaccelerations indicates that a significant fraction of these changes inapparent speed are due to changes in intrinsic speed of the component ratherthan changes in direction to the line of sight. we find an overall tendency forcomponents with increasing apparent speed to be closer to the base of theirjets than components with decreasing apparent speed. this suggests a linkbetween the observed pattern motions and the underlying flow which, in somecases, may increase in speed close to the base and decrease in speed furtherout; however, common hydro-dynamical processes for propagating shocks may alsoplay a role. about half of the components show "non-radial" motion, or amisalignment between the component's structural position angle and its velocitydirection, and these misalignments generally better align the component motionwith the downstream emission. perpendicular accelerations are closely linkedwith non-radial motion. when observed together, perpendicular accelerations areusually in the correct direction to have caused the observed misalignment.

0911.4924	relativistic beaming and gamma-ray brightness of blazars	we investigate the dependence of gamma-ray brightness of blazars on intrinsicproperties of their parsec-scale radio jets and the implication forrelativistic beaming. by combining apparent jet speeds derived fromhigh-resolution vlba images from the mojave program with millimetre-wavelengthflux density monitoring data from metsahovi radio observatory, we estimate thejet doppler factors, lorentz factors, and viewing angles for a sample of 62blazars. we study the trends in these quantities between the sources which weredetected in gamma-rays by the fermi large area telescope (lat) during its firstthree months of science operations and those which were not detected. thelat-detected blazars have on average higher doppler factors thannon-lat-detected blazars, as has been implied indirectly in several earlierstudies. we find statistically significant differences in the viewing angledistributions between gamma-ray bright and weak sources. most interestingly,gamma-ray bright blazars have a distribution of comoving frame viewing anglesthat is significantly narrower than that of gamma-ray weak blazars and centredroughly perpendicular to the jet axis. the lack of gamma-ray bright blazars atlarge comoving frame viewing angles can be explained by relativistic beaming ofgamma-rays, while the apparent lack of gamma-ray bright blazars at smallcomoving frame viewing angles, if confirmed with larger samples, may suggest anintrinsic anisotropy or lorentz factor dependence of the gamma-ray emission.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

0708.3219	doppler boosting, superluminal motion, and the kinematics of agn jets	we discuss results from a decade long program to study the fine-scalestructure and the kinematics of relativistic agn jets with the aim of betterunderstanding the acceleration and collimation of the relativistic plasmaforming agn jets. from the observed distribution of brightness temperature,apparent velocity, flux density, time variability, and apparent luminosity, theintrinsic properties of the jets including lorentz factor, luminosity,orientation, and brightness temperature are discussed. special attention isgiven to the jet in m87, which has been studied over a wide range ofwavelengths and which, due to its proximity, is observed with excellent spatialresolution.  most radio jets appear quite linear, but we also observe curved non-linearjets and non-radial motions. sometimes, different features in a given jetappear to follow the same curved path but there is evidence for ballistictrajectories as well. the data are best fit with a distribution of lorentzfactors extending up to gamma ~30 and intrinsic luminosity up to ~10^26 w/hz.in general, gamma-ray quasars may have somewhat larger lorentz factors than nongamma-ray quasars. initially the observed brightness temperature near the baseof the jet extend up to ~5x10^13 k which is well in excess of the inversecompton limit and corresponds to a large excess of particle energy overmagnetic energy. however, more typically, the observed brightness temperaturesare ~2x10^11 k, i.e., closer to equipartition.

1104.0804	dual-frequency vlbi study of centaurus a on sub-parsec scales	centaurus a is the closest active galactic nucleus. high resolution imagingusing very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) enables us to study the spectraland kinematic behavior of the radio jet-counterjet system on sub-parsec scales,providing essential information for jet emission and formation models. our aimis to study the structure and spectral shape of the emission from thecentral-parsec region of cen a. as a target of the southern hemisphere vlbimonitoring program tanami (tracking active galactic nuclei with milliarcsecondinterferometry), vlbi observations of cen a are made regularly at 8.4 and 22.3ghz with the australian long baseline array (lba) and associated telescopes inantarctica, chile, and south africa. the first dual-frequency images of thissource are presented along with the resulting spectral index map. an angularresolution of 0.4 mas x 0.7 mas is achieved at 8.4 ghz, corresponding to alinear scale of less than 0.013 pc. hence, we obtain the highest resolutionvlbi image of cen a, comparable to previous space-vlbi observations. bycombining with the 22.3 ghz image, which has been taken without contributingtransoceanic baselines at somewhat lower resolution, we present thecorresponding dual-frequency spectral index distribution along the sub-parsecscale jet revealing the putative emission regions for recently detectedgamma-rays from the core region by fermi/lat. we resolve the innermoststructure of the milliarcsecond scale jet and counterjet system of cen a intodiscrete components. the simultaneous observations at two frequencies providethe highest resolved spectral index map of an agn jet allowing us to identifymultiple possible sites as the origin of the high energy emission.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1511.02631	the gamma-ray emitting radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pks  2004-447 ii. the radio view	gamma-ray detected radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 (g-nls1) galaxiesconstitute a small but interesting sample of the gamma-ray loud agn. theradio-loudest g-nls1 known, pks 2004-447, is located in the southern hemisphereand is monitored in the radio regime by the multiwavelength monitoring programtanami. we aim for the first detailed study of the radio morphology andlong-term radio spectral evolution of pks 2004-447, which are essential tounderstand the diversity of the radio properties of g-nls1s. the tanami vlbimonitoring program uses the australian long baseline array (lba) and telescopesin antarctica, chile, new zealand, and south africa to monitor the jets ofradio-loud active galaxies in the southern hemisphere. lower resolution radioflux density measurements at multiple radio frequencies over four years ofobservations were obtained with the australia telescope compact array (atca).the tanami vlbi image at 8.4 ghz shows an extended one-sided jet with adominant compact vlbi core. its brightness temperature is consistent withequipartition, but it is an order of magnitude below other g-nls1s with thesample value varying over two orders of magnitude. we find a compact morphologywith a projected large-scale size &lt;11 kpc and a persistent steep radio spectrumwith moderate flux-density variability. pks 2004-447 appears to be a uniquemember of the g-nls1 sample. it exhibits blazar-like features, such as a flatfeatureless x-ray spectrum and a core dominated, one-sided parsec-scale jetwith indications for relativistic beaming. however, the data also revealproperties atypical for blazars, such as a radio spectrum and large-scale sizeconsistent with compact-steep-spectrum (css) objects, which are usuallyassociated with young radio sources. these characteristics are unique among allg-nls1s and extremely rare among gamma-ray loud agn.

0808.1740	gamma-ray emission from the broad-line radio galaxy 3c111	the broad-line radio galaxy 3c111 has been suggested as the counterpart ofthe gamma-ray source 3egj0416+3650. while 3c111 meets most of the criteria fora high-probability identification, like a bright flat-spectrum radio core and ablazar-like broadband sed, in the third egret catalog, the large positionaloffset of about 1.5 degrees put 3c111 outside the 99% probability region for3egj0416+3650, making this association questionable. we present a re-analysisof all available data for 3c111 from the egret archives, resulting in probabledetection of high-energy gamma-ray emission above 1000mev from a position closeto the nominal position of 3c111, in two separate viewing periods (vps), at a3-sigma level in each. a new source, groj0426+3747, appears to be presentnearby. for &gt;100mev, one source seems to account for most of the egret-detectedemission of 3egj0416+3650. a follow-up swift uvot/xrt observation reveals onemoderately bright x-ray source in the error box of 3egj0416+3650, but becauseof the large egret position uncertainty, it is not certain that the x-ray andgamma-ray sources are associated. another swift observation, of groj0426+3747,detected no x-ray source nearby.

astro-ph;0304132	jet collimation in action: re-alignment on kiloparsec scales in 3c279	we report a change in the trajectory of a well studied jet component of thequasar 3c279. the component changes in apparent projected speed and direction,and we find it to be moving with a lorentz factor gamma &gt;~ 15 at an initialangle of &lt;~ 1 degree to the line of sight. the new trajectory of the componenthas approximately the same speed and direction as an earlier superluminalfeature, originally seen in the early 1970s. the new direction for thecomponent is also much better aligned with larger scale vlba and vla structureout to 0.1 arcseconds. we suggest that the trajectory change is a collimationevent occurring at &gt;~ 1 kiloparsec (deprojected) along the jet. while thechange in trajectory on the sky appears to be 26 degrees the intrinsic changeis &lt;~ 1 degree. we estimate the doppler factor prior to the change in directionto be d &gt;~ 28 and after the change to be d &gt;~ 23. comparison to independentconstraints on the doppler factor suggest that the energy in the radiatingparticles cannot greatly exceed the energy in the magnetic field unless thevolume filling factor is very much less than one.

astro-ph;0403165	jet emission in ngc1052 at radio, optical, and x-ray frequencies	we present a combined radio, optical, and x-ray study of the nearby linergalaxy ngc 1052. data from a short (2.3 ksec) {\it chandra} observation of ngc1052 reveal the presence of various jet-related x-ray emitting regions, abright compact core and unresolved knots in the jet structure as well as anextended emitting region inside the galaxy well aligned with the radiosynchrotron jet-emission. the spectrum of the extended x-ray emission can bestbe fitted with a thermal model with $kt = (0.4-0.5)$ kev, while the compactcore exhibits a very flat spectrum, best approximated by an absorbed power-lawwith $n_{\rm h} = (0.6-0.8) \times 10^{22} {\rm cm^{-2}}$. we compare the radiostructure to an optical ``structure map'' from a {\it hubble space telescope}({\it hst}) observation and find a good positional correlation between theradio jet and the optical emission cone. bright, compact knots in the jetstructure are visible in all three frequency bands whose spectrum isinconsistent with synchrotron emission.

astro-ph;0403320	sub-milliarcsecond imaging of quasars and active galactic nuclei iii.  kinematics of parsec-scale radio jets	we report the results of a 15 ghz (2 cm) multi-epoch vlba program, begun in1994 to study the outflow in radio jets ejected from quasars and activegalaxies. the observed flow of 208 distinct features measured in 110 quasars,active galaxies, and bl lac objects shows highly collimated relativistic motionwith apparent transverse velocities typically between zero and about 15c, witha tail extending up to about 34c. within individual jets, different featuresappear to move with a similar characteristic velocity which may represent anunderlying continuous jet flow, but we also see some stationary and evenapparently inward moving features which co-exist with the main features.comparison of our observations with published data at other wavelengthssuggests that there is a systematic decrease in apparent velocity withincreasing wavelength, probably because the observations at differentwavelengths sample different parts of the jet structure. the observeddistribution of linear velocities is not consistent with any simple ballisticmodel. either there is a rather broad range of lorentz factors, a significantdifference between the velocity of the bulk relativistic flow and the patternspeed of underlying shocks, or a combination of these options. assuming aballistic flow, comparison of observed apparent velocities and doppler factorscomputed from the time scale of flux density variations is consistent with asteep power law distribution of intrinsic lorentz factors, an isotropicdistribution of orientations of the parent population, and intrinsic brightnesstemperatures about an order of magnitude below the canonical inverse comptonlimit. it appears that the parent population of radio jets is not dominated byhighly relativistic flows (abridged).

astro-ph;0407283	the twin--jet system in ngc 1052: vlbi-scrutiny of the obscuring torus	ngc 1052 offers the possibility to study the obscuring torus around asupermassive black hole, predicted by the standard model of active galacticnuclei, over a wide range of wavelengths from the radio to the x-ray regime. wepresent a detailed vlbi study of the parsec-scale structure of the ``twin-jet''system in ngc 1052 in both total and polarized intensity and at multiplefrequencies. we report the detection of linearly polarized emission from thebase of the eastern jet at 5 ghz. while the radio spectrum in this region mightbe still consistent with synchrotron self absorption, the highly invertedspectrum of the western jet base represents a clear sign of pronouncedfree-free absorption in a circumnuclear torus. we observe an abrupt change ofthe brightness temperature gradient at a distance of $\sim 0.2$ pc to 0.3 pcfrom the central engine. this might provide an observational signature of theedge of the central torus, where the transition from an externalpressure-dominated jet regime to a more or less freely expanding jet takesplace. we determine the absorbing column density towards the western jet coreto be $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ in good agreement with the valuesderived from various x-ray observations. this suggests that the nuclear x-rayemission and the jet emission imaged by vlbi originate on the same scales.

astro-ph;0505536	sub-milliarcsecond imaging of quasars and active galactic nuclei. iv.  fine scale structure	we have used vlba fringe visibility data obtained at 15 ghz to examine thecompact structure in 250 extragalactic radio sources. for 171 sources in oursample, more than half of the total flux density seen by the vlba remainsunresolved on the longest baselines. there are 163 sources in our list with amedian correlated flux density at 15 ghz in excess of 0.5 jy on the longestbaselines. for about 60% of the sources, we have at least one observation inwhich the core component appears unresolved (generally smaller than 0.05 mas)in one direction, usually transverse to the direction into which the jetextends. bl lacs are on average more compact than quasars, while activegalaxies are on average less compact. also, in an active galaxy thesub-milliarcsecond core component tends to be less dominant. idv sourcestypically have a more compact, more core-dominated structure onsub-milliarcsecond scales than non-idv sources, and sources with a greateramplitude of intra-day variations tend to have a greater unresolved vlba fluxdensity. the objects known to be gev gamma-ray loud appear to have a morecompact vlba structure than the other sources in our sample. this suggests thatthe mechanisms for the production of gamma-ray emission and for the generationof compact radio synchrotron emitting features are related. the brightnesstemperature estimates and lower limits for the cores in our sample typicallyrange between 10^11 and 10^13 k, but they extend up to 5x10^13 k, apparently inexcess of the equipartition brightness temperature, or the inverse comptonlimit for stationary synchrotron sources. the largest component speeds areobserved in radio sources with high observed brightness temperatures, as wouldbe expected from relativistic beaming (abridged).

astro-ph;0512459	extragalactic h_2o masers and x-ray absorbing column densities	having conducted a search for the 22 ghz water vapor line towards galaxieswith nuclear activity, large nuclear column densities or high infraredluminosities, we present h_2o spectra for ngc2273, ugc5101 and ngc3393 withisotropic luminosities of 7, 1500, and 400 l_sun. the h_2o maser in ugc5101 isby far the most luminous yet found in an ultraluminous infrared galaxy. ngc3393reveals the classic spectrum of a `disk maser', represented by three distinctgroups of doppler components. as in all other known cases except ngc4258, therotation velocity of the putative masing disk is well below 1000 km/s. based onthe literature and archive data, x-ray absorbing column densities are compiledfor the 64 galaxies with reported maser sources beyond the magellanic clouds.for ngc2782 and ngc5728, we present chandra archive data that indicate thepresence of an active galactic nucleus in both galaxies. the correlationbetween absorbing column and h_2o emission is analyzed. there is a strikingdifference between kilo- and megamasers with megamasers being associated withhigher column densities. all kilomasers (l_h_2o &lt; 10 l_sun) except ngc2273 andngc5194 are compton-thin, i.e. their absorbing columns are &lt; 10^24 cm^-2. amongthe h_2o megamasers, 50% arise from compton-thick and 85% from heavily obscured(&gt; 10^23 cm^-2) active galactic nuclei. these values are not larger butconsistent with those from samples of seyfert 2 galaxies not selected on thebasis of maser emission. the similarity in column densities can be explained bysmall deviations in position between maser spots and nuclear x-ray source and ahigh degree of clumpiness in the circumnuclear interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0603364	x-ray emission from the blazar ao 0235+16: the xmm-newton and chandra  point of view	in this paper we analyse five observations of the bl lac object ao 0235+16performed with the chandra and xmm-newton satellites during the years2000-2005. in the february 2002 observation the source is found in a brightstate and presents a steep x-ray spectrum, while in all the other epochs it isfaint and the spectrum is hard. the soft x-ray spectrum appears to be stronglyabsorbed, likely by the intervening system at z=0.524, which also absorbs theoptical-uv radiation. we find that models that consider spectral curvature aresuperior to single power law ones in fitting the x-ray spectrum. in particular,we favour a double power law model, which agrees with the assumption of asuperposition of two different components in the x-ray domain. both in thechandra and in one of the xmm-newton observations, a tentative detection of theredshifted fe kalpha emission line may suggest its origin from the inner partof an accretion disc. thermal emission from this accretion disc might explainthe uv-soft-x-ray bump that appears in the spectral energy distributions, whenthe x-ray spectra are complemented with the optical-uv data from the opticalmonitor onboard xmm-newton. more likely, the bump can be interpreted in termsof an additional synchrotron component emitted from an inner region of the jetwith respect to that where the lower-energy emission comes from. an inspectionof the x-ray light curves reveals that intraday variability occurs only whenthe source is in a bright state.

astro-ph;0603837	intrinsic brightness temperatures of agn jets	we present a new method for studying the intrinsic brightness temperatures ofthe parsec-scale jet cores of active galactic nuclei (agn). our method usesobserved superluminal motions and observed brightness temperatures for a largesample of agn to constrain the characteristic intrinsic brightness temperatureof the sample as a whole. to study changes in intrinsic brightness temperature,we assume that the doppler factors of individual jets are constant in time asjustified by their relatively small changes in observed flux density. we findthat in their median-low brightness temperature state, the sources in oursample have a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures centered on acharacteristic temperature, t_int = 3 x 10^10 k, which is close to the valueexpected for equipartition, when the energy in the radiating particles equalsthe energy stored in the magnetic fields. however, in their maximum brightnessstate, we find that sources in our sample have a characteristic intrinsicbrightness temperature greater than 2 x 10^11 k, which is well in excess of theequipartition temperature. in this state, we estimate the energy in radiatingparticles exceeds the energy in the magnetic field by a factor of ~ 10^5. wesuggest that the excess of particle energy when sources are in their maximumbrightness state is due to injection or acceleration of particles at the baseof the jet. our results suggest that the common method of estimating jetdoppler factors by using a single measurement of observed brightnesstemperature and/or the assumption of equipartition may lead to large scatter orsystematic errors in the derived values.
