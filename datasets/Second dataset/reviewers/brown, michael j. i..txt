0901.1109	the cosmic evolution of agn in galaxy clusters	we present the surface density of luminous active galactic nuclei (agn)associated with a uniformly selected galaxy cluster sample identified in the8.5 square degree bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. the clustersare distributed over a large range of redshift (0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5) and we identifyagn using three different selection criteria: mid-ir color, radio luminosity,and x-ray luminosity. relative to the field, we note a clear overdensity of thenumber of agn within 0.5 mpc of the cluster centers at z &gt; 0.5. the amplitudeof this agn overdensity increases with redshift. although there are significantdifferences between the agn populations probed by each selection technique, therise in cluster agn surface density generally increases more steeply than thatof field quasars. in particular, x-ray selected agn are at least three timesmore prevalent in clusters at 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 compared to clusters at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.this effect is stronger than can be explained by the evolving median richnessof our cluster sample. we thus confirm the existence of a butcher-oemler typeeffect for agn in galaxy clusters, with the number of agn in clustersincreasing with redshift.

0901.4121	host galaxies, clustering, eddington ratios, and evolution of radio,  x-ray, and infrared-selected agns	we explore the connection between different classes of active galactic nuclei(agns) and the evolution of their host galaxies, by deriving host galaxyproperties, clustering, and eddington ratios of agns selected in the radio,x-ray, and infrared. we study a sample of 585 agns at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 usingredshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages) and data in the radio(wsrt 1.4 ghz), x-rays (chandra xbootes), and mid-ir (irac shallow survey). theradio, x-ray, and ir agn samples show modest overlap, indicating that to theflux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of agns. wederive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as eddington ratios(lambda), for obscured or optically faint agns. we also measure the two-pointcross-correlation between agns and galaxies on scales of 0.3-10 h^-1 mpc, andderive typical dark matter halo masses. we find that: (1) radio agns are mainlyfound in luminous red galaxies, are strongly clustered (with m_halo ~ 3x10^13h^-1 m_sun), and have very low lambda &lt;~ 10^-3; (2) x-ray-selected agns arepreferentially found in galaxies in the "green valley" of color-magnitude spaceand are clustered similarly to typical ages galaxies (m_halo ~ 10^13 h^-1m_sun), with 10^-3 &lt;~ lambda &lt;~ 1; (3) ir agns reside in slightly bluer, lessluminous galaxies than x-ray agns, are weakly clustered (m_halo &lt;~ 10^12 h^-1m_sun), and have lambda &gt; 10^-2. we interpret these results in terms of asimple model of agn and galaxy evolution, whereby a "quasar" phase and thegrowth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches acritical mass between ~10^12 and 10^13 m_sun. subsequently, star formationceases and agn accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and ir-bright) to radiatively inefficient (optically-faint, radio-bright) modes.

0903.2219	the star formation and nuclear accretion histories of normal galaxies in  the ages survey	we combine ir, optical and x-ray data from the overlapping, 9.3 square degreenoao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs), agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages),and xbootes survey to measure the x-ray evolution of 6146 normal galaxies as afunction of absolute optical luminosity, redshift, and spectral type over thelargely unexplored redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. because only the closest orbrightest of the galaxies are individually detected in x-rays, we use astacking analysis to determine the mean properties of the sample. our resultssuggest that x-ray emission from spectroscopically late-type galaxies isdominated by star formation, while that from early-type galaxies is dominatedby a combination of hot gas and agn emission. we find that the mean starformation and supermassive black hole accretion rate densities evolve like(1+z)^3, in agreement with the trends found for samples of bright, individuallydetectable starburst galaxies and agn. our work also corroborates the resultsof many previous stacking analyses of faint source populations, with improvedstatistics.

0905.4274	strong pah emission from z~2 ulirgs	using the infrared spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope, wepresent low-resolution (64 &lt; lambda / dlambda &lt; 124), mid-infrared (20-38micron) spectra of 23 high-redshift ulirgs detected in the bootes field of thenoao deep wide-field survey. all of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24micron) &gt; 0.5 mjy; 2) r-[24] &gt; 14 vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6micron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into spitzer's 3-8 micron iracbands. of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs),usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. the pah features indicateredshifts in the range 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, with a mean of &lt;z&gt;=1.96 and a dispersionof 0.30. based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infraredluminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. our results confirmprevious indications that the rest-frame 1.6 micron stellar bump can beefficiently used to select highly obscured starforming galaxies at z~2, andthat the fraction of starburst-dominated ulirgs increases to faint 24 micronflux densities. using local templates, we find that the observed narrowredshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 micron detectability ofpah-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. we can analogously explain thebroader redshift distribution of spitzer-detected agn-dominated ulirgs based onthe shapes of their seds. finally, we conclude that z~2 sources with adetectable 1.6 micron stellar opacity feature lack sufficient agn emission toveil the 7.7 micron pah band.

0907.3185	active galactic nuclei and the truncation of star formation in k+a  galaxies	we have searched for active galactic nuclei (agns) in k+a galaxies, usingmultiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy in the bootes field of the noao deepwide-field survey. the k+a galaxies, which have had their star formationrapidly truncated, are selected via their strong balmer absorption lines andweak h-alpha emission. our sample consists of 24 k+a galaxies selected from6594 0.10&lt;z&lt;0.35 galaxies brighter than i=20 with optical spectroscopy from theagn and galaxy evolution survey. two thirds of the k+a galaxies are likelyongoing galaxy mergers, with nearby companion galaxies or tidal tails. galaxymergers may be responsible for the truncation of star formation, or we areobserving the aftermath of merger triggered starbursts. as expected, theoptical colors of k+a galaxies largely fall between blue galaxies with ongoingstar formation and red passive galaxies. however, only 1% of the galaxies withcolors between the red and blue populations are k+a galaxies, and we concludethat the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies must have been unusuallyabrupt (&lt;100 myr). we examined the agn content of k+a galaxies with bothoptical emission-line ratios (bpt diagrams) and chandra x-ray imaging. at leasthalf of all k+a galaxies display the optical emission-line ratios of agns, anda third of m_r&lt;-22 k+a galaxies host agns with x-ray luminosities of 10^{42}erg/s. the faintest k+a galaxies do not show clear evidence for hosting agns,having emission-line ratios consistent with photoionization by massive starsand few x-ray detections. we speculate that two mechanisms may be responsiblefor the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies, with agn feedback onlyplaying a role in m_r&lt;-20.5 galaxies.

0908.2854	the halo occupation distribution of hi galaxies	we perform an analysis of the spatial clustering properties of hi selectedgalaxies from the hi parkes all sky survey (hipass) using the formalism of thehalo occupation distribution (hod). the resulting parameter constraints showthat the fraction of satellite galaxies (i.e. galaxies which are not thecentral member of their host dark matter halo) among hipass galaxies is &lt;20%,and that satellite galaxies are therefore less common in hipass than inoptically selected galaxy redshift surveys. moreover the lack of fingers-of-godin the redshift space correlation function of hipass galaxies may indicate thatthe hi rich satellites which do exist are found in group mass rather thancluster mass dark matter halos. we find a minimum halo mass for hipass galaxiesat the peak of the redshift distribution of m~10^11 solar masses, and show thatless than 10% of baryons in hipass galaxies are in the form of hi. quantitativeconstraints on hod models from hipass galaxies are limited by uncertaintiesintroduced through the small survey volume. however our results imply thatfuture deeper surveys will allow the distribution of hi with environment to bestudied in detail via clustering of hi galaxies.

0909.3145	slow galaxy growth within rapidly growing dark matter halos	in cold dark matter cosmologies, the most massive dark matter halos undergorapid growth between a redshift of z=1 and z=0, corresponding to the past 7billion years of cosmic time. there is thus an expectation that the stellarmasses of the most massive galaxies will also rapidly grow via merging overthis redshift range. while there are examples of massive merging galaxies atlow redshift, recent observations show that the stellar masses of massivegalaxies have grown by only 30% since z=1. some of the literature claims thatthe slow growth of massive galaxies is contrary to the cdm paradigm, althoughthis is not necessarily the case. to determine why massive galaxies are notgrowing rapidly, we have modeled how galaxies populate dark matter halos. to dothis, we have measured the space density and spatial clustering of redshift z&lt;1galaxies in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. we have thenmodeled the observations using the halo occupation distribution (hod)formalism. we find that the stellar masses of the largest galaxies areproportional to dark matter halo mass to the power of a third. in the mostmassive dark matter halos, we also find that the stellar mass is distributedmostly among "satellite" galaxies. as a consequence, the stellar masses oflarge galaxies are expected to increase relatively slowly, even though theyreside within rapidly growing dark matter halos.

0912.2130	the halo occupation distribution of hi from 21cm intensity mapping at  moderate redshifts	the spatial clustering properties of hi galaxies can be studied using theformalism of the halo occupation distribution (hod). the resulting parameterconstraints describe properties like gas richness verses environment.unfortunately, clustering studies based on individual hi galaxies will berestricted to the local universe for the foreseeable future, even with thedeepest hi surveys. here we discuss how clustering studies of the hi hod couldbe extended to moderate redshift, through observations of fluctuations in thecombined 21cm intensity of unresolved galaxies. in particular we make ananalytic estimate for the clustering of hi in the hod. our joint goals are toestimate i) the amplitude of the signal, and ii) the sensitivity of telescopeslike the australian ska pathfinder to hod parameters. we find that the powerspectrum of redshifted 21cm intensity could be used to study the distributionof hi within dark matter halos at z&gt;0.5 where individual galaxies cannot bedetected. in addition to the hod of hi, the amplitude of the 21cm powerspectrum would also yield estimates of the cosmic hi content at epochs betweenthe local universe, and redshifts probed by damped ly-alpha absorbers.

1004.1436	ultracool field brown dwarf candidates selected at 4.5 microns	we have identified a sample of cool field brown dwarf candidates using iracdata from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs). the candidates wereselected from 400,000 sdwfs sources with [4.5] &lt;= 18.5 mag and required to have[3.6]-[4.5] &gt;= 1.5 and [4.5] - [8.0] &lt;= 2.0 on the vega system. the first colorrequirement selects objects redder than all but a handful of presently knownbrown dwarfs with spectral classes later than t7, while the second eliminates14 probable reddened agn. optical detection of 4 of the remaining 18 sourcesimplies they are likely also agn, leaving 14 brown dwarf candidates. for two ofthe brightest candidates (sdwfs j143524.44+335334.6 and sdwfsj143222.82+323746.5), the spectral energy distributions including near-infrareddetections suggest a spectral class of ~ t8. the proper motion is &lt; 0.25 "/yr,consistent with expectations for a luminosity inferred distance of &gt;70 pc. thereddest brown dwarf candidate (sdwfs j143356.62+351849.2) has [3.6] -[4.5]=2.24 and h - [4.5] &gt; 5.7, redder than any published brown dwarf in thesecolors, and may be the first example of the elusive y-dwarf spectral class.models from burrows et al.

1006.4359	the evolution of the star formation rate of galaxies at 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2	we present the 24 micron rest-frame luminosity function (lf) of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 constructed from 4047spectroscopic redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey of 24 micronselected sources in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. thissample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe theevolution of the 24 micron lf of galaxies at low and intermediate redshiftswhile minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. in order to use the observed24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei(agns) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified andexcluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions or the detection of x-ray emission. the evolution of the24 micron lf of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z &lt; 0.65 is consistentwith a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosityevolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). we extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0&lt; z &lt; 1.2 by combining our data with that of the far-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey. over this entire redshift range the evolution ofthe characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallowerpower law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). we find a local star formation rate density of(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 msun/yr/mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)over 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. these estimates are in good agreement with the rates usingoptical and uv fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in theobserved sources. this agreement confirms that star formation at z &lt;~ 1.2 isrobustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs inobscured regions of galaxies.

1009.3022	the average physical properties and star formation histories of the  uv-brightest star-forming galaxies at z~3.7	[abridged] we investigate the average physical properties and star formationhistories of the most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies at z~3.7. our resultsare derived from analyses of the average spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed from stacked optical to infrared photometry, of a sample of the1,902 most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies found in 5.3 square degrees of thenoao deep wide-field survey. we bin the sample according to uv luminosity, andfind that the shape of the average sed in the rest-frame optical and infraredis fairly constant with uv luminosity: i.e., more uv luminous galaxies are, onaverage, also more luminous at longer wavelengths. in the rest-uv, however, thespectral slope (measured at 0.13-0.28 um) rises steeply with the median uvluminosity from -1.8 at l l* to -1.2 in the brightest bin (l~4-5l*). we usepopulation synthesis analyses to derive the average physical properties ofthese galaxies and find that: (1) l_uv, and thus star formation rates (sfrs),scale closely with stellar mass such that more uv-luminous galaxies are alsomore massive; (2) the median ages indicate that the stellar populations arerelatively young (200-400 myr) and show little correlation with uv luminosity;and (3) more uv-luminous galaxies are dustier than their less-luminouscounterparts, such that l~4-5l* galaxies are extincted up to a(1600)=2 magwhile l l* galaxies have a(1600)=0.7-1.5 mag. based on these observations, weargue that the average star formation histories of uv-luminous galaxies arebetter described by models in which sfr increases with time in order tosimultaneously reproduce the tight correlation between the observed sfr andstellar mass, and the universally young ages of these galaxies. we demonstratethe potential of measurements of the sfr-m* relation at multiple redshifts todiscriminate between simple models of star formation histories.

1102.4850	clustering of obscured and unobscured quasars in the bootes field:  placing rapidly growing black holes in the cosmic web	we present the first measurement of the spatial clustering of mid-infraredselected obscured and unobscured quasars, using a sample in the redshift range0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 selected from the 9 deg^2 bootes multiwavelength survey. recentlythe spitzer space telescope and x-ray observations have revealed largepopulations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of thex-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. to date, little isknown about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the massesof their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolutionof black holes and galaxies. in this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infraredselected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxycross-correlation function w_p(r). the observed clustering yieldscharacteristic dark matter halo masses of log (m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) =12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (qso-1s) and obscuredquasars (obs-qsos), respectively. the results for qso-1s are in excellentagreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while weconclude that the obs-qsos are at least as strongly clustered as the qso-1s. wetest for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faintobs-qsos, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on theclustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clusteringamplitude of the obs-qsos by at most ~20%. we compare our results to previousstudies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering forobscured quasars.

1207.4790	assembly of the red sequence in infrared-selected galaxy clusters from  the irac shallow cluster survey	we present results for the assembly and star formation histories of massive(~l*) red sequence galaxies in 11 spectroscopically confirmed,infrared-selected galaxy clusters at 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, the precursors topresent-day massive clusters with m ~ 10^15 m_sun. using rest-frame opticalphotometry, we investigate evolution in the color and scatter of the redsequence galaxy population, comparing with models of possible star formationhistories. in contrast to studies of central cluster galaxies at lower redshift(z &lt; 1), these data are clearly inconsistent with the continued evolution ofstars formed and assembled primarily at a single, much-earlier time.specifically, we find that the colors of massive cluster galaxies at z = 1.5imply that the bulk of star formation occurred at z ~ 3, whereas by z = 1 theircolors imply formation at z ~ 2; therefore these galaxies exhibit approximatelythe same luminosity-weighted stellar age at 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. this likely reflectsstar formation that occurs over an extended period, the effects of significantprogenitor bias, or both. our results generally indicate that massive clustergalaxy populations began forming a significant mass of stars at z &gt;~ 4,contained some red spheroids by z ~ 1.5, and were actively assembling much oftheir final mass during 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 in the form of younger stars. qualitatively,the slopes of the cluster color-magnitude relations are consistent with nosignificant evolution relative to local clusters.

1208.4143	star formation in luminous quasar host galaxies at z=1-2	we present deep hst/wfpc2, rest-frame u images of 17 ~l* quasars at z=1 andz=2 (v and i bands respectively), designed to explore the host galaxies. we fitthe images with simple axisymmetric galaxy models, including a point-source, inorder to separate nuclear and host-galaxy emission. we successfully model allof the host galaxies, with luminosities stable to within 0.3 mag. combiningwith our earlier nicmos rest-frame optical study of the same sample, we providethe first rest-frame u-v colours for a sample of quasar host galaxies. whilethe optical luminosities of their host galaxies indicate that they are drawnpurely from the most massive (&gt;~l*) early-type galaxy population, their coloursare systematically bluer than those of comparably massive galaxies at the sameredshift. the host galaxies of the radio-loud quasars (rlq) in our sample aremore luminous than their radio-quiet quasar (rqq) counterparts at each epoch,but have indistinguishable colours, confirming that the rlq's are drawn fromonly the most massive galaxies (10^{11}-10^{12} m_sun, even at z~2), while therqq's are slightly less massive (~10^{11} m_sun). this is consistent with thewell-known anticorrelation between radio-loudness and accretion rate. usingsimple stellar population "frosting" models we estimate mean star formationrates of ~350 m_sun/yr for the rlq's and ~100 m_sun/yr for the rqq's at z~2. byz~1, these rates have fallen to ~150 m_sun/yr for the rlq's and ~50 m_sun/yrfor the rqq's. we conclude that while the host galaxies are extremely massive,they remain actively star-forming at, or close to, the epoch of the quasar.

1209.6055	mid-infrared selection of active galactic nuclei with the wide-field  infrared survey explorer. ii. properties of wise-selected active galactic  nuclei in the ndwfs bo\"otes field	stern et al.(2012) presented a study of wise selection of agn in the 2 deg^2cosmos field, finding that a simple criterion w1-w2&gt;=0.8 provides a highlyreliable and complete agn sample for w2&lt;15.05, where the w1 and w2 passbandsare centered at 3.4 and 4.6 microns, respectively. here we extend this studyusing the larger 9 deg^2 noao deep wide-field survey bootes field which alsohas considerably deeper wise observations than the cosmos field, and find thatthis simple color-cut significantly loses reliability at fainter fluxes. wedefine a modified selection criterion combining the w1-w2 color and the w2magnitude to provide highly reliable or highly complete agn samples for fainterwise sources. in particular, we define a color-magnitude cut that finds 130+/-4deg^-2 agn candidates for w2&lt;17.11 with 90% reliability. using the extensive uvthrough mid-ir broad-band photometry available in this field, we study thespectral energy distributions of wise agn candidates. as expected, the wise agnselection is biased towards objects where the agn dominates the bolometricluminosity output, and that it can identify highly obscured agn. we study thedistribution of reddening in the agn sample and discuss a formalism to accountfor sample incompleteness based on the step-wise maximum-likelihood method ofefstathiou et al.(1988). the resulting dust obscuration distributions dependstrongly on agn luminosity, consistent with the trend expected for a simpson(2005) receding torus. at l_agn~3x10^44 erg/s, 29+/-7% of agn are observed astype 1, while at ~4x10^45 erg/s the fraction is 64+/-13%. the distribution ofobscuration values suggests that dust in the torus is present as both a diffusemedium and in optically thick clouds.

1404.0377	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the wavelength-dependent sizes and  profiles of galaxies revealed by megamorph	we investigate the relationship between colour and structure within galaxiesusing a large, volume-limited sample of bright, low-redshift galaxies withoptical to near-infrared imaging from the gama survey. we fit single-component,wavelength-dependent, elliptical sersic models to all passbands simultaneously,using software developed by the megamorph project. dividing our sample bysersic index and colour, the recovered wavelength variations in effectiveradius (r_e) and sersic index (n) reveal the internal structure, and henceformation history, of different types of galaxies. all these trends depend onn; some have an additional dependence on galaxy colour. late-type galaxies (n_r&lt; 2.5) show a dramatic increase in sersic index with wavelength. this might bea result of their two-component (bulge-disk) nature, though stellar populationgradients within each component and dust attenuation are likely to play a role.all galaxies show a substantial decrease in r_e with wavelength. this isstrongest for early-types (n_r &gt; 2.5), even though they maintain constant nwith wavelength, revealing that ellipticals are a superimposition of differentstellar populations associated with multiple collapse and merging events.processes leading to structures with larger r_e must be associated with lowermetallicity or younger stellar populations. this appears to rule out theformation of young cores through dissipative gas accretion as an importantmechanism in the recent lives of luminous elliptical galaxies.

1404.6828	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the halo mass of galaxy groups from  maximum-likelihood weak lensing	we present a maximum-likelihood weak lensing analysis of the massdistribution in optically selected spectroscopic galaxy groups (g$^3$cv5) inthe galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey, using background sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) photometric galaxies. the scaling of halo mass, $m_h$, withvarious group observables is investigated. our main results are: 1) themeasured relations of halo mass with group luminosity, virial volume andcentral galaxy stellar mass, $m_\star$, agree very well with predictions frommock group catalogues constructed from a galform semi-analytical galaxyformation model implemented in the millennium $\lambda$cdm n-body simulation;2) the measured relations of halo mass with velocity dispersion and projectedhalf-abundance radius show weak tension with mock predictions, hinting atproblems in the mock galaxy dynamics and their small scale distribution; 3) themedian $m_h|m_\star$ measured from weak lensing depends more sensitively on thelognormal dispersion in $m_\star$ at fixed $m_h$ than it does on the median$m_\star|m_h$. our measurements suggest an intrinsic dispersion of$\sigma_{\log(m_\star)}\sim 0.15$; 4) comparing our mass estimates with thosein the catalogue, we find that the g$^3$cv5 mass can give biased results whenused to select subsets of the group sample. of the various new halo massestimators that we calibrate using our weak lensing measurements, groupluminosity is the best single-proxy estimator of group mass.

1409.1358	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): refining the local galaxy merger rate  using morphological information	we use the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey to measure the localuniverse mass dependent merger fraction and merger rate using galaxy pairs andthe cas structural method, which identifies highly asymmetric merger candidategalaxies. our goals are to determine which types of mergers produce highlyasymmetrical galaxies, and to provide a new measurement of the local galaxymajor merger rate. we examine galaxy pairs at stellar mass limits down to$m_{*} = 10^{8}m_{\odot}$ with mass ratios of $&lt;$100:1 and line of sightvelocity differences of $\delta v&lt;500$ km s$^{-1}$. we find a significantincrease in mean asymmetries for projected separations less than the sum of theindividual galaxy's petrosian 90 radii. for systems in major merger pairs withmass ratios of $&lt;$4:1 both galaxies in the pair show a strong increase inasymmetry, while in minor merger systems (with mass ratios of $&gt;$4:1) the lowermass companion becomes highly asymmetric, while the larger galaxy is much lessaffected. the fraction of highly asymmetric paired galaxies which have a majormerger companion is highest for the most massive galaxies and dropsprogressively with decreasing mass. we calculate that the mass dependent majormerger fraction is fairly constant at $\sim1.3-2\%$ between$10^{9.5}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$, and increases to $\sim4\%$ at lowermasses. when the observability time scales are taken into consideration, themajor merger rate is found to approximately triple over the mass range weconsider. the total co-moving volume major merger rate over the range$10^{8.0}&lt;m_{*}&lt;10^{11.5} m_{\odot}$ is $(1.2 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-3}$$h^{3}_{70}$ mpc$^{-3}$ gyr$^{-1}$.

1410.3489	the clustering and halo masses of star forming galaxies at z&lt;1	we present clustering measurements and halo masses of star forming galaxiesat 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. after excluding agn, we construct a sample of 22553 24 {\mu}msources selected from 8.42 deg^2 of the spitzer mips agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey of bo\"otes. mid-infrared imaging allows us to observe galaxies with thehighest star formation rates (sfrs), less biased by dust obscuration afflictingthe optical bands. we find that the galaxies with the highest sfrs have opticalcolors which are redder than typical blue cloud galaxies, with many residingwithin the green valley. at z &gt; 0.4 our sample is dominated by luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^11 lsun) and is comprised entirely oflirgs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^12 lsun) at z &gt;0.6. we observe weak clustering of r_0 = 3-6 mpc/h for almost all of our starforming samples. we find that the clustering and halo mass depend on l_tir atall redshifts, where galaxies with higher l_tir (hence higher sfrs) havestronger clustering. galaxies with the highest sfrs at each redshift typicallyreside within dark matter halos of m_halo ~ 10^12.9 msun/h. this is consistentwith a transitional halo mass, above which star formation is largely truncated,although we cannot exclude that ulirgs reside within higher mass halos. bymodeling the clustering evolution of halos, we connect our star forming galaxysamples to their local descendants. most star forming galaxies at z &lt; 1.0 arethe progenitors of l &lt; 2.5l* blue galaxies in the local universe, but starforming galaxies with the highest sfrs (l_tir &gt;10^11.7 lsun) at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 arethe progenitors of early-type galaxies in denser group environments.

0804.2293	red galaxy growth and the halo occupation distribution	we have traced the past 7 gyr of red galaxy stellar mass growth within darkmatter halos. we have determined the halo occupation distribution, whichdescribes how galaxies reside within dark matter halos, using the observedluminosity function and clustering of 40,696 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 red galaxies in bootes.half of 10^{11.9} msun/h halos host a red central galaxy, and this fractionincreases with increasing halo mass. we do not observe any evolution of therelationship between red galaxy stellar mass and host halo mass, although weexpect both galaxy stellar masses and halo masses to evolve over cosmic time.we find that the stellar mass contained within the red population has doubledsince z=1, with the stellar mass within red satellite galaxies tripling overthis redshift range. in cluster mass halos most of the stellar mass resideswithin satellite galaxies and the intra-cluster light, with a minority of thestellar mass residing within central galaxies. the stellar masses of the mostluminous red central galaxies are proportional to halo mass to the power of athird. we thus conclude that halo mergers do not always lead to rapid growth ofcentral galaxies. while very massive halos often double in mass over the past 7gyr, the stellar masses of their central galaxies typically grow by only 30%.

1505.05518	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): trends in galaxy colours, morphology,  and stellar populations with large scale structure, group, and pair  environments	we explore trends in galaxy properties with mpc-scale structures usingcatalogues of environment and large scale structure from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. existing gama catalogues of large scale structure,group and pair membership allow us to construct galaxy stellar mass functionsfor different environmental types. to avoid simply extracting the knownunderlying correlations between galaxy properties and stellar mass, we create amass matched sample of galaxies with stellar masses between $9.5 \leq\log{m_*/h^{-2} m_{\odot}} \leq 11$ for each environmental population. usingthese samples, we show that mass normalised galaxies in different large scaleenvironments have similar energy outputs, $u-r$ colours, luminosities, andmorphologies. extending our analysis to group and pair environments, we showgalaxies that are not in groups or pairs exhibit similar characteristics toeach other regardless of broader environment. for our mass controlled sample,we fail to see a strong dependence of s\'{e}rsic index or galaxy luminosity onhalo mass, but do find that it correlates very strongly with colour. repeatingour analysis for galaxies that have not been mass controlled introduces andamplifies trends in the properties of galaxies in pairs, groups, and largescale structure, indicating that stellar mass is the most important predictorof the galaxy properties we examine, as opposed to environmentalclassifications.

1507.00737	the masses of satellites in gama galaxy groups from 100 square degrees  of kids weak lensing data	we use the first 100 sq. deg. of overlap between the kilo-degree survey(kids) and the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey to determine the galaxyhalo mass of ~10,000 spectroscopically-confirmed satellite galaxies in massive($m &gt; 10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm m}_\odot$) galaxy groups. separating the sample as afunction of projected distance to the group centre, we jointly model thesatellites and their host groups with navarro-frenk-white (nfw) densityprofiles, fully accounting for the data covariance. the probed satellitegalaxies in these groups have total masses $\log m_{\rm sub} /(h^{-1}{\rmm}_\odot) \approx 11.7 - 12.2$ consistent across group-centric distance withinthe errorbars. given their typical stellar masses, $\log m_{\rm\star,sat}/(h^{-2}{\rm m}_\odot) \sim 10.5$, such total masses imply stellarmass fractions of $m_{\rm \star,sat} /m_{\rm sub} \approx 0.04 h^{-1}$ . theaverage subhalo hosting these satellite galaxies has a mass $m_{\rm sub} \sim0.015m_{\rm host}$ independent of host halo mass, in broad agreement with theexpectations of structure formation in a $\lambda$cdm universe.

(2014), and find that the models reproduce thetrend of stronger clustering for more massive galaxies. however, the modelsunder predict the clustering of blue galaxies, can incorrectly predict thecorrelation function on small scales and under predict the clustering in oursample of galaxies with ~3$l_r$ . we suggest possible avenues to explore toimprove these cluster- ing predictions. the measurements presented in thispaper can be used to test other galaxy formation models, and we make themeasurements available online to facilitate this.

astro-ph;0410523	mid-infrared selection of active galaxies	mid-infrared photometry provides a robust technique for identifying activegalaxies. while the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of normal galaxies isdominated by the composite stellar black body curve and peaks at approximately1.6 microns, the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of active galaxies isdominated by a power law. consequently, with sufficient wavelength baseline,one can easily distinguish agn from stellar populations. mirroring the tendencyof agn to be bluer than galaxies in the ultraviolet, where galaxies (and stars)sample the blue, rising portion of stellar spectra, agn tend to be redder thangalaxies in the mid-infrared, where galaxies sample the red, falling portion ofthe stellar spectra. we report on spitzer space telescope mid-infrared colors,derived from the irac shallow survey, of nearly 10,000 spectroscopicallyidentified sources from the agn and galaxy evolution survey. based on thisspectroscopic sample, we find that simple mid-infrared color criteria provideremarkably robust separation of active galaxies from normal galaxies andgalactic stars, with over 80% completeness and less than 20% contamination.considering only broad-lined agn, these mid-infrared color criteria identifyover 90% of spectroscopically identified quasars and seyfert 1s. applying thesecolor criteria to the full imaging data set, we discuss the implied surfacedensity of agn and find evidence for a large population of optically obscuredactive galaxies.

astro-ph;0510504	the 1&lt;z&lt;5 infrared luminosity function of type i quasars	we determine the rest-frame 8 micron luminosity function of type i quasarsover the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;5. our sample consists of 292 24 micron sourcesbrighter than 1 mjy selected from 7.17 square degrees of the spitzer spacetelescope mips survey of the noao deep wide-field survey bootes field. the agnand galaxy evolution survey (ages) has measured redshifts for 270 of the r&lt;21.7sources and we estimate that the contamination of the remaining 22 sources bystars and galaxies is low. we are able to select quasars missed by ultra-violetexcess quasar surveys, including reddened type i quasars and 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.0 quasarswith optical colors similar to main sequence stars. we find reddened type iquasars comprise 20% of the type i quasar population. nonetheless, the shape,normalization, and evolution of the rest-frame 8 micron luminosity function iscomparable to that of quasars selected from optical surveys. the 8 micronluminosity function of type i quasars is well approximated by a power-law withindex -2.75(+/-0.14). we directly measure the peak of the quasar space densityto be at z=2.6(+/-0.3).

astro-ph;0511249	the flamingos extragalactic survey	using the florida multi-object imaging near-ir grism observationalspectrometer (flamingos), we have conducted the flamingos extragalactic survey(flamex), a deep imaging survey covering 7.1 square degrees within the 18.6 sq.deg noao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs) regions. flamex is the first deep,wide-area near-infrared survey to image in both the j and ks filters, and islarger than any previous nir surveys of comparable depth. the intent of flamexis to facilitate the study of galaxy and galaxy cluster evolution at 1&lt;z&lt;2 byproviding rest-frame optical photometry for the massive galaxy population atthis epoch. this effort is designed to yield a public data set that complementsand augments the suite of existing surveys in the ndwfs fields. we present anoverview of flamex and initial results based upon ~150,000 ks-selected sourcesin the bootes field. we describe the observations and reductions, quantify thedata quality, and verify that the number counts are consistent with resultsfrom previous surveys. finally, we comment upon the utility of this sample fordetailed study of the ero population, and present one of the firstspectroscopically confirmed z&gt;1 galaxy clusters detected using the jointflamex, ndwfs, and spitzer irac shallow survey data sets.

astro-ph;0512343	the chandra xbootes survey - iii: optical and near-ir counterparts	the xbootes survey is a 5-ks chandra survey of the bootes field of the noaodeep wide-field survey (ndwfs). this survey is unique in that it is the largest(9.3 deg^2), contiguous region imaged in x-ray with complementary deep opticaland near-ir observations. we present a catalog of the optical counterparts tothe 3,213 x-ray point sources detected in the xbootes survey. using a bayesianidentification scheme, we successfully identified optical counterparts for 98%of the x-ray point sources. the optical colors suggest that the opticallydetected galaxies are a combination of z&lt;1 massive early-type galaxies andbluer star-forming galaxies whose optical agn emission is faint or obscured,whereas the majority of the optically detected point sources are likely quasarsover a large redshift range. our large area, x-ray bright, optically deepsurvey enables us to select a large sub-sample of sources (773) with high x-rayto optical flux ratios (f_x/f_o&gt;10). these objects are likely high redshiftand/or dust obscured agn. these sources have generally harder x-ray spectrathan sources with 0.1&lt;f_x/f_o&lt;10. of the 73 x-ray sources with no opticalcounterpart in the ndwfs catalog, 47 are truly optically blank down to r~25.5(the average 50% completeness limit of the ndwfs r-band catalogs). thesesources are also likely to be high redshift and/or dust obscured agn.

astro-ph;0602383	the protostellar jet model of chondrule formation	a chondrule formation theory is presented where the chondrule formation zoneis located within 0.1 au of the protosun. this hot, optically thick, inner zoneof the solar accretion disk is coincident with the formation region of theprotosolar jet.  the model assumes that particles, ranging in diameter from 1 micron to 1 cm,can be ejected from the inner-accretion disk by the jet flow, and that theangular momentum of this material is sufficient to eject it from the jet flow.given these assumptions, any material so ejected, will fly across the face ofthe accretion disk at speeds greater than the escape velocity of the system.this material can only be recaptured through the action of gas drag. such acapture process naturally produces aerodynamic size sorting of chondrules andchondrule fragments, while the ejection of refractory dust provides a possibleexplanation for the observed complementarity between matrix and chondrules.this transfer of material will result in the loss of angular momentum from theupper atmosphere of the outer accretion disk and thereby facilitate theaccretion of matter onto the protosun.

astro-ph;0605030	the discovery of three new z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolution  survey	we present the discovery of three z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey (ages) spectroscopic observations of the noao deep wide-field survey(ndwfs) bootes field. these quasars were selected as part of a larger spitzermid-infrared quasar sample with no selection based on optical colors. thehighest redshift object, ndwfs j142516.3+325409, z=5.85, is thelowest-luminosity z&gt;5.8 quasar currently known. we compare mid-infraredtechniques for identifying z&gt;5 quasars to more traditional optical techniquesand show that mid-infrared colors allow for selection of high-redshift quasarseven at redshifts where quasars lie near the optical stellar locus and at z&gt;7where optical selection is impossible. using the superb multi-wavelengthcoverage available in the ndwfs bootes field, we construct the spectral energydistributions (seds) of high-redshift quasars from observed bw-band to 24microns (rest-frame 600 angstroms - 3.7 microns). we show that the threehigh-redshift quasars have quite similar seds, and the rest-frame composite sedof low-redshift quasars from the literature shows little evolution compared toour high-redshift objects. we compare the number of z&gt;5 quasars we havediscovered to the expected number from published quasar luminosity functions.while analyses of the quasar luminosity function are tenuous based on onlythree objects, we find that a relatively steep luminosity function with psil^(-3.2) provides the best agreement with the number of high-redshift quasarsdiscovered in our survey.

astro-ph;0608633	the weak clustering of gas-rich galaxies	we examine the clustering properties of hi-selected galaxies through ananalysis of the hi parkes all-sky survey catalogue (hicat) two-pointcorrelation function. various sub-samples are extracted from this catalogue tostudy the overall clustering of hi-rich galaxies and its dependence onluminosity, hi gas mass and rotational velocity. these samples cover the entiresouthern sky dec &lt; 0 deg, containing up to 4,174 galaxies over the radialvelocity range 300-12,700 km/s. a scale length of r_0 = 3.45 +/- 0.25 mpc/h andslope of gamma = 1.47 +/- 0.08 is obtained for the hi-rich galaxy real-spacecorrelation function, making gas-rich galaxies among the most weakly clusteredobjects known. hi-selected galaxies also exhibit weaker clustering thanoptically selected galaxies of comparable luminosities. good agreement is foundbetween our results and those of synthetic hi-rich galaxy catalogues generatedfrom the millennium run cdm simulation. bisecting hicat using differentparameter cuts, clustering is found to depend most strongly on rotationalvelocity and luminosity, while the dependency on hi mass is marginal. splittingthe sample around v_rot = 108 km/s, a scale length of r_0 = 2.86 +/- 0.46 mpc/his found for galaxies with low rotational velocities compared to r_0 = 3.96 +/-0.33 mpc/h for the high rotational velocity sample.

astro-ph;0609451	clustering of the ir background light with spitzer: contribution from  resolved sources	we describe the angular power spectrum of resolved sources at 3.6 microns(l-band) in spitzer imaging data of the goods hdf-n, the goods cdf-s, and thendwfs bootes field in several source magnitude bins. we also measure angularpower spectra of resolved sources in the bootes field at k_s and j-bands usingground-based ir imaging data. in the three bands, j, k_s, and l, we detect theclustering of galaxies on top of the shot-noise power spectrum at multipolesbetween ell ~ 10^2 and 10^5. the angular power spectra range from the large,linear scales to small, non-linear scales of galaxy clustering, and in somemagnitude ranges, show departure from a power-law clustering spectrum. weconsider a halo model to describe clustering measurements and to establish thehalo occup ation number parameters of ir bright galaxies at redshifts aroundone. we also extend our clustering results and completeness-corrected faintsource number counts in goods fields to understand the underlying nature ofunresolved sources responsible for ir background (irb) anisotropies that weredetected in deep spitzer images. while these unresolved fluctuations weremeasured at sub-arcminute angular scales, if a high-redshift diffuse componentassociated with first galaxies exists in the irb, then it's clusteringproperties are best studied with shallow, wide-field images that allow ameasurement of the clustering spectrum from a few degrees to arcminute angularscales.

astro-ph;0609584	the evolving luminosity function of red galaxies	we trace the assembly history of red galaxies since z=1, by measuring theirevolving space density with the b-band luminosity function. our sample of 39599red galaxies, selected from 6.96 square degrees of imaging from the noao deepwide-field and spitzer irac shallow surveys, is an order of magnitude larger,in size and volume, than comparable samples in the literature. we measure ahigher space density of z=0.9 red galaxies than some of the recent literature,in part because we account for the faint yet significant galaxy flux whichfalls outside of our photometric aperture. the b-band luminosity density of redgalaxies, which effectively measures the evolution of ~l* galaxies, increasesby only 36 percent from z=0 to z=1. if red galaxy stellar populations havefaded by 1.24 b-band magnitudes since z=1, the stellar mass contained withinthe red galaxy population has roughly doubled over the past 8 gyr. this isconsistent with star-forming galaxies being transformed into ~l* red galaxiesafter a decline in their star formation rates. in contrast, the evolution of4l* red galaxies differs only slightly from a model with negligible starformation and no galaxy mergers since z=1. if this model approximates theluminosity evolution of red galaxy stellar populations, then 80 percent of thestellar mass contained within today's 4l* red galaxies was already in place atz=0.7. while red galaxy mergers have been observed, such mergers do not producerapid growth of 4l* red galaxy stellar masses between z=1 and the present day.

0810.0528	clustering of dust-obscured galaxies at z ~ 2	we present the angular autocorrelation function of 2603 dust-obscuredgalaxies (dogs) in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. dogsare red, obscured galaxies, defined as having r-[24] \ge 14 (f_24/f_r \ga1000). spectroscopy indicates that they are located at 1.5 \la z \la 2.5. wefind strong clustering, with r_0 = 7.40^{+1.27}_{-0.84} mpc/h for the full f_24&gt; 0.3 mjy sample. the clustering and space density of the dogs are consistentwith those of submillimeter galaxies, suggestive of a connection between thesepopulations. we find evidence for luminosity-dependent clustering, with thecorrelation length increasing to r_0 = 12.97^{+4.26}_{-2.64} mpc/h for brighter(f_24 &gt; 0.6 mjy) dogs. bright dogs also reside in richer environments thanfainter ones, suggesting these subsamples may not be drawn from the same parentpopulation. the clustering amplitudes imply average halo masses of log m =12.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} msun for the full dog sample, rising to log m =13.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3} msun for brighter dogs. in a biased structure formationscenario, the full dog sample will, on average, evolve into ~ 3 l* present-daygalaxies, whereas the most luminous dogs may evolve into brightest clustergalaxies.

0811.1398	the origin of the 24-micron excess in red galaxies	observations with the spitzer space telescope have revealed a population ofred-sequence galaxies with a significant excess in their 24-micron emissioncompared to what is expected from an old stellar population. we identify 900red galaxies with 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.3 from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages)selected from the noao deep wide-field survey bootes field. using spitzer/mips,we classify 89 (~10%) with 24-micron infrared excess (f24&gt;0.3 mjy). wedetermine the prevalence of agn and star-formation activity in all the agesgalaxies using optical line diagnostics and mid-ir color-color criteria. usingthe irac color-color diagram from the irac shallow survey, we find that 64% ofthe 24-micron excess red galaxies are likely to have strong pah emissionfeatures in the 8-micron irac band. this fraction is significantly larger thanthe 5% of red galaxies with f24&lt;0.3 mjy that are estimated to have strong pahemission, suggesting that the infrared emission is largely due tostar-formation processes. only 15% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies haveoptical line diagnostics characteristic of star-formation (64% are classifiedas agn and 21% are unclassifiable). the difference between the optical andinfrared results suggest that both agn and star-formation activity is occurringsimultaneously in many of the 24-micron excess red galaxies. these resultsshould serve as a warning to studies that exclusively use optical linediagnostics to determine the dominant emission mechanism in the infrared andother bands. we find that ~40% of the 24-micron excess red galaxies are edge-onspiral galaxies with high optical extinctions. the remaining sources are likelyto be red galaxies whose 24-micron emission comes from a combination ofobscured agn and star-formation activity.
