0903.3406	the solar photospheric nitrogen abundance. analysis of atomic  transitions with 3d and 1d model atmospheres	context: in recent years, the solar chemical abundances have been studied inconsiderable detail because of discrepant values of solar metallicity inferredfrom different indicators, i.e., on the one hand, the "sub-solar" photosphericabundances resulting from spectroscopic chemical composition analyses with theaid of 3d hydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere, and, on the otherhand, the high metallicity inferred by helioseismology. aims: afterinvestigating the solar oxygen abundance using a co5bold 3d hydrodynamicalsolar model in previous work, we undertake a similar approach studying thesolar abundance of nitrogen, since this element accounts for a significantfraction of the overall solar metallicity, z. method: we used a selection ofatomic spectral lines to determine the solar nitrogen abundance, relying mainlyon equivalent width measurements in the literature. we investigate theinfluence on the abundance analysis, of both deviations from localthermodynamic equilibrium ("nlte effects") and photospheric inhomogeneities("granulation effects"). results: we recommend use of a solar nitrogenabundance of a(n)=7.86+-0.12 whose error bar reflects the line-to-line scatter.conclusion: the solar metallicity implied by the co5bold-based nitrogen andoxygen abundances is in the range 0.0145&lt;= z &lt;= 0.0167. this result is a steptowards reconciling photospheric abundances with helioseismic constraints on z.our most suitable estimates are z=0.0156 and z/x=0.0213.

0905.2695	hydrodynamical simulations of convection-related stellar  micro-variability. ii. the enigmatic granulation background of the corot  target hd49933	local-box hydrodynamical model atmospheres provide statistical informationabout a star's emergent radiation field which allows one to predict the levelof its granulation-related micro-variability. space-based photometry is nowsufficiently accurate to test model predictions. we aim to model thephotometric granulation background of hd49933 as well as the sun, and comparethe predictions to the measurements obtained by the corot and soho satellitemissions. we construct hydrodynamical model atmospheres representing hd49933and the sun, and use a previously developed scaling technique to obtain theobservable disk-integrated brightness fluctuations. we further performedexploratory magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of smallscale magnetic fields on the synthetic light-curves. we find that thegranulation-related brightness fluctuations depend on metallicity. we obtain asatisfactory correspondence between prediction and observation for the sun,validating our approach. for hd49933, we arrive at a significantover-estimation by a factor of two to three in total power. locally generatedmagnetic fields are unlikely to be responsible, otherwise existing fields wouldneed to be rather strong to sufficiently suppress the granulation signal.presently suggested updates on the fundamental stellar parameters do notimprove the correspondence; however, an ad-hoc increase of the hd49933 surfacegravity by about 0.2dex would eliminate most of the discrepancy. we diagnose apuzzling discrepancy between the predicted and observed granulation backgroundin hd49933, with only rather ad-hoc ideas for remedies at hand.

0906.4697	impact of granulation effects on the use of balmer lines as temperature  indicators	balmer lines serve as important indicators of stellar effective temperaturesin late-type stellar spectra. one of their modelling uncertainties is theinfluence of convective flows on their shape. we aim to characterize theinfluence of convection on the wings of balmer lines. we perform a differentialcomparison of synthetic balmer line profiles obtained from 3d hydrodynamicalmodel atmospheres and 1d hydrostatic standard ones. the model parameters areappropriate for f,g,k dwarf and subgiant stars of metallicity ranging fromsolar to 1/1000 solar. the shape of the balmer lines predicted by 3d models cannever be exactly reproduced by a 1d model, irrespective of its effectivetemperature. we introduce the concept of a 3d temperature correction, as theeffective temperature difference between a 3d model and a 1d model whichprovides the closest match to the 3d profile. the temperature correction isdifferent for the different members of the balmer series and depends on theadopted mixing-length parameter in the 1d model. among the investigated models,the 3d correction ranges from -300k to +300k. horizontal temperaturefluctuations tend to reduce the 3d correction. accurate effective temperaturescannot be derived from the wings of balmer lines, unless the effects ofconvection are properly accounted for. the 3d models offer a physically welljustified way of doing so. the use of 1d models treating convection with themixing-length theory do not appear to be suitable for this purpose. inparticular, there are indications that it is not possible to determine a singlevalue of the mixing-length parameter which will optimally reproduce the balmerlines for any choice of atmospheric parameters.

0910.4733	solar abundances and granulation effects	the solar abundances have undergone a major downward revision in the lastdecade, reputedly as a result of employing 3d hydrodynamical simulations tomodel the inhomogeneous structure of the solar photosphere. the very low oxygenabundance advocated by asplund et al. (2004), a(o)=8.66, together with thedownward revision of the carbon and nitrogen abundances, has created seriousproblems for solar models to explain the helioseismic measurements. in aneffort to contribute to the dispute we have re-derived photospheric abundancesof several elements independently of previous analysis. we applied astate-of-the art 3d (co5bold) hydrodynamical simulation of the solargranulation as well as different 1d model atmospheres for the line by linespectroscopic abundance determinations. the analysis is based on both standarddisc-centre and disc-integrated spectral atlases; for oxygen we acquired inaddition spectra at different heliocentric angles. the derived abundances arethe result of equivalent width and/or line profile fitting of the availableatomic lines. we discuss the different granulation effects on solar abundancesand compare our results with previous investigations. according to ourinvestigations hydrodynamical models are important in the solar abundancedetermination, but are not responsible for the recent downward revision in theliterature of the solar metallicity.

0910.5917	6li in metal-poor halo stars: real or spurious?	the presence of convective motions in the atmospheres of metal-poor halostars leads to systematic asymmetries of the emergent spectral line profiles.since such line asymmetries are very small, they can be safely ignored forstandard spectroscopic abundance analysis. however, when it comes to thedetermination of the 6li/7li isotopic ratio, q(li)=n(6li)/n(7li), the intrinsicasymmetry of the 7li line must be taken into account, because its signature isessentially indistinguishable from the presence of a weak 6li blend in the redwing of the 7li line. in this contribution we quantity the error of theinferred 6li/7li isotopic ratio that arises if the convective line asymmetry isignored in the fitting of the lithium blend at 6707 a. our conclusion is that6li/7li ratios derived by asplund et al. (2006), using symmetric line profiles,must be reduced by typically dq(li) ~ 0.015. this diminishes the number ofcertain 6li detections from 9 to 4 stars or less, casting some doubt on theexistence of a 6li plateau.

0911.4251	accuracy of spectroscopy-based radioactive dating of stars	combined spectroscopic abundance analyses of stable and radioactive elementscan be applied for deriving stellar ages. the achievable precision depends onfactors related to spectroscopy, nucleosynthesis, and chemical evolution. wequantify the uncertainties arising from the spectroscopic analysis, and comparethese to the other error sources. we derive formulae for the age uncertaintiesarising from the spectroscopic abundance analysis, and apply them tospectroscopic and nucleosynthetic data compiled from the literature for the sunand metal-poor stars. we obtained ready-to-use analytic formulae of the ageuncertainty for the cases of stable+unstable and unstable+unstable chronometerpairs, and discuss the optimal relation between to-be-measured age and meanlifetime of a radioactive species. application to the literature data indicatesthat, for a single star, the achievable spectroscopic accuracy is limited toabout +/- 20% for the foreseeable future. at present, theoretical uncertaintiesin nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models form the precision bottleneck.for stellar clusters, isochrone fitting provides a higher accuracy thanradioactive dating, but radioactive dating becomes competitive when applied tomany cluster members simultaneously, reducing the statistical errors by afactor sqrt(n). spectroscopy-based radioactive stellar dating would benefitfrom improvements in the theoretical understanding of nucleosynthesis andchemical evolution. its application to clusters can provide strong constraintsfor nucleosynthetic models.

0912.5430	the evolution of planetary nebulae vi. on the chemical composition of  the metal-poor pn g135.9+55.9	the actual value of the oxygen abundance of the metal-poor planetary nebulapn g135.9+55.9 has frequently been debated in the literature. we wanted toclarify the situation by making an improved abundance determination based on astudy that includes both new accurate observations and new models. we madeobservations using the method of integral field spectroscopy with the pmasinstrument, and also used ultraviolet observations that were measured withhst-stis. in our interpretation of the reduced and calibrated spectrum we usedfor the first time, recent radiation hydrodynamic models, which were calculatedwith several setups of scaled values of mean galactic disk planetary nebulametallicities. for evolved planetary nebulae, such as pn g135.9+55.9, it turnsout that departures from thermal equilibrium can be significant, leading tomuch lower electron temperatures, hence weaker emission in collisionallyexcited lines. based on our time-dependent hydrodynamic models and the observedemission line [oiii]5007, we found a very low oxygen content of about 1/80 ofthe mean galactic disk value. this result is consistent with emission linemeasurements in the ultraviolet wavelength range. the c/o and ne/o ratios areunusually high and similar to those of another halo object, bobn-1.

1001.3274	convection and 6li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars	based on 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the co5bold codeand 3d non-lte (nlte) line formation calculations, we study the effect of theconvection-induced line asymmetry on the derived 6li abundance for a range ineffective temperature, gravity, and metallicity covering the stars of theasplund et al. (2006) sample. when the asymmetry effect is taken into accountfor this sample of stars, the resulting 6li/7li ratios are reduced by about1.5% on average with respect to the isotopic ratios determined by asplund etal. (2006). this purely theoretical correction diminishes the number ofsignificant 6li detections from 9 to 4 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3sigma criterion). in view of this result the existence of a 6li plateau appearsquestionable. a careful reanalysis of individual objects by fitting theobserved lithium 6707 a doublet both with 3d nlte and 1d lte synthetic lineprofiles confirms that the inferred 6li abundance is systematically lower whenusing 3d nlte instead of 1d lte line fitting. nevertheless, halo stars withunquestionable 6li detection do exist even if analyzed in 3d-nlte, the mostprominent example being hd 84937.

1002.2628	the solar photospheric abundance of carbon.analysis of atomic carbon  lines with the co5bold solar model	the use of hydrodynamical simulations, the selection of atomic data, and thecomputation of deviations from local thermodynamical equilibrium for theanalysis of the solar spectra have implied a downward revision of the solarmetallicity. we are in the process of using the latest simulations computedwith the co5bold code to reassess the solar chemical composition. we determinethe solar photospheric carbon abundance by using a radiation-hydrodynamicalco5bold model, and compute the departures from local thermodynamicalequilibrium by using the kiel code. we measure equivalent widths of atomic cilines on high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio solar atlases. deviationsfrom local thermodynamic equilibrium are computed in 1d with the kiel code. ourrecommended value for the solar carbon abundance, relies on 98 independentmeasurements of observed lines and is a(c)=8.50+-0.06, the quoted error is thesum of statistical and systematic error. combined with our recent results forthe solar oxygen and nitrogen abundances this implies a solar metallicity ofz=0.0154 and z/x=0.0211. our analysis implies a solar carbon abundance which isabout 0.1 dex higher than what was found in previous analysis based ondifferent 3d hydrodynamical computations. the difference is partly driven byour equivalent width measurements (we measure, on average, larger equivalentwidths with respect to the other work based on a 3d model), in part it islikely due to the different properties of the hydrodynamical simulations andthe spectrum synthesis code. the solar metallicity we obtain from the co5boldanalyses is in slightly better agreement with the constraints ofhelioseismology than the previous 3d abundance results.

0708.4292	the evolution of planetary nebulae iv. on the physics of the luminosity  function	the nebular evolution is followed from the vicinity of the asymptotic-giantbranch across the hertzsprung-russell diagram until the white-dwarf domain isreached, using various central-star models coupled to different initialenvelope configurations. along each sequence the relevant line emissions of thenebulae are computed and analysed. maximum line luminosities in hbeta and[oiii] 5007a are achieved at stellar effective temperatures of about 65000k and95000-100000k, respectively, provided the nebula remains optically thick forionising photons. in the optically thin case, the maximum line emission occursat or shortly after the thick/thin transition. our models suggest that mostplanetary nebulae with hotter (&gt;~ 45000k) central stars are optically thin inthe lyman continuum, and that their [oiii] 5007a emission fails to explain thebright end of the observed planetary nebulae luminosity function. however,sequences with central stars of &gt;~ 0.6 msun and rather dense initial envelopesremain virtually optically thick and are able to populate the bright end of theluminosity function. individual luminosity functions depend strongly on thecentral-star mass and on the variation of the nebular optical depth with time.hydrodynamical simulations of planetary nebulae are essential for anyunderstanding of the basic physics behind their observed luminosity function.in particular, our models do not support the claim of marigo et.al (2004)according to which the maximum 5007a luminosity occurs during the recombinationphase well beyond 100 000k when the stellar luminosity declines and the nebularmodels become, at least partially, optically thick. consequently, there is noneed to invoke relatively massive central stars of, say &gt; 0.7 msun, to accountfor the bright end of the luminosity function.

1202.4463	rebirth of x-ray emission from the born-again planetary nebula a 30	the planetary nebula (pn) a30 is believed to have undergone a very latethermal pulse resulting in the ejection of knots of hydrogen-poor material.using hst images we have detected the angular expansion of these knots andderived an age of 850+280-150 yr. to investigate the spectral and spatialproperties of the soft x-ray emission detected by rosat, we have obtainedchandra and xmm-newton observations of a30. the x-ray emission from a30 can beseparated into two components: a point-source at the central star and diffuseemission associated with the hydrogen-poor knots and the cloverleaf structureinside the nebular shell. to help us assess the role of the current stellarwind in powering this x-ray emission, we have determined the stellar parametersof the central star of a 30 using a non-lte model fit to its optical and uvspectrum. the spatial distribution and spectral properties of the diffuse x-rayemission is suggestive that it is generated by the post-born-again and presentfast stellar winds interacting with the hydrogen-poor ejecta of the born-againevent. this emission can be attributed to shock-heated plasma, as thehydrogen-poor knots are ablated by the stellar winds, under which circumstancesthe efficient mass-loading of the present fast stellar wind raises its densityand damps its velocity to produce the observed diffuse soft x-rays. chargetransfer reactions between the ions of the stellar winds and material of theborn-again ejecta has also been considered as a possible mechanism for theproduction of diffuse x-ray emission, and upper limits on the expected x-rayproduction by this mechanism have been derived. the origin of the x-rayemission from the central star of a 30 is puzzling: shocks in the present faststellar wind and photospheric emission can be ruled out, while the developmentof a new, compact hot bubble confining the fast stellar wind seems implausible.

1206.2239	6li detection in metal-poor stars: can 3d model atmospheres solve the  second lithium problem?	the presence of 6li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars is usuallyinferred from the detection of a subtle extra depression in the red wing of the7li doublet line at 670.8 nm. however, the intrinsic line asymmetry caused byconvective flows in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishablefrom the asymmetry produced by a weak 6li blend on a (presumed) symmetric 7liprofile. previous determinations of the 6li/ 7li isotopic ratio based on 1dmodel atmospheres, ignoring the convection-induced line asymmetry, musttherefore be considered as upper limits. by comparing synthetic 1d lte and 3dnon-lte line profiles of the li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differentialeffect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6li abundance as afunction of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. as expected, wefind that the asymmetry effect systematically reduces the resulting 6li/7liratios. depending on the stellar parameters, the 3d-1d offset in 6li/7li rangesbetween -0.005 and -0.020. when this purely theoretical correction is takeninto account for the asplund 2006 sample of stars, the number of significant6li detections decreases from 9 to 5 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3sigma criterion).  we also present preliminary results of a re-analysis of high-resolution, highs/n spectra of individual metal-poor turn-off stars, to see whether the "secondlithium problem" actually disappears when accounting properly for convectionand non-lte line formation in 3d stellar atmospheres. out of 8 stars, hd84937seems to be the only significant (2 sigma) detection of 6li. in view of ourresults, the existence of a 6li plateau appears questionable.

1211.7313	three-dimensional hydrodynamical co5bold model atmospheres of red giant  stars ii. spectral line formation in the atmosphere of a giant located near  the rgb tip	we investigate the role of convection in the formation of atomic andmolecular lines in the atmosphere of a red giant star. for this purpose westudy the formation properties of spectral lines that belong to a number ofastrophysically important tracer elements, including neutral and singly ionizedatoms, and molecules. we focus our investigation on a prototypical red giantlocated close to the red giant branch (rgb) tip (teff=3660k, logg=1.0,[m/h]=0.0). we used two types of model atmospheres, 3d hydrodynamical andclassical 1d, calculated with the co5bold and lhd stellar atmosphere codes,respectively. both codes share the same atmospheric parameters, chemicalcomposition, equation of state, and opacities, which allowed us to make astrictly differential comparison between the line formation propertiespredicted in 3d and 1d. the influence of convection on the spectral lineformation was assessed with the aid of 3d-1d abundance corrections, whichmeasure the difference between the abundances of chemical species derived withthe 3d hydrodynamical and 1d classical model atmospheres. we find thatconvection plays a significant role in the spectral line formation in thisparticular red giant. the derived 3d-1d abundance corrections rarely exceed\pm0.1 dex when lines of neutral atoms and molecules are considered, which isin line with the previous findings for solar-metallicity red giants located onthe lower rgb. the situation is different with lines that belong to ionizedatoms, or to neutral atoms with high ionization potential. in both cases, thecorrections for high-excitation lines (\chi&gt;8 ev) may amount to \delta_3d-1d ~-0.4 dex. the 3d--1d abundance corrections generally show a significantwavelength dependence; in most cases they are smaller in the near-infrared, at1600-2500 nm.

1302.3886	diffuse x-ray emission from planetary nebulae with nebular o vi	the presence of o vi ions can be indicative of plasma temperatures of a fewtimes 10^5 k that is expected in heat conduction layers between the hot shockedstellar wind gas at several 10^6 k and the cooler (~10,000 k) nebular gas ofplanetary nebulae (pne). we have used fuse observations of pne to search fornebular o vi emission or absorption as a diagnostic of conduction layer toensure the presence of hot interior gas. three pne showing nebular o vi, namelyic 418, ngc 2392, and ngc 6826, have been selected for chandra observations anddiffuse x-ray emission is indeed detected in each of these pne. among thethree, ngc 2392 has peculiarly high diffuse x-ray luminosity and plasmatemperature compared with those expected from its stellar wind's mechanicalluminosity and terminal velocity. the limited effects of heat conduction on theplasma temperature of a hot bubble at the low terminal velocity of the stellarwind of ngc 2392 may partially account for its high plasma temperature, but thehigh x-ray luminosity needs to be powered by processes other than the observedstellar wind, probably caused by the presence of an unseen binary companion ofthe cspn of ngc 2392. we have compiled relevant information on the x-ray,stellar, and nebular properties of pne with a bubble morphology and found thatthe expectations of bubble models including heat conduction compare favorablywith the present x-ray observations of hot bubbles around h-rich cspne, buthave notable discrepancies for those around h-poor [wr] cspne. we note that pnewith more massive central stars can produce hotter plasma and higher x-raysurface brightness inside central hot bubbles.

1305.3441	the influence of convection on the atmospheric structures and observable  properties of red giant stars	during the recent years significant progress has been made in the modeling ofred giant atmospheres with the aid of 3d hydrodynamical model atmosphere codes.in this contribution we provide an overview of selected results obtained inthis context by utilizing 3d hydrodynamical co5bold stellar model atmospheres.hydrodynamical simulations show that convective motions lead to significantdifferences in the atmospheric structures of red giants with respect to thosepredicted by the classical 1d model atmospheres. results of these simulationsalso show that in certain cases 1d models fail to reproduce even the averageproperties of the 3d hydrodynamical models, such as p-t profiles. largehorizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3d model atmospheres, as well asdifferences between the temperature profiles of the average &lt;3d&gt; and 1d models,lead to large discrepancies in the strengths of spectral lines predicted by the3d and 1d model atmospheres. this is especially important in models at lowestmetallicities ([m/h]&lt;-2.0) where the 3d-1d abundance differences may reach (oreven exceed) -0.6 dex for lines of neutral atoms and molecules. we also discussseveral simplifications and numerical aspects involved in the present 3dhydrodynamical modeling of red giant atmospheres, and briefly address severalissues where urgent progress may be needed.

1305.6033	evaluating local correlation tracking using co5bold simulations of solar  granulation	flows on the solar surface are linked to solar activity, and lct is one ofthe standard techniques for capturing the dynamics of these processes bycross-correlating solar images. however, the link between contrast variationsin successive images to the underlying plasma motions has to be quantitativelyconfirmed. radiation hydrodynamics simulations of solar granulation(e.g.,co5bold) provide access to both the wavelength-integrated, emergentcontinuum intensity and the 3d velocity field at various heights in the solaratmosphere. thus, applying lct to continuum images yields horizontal propermotions, which are then compared to the velocity field of the simulated(non-magnetic) granulation. in this study, we evaluate the performance of anlct algorithm previously developed for bulk-processing hinode g-band images,establish it as a quantitative tool for measuring horizontal proper motions,and clearly work out the limitations of lct or similar techniques designed totrack optical flows. horizontal flow maps and frequency distributions of theflow speed were computed for a variety of lct input parameters including thespatial resolution, the width of the sampling window, the time cadence ofsuccessive images, and the averaging time used to determine persistent flowproperties. smoothed velocity fields from the hydrodynamics simulation at threeatmospheric layers (log tau=-1,0,and +1) served as a point of reference for thelct results. lct recovers many of the granulation properties, e.g.,the shape ofthe flow speed distributions, the relationship between mean flow speed andaveraging time, and also--with significant smoothing of the simulated velocityfield--morphological features of the flow and divergence maps. however, thehorizontal proper motions are grossly underestimated by as much as a factor ofthree. the lct flows match best the flows deeper in the atmosphere at logtau=+1.

1307.6189	the evolution of planetary nebulae. viii. true expansion rates and  visibility times	the visibility time of planetary nebulae (pne) in stellar systems is anessential quantity for estimating the size of a pn population in the context ofgeneral population studies. for instance, it enters directly into the pn deathrate determination. the basic ingredient for determining visibility times isthe typical nebular expansion velocity, as a suited average over all pn sizesof a pn population within a certain volume or stellar system. the trueexpansion speed of the outer nebular edge of a pn is, however, not accessibleby spectroscopy -- a difficulty that we surmount by radiation-hydrodynamicsmodelling. we find a mean true expansion velocity of 42 km/s, i.e. nearly twiceas high as the commonly adopted value to date. accordingly, the time for a pnto expand to a radius of, say 0.9 pc, is only 21000 +/- 5000 years. thisvisibility time of a pn holds for all central star masses since a nebula doesnot become extinct as the central star fades. there is, however, a dependenceon metallicity in the sense that the visibility time becomes shorter for lowernebular metal content. with the higher expansion rate of pne derived here wedetermined their local death-rate density as (1.4 +/- 0.5) x e-12 pn pc^{-3}yr^{-1}, using the local pn density advocated by frew (2008).

1310.6058	isotope spectroscopy	the measurement of isotopic ratios provides a privileged insight both intonucleosynthesis and into the mechanisms operating in stellar envelopes, such asgravitational settling. in this article, we give a few examples of how isotopicratios can be determined from high-resolution, high-quality stellar spectra. weconsider examples of the lightest elements, h and he, for which the isotopicshifts are very large and easily measurable, and examples of heavier elementsfor which the determination of isotopic ratios is more difficult. the presenceof 6li in the stellar atmospheres causes a subtle extra depression in the redwing of the 7li 670.7 nm doublet which can only be detected in spectra of thehighest quality. but even with the best spectra, the derived $^6$li abundancecan only be as good as the synthetic spectra used for their interpretation. itis now known that 3d non-lte modelling of the lithium spectral line profiles isnecessary to account properly for the intrinsic line asymmetry, which isproduced by convective flows in the atmospheres of cool stars, and can mimicthe presence of 6li. we also discuss briefly the case of the carbon isotopicratio in metal-poor stars, and provide a new determination of the nickelisotopic ratios in the solar atmosphere.

1409.3153	oxygen in the early galaxy: oh lines as tracers of oxygen abundance in  extremely metal-poor giant stars	oxygen is a powerful tracer element of galactic chemical evolution.unfortunately, only a few oxygen lines are available in theultraviolet-infrared stellar spectra for the reliable determination of itsabundance. moreover, oxygen abundances obtained using different spectral linesoften disagree significantly. in this contribution we therefore investigatewhether the inadequate treatment of convection in 1d hydrostatic modelatmospheres used in the abundance determinations may be responsible for thisdisagreement. for this purpose, we used vlt crires spectra of three emp giants,as well as 3d hydrodynamical co$^5$bold and 1d hydrostatic lhd modelatmospheres, to investigate the role of convection in the formation of infrared(ir) oh lines. our results show that the presence of convection leads tosignificantly stronger ir oh lines. as a result, the difference in the oxygenabundance determined from ir oh lines with 3d hydrodynamical and classical 1dhydrostatic model atmospheres may reach -0.2 ... -0.3 dex. in case of the threeemp giants studied here, we obtain a good agrement between the 3d lte oxygenabundances determined by us using vibrational-rotational ir oh lines in thespectral range of 1514-1626 nm, and oxygen abundances determined from forbidden[o i] 630 nm line in previous studies.

1410.6419	detecting arbitrary quantum errors via stabilizer measurements on a  sublattice of the surface code	to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer, it is necessary to implement aquantum error correcting code. such codes rely on the ability to extractinformation about the quantum error syndrome while not destroying the quantuminformation encoded in the system. stabilizer codes are attractive solutions tothis problem, as they are analogous to classical linear codes, have simple andeasily computed encoding networks, and allow efficient syndrome extraction. inthese codes, syndrome extraction is performed via multi-qubit stabilizermeasurements, which are bit and phase parity checks up to local operations.previously, stabilizer codes have been realized in nuclei, trapped-ions, andsuperconducting qubits. however these implementations lack the ability toperform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction which continues to be a challengefor all physical quantum computing systems. here we experimentally demonstratea key step towards this problem by using a two-by-two lattice ofsuperconducting qubits to perform syndrome extraction and arbitrary errordetection via simultaneous quantum non-demolition stabilizer measurements. thislattice represents a primitive tile for the surface code, which is a promisingstabilizer code for scalable quantum computing. furthermore, we successfullyshow the preservation of an entangled state in the presence of an arbitraryapplied error through high-fidelity syndrome measurement. our results bolsterthe promise of employing lattices of superconducting qubits for larger-scalefault-tolerant quantum computing.

1412.1789	calibration of the mixing-length theory for convective white dwarf  envelopes	a calibration of the mixing-length parameter in the local mixing-lengththeory (mlt) is presented for the lower part of the convection zone inpure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. the parameterization is performed from acomparison of 3d co5bold simulations with a grid of 1d envelopes with a varyingmixing-length parameter. in many instances, the 3d simulations are restrictedto the upper part of the convection zone. the hydrodynamical calculationssuggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not changesignificantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediatelybelow the photosphere. we rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristicof the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1d envelopes. thecalibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (da) white dwarfs in theeffective temperature range 6000 &lt; teff (k) &lt; 15,000 and the surface gravityrange 7.0 &lt; log g &lt; 9.0. it is established that the local mlt is unable toreproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties ofthe 3d simulations. we therefore propose three different parameterizations forthese quantities. the resulting calibration can be applied to structure andenvelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, andconvective mixing studies. on the other hand, convection has no effect on thewhite dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with thedegenerate core below teff ~ 5000 k. in this regime, the 1d structures areinsensitive to the mlt parameterization and converge to the mean 3d results,hence remain fully appropriate for age determinations.

1412.2793	the chandra planetary nebulae survey (chanplans): iii. x-ray emission  from the central stars of planetary nebulae	we present x-ray spectral analysis of 20 point-like x-ray sources detected inchandra planetary nebula survey (chanplans) observations of 59 planetarynebulae (pne) in the solar neighborhood. most of these 20 detections areassociated with luminous central stars within relatively young, compactnebulae. the vast majority of these point-like x-ray-emitting sources at pncores display relatively "hard" ($\geq0.5$~kev) x-ray emission components thatare unlikely to be due to photospheric emission from the hot central stars(cspn). instead, we demonstrate that these sources are well modeled byoptically-thin thermal plasmas. from the plasma properties, we identify twoclasses of cspn x-ray emission: (1) high-temperature plasmas with x-rayluminosities, $l_{\rm x}$, that appear uncorrelated with the cspn bolometricluminosity, $l_{\rm bol}$; and (2) lower-temperature plasmas with $l_{\rmx}/l_{\rm bol}\sim10^{-7}$. we suggest these two classes correspond to thephysical processes of magnetically active binary companions and self-shockingstellar winds, respectively. in many cases this conclusion is supported bycorroborative multiwavelength evidence for the wind and binary properties ofthe pn central stars. by thus honing in on the origins of x-ray emission frompn central stars, we enhance the ability of cspn x-ray sources to constrainmodels of pn shaping that invoke wind interactions and binarity.

1506.00931	the photospheric solar oxygen project: iii. investigation of the  centre-to-limb variation of the 630nm [oi]-nii blend	the solar photospheric abundance of oxygen is still a matter of debate. forabout ten years some determinations have favoured a low oxygen abundance whichis at variance with the value inferred by helioseismology. among the oxygenabundance indicators, the forbidden line at 630nm has often been considered themost reliable even though it is blended with a nii line. in papers i and paperii of this series we reported a discrepancy in the oxygen abundance derivedfrom the 630nm and the subordinate [oi] line at 636nm in dwarf stars, includingthe sun. here we analyse several, in part new, solar observations of the thecentre-to-limb variation of the spectral region including the blend at 630nm inorder to separate the individual contributions of oxygen and nickel. we analyseintensity spectra observed at different limb angles in comparison with lineformation computations performed on a co5bold 3d hydrodynamical simulation ofthe solar atmosphere. the oxygen abundances obtained from the forbidden line atdifferent limb angles are inconsistent if the commonly adopted nickel abundanceof 6.25 is assumed in our local thermodynamic equilibrium computations. with aslightly lower nickel abundance, a(ni)~6.1, we obtain consistent fitsindicating an oxygen abundance of a(o)=8.73+/-0.05. at this value thediscrepancy with the subordinate oxygen line remains. the derived value of theoxygen abundance supports the notion of a rather low oxygen abundance in thesolar hotosphere. however, it is disconcerting that the forbidden oxygen linesat 630 and 636nm give noticeably different results, and that the nickelabundance derived here from the 630nm blend is lower than expected from othernickel lines.

0705.2304	inter-network regions of the sun at millimetre wavelengths	the continuum intensity at wavelengths around 1 mm provides an excellent wayto probe the solar chromosphere. future high-resolution millimetre arrays, suchas the atacama large millimeter array (alma), will thus produce valuable inputfor the ongoing controversy on the thermal structure and the dynamics of thislayer. synthetic brightness temperature maps are calculated on basis ofthree-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (mhd) simulations. while themillimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, thelonger wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. theeffective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also fromdisk-centre towards the solar limb. the average intensity contributionfunctions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are evendouble-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and coolpost-shock regions in the model chromosphere. taking into account thedeviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strongvariation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. the resultis a narrower formation height range. the average brightness temperatureincreases with wavelength and towards the limb. the relative contrast dependson wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towardsthe limb. the dependence of the brightness temperature distribution onwavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formationheight and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the modelatmospheres.

1507.01927	3d model atmospheres for extremely low-mass white dwarfs	we present an extended grid of mean three-dimensional (3d) spectra forlow-mass, pure-hydrogen atmosphere da white dwarfs (wds). we use co5boldradiation-hydrodynamics 3d simulations covering teff = 6000-11,500 k and logg =5-6.5 (cgs units) to derive analytical functions to convert spectroscopicallydetermined 1d temperatures and surface gravities to 3d atmospheric parameters.along with the previously published 3d models, the 1d to 3d corrections are nowavailable for essentially all known convective da wds (i.e., logg = 5-9). forlow-mass wds, the correction in temperature is relatively small (a few per centat the most), but the surface gravities measured from the 3d models are lowerby as much as 0.35 dex. we revisit the spectroscopic analysis of the extremelylow-mass (elm) wds, and demonstrate that the 3d models largely resolve thediscrepancies seen in the radius and mass measurements for relatively cool elmwds in eclipsing double wd and wd + milli-second pulsar binary systems. we alsouse the 3d corrections to revise the boundaries of the zz ceti instabilitystrip, including the recently found elm pulsators.

1508.03487	the photospheric solar oxygen project: iv. 3d-nlte investigation of the  777 nm triplet lines	the solar photospheric oxygen abundance is still widely debated. adopting thesolar chemical composition based on the "low" oxygen abundance, as determinedwith the use of three-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamical model atmospheres,results in a well-known mismatch between theoretical solar models andhelioseismic measurements that is so far unresolved. we carry out anindependent redetermination of the solar oxygen abundance by investigating thecenter-to-limb variation of the oi ir triplet lines at 777 nm in different setsof spectra with the help of detailed synthetic line profiles based on 3dhydrodynamical co5bold model atmospheres and 3d non-lte line formationcalculations with nltetd. the idea is to simultaneously derive the oxygenabundance,a(o), and the scaling factor sh that describes the cross-sections forinelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen relative the classical drawinformula. the best fit of the center-to-limb variation of the triplet linesachieved with the co5bold 3d solar model is clearly of superior qualitycompared to the line profile fits obtained with standard 1d model atmospheres.our best estimate of the 3d non-lte solar oxygen abundance is a(o) = 8.76 +/-0.02, with the scaling factor sh in the range between 1.2 and 1.8. all 1dnon-lte models give much lower oxygen abundances, by up to -0.15 dex. this ismainly a consequence of the assumption of a $\mu$-independent microturbulence.

1509.05398	on the evolution of magnetic white dwarfs	we present the first radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of theatmosphere of white dwarf stars. we demonstrate that convective energy transferis seriously impeded by magnetic fields when the plasma-beta parameter, thethermal to magnetic pressure ratio, becomes smaller than unity. the criticalfield strength that inhibits convection in the photosphere of white dwarfs isin the range b = 1-50 kg, which is much smaller than the typical 1-1000 mgfield strengths observed in magnetic white dwarfs, implying that these objectshave radiative atmospheres. we have then employed evolutionary models to studythe cooling process of high-field magnetic white dwarfs, where convection isentirely suppressed during the full evolution (b &gt; 10 mg). we find that theinhibition of convection has no effect on cooling rates until the effectivetemperature (teff) reaches a value of around 5500 k. in this regime, thestandard convective sequences start to deviate from the ones without convectionowing to the convective coupling between the outer layers and the degeneratereservoir of thermal energy. since no magnetic white dwarfs are currently knownat the low temperatures where this coupling significantly changes theevolution, effects of magnetism on cooling rates are not expected to beobserved. this result contrasts with a recent suggestion that magnetic whitedwarfs with teff &lt; 10,000 k cool significantly slower than non-magneticdegenerates.

1512.08999	lithium spectral line formation in stellar atmospheres. the impact of  convection and nlte effects	different simplified approaches are used to account for the non-localthermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) effects with 3d hydrodynamical modelatmospheres. in certain cases, chemical abundances are derived in 1d nlte andcorrected for the 3d effects by adding 3d-1d lte abundance corrections (3d+nlteapproach). alternatively, average &lt;3d&gt; model atmospheres are sometimes used tosubstitute for the full 3d hydrodynamical models.  we tested whether the results obtained using these simplified schemes (i.e.,3d+nlte, &lt;3d&gt; nlte) may reproduce those derived using the full 3d nltecomputations. the tests were made using 3d hydrodynamical co5bold modelatmospheres of the main sequence (ms), main sequence turn-off (to), subgiant(sgb), and red giant branch (rgb) stars, all at [m/h]=0.0 and -2.0. our goalwas to investigate the role of 3d and nlte effects on the formation of the670.8 nm lithium line by assessing strengths of synthetic 670.8 nm lineprofiles, computed using 3d/1d nlte/lte approaches.  our results show that li 670.8 nm line strengths obtained using differentmethodologies differ only slightly in most of the models at solar metallicity.however, the line strengths predicted with the 3d nlte and 3d+nlte approachesbecome significantly different at subsolar metallicities. at [m/h]=-2.0, thismay lead to (3d nlte)-(3d+nlte) differences in the predicted lithium abundanceof ~0.46 and ~0.31 dex in the to and rgb stars, respectively. on the otherhand, nlte line strengths computed with the average &lt;3d&gt; and 1d modelatmospheres are similar to those obtained with the full 3d nlte approach forms, to, sgb, and rgb stars, at all metallicities; 3d-&lt;3d&gt; and 3d-1d differencesin the predicted abundances are always less than ~0.04 dex and ~0.08 dex,respectively. however, neither of the simplified approaches can reliablysubstitute 3d nlte spectral synthesis when precision is required.

0807.3290	the evolution of planetary nebulae. v. the diffuse x-ray emission	observations with space-borne x-ray telescopes revealed the existence ofsoft, diffuse x-ray emission from the inner regions of planetary nebulae.although the existing images support the idea that this emission arises fromthe hot shocked central-star wind which fills the inner cavity of a planetarynebula, existing models have difficulties to explain the observationsconsistently. we investigate how the inclusion of thermal conduction changesthe physical parameters of the hot shocked wind gas and the amount of x-rayemission predicted by time-dependent hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulaewith central stars of normal, hydrogen-rich surface composition. the radiationhydrodynamical models show that heat conduction leads to lower temperatures andhigher densities within a bubble and brings the physical properties of thex-ray emitting domain into close agreement with the values derived fromobservations. depending on the central-star mass and the evolutionary phase,our models predict x-ray [0.45--2.5 kev] luminosities between $10^{-8}$ and$10^{-4}$ of the stellar bolometric luminosities, in good agreement with theobservations. less than 1% of the wind power is radiated away in this x-rayband. although temperature, density, and also the mass of the hot bubble issignificantly altered by heat conduction, the dynamics of the whole systemremains practically the same. heat conduction allows the construction ofnebular models which predict the correct amount of x-ray emission and at thesame time are fully consistent with the observed mass-loss rate and wind speed.thermal conduction must be considered as a viable physical process forexplaining the diffuse x-ray emission from planetary nebulae with closed innercavities. magnetic fields must then be absent or extremely weak.

astro-ph;0612197	carbon monoxide in the solar atmosphere ii. radiative cooling by co  lines	the role of carbon monoxide as a cooling agent for the thermal structure ofthe mid-photospheric to low-chromospheric layers of the solar atmosphere ininternetwork regions is investigated. the treatment of radiative cooling viaspectral lines of carbon monoxide (co) has been added to the radiationchemo-hydrodynamics code co5bold. [...] the co opacity indeed causes additionalcooling at the fronts of propagating shock waves in the chromosphere. there,the time-dependent approach results in a higher co number density compared tothe equilibrium case and hence in a larger net radiative cooling rate. theaverage gas temperature stratification of the model atmosphere, however, isonly reduced by roughly 100 k. also the temperature fluctuations and the conumber density are only affected to small extent. a numerical experimentwithout dynamics shows that the co cooling process works in principle anddrives the atmosphere to a cool radiative equilibrium state. at chromosphericheights, the radiative relaxation of the atmosphere to a cool state takesseveral 1000 s. the co cooling process thus would seem to be too slow comparedto atmospheric dynamics to be responsible for the very cool temperature regionsobserved in the solar atmosphere. the hydrodynamical timescales in our solaratmosphere model are much too short to allow for the radiative relaxation to acool state, thus suppressing the potential thermal instability due to carbonmonoxide as a cooling agent. apparently, the thermal structure and dynamics ofthe outer model atmosphere are instead determined primarily by shock waves.
