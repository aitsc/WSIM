0901.0711	the formation rates of population iii stars and chemical enrichment of  halos during the reionization era	[abridged] the first stars in the universe form out of pristine primordialgas clouds that have been radiatively cooled to a few hundreds of degreeskelvin either via molecular or atomic (lyman-alpha) hydrogen lines. thisprimordial mode of star formation is eventually quenched once radiative and/orchemical (metal enrichment) feedbacks mark the transition to population iistars. in this paper we present a model for the formation rate of populationiii stars based on press-schechter modeling coupled with analytical recipes forgas cooling and radiative feedback. our model also includes a novel treatmentfor metal pollution based on self-enrichment due to a previous episode ofpopulation iii star formation in progenitor halos. with this model we derivethe star formation history of population iii stars, their contribution to there-ionization of the universe and the time of the transition from populationiii star formation in minihalos to that in more massive halos where atomichydrogen cooling is also possible. we consider a grid of models highlightingthe impact of varying the values for the free parameters used, such as starformation and feedback efficiency. the most critical factor is the assumptionthat only one population iii star is formed in a halo. in this scenario, metalfree stars contribute only to a minor fraction of the total number of photonsrequired to re-ionize the universe. in addition, metal free star formation isprimarily located in minihalos and chemically enriched halos become thedominant locus of star formation very early in the life of the universe, atredshift z~25. if instead multiple metal free stars are allowed to form out ofa single halo, then there is an overall boost of population iii star formation,with a consequent significant contribution to the re-ionizing radiation budget.

0706.2653	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: i. the faint-end slope of the  lyman-break galaxy population at z~5	we present the udf05 project, a hst large program of deep acs (f606w, f775w,f850lp) and nicmos (f110w, f160w) imaging of three fields, two of whichcoincide with the nicp1-4 nicmos parallel observations of the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf). in this first paper we use the acs data for the nicp12 field, aswell as the original hudf acs data, to measure the uv luminosity function (lf)of z~5 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) down to very faint levels. specifically,based on a v-i, i-z selection criterion, we identify a sample of 101 and 133candidate z~5 galaxies down to z_{850}=28.5 and 29.25 magnitudes in the nicp12and in the hudf fields, respectively. using an extensive set of monte carlosimulations we derive corrections for observational biases and selectioneffects, and construct the rest-frame 1400 a lbg lf over the rangem_{1400}=[-21.4, -17.1], i.e. down to ~0.04 l* at z~5, and complement it withdata from the subaru deep field (sdf) from yoshida et al. (2006) to extend itto the brighter end (m_{1400}&gt;-22.2). we show that: (i) different assumptionsregarding the sed distribution of the lbg population, dust properties andintergalactic absorption result in a 25% variation in the number density oflbgs at z~5; (ii) under consistent assumptions for dust properties andintergalactic absorption, the hudf is about 30% under-dense in z~5 lbgsrelative to the nicp12 field, a variation which is well explained by cosmicvariance; (iii) the faint-end slope of the lf is independent of the specificassumptions for the input physical parameters, and has a value of alpha ~ -1.6,similar to the faint-end slope of the lf that has been measured for lbgs at z~3and z~6.

0909.1803	discovery of z~8 galaxies in the hudf from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  observations	we utilize the newly-acquired, ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations over the hudfto search for star-forming galaxies at z~8-8.5, only 600 million years fromrecombination, using a y_{105}-dropout selection. the new 4.7 arcmin**2 wfc3/irobservations reach to ~28.8 ab mag (5 sigma) in the y_{105}j_{125}h_{160}bands. these remarkable data reach ~1.5 ab mag deeper than the previous dataover the hudf, and now are an excellent match to the hudf optical acs data. forour search criteria, we use a two-color lyman-break selection technique toidentify z~8-8.5 y_{105}-dropouts. we find 5 likely z~8-8.5 candidates. thesources have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~28.3 ab mag and very blue uv-continuumslopes, with a median estimated beta of &lt;~-2.5 (where f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{\beta}). this suggests that z~8 galaxies are not only essentially dustfree but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. the observednumber of y_{105}-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20+/-6 sourcesexpected assuming no evolution from z~6, but is consistent with the 5 expectedextrapolating the bouwens et al. 2008 lf results to z~8. these results provideevidence that the evolution in the lf seen from z~7 to z~3 continues to z~8.the remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of wfc3/ir has enabled hst tocross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~8-9.

0909.5183	structure and morphologies of z~7-8 galaxies from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  imaging of the hudf	we present a first morphological study of z~7-8 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)from oesch et al. 2009 and bouwens et al. 2009 detected in ultra-deepnear-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) by the hudf09program. with an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies arefound to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness ofmu_j ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7galaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. by comparison tolower redshift lbgs it is found that only little size evolution takes placefrom z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in theirapparent profiles. the average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 forgalaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52for (0.12-0.3)l*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comovingsizes. the peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.however, a tail of larger galaxies (&gt;~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towardslater cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhancedaccretion of cold gas. additionally, the average star-formation surface densityof lbgs with luminosities (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} is nearly constant at sigma_{sfr}=1.9msun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similarstar-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. the above evolutionarytrends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possiblyincomplete.

0910.0001	very blue uv-continuum slopes of low luminosity z~7 galaxies from  wfc3/ir: evidence for extremely low metallicities?	we use the ultra-deep wfc3/ir data over the hudf and the early releasescience wfc3/ir data over the cdf-south goods field to quantify the broadbandspectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. we determine theuv-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxiesat later times to measure the evolution in beta. for luminous l*(z=3) galaxies,we measure a mean uv-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable tothe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. however, for the lowerluminosity 0.1l*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. this issubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just800 myr later, and even at z~5-6. in principle, the observed beta of -3.0 canbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebularemission is included the expected beta becomes &gt;~-2.7. to produce these veryblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms toreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. for example, a largeescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}&gt;~0.3) could minimize the contribution from thisred nebular emission. if this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7galaxies is &gt;~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

0910.0838	ultradeep infrared array camera observations of sub-l* z~7 and z~8  galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field: the contribution of low-luminosity  galaxies to the stellar mass density and reionization	we study the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) mid-infrared (rest-frameoptical) fluxes of 14 newly wfc3/ir-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5z=8 y_{105}-dropout galaxies. the wfc3/ir depth and spatial resolution allowaccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable fluxmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. none of the galaxies are detected to[3.6]=26.9 (ab, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detectionfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the y_{105}-dropouts. weconstruct average broadband seds using the stacked acs, wfc3, and irac fluxesand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellarmasses, and ages. for the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},(u-v)_{rest}=0.4, reddening a_v=0, stellar mass m*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9m_sun (salpeter imf). the best-fit ages ~300myr, m/l_v=0.2, andssfr=1.7gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. the sub-l* galaxiesobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and underfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustainedreionization at 7&lt;z&lt;11. in contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} y_{105}-dropoutshave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-completereliance on far-uv data. adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the m/l(z=8), thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab} &lt; -18 declines fromrho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 m_sun mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) &lt; 8 x 10^5 m_sunmpc^{-3}, following (1+z)^{-6} over 3&lt;z&lt;8. lower masses at z=8 would signifymore dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper iracobservations, long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope.

0911.1356	star formation rates and stellar masses of z=7-8 galaxies from irac  observations of the wfc3/ir ers and the hudf field	we investigate the spitzer/irac properties of 36 z~7 z-dropout galaxies and 3z~8 y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area wfc3/ir data of the earlyrelease science, the ultradeep hudf09, and wide-area nicmos data. we fitstellar population synthesis models to the seds to derive mean redshifts,stellar masses, and ages. the z~7 galaxies are best characterized bysubstantial ages (&gt;100 myr) and m/l_v~0.2. the main trend with decreasingluminosity is that of bluing of the far-uv slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.this can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowestluminosity galaxies (0.1 l*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth sfhs failto match the blue far-uv and moderately red h-[3.6] color. such colors mayrequire episodic sfhs with short periods of activity and quiescence ("on-off"cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. the stellar mass of oursample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with sfr according to log m* =8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log sfr, implying star formation may havecommenced at z&gt;10. no galaxies are found with sfrs much higher or lower thanthe past averaged sfr suggesting that the typical star formation timescales areprobably a substantial fraction of the hubble time. we report the first iracdetection of y-dropout galaxies at z~8. the average rest-frame u-v=0.3 (ab) ofthe 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar m/l. thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 is rho*(z=8) = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-1.0} x 10^6m_sun mpc^-3, following log rho*(z)= 10.6(+-0.6) - 4.4(+-0.7) log(1+z) [m_sunmpc^-3] over 3&lt;z&lt; 8.

0911.3368	the clustering properties of the first galaxies	we study the clustering properties of the first galaxies formed in theuniverse. we find that, due to chemical enrichment of the inter-stellar mediumby isolated population iii stars formed in mini-halos at redshift z&gt;30, the(chronologically) first galaxies are composed of metal-poor population ii starsand are highly clustered on small scales. in contrast, chemically pristinegalaxies in halos with mass m~10^8 m_sun may form at z&lt;20 in relativelyunderdense regions of the universe. this occurs once self-enrichment bypopulation iii in mini-halos is quenched by the build-up of an $h_2$photo-dissociating radiative background in the lyman-werner bands. we find thatthese chemically pristine galaxies are spatially uncorrelated. thus, we expectthat deep fields with the james webb space telescope may detect clusters ofchemically enriched galaxies but individual chemically pristine objects. wepredict that metal-free galaxies at 10 &lt;= z &lt;= 15$ have surface densities ofabout 80 per square arcmin and per unit redshift but most of them will be toofaint even for jwst. however, the predicted density makes these objectsinteresting targets for searches behind lensing clusters.

0912.4263	a candidate redshift z ~ 10 galaxy and rapid changes in that population  at an age of 500 myr	searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded alarge sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years(myr) after the big bang (redshifts 6 &gt; z &gt; 3; ref. 1). the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10,11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. observations ofz ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z &gt; 9-10. here we usethe full two-year hudf09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 myr after the bigbang. not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we showthat, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is muchsmaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 myr later at z ~ 8. thisdemonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased inboth luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. the 100-200myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliestgalaxies.

1004.0384	the galaxy luminosity function during the reionization epoch	the new wide field camera 3/ir observations on the hubble ultra-deep fieldstarted investigating the properties of galaxies during the reionization epoch.to interpret these observations, we present a novel approach inspired by theconditional luminosity function method. we calibrate our model to observationsat z=6 and assume a non-evolving galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation.we first compare model predictions against the luminosity function measured atz=5 and z=4. we then predict the luminosity function at z&gt;=7 under the soleassumption of evolution in the underlying dark-matter halo mass function. ourmodel is consistent with the observed z&gt;6.5 galaxy number counts in the hudfsurvey and suggests a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of theluminosity function: alpha(z&gt;8)&lt; -1.9 compared to alpha=-1.74 at z=6. althoughwe currently see only the brightest galaxies, a hidden population of lowerluminosity objects (l/l_{*}&gt; 10^{-4}) might provide &gt;75% of the totalreionizing flux. assuming escape fraction f_{esc}~0.2, clumping factor c~5, topheavy-imf and low metallicity, galaxies below the detection limit producecomplete reionization at z&gt;8. for solar metallicity and normal stellar imf,reionization finishes at z&gt;6, but a smaller c/f_{esc} is required for anoptical depth consistent with the wmap measurement. our model highlights thatthe star formation rate in sub-l_* galaxies has a quasi-linear relation todark-matter halo mass, suggesting that radiative and mechanical feedback wereless effective at z&gt;6 than today.

1005.1661	the evolution of the uv luminosity function from z ~ 0.75 to z ~ 2.5  using hst ers wfc3/uvis observations	we present uv luminosity functions (lfs) at 1500 angstrom derived from thehst early release science wfc3/uvis data acquired over ~50 arcmin^2 of thegoods-south field. the lfs are determined over the entire redshift rangez=0.75-2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts forlyman break galaxies (lbgs): (1) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshiftsto study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropoutsamples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. thecharacteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistentwith earlier work. however, the other schechter function parameters, thefaint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constantover the range z=0.75-2.5. using these lf determinations we find the uvluminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} fromz~0 to its peak at z~2.5. strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our lfsare all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift lbg studies.since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatterwith alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expectedflattening occurs. despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggestalpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. these new results from such a shallow earlydataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of wfc3/uvis for thethorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift rangez~0.5 to z~3.

1006.4360	uv luminosity functions from 132 z~7 and z~8 lyman-break galaxies in the  ultra-deep hudf09 and wide-area ers wfc3/ir observations	we identify 73 z~7 and 59 z~8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch,and use this large 26-29.4 ab mag sample of galaxies to derive very deepluminosity functions to &lt;-18 ab mag and the star formation rate density at z~7and z~8. the galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated lyman-breaktechnique on the full two-year wfc3/ir and acs data available over the hudf09(~29.4 ab mag, 5 sigma), two nearby hudf09 fields (~29 ab mag, 14 arcmin) andthe wider area ers (~27.5 ab mag) ~40 arcmin**2). the application of strictoptical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low(just ~7% in the hudf). this very low value includes a full assessment of thecontamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, agn, spurioussources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., sne). from careful modelling ofthe selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosityfunctions for galaxies at z~7 and z~8 to &lt;-18 ab mag. the faint-end slopesalpha at z~7 and z~8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 andalpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. such steep slopes contrast to the localalpha&lt;~-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z~4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05.with such steep slopes (alpha&lt;~-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate thegalaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. the star formationrate densities derived from these new z~7 and z~8 luminosity functions areconsistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). we findreasonable consistency, with the sfr densities implied from reported stellarmass densities, being only ~40% higher at z&lt;7. this suggests that (1) thestellar mass densities inferred from the spitzer irac photometry are reasonablyaccurate and (2) that the imf at very high redshift may not be very differentfrom that at later times.

1011.4075	the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey: design and preliminary  results	we present the first results on the search for very bright (m_ab -21)galaxies at redshift z~8 from the brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg)survey. borg is a hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 pure-parallelsurvey that is obtaining images on random lines of sight at high galacticlatitudes in four filters (f606w, f098m, f125w, f160w), with integration timesoptimized to identify galaxies at z&gt;7.5 as f098m-dropouts. we discuss hereresults from a search area of approximately 130 arcmin^2 over 23 borg fields,complemented by six other pure-parallel wfc3 fields with similar filters. thisnew search area is more than two times wider than previous wfc3 observations atz~8. we identify four f098m-dropout candidates with high statistical confidence(detected at greater than 8sigma confidence in f125w). these sources are amongthe brightest candidates currently known at z~8 and approximately ten timesbrighter than the z=8.56 galaxy udfy-38135539. they thus represent idealtargets for spectroscopic followup observations and could potentially lead to aredshift record, as our color selection includes objects up to z~9. however,the expected contamination rate of our sample is about 30% higher than typicalsearches for dropout galaxies in legacy fields, such as the goods and hudf,where deeper data and additional optical filters are available to rejectcontaminants.

1105.2038	lower-luminosity galaxies could reionize the universe: very steep  faint-end slopes to the uv luminosity functions at z&gt;=5-8 from the hudf09  wfc3/ir observations	the hudf09 data are the deepest near-ir observations ever, reaching to 29.5mag. luminosity functions (lf) from these new hudf09 data for 132 z\sim7 andz\sim8 galaxies are combined with new lfs for z\sim5-6 galaxies and the earlierz\sim4 lf to reach to very faint limits (&lt;0.05 l*(z=3)). the faint-end slopesalpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z\sim5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z\sim6), -2.01+/-0.21(z\sim7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z\sim8). slopes alpha\lesssim-2 lead to formallydivergent uv fluxes, though galaxies are not expected to form below \sim-10 abmag. these results have important implications for reionization. the weightedmean slope at z\sim6-8 is -1.87+/-0.13. for such steep slopes, and a faint-endlimit of -10 ab mag, galaxies provide a very large uv ionizing photon flux.while current results show that galaxies can reionize the universe by z\sim6,matching the thomson optical depths is more challenging. extrapolating thecurrent lf evolution to z&gt;8, taking alpha to be -1.87+/-0.13 (the mean value atz\sim6-8), and adopting typical parameters, we derive thomson optical depths of0.061_{-0.006}^{+0.009}. however, this result will change if the faint-endslope alpha is not constant with redshift. we test this hypothesis and find aweak, though uncertain, trend to steeper slopes at earlier times(dalpha/dz\sim-0.05+/-0.04), that would increase the thomson optical depths to0.079_{-0.017}^{+0.063}, consistent with recent wmap estimates(tau=0.088+/-0.015). it may thus not be necessary to resort to extremeassumptions about the escape fraction or clumping factor. nevertheless, theuncertainties remain large. deeper wfc3/ir+acs observations can furtherconstrain the ionizing flux from galaxies.

1110.0468	overdensities of y-dropout galaxies from the brightest-of-reionizing  galaxies survey: a candidate protocluster at redshift z~8	theoretical and numerical modeling of dark-matter halo assembly predicts thatthe most luminous galaxies at high redshift are surrounded by overdensities offainter companions. we test this prediction with hst observations acquired byour brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) survey, which identified four verybright z~8 candidates as y-dropout sources in four of the 23 non-contiguouswfc3 fields observed. we extend here the search for y-dropouts to fainterluminosities (m_* galaxies with m_ab\sim-20), with detections at &gt;5sigmaconfidence (compared to &gt;8sigma confidence adopted earlier) identifying 17 newcandidates. we demonstrate that there is a correlation between number counts offaint and bright y-dropouts at &gt;99.84% confidence. field borg58, which containsthe best bright z\sim8 candidate (m_ab=-21.3), has the most significantoverdensity of faint y-dropouts. four new sources are located within 70arcsec(corresponding to 3.1 comoving mpc at z=8) from the previously known brighterz\sim8 candidate. the overdensity of y-dropouts in this field has a physicalorigin to high confidence (p&gt;99.975%), independent of completeness andcontamination rate of the y-dropout selection. we modeled the overdensity bymeans of cosmological simulations and estimate that the principal dark matterhalo has mass m_h\sim(4-7)x10^11msun (\sim5sigma density peak) and issurrounded by several m_h\sim10^11msun halos which could host the fainterdropouts. in this scenario, we predict that all halos will eventually mergeinto a m_h&gt;2x10^14msun galaxy cluster by z=0. follow-up observations withground and space based telescopes are required to secure the z\sim8 nature ofthe overdensity, discover new members, and measure their precise redshift.

1201.0016	inferences on the distribution of ly-alpha emission of z~7 and z~8  galaxies	spectroscopic confirmation of galaxies at z~7 and above has been extremelydifficult, owing to a drop in intensity of ly-alpha emission in comparison withsamples at z~6. this crucial finding could potentially signal the ending ofcosmic reionization. however it is based on small datasets, often incompleteand heterogeneous in nature. we introduce a flexible bayesian framework, usefulto interpret such evidence. within this framework, we implement two simplephenomenological models: a smooth one, where the distribution of ly-alpha isattenuated by a factor \es with respect to z~6; a patchy one where a fraction\ep is absorbed/non-emitted while the rest is unabsorbed. from a compilation of39 observed z~7 galaxies we find \es=0.69+-0.12 and \ep=0.66+-0.16. the modelscan be used to compute fractions of emitters above any equivalent width w. forw&gt;25\aa, we find x^{25}_{z=7}=0.37+-0.11 (0.14+-0.06) for galaxies fainter(brighter) than m_{uv}=-20.25 for the patchy model, consistent with previouswork, but with smaller uncertainties by virtue of our full use of the data. atz~8 we combine new deep (5-\sigma flux limit 10^{-17}ergs^{-1}cm^{-2})keck-nirspec observations of a bright y-dropout identified by our borg survey,with those of three objects from the literature and find that the inference isinconclusive. we compute predictions for future near-infrared spectroscopicsurveys and show that it is challenging but feasible to constrain thedistribution of ly-alpha emitters at z~8 and distinguish between models.

1204.3641	the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey: constraints on the bright  end of the z~8 luminosity function	we report the discovery of 33 lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidates at z~8detected in hubble space telescope (hst) wide field camera 3 (wfc3) imaging aspart of the brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) pure-parallel survey. theongoing borg survey currently has the largest area (274 arcmin^2) with y_098(or y_105), j_125, and h_160 band coverage needed to search for z~8 galaxies,about three times the current candels area, and slightly larger than what willbe the final candels wide component with y_105 data. our sample of 33relatively bright y_098-dropout galaxies have j_125 band magnitudes between25.5 and 27.4 mag. this is the largest sample of bright (j_125 &lt;~ 27.4) z~8galaxy candidates presented to date. combining our dataset with the hubbleultra-deep field (hudf09) dataset, we constrain the rest-frame ultravioletgalaxy luminosity function at z~8 over the widest dynamic range currentlyavailable. the combined datasets are well fitted by a schechter function, i.e.\phi(l) = \phi_* (l/l_*)^{\alpha}\ e^{-(l/l_*)}, without evidence for an excessof sources at the bright end. at 68% confidence, we derive \phi_* =(4.3^{+3.5}_{-2.1}) \times 10^{-4} mpc^{-3}, m_* = -20.26^{+0.29}_{-0.34}, anda very steep faint-end slope \alpha = -1.98^{+0.23}_{-0.22}. while the best-fitparameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between \phi_* and m_*,our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of thefaint-end power-law slope at z~8 compared to the best previous determination at+/-0.4. with a future expansion of the borg survey, combined with plannedultradeep wfc3/ir observations, it will be possible to further reduce thisuncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slopecompared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key roleplayed by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.

1209.3037	the spectral energy distributions of z~8 galaxies from the irac ultra  deep fields: emission lines, stellar masses, and specific star formation  rates at 650 myr	using new ultradeep spitzer/irac photometry from the irac ultradeep fieldprogram (iudf), we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 63y-dropout galaxy candidates at z~8, only 650myr after the big bang. the sourcesare selected from hst/acs+wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field (hudf),two hudf parallel fields, and wide area data over the candels/goods-south. thenew spitzer/irac data increase the coverage at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron to~120h over the hudf reaching depths of ~28 (ab,1 sigma). the improved depth andinclusion of brighter candidates result in direct &gt;3 sigma irac detections of20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at &gt; 5 sigma. the average[3.6]-[4.5] colors of irac detected galaxies at z~8 are markedly redder thanthose at z~7, observed only 130myr later. the simplest explanation is that wewitness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular[oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) moving through the irac bandpasses with redshift.assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z~7 and z~8we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of w([oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) = 670(+260,-170) angstrom contributing 0.56 (+0.16,-0.11) mag to the 4.5 micronfilter at z~8. the corresponding w(halpha) = 430 (+160,-110) angstrom impliesan average specific star formation rate of ssfr = 11 (+11,-5) gyr^-1 and astellar population age of 100 (+100,-50) myr. correcting the spectral energydistribution for the contribution of emission lines lowers the average best-fitstellar masses and mass-to-light ratios by x3, decreasing the integratedstellar mass density to rho*(z=8,muv&lt;-18)=0.6 (+0.4,-0.3) x 10^6 msun mpc^-3.

0712.0398	cosmic variance and its effect on the luminosity function determination  in deep high z surveys	we study cosmic variance in deep high redshift surveys and its influence onthe determination of the luminosity function for high redshift galaxies. forseveral survey geometries relevant for hst and jwst instruments, wecharacterize the distribution of the galaxy number counts. this is obtained bymeans of analytic estimates via the two point correlation function in extendedpress-schechter theory as well as by using synthetic catalogs extracted fromn-body cosmological simulations of structure formation. we adopt a simpleluminosity - dark halo mass relation to investigate the environment effects onthe fitting of the luminosity function. we show that in addition to variationsof the normalization of the luminosity function, a steepening of its slope isalso expected in underdense fields, similarly to what is observed within voidsin the local universe. therefore, to avoid introducing artificial biases,caution must be taken when attempting to correct for field underdensity, suchas in the case of hst udf i-dropout sample, which exhibits a deficit of brightcounts with respect to the average counts in goods. a public version of thecosmic variance calculator based on the two point correlation functionintegration is made available on the web.

1301.6162	probing the dawn of galaxies at z~9-12: new constraints from hudf12/xdf  and candels data	we present a comprehensive analysis of z&gt;8 galaxies based on ultra-deepwfc3/ir data. we constrain the evolution of the uv luminosity function (lf) andluminosity densities from z~11 to z~8 by exploiting all the wfc3/ir data overthe hubble ultra-deep field from the hudf09 and the new hudf12 program, inaddition to the hudf09 parallel field data, as well as wider area wfc3/irimaging over goods-south. galaxies are selected based on the lyman breaktechnique in three samples centered around z~9, z~10 and z~11, with seven z~9galaxy candidates, and one each at z~10 and z~11. we confirm a new z~10candidate (with z=9.8+-0.6) that was not convincingly identified in our firstz~10 sample. the deeper data over the hudf confirms all our previous z&gt;~7.5candidates as genuine high-redshift candidates, and extends our samples tohigher redshift and fainter limits (h_160~29.8 mag). we perform one of thefirst estimates of the z~9 uv lf and improve our previous constraints at z~10.extrapolating the lower redshift uv lf evolution should have revealed 17 z~9and 9 z~10 sources, i.e., a factor ~3x and 9x larger than observed. theinferred star-formation rate density (sfrd) in galaxies above 0.7 m_sun/yrdecreases by 0.6+-0.2 dex from z~8 to z~9, in good agreement with previousestimates. the low number of sources found at z&gt;8 is consistent with a veryrapid build-up of galaxies across z~10 to z~8. from a combination of allcurrent measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10x decrease in thesfrd from z~8 to z~10, following (1+z)^(-11.4+-3.1). our measurements thusconfirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z~8, andsignify a rapid build-up of galaxies with m_uv&lt;-17.7 within only ~200 myr fromz~10 to z~8, in the heart of cosmic reionization.

1304.6093	constraining the luminosity function of faint undetected i-dropout  galaxies	we present a new technique to quantify the light contribution coming from thefaint high redshift ($z\sim6$) galaxies below the detection threshold ofimaging data, set conventionally at s/n=4.5. we illustrate the technique withan application to hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys images inthe f775w and f850lp filters of the ultra deep field parallel field nicp12. theaim of this analysis is to extend by a few magnitudes the faint end of theluminosity function at $z\sim6$. after masking all the detected sources in thefield we apply a fast fourier transform to obtain the spatial power spectrum ofthe background signal. the power spectrum permits us to separate the backgroundnoise signal, the residuals due to the data reduction of the wide field, andthe overall signal produced by faint galaxies. the ratio of the signal in thei_775 and z_850 bands is used to estimate the contribution of the fainti-dropout objects. we rely on extensive monte carlo simulations to characterizevarious sources of uncertainty and quantify the number of faint i-dropoutgalaxies in the field. the analysis allows us to put constraints on theluminosity function at $z\sim6$ down to z_850= 30 mag, 2.5 mag fainter thanwith standard techniques on the same data. the data are consistent with a faintend slope of the luminosity function of $\alpha = -1.9$. assuming a specificset of values for the clumping factor, escape fraction, and spectral energydistribution, we find that the $z\sim6$ undetected galaxies down to z_850=30mag could have driven cosmic reionization.

0804.4874	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: ii. constraints on reionization from  z-dropout galaxies	[abridged] we detect three (plus one less certain) z-dropout sources in twoseparate fields of our udf05 hst nicmos images. these z~7 lyman-break galaxy(lbg) candidates allow us to constrain the luminosity function (lf) of the starforming galaxy population at those epochs. by assuming a change in only m* andadopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values atz~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unitredshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a valueof m*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. this implies a steady evolution for the lbg lf out toz~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. thisputs a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whoseensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 myrbefore the epoch at which they are observed. in particular, a large fraction ofstars in the z~6 lbg population must form at redshifts well above z~7.extrapolating this steady evolution of the lf out to higher redshifts, weestimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, providedthat the faint-end slope of the z&gt;7 lf steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faintgalaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute asubstantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. this scenario giveshowever an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigmabelow the wmap-5 measurement. therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either thecurrently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z&gt;7, or thelf evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and acorresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

0807.3352	where can we really find the first stars' remnants today?	a number of recent numerical investigations concluded that the remnants ofrare structures formed at very high redshift, such as the very first stars andbright redshift z~6 qsos, are preferentially located at the center of the mostmassive galaxy clusters at redshift z=0. in this paper we readdress thisquestion using a combination of cosmological simulations of structure formationand extended press-schechter formalism and we show that the typical remnants ofpopulation iii stars are instead more likely to be found in a groupenvironment, that is in dark matter halos of mass ~2x10^{13} h^{-1}m_sun.similarly, the descendants of the brightest z~6 qsos are expected to be inmedium-sized clusters (mass of a few 10^{14} h^{-1}m_sun), rather than in themost massive superclusters (m&gt;10^{15} h^{-1}m_sun) found within the typical 1gpc^3 cosmic volume where a bright z~6 qso lives. the origin of past claimsthat the most massive clusters preferentially host these remnants is rooted inthe numerical method used to initialize their numerical simulations: only asmall region of the cosmological volume of interest was simulated withsufficient resolution to identify low-mass halos at early times, and thisregion was chosen to host the most massive halo in the cosmological volume atlate times. the conclusion that the earliest structures formed in the entirecosmological volume evolve into the most massive halo at late times was thusarrived at by construction. we demonstrate that, to the contrary, the firststructures to form in a cosmological region evolve into relatively typicalobjects at later times. we propose alternative numerical methods for simulatingthe earliest structures in cosmological volumes.

astro-ph;0007252	the fundamental plane of field early-type galaxies at intermediate  redshift	we present preliminary results on the evolution of the stellar populations offield early-type galaxies (e/s0) from z=0.4 to z=0. the diagnostic tool used inthis study is the fundamental plane (fp), a tight empirical correlation betweentheir central velocity dispersion (sigma), effective radius (re), and effectivesurface brightness (sbe), which is observed to hold in the local universe.using hst-wfpc2 archive images and spectra obtained at the eso-3.6m telescopewe measured the fp parameters for a sample of ~30 field e/s0s at z=0.2-0.4.remarkably, field e/s0s at intermediate redshift also define a tight fp, withscatter unchanged with respect to that of local samples. the intermediateredshift fp is offset from the local one, in the sense that, for given re andsigma, galaxies are brighter at z=0.4 than at z=0. the implication of theoffset of the fp in terms of passive evolution of the stellar populationdepends on its star formation history. in a single burst scenario, the stellarpopulations of field e/s0s were formed at z=0.8-1.6 (omega=0.3;omega_{lambda}=0.7; h_0=50 km/s/mpc). alternatively, the bulk of stars (90% inmass) can be formed at high redshift (z~3), and the rest in a secondary burstoccurred more recently (z~0.5-0.8).

astro-ph;0012170	the nuclear cusp slopes of dwarf elliptical galaxies	we derive the light profiles for a sample of 25 dwarf elliptical galaxiesobserved by us with hst/wfpc2 in f555w and f814w. these profiles are fittedwith nuker, r^1/4, exponential, and sersic laws, and are also used to derivethe nuclear cusp slopes gamma. we discuss the correlation of nuclear cusp slopewith galactic luminosity, presence of a nucleus, and type of light profile. theresults are compared to those found in the literature for elliptical galaxiesand the bulges of spiral galaxies. we find that as a class the nuclear regionsof dwarf ellipticals are very similar to those of the exponential bulges ofspiral galaxies, and have nuclear cusp slopes shallower than those of bulgesthat were well fitted by a de vaucouleurs r^1/4 profile with the sameluminosity. for the 14 nucleated galaxies in our sample this conclusion is lesscertain than for the 11 non-nucleated objects since it relies on anextrapolation of galaxy light under the nucleus. in terms of their lightprofiles and nuclear properties, most spheroidal stellar systems can be broadlydivided into two subclasses: the exponential shallow cusp objects and ther^1/4, steep cusp objects. membership of a class does not appear to correlatewith the presence of a massive stellar disk.

astro-ph;0104177	the properties of field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift.  ii: photometry and spectroscopy of an hst selected sample	a sample of field early-type galaxies (e/s0) at intermediate redshift($z\sim0.1-0.6$) is selected, based on morphology and colours from hst-wfpc2parallel images. photometric structural parameters (effective radius$r_{\tx{e}}$ and effective surface brightness $sb_{\tx{e}}$) are derivedthrough the f606w and f814w filters, using luminosity profile fitting andtwo-dimensional fitting techniques. the combined parameter that enters thefundamental plane ($\log r_{\tx{e}}-\beta sb_{\tx{e}}$, with$\beta\approx0.32$) is shown to suffer from significantly smaller uncertainties(r.m.s. 0.03) than the individual structural parameters (e.g. $\sim 15$ percent r.m.s. on the effective radius).  high signal-to-noise intermediate resolution spectra, taken at the eso-3.6m,yield redshifts for 35 galaxies and central velocity dispersions for 22galaxies. central velocity dispersions are derived using a library of stellartemplates covering a wide range of spectral types, in order to study theeffects of templates mismatches. the average random error on the centralvelocity dispersion is found to be 8 per cent and the average systematic errordue to template mismatch is found to be 5 per cent. the errors on velocitydispersion measurement and the effects of template mismatches are studied bymeans of extensive montecarlo simulations. in addition, we investigate whetherthe determination of the velocity dispersion is sensitive to the spectral rangeused, finding that the value of velocity dispersion is unchanged when thespectral regions that include the absorption features ca hk and nad are maskedout during the fit.

astro-ph;0106147	the properties of field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift.  iii: the fundamental plane and the evolution of stellar populations from  z~0.4 to z=0	we report on the study of a sample of 25 field early-type galaxies, in theredshift range z~0.1-0.5, selected on the basis of colours and morphology fromthe hst-mds. field early-type galaxies define a tight fundamental plane (fp)out to z~0.4, with scatter unchanged with respect to local samples, within theobservational errors. the intermediate redshift fp is offset with respect tothe fp of the coma cluster. the offset of the fp is found to increase withredshift. the evolution of the fp is studied quantitatively with abayesian-montecarlo technique. by applying this technique, we find that theoffset of the intercept of the fp (\delta \gamma) with respect to the local fpincreases as \delta \gamma = \tau z with the following 68 per cent limits:0.33&lt;\tau&lt;0.44 (for \omega=1, \omega_{\lambda}=0) or 0.44&lt;\tau&lt;0.56 (for\omega=0.3,\omega_{\lambda}=0.7). in addition, we interpret the results interms of the evolution of the stellar populations, under the assumption ofpassive evolution. in a single-burst scenario, the observed properties areconsistent with those of a stellar population formed at z&gt;2 (for \omega=1,\omega_{\lambda}=0, h_0=50 \kms mpc^{-1}) or 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.6 (for \omega=0.3,\omega_{\lambda}=0.7, h_0=65 \kms mpc^{-1}). if a small fraction of the stellarmass is formed in a secondary burst, the primary burst may have occurred athigher z. finally, the intercept and scatter of the fp found for fieldearly-type galaxies and for cluster data at z~0.4 are mutually consistent,within the observational errors. if higher redshift (up to z=0.83) cluster dataare considered, the ages of the stellar populations of field early-typegalaxies inferred from a single-burst scenario are found to be marginallysmaller than the ages derived for the cluster galaxies.

(2.) the large observed range of the strength of the nuclearstellar cusps seen in the hst optical study of spiral galaxies reflects aphysical difference between galaxies, and is not an artifact caused by nucleardust and/or recent star formation.

astro-ph;0211650	is there really a black hole at the center of ngc 4041? - constraints  from gas kinematics	we present hst/stis spectra of the sbc spiral galaxy ngc 4041 which were usedto map the velocity field of the gas in its nuclear region. we detect thepresence of a compact (r~0.4" ~40 pc), high surface brightness, rotatingnuclear disk co-spatial with a nuclear star cluster. the disk is characterizedby a rotation curve with a peak to peak amplitude of ~40 km/s and issystematically blueshifted by 10 - 20 km/s with respect to the galaxy systemicvelocity. with the standard assumption of constant mass-to-light ratio and withthe nuclear disk inclination taken from the outer disk, we find that a darkpoint mass of 1(-0.7;+0.6) 10^7 msun is needed to reproduce the observedrotation curve. however the observed blueshift suggests the possibility thatthe nuclear disk could be dynamically decoupled. following this line ofreasoning we relax the standard assumptions and find that the kinematical datacan be accounted for by the stellar mass provided that either the centralmass-to-light ratio is increased by a factor of ~2 or that the inclination isallowed to vary. this model results in a 3 sigma upper limit of 6 10^6 msun onthe mass of any nuclear black hole. overall, our analysis only allows us to setan upper limit of 2 10^7 msun on the mass of the nuclear black hole. if thisupper limit is taken in conjunction with an estimated bulge b magnitude of-17.7 and with a central stellar velocity dispersion of 95 km/s, then theseresults are not inconsistent with both the mbh-lsph and the mbh-sigmacorrelations. constraints on black hole masses in spiral galaxies of types aslate as sbc are still very scarce and therefore the present result adds animportant new datapoint to our understanding of black hole demography.

astro-ph;0309835	observable properties of cosmological reionization sources	motivated by recent evidence that the epoch of reionization of hydrogen mayhave ended at a redshift as low as z~6 we consider the detectability of thesources responsible for this reionization. the main idea is that reionizationplaces limits on the mean surface brightness of the population of reionizationsources. reducing the number of model-dependent assumptions to a minimum, wediscuss the observability of these sources with existing and plannedtelescopes. we define a family of models characterized by two parameters: thelyman continuum escape fraction f_c from the sources, and the clumpinessparameter c of the intergalactic medium. the minimum surface brightness modelcorresponds to a value of unity for both parameters. we find that the detectionof the non-ionizing uv continuum of the reionization sources will be difficultto accomplish before the launch of jwst if these sources have a mean surfacebrightness close to the minimum value. however, if the values of f_c and c aremore realistic, the reionization sources may well be detected by hst beforejwst, perhaps by exploiting gravitational lensing amplification by foregroundclusters of galaxies. instead of a detection in the continuum, one may attemptto detect the lyalpha emission line by narrow-band imaging. present lyalphasearches at z&gt;6 suggest that either the typical sources are fainter than dwarfgalaxies, or that the escape fraction of ionizing photons is much higher than50%, so that there are no bright compact hii regions formed around the ionizingsources.

0808.3573	early-type galaxies in the near-infrared: 1.5-2.4\mum spectroscopy	near-infrared (hereafter nir) data may provide complementary information tothe traditional optical population synthesis analysis of unresolved stellarpopulations because the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies in the1-2.5\mum range is dominated by different types of stars than at opticalwavelengths. furthermore, nir data are subjected to less absorption and hencecould constrain the stellar populations in dust-obscured galaxies. we want todevelop observational constraints on the stellar populations of unresolvedstellar systems in the nir. to achieve this goal we need a benchmark sample ofnir spectra of ``simple'' early-type galaxies, to be used for testing andcalibrating the outputs of population synthesis models. we obtainedlow-resolution (r~1000) long-slit spectra between 1.5 and 2.4\mum for 14 nearbyearly-type galaxies using sofi at ntt and higher resolution (r~3000) long-slitspectra, centered at the mgi at ~1.51\mum for a heterogeneous sample of 5nearby galaxies observed with isaac at vlt. we defined spectral indices for co,nai, cai and mgi features and measured the strengths of these features in thesample galaxies. we defined a new global nir metallicity index, suitable forabundance measurements in low-resolution spectra. finally, we present anaverage nir spectrum of an early-type galaxy, built from a homogenized subsetof our sample. the nir spectra of the sample galaxies show great similarity andthe strength of some features does correlate with the iron abundance [fe/h] andoptical metal features of the galaxies. the data suggest that the nir metalfeatures, in combination with a hydrogen absorption feature may be able tobreak the age-metallicity degeneracy just like the mg and fe features in theoptical wavelength range.

astro-ph;9901022	the lyman-alpha forest of the qso in the hubble deep field south	the quasar in the hubble deep field south (hdfs), j2233-606 (z=2.23) has beenexhaustively observed by ground based telescopes and by the stis spectrographon board the hubble space telescope at low, medium and high resolution in thespectral interval from 1120 a to 10000 a. this very large base-line representsa unique opportunity to study in detail the distribution of clouds associatedwith emitting structures in the field of the quasar and in nearby fieldsalready observed as part of the hdfs campaign. here we report the mainproperties of the lyman-alpha clouds in the intermediate redshift range1.20-2.20, where our present knowledge has been complicated by the difficultyin producing good data. the number density is shown to be higher than what isexpected by extrapolating the results from both lower and higher redshifts:63\pm8 lines with log n_{hi}\geq14.0 are found (including metal systems) at&lt;z&gt;=1.7, to be compared with ~40 lines predicted by extrapolating from previousstudies. the redshift distribution of the lyman-alpha clouds shows a regionspanning z=1.383-1.460 (comoving size of 94 h^{-1}_{65} mpc, omega_o=1) with alow density of absorption lines; we detect 5 lines in this region, comparedwith the 16 expected from an average density along the line of sight. the twopoint correlation function shows a positive signal up to scales of about 3h^{-1}_{65} mpc and an amplitude that is larger for larger hi column densities.the average doppler parameter is about 27 km/s, comparable to the mean valuefound at z &gt; 3, thus casting doubts on the temperature evolution of thelyman-alpha clouds.

astro-ph;9904327	the properties of field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift. i:  empirical scaling laws	we present measurements of the fundamental plane (fp) parameters (theeffective radius, the mean effective surface brightness, and the centralvelocity dispersion) of six field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift.the imaging is taken from the medium deep survey of the hubble space telescope,while the kinematical data are obtained from long-slit spectroscopy using the3.6-m eso telescope. the fundamental plane appears well defined in the fieldeven at redshift $\approx$ 0.3. the data show a shift in the fp zero point withrespect to the local relation, possibly indicating modest evolution, consistentwith the result found for intermediate redshift cluster samples. the fp slopesderived for our field data, plus other cluster ellipticals at intermediateredshift taken from the literature, differ from the local ones, but are stillconsistent with the interpretation of the fp as a result of homology, of thevirial theorem and of the existence of a relation between luminosity and mass,$l \propto m^{\eta}$. we also derive the surface brightness vs. effectiveradius relation for nine galaxies with redshift up to $z \approx0.6$, and datafrom the literature; the evolution that can be inferred is consistent with whatis found using the fp.
