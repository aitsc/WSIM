0912.2575	using 21cm absorption in small impact parameter galaxy-qso pairs to  probe low-redshift damped and sub-damped lyman-alpha system	to search for low-redshift damped lyman-alpha (dla) and sub-dla quasarabsorbers, we have conducted a 21cm absorption survey of radio-loud quasars atsmall impact parameters to foreground galaxies selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). here we present the first results from this survey based onobservations of sdss j104257.58+074850.5 ($z_{qso}$ = 2.66521), a quasar at anangular separation from a foreground galaxy ($z_{gal}$ = 0.03321) of 2.5" (1.7kpc in projection). the foreground galaxy is a low-luminosity spiral withon-going star formation (0.004 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$) and ametallicity of $-0.27 \pm 0.05$ dex. we detect 21cm absorption from the galaxywith the green bank telescope (gbt), the very large array (vla), and the verylong baseline array (vlba). the absorption appears to be quiescent disk gascorotating with the galaxy and we do not find any evidence for outflowing coldneutral gas. the width of the main absorption line indicates that the gas iscold, $t_{k} &lt; 283$ k, and the hi column is surprisingly low given the impactparameter of 1.7 kpc; we find that n(hi) $\leq 9.6 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$(gbt) and n(hi) $\leq 1.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (vlba). vlba marginallyresolves the continuum source and the absorber, and a lower limit of 27.1$\times$ 13.9 pc is derived for the size of the absorbing cloud. in turn, thisindicates a low density for a cold cloud, n(hi) $&lt;$ 3.5 cm$^{-3}$. wehypothesize that this galaxy, which is relatively isolated, is becomingdepleted in hi because it is converting its interstellar matter into starswithout a replenishing source of gas, and we suggest future observations toprobe this and similar galaxies.

1007.3637	variable o vi and n v emission from the x-ray binary lmc x-3: heating of  the black hole companion	based on high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with fuse and cos,we present new detections of o vi and n v emission from the black-hole x-raybinary (xrb) system lmc x-3. we also update the ephemeris of the xrb usingrecent radial velocity measurements obtained with the echelle spectrograph onthe magellan-clay telescope. we observe significant velocity variability of theuv emission, and we find that the o vi and n v emission velocities follow theoptical velocity curve of the xrb. moreover, the o vi and n v intensitiesregularly decrease between binary phase = 0.5 and 1.0, which suggests that thesource of the uv emission is increasingly occulted as the b star in the xrbmoves from superior to inferior conjunction. these trends suggest thatillumination of the b-star atmosphere by the intense x-ray emission from theaccreting black hole creates a hot spot on one side of the b star, and this hotspot is the origin of the o vi and n v emission. however, the velocitysemiamplitude of the ultraviolet emission, k_{uv}~180 km/s, is lower than theoptical semiamplitude; this difference could be due to rotation of the b star.if our hypothesis about the origin of the highly ionized emission is correct,then careful analysis of the emission occultation could, in principle,constrain the inclination of the xrb and the mass of the black hole.

1007.3936	a gbt survey for hi 21 cm absorption in the disks and halos of  low-redshift galaxies	we present an hi 21 cm absorption survey with the green bank telescope (gbt)of galaxy-quasar pairs selected by combining data from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimeters(first) survey. our sample consists of 23 sightlines through 15 low-redshiftforeground galaxy - background quasar pairs with impact parameters ranging from1.7 kpc up to 86.7 kpc. we detected one absorber in the gbt survey from theforeground dwarf galaxy, gq1042+0747, at an impact parameter of 1.7 kpc andanother possible absorber in our follow-up very large array (vla) imaging ofthe nearby foreground galaxy, ugc 7408. both of the absorbers are narrow (fwhmof 3.6 and 4.8 km/s), have sub damped lyman alpha column densities, and mostlikely originate in the disk gas of the foreground galaxies. we also detected hi emission from three foreground galaxies, including ugc 7408. although oursample contains both blue and red galaxies, the two h i absorbers as well asthe h i emissions are associated with blue galaxies. we discuss the physicalconditions in the 21 cm absorbers and some drawbacks of the large gbt beam forthis type of survey.

1101.1107	the 21cm "outer arm" and the outer-galaxy high-velocity clouds:  connected by kinematics, metallicity, and distance	using high-resolution ultraviolet spectra obtained with the hst/spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis) and the far ultraviolet spectroscopicexplorer, we study the metallicity, kinematics, and distance of the gaseous"outer arm" (oa) and the high-velocity clouds (hvcs) in the outer galaxy. wedetect the oa in a variety of absorption lines toward two qsos, h1821+643 andhs0624+6907. we search for oa absorption toward eight galactic stars and detectit in one case, which constrains the oa galactocentric radius to 9&lt;r_{g}&lt;18kpc. we also detect hvc complex g, which is projected near the oa at a similarvelocity, in absorption toward two stars; complex g is therefore in the sameregion at r_{g} = 8 - 10 kpc. hvc complex c is known to be at a similargalactocentric radius. toward h1821+643, the low-ionization absorption linesare composed of multiple narrow components, indicating the presence of severalcold clouds and rapid cooling and fragmentation. some of the highly ionized gasis also surprisingly cool. accounting for ionization corrections, we find thatthe oa metallicity is z=0.2-0.5 z_{solar}, but nitrogen is underabundant andsome species are possibly mildly depleted by dust. the similarity of the oametallicity, galactocentric location, and kinematics to those of the adjacentouter-galaxy hvcs, including high velocities that are not consistent withgalactic rotation, suggests that the oa and outer-galaxy hvcs could have acommon origin.

1102.3927	the first observations of low redshift damped lyman-alpha systems with  the cosmic origins spectrograph	we report on the first cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) observations ofdamped and sub-damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems discovered in a new survey ofthe gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies. from observations of 37 sightlines,we have discovered three dlas and four sub-dlas. we measure the neutral gasdensity omega(hi), and redshift density dn/dz, of dla and sub-dla systems atz&lt;0.35. we find dn/dz=0.25 and omega(hi)=1.4x10^-3 for dlas, and dn/dz=0.08with omega(hi)=4.2x10^-5 for sub-dlas over a redshift path delta z=11.9. todemonstrate the scientific potential of such systems, we present a detailedanalysis of the dla at z=0.1140 in the spectrum of sdss j1009+0713. profilefits to the absorption lines determine log n(h i)=20.68pm0.10 with ametallicity determined from the undepleted element sulfur of [s/h]=-0.62pm0.18.the abundance pattern of this dla is similar to that of higher z dlas, showingmild depletion of the refractory elements fe and ti with [s/fe]=+0.24pm0.22 and[s/ti]=+0.28pm0.15. nitrogen is underabundant in this system with[n/h]=-1.40pm0.14, placing this dla below the plateau of the [n/alpha]measurements in the local universe at similar metallicities. this dla has asimple kinematic structure with only two components required to fit theprofiles and a kinematic width of 52 km/s. imaging of the qso field with wfc3reveals a spiral galaxy at very small impact parameter to the qso and severalgalaxies within 10". followup spectra with lris reveal that none of the nearbygalaxies are at the redshift of the dla. the spiral galaxy is identified as thehost galaxy of the qso based on the near perfect alignment of the nucleus anddisk of the galaxy as well as spectra of an h ii region showing emission linesat the qso redshift. a small feature appears 0.70" from the nucleus of the qsoafter psf subtraction, providing another candidate for the host galaxy of thedla.

1103.4134	shining light on merging galaxies i: the ongoing merger of a quasar with  a `green valley' galaxy	serendipitous observations of a pair z = 0.37 interacting galaxies (onehosting a quasar) show a massive gaseous bridge of material connecting the twoobjects. this bridge is photoionized by the quasar (qso) revealing gas alongthe entire projected 38 kpc sightline connecting the two galaxies. the emissionlines that result give an unprecedented opportunity to study the merger processat this redshift. we determine the kinematics, ionization parameter (log u ~-2.5 +- 0.03), column density (n_h ~ 10^{21} cm^{-2}), metallicity ([m/h] ~-0.20 +- 0.15), and mass (~ 10^8 msun) of the gaseous bridge. we simultaneouslyconstrain properties of the qso-host (m_dm&gt;8.8x 10^{11} msun) and its companiongalaxy (m_dm&gt;2.1 x 10^{11} msun; m_star ~ 2 x 10^{10} msun; stellar burstage=300-800 myr; sfr~6 msun/yr; and metallicity 12+log (o/h)= 8.64 +- 0.2). thegeneral properties of this system match the standard paradigm of agalaxy-galaxy merger caught between first and second passage while one of thegalaxies hosts an active quasar. the companion galaxy lies in the so-called`green valley', with a stellar population consistent with a recent starbursttriggered during the first passage of the merger and has no detectable agnactivity. in addition to providing case-studies of quasars associated withgalaxy mergers, quasar/galaxy pairs with qso-photoionized tidal bridges such asthis one offer unique insights into the galaxy properties while alsodistinguishing an important and inadequately understood phase of galaxyevolution.

1104.2323	the distribution of thermal pressures in the diffuse, cold neutral  medium of our galaxy. ii. an expanded survey of interstellar c i  fine-structure excitations	we analyzed absorption features arising from interstellar neutral carbon thatappeared in the uv spectra of 89 stars recorded in the highest resolutionechelle modes of stis on hst so that we could determine the relativepopulations of collisionally excited fine structure levels in the atom'selectronic ground state. from this information we derive the distribution ofthermal pressures in the diffuse, cold neutral medium. we find a lognormalpressure distribution (weighted by mass) with a mean in log (p/k) equal to 3.58and an rms dispersion of at least 0.175 dex that plausibly arises fromturbulence with a characteristic mach number in the range 1 &lt; m &lt; 4. theextreme tails in the distribution are above the lognormal function however.overall, pressures are well correlated with local starlight intensities andextreme kinematics. approximately 23% of the gas is at a pressure that is belowthat allowed for a static cold neutral medium. accompanying nearly all of thegas is a small fraction (~0.05%) that has an extraordinarily large pressure,log (p/k) &gt; 5.5, and this condition is more prevalent at high velocities or forregions with enhanced starlight densities. this survey suggests that thedispersion of thermal pressures in the cold, neutral ism is predominantlygoverned by microscopic turbulence driven by star forming regions, with someadditional effects from macroscopic events (e.g., sn explosions), and thesemeasurements provide constraints for future studies of the broader impact ofturbulence on the ism and star formation.

1105.5381	evidence for cold accretion: primitive gas flowing onto a galaxy at  z~0.274	we present uv and optical observations from the cosmic origins spectrographon the hubble space telescope and keck of a z= 0.27395 lyman limit system (lls)seen in absorption against the qso pg1630+377. we detect h i absorption withlog n(hi)=17.06\pm0.05 as well as mg ii, c iii, si iii, and o vi in thissystem. the column densities are readily explained if this is a multi-phasesystem, with the intermediate and low ions arising in a very low metallicity([mg/ h] =-1.71 \pm 0.06) photoionized gas. we identify via keck spectroscopyand large binocular telescope imaging a 0.3 l_* star-forming galaxy projected37 kpc from the qso at nearly identical redshift (z=0.27406, \delta v = -26\kms) with near solar metallicity ([o/ h]=-0.20 \pm 0.15). the presence of verylow metallicity gas in the proximity of a near-solar metallicity, sub-l_*galaxy strongly suggests that the lls probes gas infalling onto the galaxy. asearch of the literature reveals that such low metallicity llss are notuncommon. we found that 50% (4/8) of the well-studied z &lt; 1 llss havemetallicities similar to the present system and show sub-l_* galaxies with rho&lt; 100 kpc in those fields where redshifts have been surveyed. we argue that theproperties of these primitive llss and their host galaxies are consistent withthose of cold mode accretion streams seen in galaxy simulations.

1106.1205	discovery of cold, pristine gas possibly accreting onto an overdensity  of star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.6	we report the discovery of large amounts of cold (t ~ 10^4 k), chemicallyyoung gas in an overdensity of galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.6 in the greatobservatories origins deep survey southern field (goods-s). the gas isidentified thanks to the ultra-strong mg ii absorption features it imprints inthe rest-frame uv spectra of galaxies in the background of the overdensity.there is no evidence that the optically-thick gas is part of any massive galaxy(i.e. m_star &gt; 4x10^9 m_sun), but rather is associated with the overdensity;less massive and fainter galaxies (25.5 &lt; z_850 &lt; 27.5 mag) have too large animpact parameter to be causing ultra-strong absorption systems, based on ourknowledge of such systems. the lack of corresponding fe ii absorption features,not detected even in co-added spectra, suggests that the gas is chemically morepristine than the ism and outflows of star-forming galaxies at similarredshift, including those in the overdensity itself, and comparable to the mostmetal-poor stars in the milky way halo. a crude estimate of the projectedcovering factor of the high-column density gas (n_h &gt;~ 10^20 cm-2) based on theobserved fraction of galaxies with ultra-strong absorbers is c_f ~ 0.04. abroad, continuum absorption profile extending to the red of the interstellar mgii absorption line by &lt;~ 2000 km/s is possibly detected in two independentco-added spectra of galaxies of the overdensity, consistent with a large-scaleinfall motion of the gas onto the overdensity and its galaxies. overall, thesefindings provides the first tentative evidence of accretion of cold, chemicallyyoung gas onto galaxies at high redshift, possibly feeding their star formationactivity. the fact that the galaxies are members of a large structure, asopposed to field galaxies, might play a significant role in our ability todetect the accreting gas.

1307.6799	a census of quasar-intrinsic absorption in the hubble space telescope  archive: systems from high resolution echelle spectra	we present a census of z(abs) &lt; 2, intrinsic (those showing partial coverage)and associated [z(abs) ~ z(em)] quasar absorption-line systems detected in thehubble space telescope archive of space telescope imaging spectrograph echellespectra. this work complements the misawa et al. (2007) survey of 2 &lt; z(em) &lt; 4quasars that selects systems using similar techniques. we confirm the existenceof so-called "strong n v" intrinsic systems (where the equivalent width of h ily alpha is small compared to n v 1238) presented in that work, but find noconvincing cases of "strong c iv" intrinsic systems at low redshift/luminosity.moreover, we also report on the existence of "strong o vi" systems. from acomparison of partial coverage results as a function of ion, we conclude thatsystems selected by the n v ion have the highest probability of beingintrinsic. by contrast, the c iv and o vi ions are poor selectors. of the 30 ovi systems tested, only two of the systems in the spectrum on 3c 351 showconvincing evidence for partial coverage. however, there is a 3-sigma excess inthe number of absorbers near the quasar redshift (|delta v| &lt;= 5000 km/s) overabsorbers at large redshift differences. in at least two cases, the associatedo vi systems are known not to arise close to the accretion disk of the quasar.

1310.6267	the high-ion content and kinematics of low-redshift lyman limit systems	we study the high-ionization phase and kinematics of the circumgalacticmedium around low-redshift galaxies using a sample of 23 lyman limit systems(llss) at 0.08&lt;z&lt;0.93 observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph onboard thehubble space telescope. in lehner et al. (2013), we recently showed that low-zllss have a bimodal metallicity distribution. here we extend that analysis tosearch for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of themetal-poor and metal-rich branches. we find that metal-rich llss tend to showhigher o vi columns and broader o vi profiles than metal-poor llss. the total hi line width (dv90 statistic) in llss is not correlated with metallicity,indicating that the h i kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflowfrom outflow and gas recycling. among the 17 llss with o vi detections, all buttwo show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of o vi-h i centroidoffsets, multiple components, or both. using various scenarios for how themetallicity in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each lls compare, weconstrain the ionized hydrogen column in the o vi phase to lie in the range logn(h ii)~17.6-20. the o vi phase of llss is a substantial baryon reservoir, withm(high-ion)~10^{8.5-10.9}(r/150 kpc)^2 solar masses, similar to the mass in thelow-ion phase. accounting for the o vi phase approximately doubles thecontribution of low-z llss to the cosmic baryon budget.

1311.4559	a deep search for faint galaxies associated with very low-redshift c iv  absorbers: a case with cold-accretion characteristics	studies of qso absorber-galaxy connections are often hindered by inadequateinformation on whether faint/dwarf galaxies are located near the qso sightlines. to investigate the contribution of faint galaxies to qso absorberpopulations, we are conducting a deep galaxy redshift survey near low-z c ivabsorbers. here we report a blindly-detected c iv absorption system (z(abs) =0.00348) in the spectrum of pg1148+549 that appears to be associated eitherwith an edge-on dwarf galaxy with an obvious disk (ugc 6894, z(gal) = 0.00283)at an impact parameter of rho = 190 kpc or with a very faint dwarf irregulargalaxy at rho = 23 kpc, which is closer to the sightline but has a largerredshift difference (z(gal) = 0.00107, i.e., dv = 724 km/s). we considervarious gas/galaxy associations, including infall and outflows. based oncurrent theoretical models, we conclude that the absorber is most likelytracing (1) the remnants of an outflow from a previous epoch, a so-called'ancient outflow', or (2) intergalactic gas accreting onto ugc 6894, 'coldmode' accretion. the latter scenario is supported by h i synthesis imaging datathat shows the rotation curve of the disk being codirectional with the velocityoffset between ugc 6894 and the absorber, which is located almost directlyalong the major axis of the edge-on disk.

1403.0947	the cos-halos survey: physical conditions and baryonic mass in the  low-redshift circumgalactic medium	we analyze the physical conditions of the cool, photoionized (t $\sim 10^4$k) circumgalactic medium (cgm) using the cos-halos suite of gas column densitymeasurements for 44 gaseous halos within 160 kpc of $l \sim l^*$ galaxies at $z\sim 0.2$. these data are well described by simple photoionization models, withthe gas highly ionized (n$_{\rm hii}$/n$_{\rm h} \gtrsim 99\%$) by theextragalactic ultraviolet background (euvb). scaling by estimates for thevirial radius, r$_{\rm vir}$, we show that the ionization state (tracked by thedimensionless ionization parameter, u) increases with distance from the hostgalaxy. the ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profilen$_{\rm h}$ = (10$^{-4.2 \pm 0.25}$)(r/r$_{\rm vir})^{-0.8\pm0.3}$. our derivedgas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictionsfrom standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium witha hot, coronal medium expected in virialized halos at this mass scale. applyingthe ionization corrections to the hi column densities, we estimate a lowerlimit to the cool gas mass m$_{\rm cgm}^{\rm cool} &gt; 6.5 \times 10^{10}$m$_{\odot}$ for the volume within r $&lt;$ r$_{\rm vir}$. allowing for anadditional warm-hot, ovi-traced phase, the cgm accounts for at least half ofthe baryons purported to be missing from dark matter halos at the 10$^{12}$m$_{\odot}$ scale.

1512.00853	a deep search for faint galaxies associated with very low-redshift c iv  absorbers: iii. a galaxy sample complete to 0.01 l* and evidence for  environmental effects	we employ a blindly selected sample of low-redshift c iv absorption systemsidentified in spectra from the hubble space telescope (hst) cosmic originsspectrograph (cos), combined with galaxy data from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), to study the metal-enriched circumgalactic medium (cgm) with ~100%completeness for galaxy luminosities l &gt; 0.01 l* at z &lt; 0.015. we find thatgalaxies are typically found at the c iv absorber redshifts within impactparameters rho &lt; 200 kpc, with the nearest galaxy having l &lt; 0.1 l* for 78% ofthe absorbers. the ubiquity of faint dwarfs in close proximity to the absorberssuggests that these galaxies affect the enrichment and physical conditions ofmassive-galaxy halos. however, a fraction of our sample (33%) arise welloutside the virial radius of any nearby galaxy brighter than 0.01 l*. thedetection rate for c iv absorption within the virial radius is mass dependentand is considerably higher for l &gt;~0.1 l* galaxies (7/8) than for less luminousgalaxies (1/10). we also find that the occurrence of c iv absorbers dependsstrongly on the broader environment: 67% (8/12) of galaxies with rho &lt; 150 kpcin regions of low galaxy density (regions with fewer than ten 0.1 l* galaxieswithin 1 mpc) have affiliated c iv absorption while none (0/9) of the galaxiesin denser regions show c iv within rho &lt; 150 kpc. the reduced detection rate ofc iv in denser environments persists for massive group dark matter halos. incontrast, h i is pervasive in the cgm without regard to mass or environment,although some of these ly-alpha absorbers could arise in unrelatedintergalactic gas.

astro-ph;0003132	the properties of molecular hydrogen toward the orion belt stars from  observations by the interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph	absorption features from the lyman and werner bands of interstellar molecularhydrogen were recorded by the interstellar medium absorption profilespectrograph (imaps) at a wavelength resolving power r=80,000 in the spectra ofdelta ori and epsilon ori. the objective was to find and study more examples ofan unusual phenomenon found for one of the velocity components of h2 in thespectrum of zeta ori by jenkins &amp; peimbert (1997). specifically, they detecteda gradual shift in velocity and broadening for features arising fromprogressively higher rotational excitations j. this effect appears to be absentin the spectra of both delta and epsilon ori, which are only a few degrees awayin the sky from zeta ori. the absence of atomic material at a large negativevelocity in the spectra of delta and epsilon ori (and its presence in zeta ori)supports a proposal by jenkins &amp; peimbert that the line of sight to zetaintercepts a bow shock facing away from us, perhaps created by the collision ofwind-like material with some foreground obstruction. for both stars, the h2absorption features are separated into two velocity components. total h2 columndensities toward delta and epsilon ori are 5.5e14 and 1.9e16 cm^-2,respectively. the rotation temperatures of the molecules with j &gt; 2 towardepsilon ori indicate that the gas is in the general vicinity of the stars thatemit uv fluxes capable of rotationally pumping the molecules. for the strongestcomponent of h2 toward delta ori, the pumping rate is lower and consistent witha general uv flux level in the plane of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0007238	spatial variability in the ratio of interstellar atomic deuterium to  hydrogen. ii. observations toward gamma2 velorum and zeta puppis by the  interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph	to measure interstellar atomic deuterium abundances, we used the interstellarmedium absorption profile spectrograph (imaps) to obtain spectra of gamma2 veland zeta pup over the wavelength interval 930-1150 a at a resolving power of80,000. the interstellar d i features are resolved and cleanly separated frominterstellar h i in the ly-delta and ly-epsilon profiles of both sight lines,and also in the ly-gamma profile of zeta pup. the d i profiles were modeledusing a velocity template derived from several n i lines in the imaps spectrarecorded at higher s/n. to find the best d i column density, we minimizedchi-squares for model d i profiles that included not only the n(d i) as a freeparameter, but also the effects of several potential sources of systematicerror which could also be varied. for both stars, h i column densities weremeasured by analyzing ly-alpha absorption profiles in a large number of iuehigh dispersion spectra. ultimately we found that d/h = 2.18(+0.36,-0.31)e-5for gamma2 vel and 1.42(+0.25,-0.23)e-5 for zeta pup, values that contrastmarkedly with d/h derived in paper i for delta ori (the stated errors are 90%confidence limits). evidently, the atomic d/h ratio in the ism, averaged overpath lengths of 250 to 500 pc, exhibits significant spatial variability.furthermore, variations in d/h do not appear to be anticorrelated with n/h.within the framework of standard big bang nucleosynthesis, the large value ofd/h found toward gamma2 vel is equivalent to a cosmic baryon density of omega_bh^2 = 0.023 (+-0.002), which we regard as an upper limit since there is nocorrection for the destruction of deuterium in stars.

(2000) to account for the presence of sources close tothe line of sight of the background quasar. as an alternative to the delayedreionization model suggested by reimers et al. (1997), we propose that thelarge softness observed at z~2.86 is due to the presence of bright soft sourcesclose to the line of sight, i.e. for which the ratio between the number of hito heii ionizing photons reaching the igm is large. we discuss these two modelsand suggest ways to discriminate between them.

astro-ph;0106204	revealing the warm-hot intergalactic medium with ovi absorption	hydrodynamic simulations of growth of cosmic structure suggest that 30-50% ofthe total baryons at z=0 may be in a warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) withtemperatures ~10^5-10^7k. the o vi \lambda \lambda 1032, 1038 absorption linedoublet in the fuv portion of qso spectra provides an important probe of thisgas. utilizing recent hydrodynamic simulations, it is found that there shouldbe ~5 o vi absorption lines per unit redshift with equivalent widths &gt;= 35 ma,decreasing rapidly to ~0.5 per unit redshift at &gt;= 350 ma. about 10% of thetotal baryonic matter or 20-30% of the whim is expected to be in the o viabsorption line systems with equivalent width &gt;= 20 ma; the remaining whim gasmay be too hot or have too low metallicity to be detected in o vi. we find thatthe simulation results agree well with observations with regard to the lineabundance and total mass contained in these systems. some of the o vi systemsare collisionally ionized and some are photoionized, but most of the mass is inthe collisionally ionized systems. we show that the gas that produces the o viabsorption lines does not reside in virialized regions such as galaxies,groups, or clusters of galaxies, but rather has an overdensity of 10-40 timesthe average density. these regions form a somewhat connected network offilaments. the typical metallicity of these regions is 0.1-0.3zsun.

astro-ph;0107177	the distribution of thermal pressures in the interstellar medium from a  survey of c i fine-structure excitation	we used the smallest entrance aperture (0.03 arc-sec wide slit) and highestresolution echelle gratings (e140h and e230h) of stis on hst to record theinterstellar absorption features for 10 different multiplets of neutral carbonat a wavelength resolving power of 200,000 in the uv spectra of 21 early-typestars. we measured the amount of c i in each of its three fine-structurelevels, so that we could determine nt of the absorbing gas and how much itvaries in different regions. to obtain internally consistent results for allmultiplets, we had to modify the transition f-values so that generally weaktransitions were stronger than their published values. the fine-structurepopulations indicate that the median thermal pressure for our entire sample isp/k=2240 cm^-3 k, or slightly higher for temperatures that differ appreciablyfrom 40 k. about 15% of the gas moving at peculiar velocities shows p/k &gt; 10^4cm^-3 k, and this fraction drops to 1.5% for quiescent gas. often, there aresmall amounts of gas at p/k &gt; 10^5 cm^-3 k. these ubiquitous wisps of highpressure material probably arise from small-scale density enhancements createdby converging flows in a turbulent medium. the c i excitations indicate abarytropic index gamma_eff &gt; 0.90 when the gas is compressed, which is largerthan the value 0.72 expected for material in thermal equilibrium. thisindicates that the regions have a dimension r &lt; 0.01 pc which allows them tocompress very quickly and nearly adiabatically. appendices of this paperpresent evidence that stis can indeed achieve r = 200,000, and that telluricoxygen absorption lines are broadened by macroscopic motions.

(2) there is a complex cluster of h i lyaabsorption lines near the o vi redshift, including at least five componentsspread over a velocity range of ~700 km/s . (3) the strongest lya line in thecluster appears to be composed of a mildly saturated component with a typicalb-value blended with a broad component with b = 85 km/s . (4) the o viabsorption is not aligned with the strongest h i absorption, but instead iswell-aligned with the broad component. (5) the only detected species (&gt;4sigma)are o vi and h i despite coverage of strong transitions of other abundantelements. based on these constraints, we find that the absorption lineproperties can be produced in collisionally ionized gas with roughly 5.3 &lt; logt &lt; 5.6 and -1.8 &lt; [o/h] &lt; -0.6. however, we find that photoionization is alsoviable if the pathlength l through the absorbing gas is long enough; simplephotoionization models require 85 &lt; l &lt; 1900 kpc and -1.1 &lt; [o/h] &lt; -0.3. webriefly discuss how observations of x-ray absorption lines due to o vii and oviii could be used, in principle, to break the ionization mechanism degeneracy.

astro-ph;0411151	missing baryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium	we briefly review the use of uv absorption lines in the spectra oflow-redshift qsos for the study of the physical conditions, metallicity, andbaryonic content of the low-z igm, with emphasis on the missing baryonsproblem. current results on the statistics and baryonic content of intervening,low-z o vi and lya absorption-line systems are presented with some comments onoverlap between these two classes of absorbers and consequent baryondouble-counting problems. from observations of a sample of 16 qsos observedwith the e140m echelle mode of stis, we find 44 intervening o vi absorbers and14 associated o vi systems [i.e, z(abs) ~ z(qso)]. the implied number ofintervening o vi absorbers per unit redshift is dn/dz(o vi) = 23+/-4 for restequivalent width &gt; 30 ma. the intervening o vi systems contain at least 7% ofthe baryons if their typical metallicity is 1/10 solar and the o vi ionfraction is &lt;0.2. this finding is consistent with predictions made bycosmological simulations of large-scale structure growth. recently, apopulation of remarkably broad lya lines have been recognized in low-z quasarspectra. if these lya lines are predominantly thermally broadened, then these hi absorbers likely harbor an important fraction of the baryons. we present anddiscuss some examples of the broad lya absorbers. finally, we briefly summarizesome findings on the relationships between o vi absorbers and nearbygalaxies/large-scale structures.

astro-ph;0412485	highly ionized gas in the galactic halo and the high velocity clouds  toward pg 1116+215	we have obtained high resolution fuse and hst/stis echelle observations ofthe quasar pg 1116+215. the semi-continuous coverage of the ultravioletspectrum over the wavelength range 916-2800 provides detections of galactic andhigh velocity cloud (hvc) absorption over a wide range of ionization speciesover the local standard of rest velocity range -100 - +200 km/s. the highdispersion of these spectra (6.5-20 km/s) reveals that low ionization speciesconsist of five discrete components, three at low-to-intermediate velocities,and two at high velocities (v = +100, +184 km/s). over the same velocity range,the higher ionization species show continuous absorption with column densitypeaks at v = +10 km/s +184 km/s. the absorption kinematics of the v=+184 km/shvc suggest a scenario in which a low-ionization cloud of gas is streamingthrough a hot external medium that is stripping gas from this cloud. using theoi and hi column densities, we estimate [o/h]=-0.66, with a substantialuncertainty due to saturation of the hi lyman series. if the ionization of thecloud core is photonionization by the extragalactic uv background, we estimatethe cloud has a density of 10^-2.7 cm^-3. if photons escaping the galactic diskare also included, the density could be higher by nearly 2 dex. in either case,the relative abundances of o, si, and fe in the cloud core are readilyexplained by a solar pattern. magellanic stream gas is a possible origin forthis gas and is consistent with the location of the hvc on the sky, as well asits high positive velocity, the ionization, and metallicity.

astro-ph;0501475	a near-solar metallicity, nitrogen-deficient lyman limit absorber  associated with two s0 galaxies	from uv spectra of the bright quasar phl 1811 recorded by fuse and the e140mconfiguration on stis, we have determined the abundances of various atomicspecies in a lyman limit system at z = 0.0809 with log n(h i) = 17.98.considerably more hydrogen may be in ionized form, since the abundances of cii, si ii, s ii and fe ii are very large compared to that of o i, when comparedto their respective solar abundance ratios. our determination [o/h] = -0.19 inthe h i-bearing gas indicates that the chemical enrichment of the gas isunusually high for an extragalactic qso absorption system. however, this samematerial has an unusually low abundance of nitrogen, [n/o] &lt; -0.59, indicatingthat there may not have been enough time during this enrichment for secondarynitrogen to arise from low and intermediate mass stars. in an earlierinvestigation we found two galaxies at nearly the same redshift as thisabsorption system and displaced by 34 and 87 kpc from the line of sight. anr-band image recorded by the acs on hst indicates these are s0 galaxies. one orboth of these galaxies may be the source of the gas, which might have beenexpelled in a fast wind, by tidal stripping, or by ram-pressure stripping.subtraction of the acs point-spread function from the image of the qso revealsthe presence of a face-on spiral galaxy under the glare of the quasar; althoughit is possible that this galaxy may be responsible for the lyman limitabsorption, the exact alignment of the qso with the center of the galaxysuggests that the spiral is the quasar host.

astro-ph;0503051	detection of ne viii in the low-redshift warm-hot igm	high resolution fuse and stis observations of the bright qso he 0226-4110(zem = 0.495) reveal the presence of a multi-phase absorption line system atzabs(o vi) = 0.20701 containing absorption from h i (ly alpha to ly theta), ciii, o iii, o iv, o vi, n iii, ne viii, si iii, s vi and possibly s v. singlecomponent fits to the ne viii and o vi absorption doublets yield logn(ne viii)= 13.89+/-0.11 and logn(o vi) = 14.37+/-0.03. the ne viii and o vi doublets aredetected at 3.9 sigma and 16 sigma significance levels, respectively. thisrepresents the first detection of intergalactic ne viii, a diagnostic of gaswith temperature in the range from 5x10(5) to 1x10(6) k. the o vi and ne viiiare not likely created in a low density medium photoionized solely by theextragalactic background at z = 0.2 since the required path length of ~11 mpcimplies the hubble flow absorption line broadening would be ~10 times greaterthan the observed line widths. a collisional ionization origin is thereforemore likely. assuming [ne/h] and [o/h] = -0.5, the value n(ne viii)/n(o vi) =0.33+/-0.10 is consistent with gas in collisional ionization equilibrium neart=5.4x10(5) k with logn(h)= 19.9 and n(h)/n(h i) = 1.7x10(6). the observationssupport the basic idea that a substantial fraction of the baryonic matter atlow redshift exists in hot very highly ionized gaseous structures.

astro-ph;0505299	multi-phase high-velocity clouds toward he 0226-4110 and pg 0953+414	we study the physical conditions, elemental abundances, and kinematics of thehigh-velocity clouds (hvcs) along the sight lines toward active galaxieshe0226-4110 and pg0953+414 using hubble space telescope imaging spectrographand far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer data. our observations revealmultiple components of hvc absorption in lines of hi, cii, ciii, civ, ovi,siii, siiii, and siiv in both directions. we investigate whetherphotoionization by the extragalactic background radiation or by escaping milkyway radiation can explain the observed ionization pattern. we find thatphotoionization is a good explanation for the cii, ciii, siii, and siiiifeatures, but not for the ovi or civ associated with the hvcs, suggesting thattwo principal phases exist: a warm (t~10^4k), photoionized phase and a hotter(t=1-3x10^5k), collisionally-ionized phase. the warm hvcs toward he0226-4110have high levels of ionization (97-99%), and metallicities ([z/h] between -0.9and -0.4) close to those in the magellanic stream, which lies eleven degreesaway on the sky at similar velocities. these hvcs have thermal pressures thatwould place them close to equilibrium in a fully ionized 10^6 k galactic coronawith n_h=4-9x10^{-5}cm^{-3} at 50 kpc. a mini-survey of the hot, collisionallyionized hvc components seen here and in five other sight lines finds that in11/12 cases, the high ions have kinematics and ionic ratios that are consistentwith an origin in conductive interfaces. however, the broad absorption wing onthe ovi profile toward pg0953+414 is not completely explained by the interfacescenario, and may be tracing the outflow of hot gas into the milky way halo aspart of a galactic fountain or wind.

astro-ph;0509002	a comparison of absorption and emission line abundances in the nearby  damped lyman-alpha galaxy sbs 1543+593	we have used the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) aboard hst tomeasure a sulfur abundance of [s/h] = -0.41 +/-0.06 in the interstellar medium(ism) of the nearby damped lyman-alpha (dla) absorbing galaxy sbs 1543+593. adirect comparison between this qso absorption line abundance on the one hand,and abundances measured from hii region emission line diagnostics on the other,yield the same result: the abundance of sulfur in the neutral ism is in goodagreement with that of oxygen measured in an hii region 3 kpc away. our resultcontrasts with those of other recent studies which have claimedorder-of-magnitude differences between hi (absorption) and hii (emission)region abundances. we also derive a nickel abundance of [ni/h] &lt; -0.81, somethree times less than that of sulfur, and suggest that the depletion is due todust, although we cannot rule out an over-abundance of alpha-elements as thecause of the lower metallicity. it is possible that our measure of [s/h] isover-estimated if some sii arises in ionized gas; adopting a plausible starformation rate for the galaxy along the line of sight, and a measurement of thecii* 1335.7 absorption line detected from sbs 1543+593, we determine that themetallicity is unlikely to be smaller than we derive by more than 0.25 dex. weestimate that the cooling rate of the cool neutral medium is log [l_c (ergss^{-1} h atom^{-1})] = -27.0, the same value as that seen in the high redshiftdla population.

astro-ph;0509648	measurements of the f-values of the resonance transitions of ni ii at  1317.217a and 1370.132a	we have retrieved high-resolution uv spectra of 69 hot stars from the hstarchive and determined the strengths of the interstellar ni ii absorptionfeatures at 1317.217a. we then compared them to absorptions from either thetransitions at 1741.553a (covered in the spectra of 21 of the stars) or the oneat 1370.132a (seen for the remaining 48 stars). all spectra were recorded bythe either the e140m, e140h, or e230h gratings of stis. by comparing thestrengths of the two lines in each spectrum and evaluating a weighted averageof all such comparisons, we have found that the f-value of the 1317a line is1.34 +/-0.019 times the one at 1741a and 0.971 +/-0.014 times that of the oneat 1370a. we adopt as a comparison standard an experimentally determinedf-value for the 1741a line (known to 10% accuracy), so that f(1317a) = 0.0571+/-0.006. it follows from this f-value and our measured line-strength ratiosthat f(1370a) = 0.0588 +/-0.006. as an exercise to validate our methodology, wecompared the 1317a transition to another ni ii line at 1454.842a and arrived atan f-value for the latter that is consistent with a previously measuredexperimental value to within the expected error.

astro-ph;0510312	the connections between qso absorption systems and galaxies:  low-redshift observations	quasar absorption lines have long been recognized to be a sensitive probe ofthe abundances, physical conditions, and kinematics of gas in a wide variety ofenvironments including low-density intergalactic regions that probably cannotbe studied by any other means. while some pre-hubble space telescope (hst)observations indicated that mg ii absorption lines arise in gaseous galactichalos with a large covering factor, many early qso absorber studies werehampered by a lack of information about the context of the absorbers and theirconnections with galaxies. by providing access to crucial ultraviolet resonancelines at low redshifts, deployment of hst and the far ultraviolet spectroscopicexplorer enabled detailed studies of the relationships between qso absorbersand galaxies. the advent of large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) has also advanced the topic by greatly improving the size of absorberand galaxy samples. this paper briefly reviews some observational results onabsorber-galaxy connections that have been obtained in the hst/sdss era,including mg ii absorbers, the low-z lyman alpha forest, lyman limit and dampedlyman alpha absorbers, and o vi systems.

astro-ph;0512163	high metallicity, photoionised gas in intergalactic large-scale  filaments	we present high-resolution uv spectra of absorption-line systems toward thelow-z qso hs0624+6907 (z=0.3700). coupled with spectroscopic galaxy redshifts,we find that many of these absorbers are integalactic gas clouds distributedwithin large-scale structures. the gas is cool (t&lt;10^5 k) and has relativelyhigh metallicity (z/z_sol&gt;0.9). stis data reveal a cluster of 13 hi lyman alphalines within a 1000 km/s interval at z=0.0635. we find 10 galaxies at thisredshift with impact parameters ranging from 135 h^-1 kpc to 1.37 h^-1 mpc. weattribute the hi lya absorptions to intragroup medium gas, possibly from alarge-scale filament viewed along its long axis. remarkably, the metallicity isnear-solar, [m/h] = -0.05 +/- 0.4 (2 sigma uncertainty), yet the nearest galaxywhich might pollute the igm is at least 135 h_70^-1 kpc away. tidal strippingfrom nearby galaxies appears to be the most likely origin of this highlyenriched, cool gas. more than six abell galaxy clusters are found within 4degree of the sight line suggesting that the qso line of sight passes near anode in the cosmic web. at z~0.077, we find absorption systems as well asgalaxies at the redshift of the nearby clusters abell 564 and abell 559. weconclude that the sight line pierces a filament of gas and galaxies feedinginto these clusters. the absorber at z_abs = 0.07573 associated with abell564/559 also has a high metallicity with [c/h] &gt; -0.6, but again the closestgalaxy is relatively far from the sight line (293 h^-1 kpc).

astro-ph;0603492	high-resolution absorption spectroscopy of multi-phase, high-metallicity  gas associated with the luminous quasar he 0226-4110	we present fuse and hst/stis observations of the absorption line system nearthe emission redshift of the radio-quiet, x-ray bright quasar he0226-4110 (z =0.495, v=15.2). the spectra cover the rest-frame wavelength range 610--1150 a,and we detect a wide range of ionization species, including four adjacentstages of oxygen (o iii-vi), which reveal a striking change in gas kinematicswith ionization. examination of the o vi 1031, 1037 doublet profiles reveals noevidence for partial coverage or unresolved saturated structure. o iii is onlydetected in a narrow feature which is also traced by h i and c iii, suggestingthat they arise in the same gas. absorption at the same velocity is alsopresent in other species n iv, o iv-vi, s iv, and possibly n viii, but thekinematics differ from the o iii, implying production in separate gaseousphases. the h i, o ii-iv, and c iii information in yield an estimate of boththe photoionization parameter and metallicity of the o iii-bearing gas:[o/h]=+0.12(-0.03/+0.16), log u=-2.29(-0.23/+0.02). we discuss two possiblelocations for the gas in this associated absorption-line system: the narrowemission line region of the quasar, and the halo of the quasar host galaxy. anadditional narrow (thus, photoionized) component that is only detected in o viappears 58 km/s redward of the o iii-bearing gas with -0.35 &lt; log u &lt; 0.02.additional structure is detected in the associated absorber in the form of twobroad components which only appear in moderate to high ionization species.[highly abridged]

astro-ph;0604415	the o vi absorbers toward pg0953+415: high metallicity, cosmic-web gas  far from luminous galaxies	the spectrum of the low-redshift qso pg0953+415 shows two strong, interveningo vi absorption systems. to study the nature of these absorbers, we have usedthe gemini multiobject spectrograph to conduct a deep spectroscopic galaxyredshift survey in the 5' x 5' field centered on the qso. this survey is fullycomplete for r' &lt; 19.7 and is 73% complete for r' &lt; 21.0. we find threegalaxies at the redshift of the higher-z o vi system (z = 0.14232) including agalaxy at projected distance rho = 155 kpc. we find no galaxies in the geminifield at the redshift of the lower-z o vi absorber (z = 0.06807), whichindicates that the nearest galaxy is more than 195 kpc away or has l &lt; 0.04 l*.previous shallower surveys covering a larger field have shown that the z =0.06807 o vi absorber is affiliated with a group/filament of galaxies, but thenearest known galaxy has rho = 736 kpc. the z = 0.06807 absorber is notable forseveral reasons. the absorption profiles reveal simple kinematics indicative ofquiescent material. the h i line widths and good alignment of the h i and metallines favor photoionization and, moreover, the column density ratios imply ahigh metallicity: [m/h] = -0.3 +/- 0.12. the z = 0.14232 o vi system is morecomplex and less constrained but also indicates a relatively high metallicity.using galaxy redshifts from sdss, we show that both of the pg0953+415 o viabsorbers are located in large-scale filaments of the cosmic web. evidently,some regions of the web filaments are highly metal enriched. we discuss theorigin of the high-metallicity gas and suggest that the enrichment might haveoccurred long ago (at high z).

astro-ph;9703080	echelle spectroscopy of qso absorption line systems with metals in the  direction of hs 1700+6416	we present a high signal-to-noise high resolution spectrum of the radio-quietqso hs1700+6416 (z = 2.72). analysis of the absorption line systems with metalsyields the following results. (1) the dense cluster of c iv doublets at 2.432 &lt;z(abs) &lt; 2.441 shows the weak line of one c iv absorber apparently aligned withthe strong line of a different c iv doublet, i.e., line locked, for two pairsof c iv absorbers. this is surprising since these absorption lines aredisplaced by more than 24000 km/s from the qso redshift, but it is possiblethat these alignments are coincidental. (2) physical conditions in the lymanlimit absorber at z(abs) = 2.3150 differ significantly from the galacticgaseous halo, and photoionization models require [si/h] &gt; -0.95 and [al/h] &gt;-0.96 for the strongest component of this absorber. abundances of three otherlyman limit absorbers are also derived from photoionization models. (3)unsaturated c iv and rather strong n v are detected in the associated absorberat z(abs) = 2.7125. the apparent column density profiles indicate that n v isaffected by unresolved saturation or that the n v absorbing gas does notcompletely cover the qso flux source. from photoionization models we derive[n/h] &gt; -0.65 and [c/h] &gt; -0.82. (4) we tentatively conclude that the number ofmg ii systems detected per unit redshift is dominated by weak mg ii lines withrest equivalent width less than 0.3 a.

astro-ph;9901403	spatial variability in the ratio of interstellar atomic deuterium to  hydrogen. i. observations toward delta orionis by the interstellar medium  absorption profile spectrograph	studies of the abundances of deuterium in different astrophysical sites areof fundamental importance to answering the question about how much deuteriumwas produced during big bang nucleosynthesis and what fraction of it wasdestroyed later. with this in mind, we used the interstellar medium absorptionprofile spectrograph (imaps) on the orfeus-spas ii mission to observe at awavelength resolution of 4 km/s (fwhm) the l-delta and l-epsilon absorptionfeatures produced by interstellar atomic deuterium in the spectrum of delta oria. a chi-square analysis indicated that 0.96 &lt; n(d i)&lt; 1.45e15 cm^{-2} at a 90%level of confidence, and the gas is at a temperature of about 6000k. to obtainan accurate value of n(h i) needed for a determination of the atomic ratio of dto h, we measured the l-alpha absorption features in 57 spectra of delta ori inthe iue archive. from our measurement of n(h i)= 1.56e20 cm^{-2}, we found thatn(d i)/n(h i)= 7.4(+1.9,-1.3)e-6 (90% confidence). our result for d/h contrastswith the more general finding along other lines of sight that d/h isapproximately 1.5e-5. the underabundance of d toward delta ori a is notaccompanied by an overabundance of n or o relative to h, as one might expect ifthe gas were subjected to more stellar processing than usual.

0706.1214	a high-resolution survey of low-redshift qso absorption lines:  statistics and physical conditions of o vi absorbers	using high-resolution uv spectra of 16 low-z qsos, we study the physicalconditions and statistics of o vi absorption in the igm at z &lt; 0.5. we identify51 intervening (z_{abs} &lt;&lt; z_{qso}) o vi systems comprised of 77 individualcomponents, and we find 14 "proximate" systems (z_{abs} ~ z_{qso}) containing34 components. for intervening systems [components] with rest-frame equivalentwidth w_{r} &gt; 30 ma, the number of o vi absorbers per unit redshift dn/dz =15.6(+2.9/-2.4) [21.0(+3.2/-2.8)], and this decreases to dn/dz = 0.9(+1.0/-0.5)[0.3(+0.7/-0.3)] for w_{r} &gt; 300 ma. the number per redshift increases steeplyas z_{abs} approaches z_{qso}, and some proximate absorbers have substantiallylower h i/o vi ratios. the lower proximate ratios could be partially due toionization effects but also require higher metallicities. we find that 37% ofthe intervening o vi absorbers have velocity centroids that are well-alignedwith corresponding h i absorption. if the o vi and the h i trace the same gas,the relatively small differences in line widths imply the absorbers are coolwith t &lt; 10^{5} k. most of these well-aligned absorbers have thecharacteristics of metal-enriched photoionized gas. however, the o vi in theapparently simple and cold systems could be associated with a hot phase with t~ 10^{5.5} k if the metallicity is high enough to cause the associated broad lyalpha absorption to be too weak to detect. we show that 53% of the interveningo vi systems are complex multiphase absorbers that can accommodate both lowermetallicity collisionally-ionized gas with t &gt; 10^{5} k and cold photoionzedgas.
