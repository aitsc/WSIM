0902.0577	a multifrequency study of giant radio sources iii. dynamical age vs.  spectral age of the lobes of selected sources	the dynamical ages of the opposite lobes of selected giant radio sources areestimated using the dynage algorithm of machalski et al., and compared withtheir spectral ages estimated and studied by jamrozy et al. in paper ii. asexpected, the dynage fits give slightly different dynamical ages and othermodel's parameters for the opposite lobes modelled independently each other,e.g. the age ratios are found between ~1.1 to ~1.4. demanding similar values ofthe jet power and the radio core density for the same source, we look for aself-consistent solution for the opposite lobes, which results in differentdensity profiles along them found by the fit. we also show that a departurefrom the equipartition conditions assumed in the model, justified by x-rayobservations of the lobes of some nearby radio galaxies, and a relevantvariation of the magnetic-field strengths may provide an equalisation of thelobes' ages. a comparison of the dynamical and spectral ages shows that a ratioof the dynamical age to the spectral age of the lobes of investigated giantradio galaxies is between ~1 and ~5, i.e. is similar to that found for smallerradio galaxies (e.g. parma et al. 1999). supplementing possible causes for thiseffect already discussed in the literature, like uncertainty of assumedparameters of the model, an influence of a possible departure from the energyequipartition assumption, etc. arguments are given to suggest that dynage canbetter take account of radiative effects at lower frequencies than thespectral-ageing analysis.the dynage algorithm is especially effective forsources at high redshifts, for which an intrinsic spectral curvature is shiftedto low frequencies.

0902.3016	21-cm absorbers at intermediate redshifts	damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) seen in the spectra of high-z qsos allow usto probe the physical conditions in protogalaxies. our understanding ofphysical conditions in dlas at high-z is primarily based on the absorptionlines of h_2 molecules and fine-structure transitions. another important way ofprobing the thermal state of interstellar medium in these systems is bystudying the 21-cm absorption in the spectra of background quasars. here wereport the main results of our gmrt survey to search for 21-cm absorption in arepresentative and unbiased sample of 35 dla candidates at 1.10&lt;z&lt;1.45. oursample of dla candidates is drawn from the strong mgii systems in sdss dr5 andhas resulted in discovery of 9 new 21-cm absorbers. prior to our survey onlyone 21-cm absorber was known in the redshift range: 0.7&lt;z&lt;2. this survey hasallowed us to investigate the dependence of detectability of 21-cm absorptionon the properties of uv absorption lines detected in sdss spectra and estimatethe number per unit redshift of 21-cm absorbers. our gmrt survey provides arepresentative sample of systems that can be used in combination with variousfollow-up observations: (1) for investigating the physical conditions in theabsorbing gas using spin temperature measurements, (2) for investigating theeffect of metallicity and dust content on the detectability of 21-cmabsorption, (3) for studying the morphology of the absorbing gas and (4) forprobing the time evolution of various fundamental constants. results from thefirst phase of our survey are presented in gupta et al.

0706.3174	ngc4438 and its environment at radio wavelengths	we present multi-frequency, radio-continuum and hi observations of ngc4438,the highly-disturbed, active galaxy in the virgo cluster, with the vla and thegmrt. high-resolution observations with the vla at 4860 and 8460 mhz show thepresence of an inverted-spectrum radio nucleus located between the highlyasymmetric lobes of radio emission. this demonstrates that these lobes arisedue to an agn rather than a compact nuclear starburst. the low-frequency radiocontinuum observations made with the gmrt detect the extended emission on thewestern side of the galaxy whose spectral index is flatter at higherfrequencies and suggests that it is a mixture of thermal and non-thermalemission.  the hi observations show an elongated structure which is displaced by ~4.1kpc on the western side of ngc4438 and has a size of ~9.8 kpc and a mass of1.8*10^8 m_sun. the velocity field suggests systematic rotation. we also detecthi emission from the disk of the galaxy with a mass of 1.2*10^8 m_sun. wedetect a faint hi tail towards the north of ngc4438 close to a stellar tailseen in deep optical observations. this hi tail has a total extent of ~50 kpcand a mass of 1.4*10^8 m_sun if it is at the distance of ngc4438. the velocityof the hi tail is ~-10 km/s similar to that of hi emission from ic 3355, butthe possibility that the tail could be foreground galactic emission cannot beruled out. we discuss the different structures in the light of differentmodels.

0904.2878	a complete sample of 21-cm absorbers at z~1.3: giant metrewave radio  telescope survey using mgii systems	we present the results of a systematic giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt)survey of 21-cm absorption in a representative and unbiased sample of 35 strongmgii systems in the redshift range: zabs~1.10-1.45, 33 of which have w_r&gt;1 \aa.the survey using ~400hrs of telescope time has resulted in 9 new 21-cmdetections and stringent 21-cm optical depth upper limits (median 3-sigmaoptical depth per 10 km/s of 0.017) for the remaining 26 systems. this is byfar the largest number of 21-cm detections from any single survey ofintervening absorbers. prior to our survey no intervening 21-cm system wasknown in the above redshift range and only one system was known in the redshiftrange 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5. we discuss the relation between the detectability of 21-cmabsorption and various properties of uv absorption lines. we show that if mgiisystems are selected with the following criteria, mgii doublet ratio &lt;1.3 andw_r(mgi)/w_r(mgii)&gt;0.3, then a detection rate of 21-cm absorption up to 90% canbe achieved. we estimate n_{21}, the number per unit redshift of 21-cmabsorbers with w_r(mg(ii)&gt;w_o and integrated optical depth tau_{21}&gt;tau_o andshow that n_{21} decreases with increasing redshift. in particular, for w_o=1.0\aa and tau_o&gt;0.3 km\s, n_{21} falls by a factor 4 from &lt;z&gt;=0.5 to &lt;z&gt;=1.3. theevolution seems to be stronger for stronger mgii systems. using a subsample ofsystems for which high frequency vlba images are available, we show that theeffect is not related to the structure of the background radio sources and ismost probably due to the evolution of the cold neutral medium filling factor inmgii systems. we find no correlation between the velocity spread of the 21-cmabsorption feature and w_r(mgii) at z~1.3.

0905.0449	spectral ages of giant radio sources	multifrequency observations with the gmrt and the vla are used to determinethe spectral breaks in consecutive strips along the lobes of a sample ofselected giant radio sources (grss) in order to estimate their spectral ages.the maximum spectral ages estimated for the detected radio emission in thelobes of our sample of ten sources has a median value of $\sim$20 myr. thespectral ages of these grss are significantly older than smaller sources. inall but one source (j1313+6937) the spectral age gradually increases withdistance from the hotspot regions, confirming that acceleration of theparticles mainly occurs in the hotspots. most of the grss do not exhibit zerospectral ages in the hotspots. this is likely to be largely due tocontamination by more extended emission due to relatively modest resolutions.the injection spectral indices range from $\sim$0.55 to 0.88 with a medianvalue of $\sim$0.6. we show that the injection spectral index appears to becorrelated with luminosity and/or redshift as well as with linear size.

0912.4354	a multiwavelength study of a young, z-shaped, fr i radio galaxy ngc 3801	we present preliminary results from a multi-wavelength study of a mergercandidate, ngc3801, hosting a young fr i radio galaxy, with a z-shapedstructure. analysing archival data from the vla, we find two hi emission blobson either side of the host galaxy, suggesting a 30 kpc sized rotating gas diskaligned with stellar rotation, but rotating significantly faster than thestars. broad, faint, blue-shifted absorption wing and an hi absorption clumpassociated with the shocked shell around the eastern lobe are also seen,possibly due to an jet-driven outflow. while 8.0 um dust and pah emission, fromspitzer and near and far uv emission from galex is seen on a large scale in ans-shape, partially coinciding with the hi emission blobs, it reveals a ~2 kpcradius ring-like, dusty, starforming structure in the nuclear region,orthogonal to the radio jet axis. its similarities with kinematically decoupledcore galaxies and other evidences have been argued for a merger origin of thisyoung, bent jet radio galaxy.

1002.1841	recurrent activity in active galactic nuclei	there has been a growing body of evidence to suggest that agn activity, whichis powered by mass accretion on to a supermasive black hole, could be episodic,although the range of time scales involved needs to be explored further. thestructure and spectra of radio emission from radio galaxies, whose sizes rangeup to $\sim$5 mpc, contain information on the history of agn activity in thesource. they thus provide a unique opportunity to study the time scales ofrecurrent agn activity. the most striking examples of recurrent activity inradio galaxies and quasars are the double-double or triple-double radio sourceswhich contain two or three pairs of distinct lobes on opposite sides of theparent optical object. spectral and dynamical ages of these lobes could be usedto constrain time scales of episodic activity. inverse-compton scattered cosmicmicrowave background radiation could in principle probe lower lorentz-factorparticles than radio observations of synchrotron emission, and thereby revealan older population. we review briefly the radio continuum as well as molecularand atomic gas properties of radio sources which exhibit recurrent or episodicactivity, and present a few cases of quasars which require further observationsto confirm their episodic nature. we also illustrate evidence of episodic agnactivity in radio sources in clusters of galaxies.

1005.2950	radio polarimetry of 3c119, 3c318, and 3c343 at milliarcsecond  resolution	we report vlba polarimetric observations of the css sources 3c119, 3c318, and3c343 at 5 and 8.4 ghz. the css source 3c119 has source rest-frame rm values upto ~10200 rad/m**2 in a region which coincides with a change in the directionof the inner jet. this component is located ~325 pc from the core, which isvariable and has a peaked radio spectrum. in the case of 3c318, a rest-frame rmof ~3030 rad/m**2 has been estimated for the brightest component whichcontributes almost all of the polarised emission. further, two more extendedcomponents have been detected, clearly showing "wiggles" in the jet towards thesouthern side of the source. the css source 3c343 contains two peaks ofemission and a curved jet embedded in more diffuse emission. it exhibitscomplex field directions near the emission peaks, which indicate rest-frame rmvalues in excess of ~6000 rad/m**2. the locations of the cores in 3c318 and3c343 are not clear. the available data on mas-scale rest-frame rm estimatesfor css sources show that these have a wide range of values extending up to~40000 rad/m**2 in the central region of oq172, and could be located atprojected distances from the core of up to ~1600 pc, as in 3c43 where thisfeature has a rest-frame rm of ~14000 rad/m**2. rm estimates for cores incore-dominated radio sources indicate that in addition to responding to anoverall density gradient of the magneto-ionic medium, geometry, orientation andmodes of fuelling may also play a significant role. in addition to theseeffects, the high values of rm in css sources are possibly due to dense cloudsof gas interacting with the radio jets. the observed distortions in the radiostructures of many css sources are consistent with this interpretation.

1107.4742	discovery of a spiral-host episodic radio-galaxy	we report the discovery of a unique radio galaxy at z=0.137, which couldpossibly be the second spiral-host large radio galaxy and also the secondtriple-double episodic radio galaxy. the host galaxy shows signs of recent starformation in the uv but is optically red and is the brightest galaxy of apossible cluster. the outer relic radio lobes of this galaxy, separated by ~1mpc, show evidence of spectral flattening and a high fraction of linearpolarisation. we interpret that these relic lobes have experiencedre-acceleration of particles and compression of the magnetic field due toshocks in the cluster outskirts. from the morphology of the relics and galaxydistribution, we argue that re-acceleration is unlikely to be due to acluster-cluster merger and suggest the possibility of accretion shocks. thesource was identified from sdss, galex, nvss and first survey data but we alsopresent follow up optical observations with the lulin telescope and 325 mhz lowfrequency radio observations with the gmrt. we briefly discuss the scientificpotential of this example in understanding the evolution of galaxies andclusters by accretion, mergers, star formation, and agn feedback.

0712.0162	a multifrequency study of giant radio sources-ii. spectral ageing  analysis of the lobes of selected sources	multifrequency observations with the gmrt and the vla are used to determinethe spectral breaks in consecutive strips along the lobes of a sample ofselected giant radio sources (grss) in order to estimate their spectral ages.the maximum spectral ages estimated for the detected radio emission in thelobes of our sources range from $\sim$6 to 36 myr with a median value of$\sim$20 myr using the classical equipartition fields. using the magnetic fieldestimates from the beck &amp; krause formalism the spectral ages range from $\sim$5to 38 myr with a median value of $\sim$22 myr. these ages are significantlyolder than smaller sources. in all but one source (j1313+6937) the spectral agegradually increases with distance from the hotspot regions, confirming thatacceleration of the particles mainly occurs in the hotspots. most of the grssdo not exhibit zero spectral ages in the hotspots, as is the case in earlierstudies of smaller sources. this is likely to be largely due to contaminationby more extended emission due to relatively modest resolutions. the injectionspectral indices range from $\sim$0.55 to 0.88 with a median value of$\sim$0.6. we discuss these values in the light of theoretical expectations,and show that the injection spectral index appears to be correlated withluminosity and/or redshift as well as with linear size.

astro-ph;0411628	a radio study of the superwind galaxy ngc1482	we present multifrequency radio continuum as well as hi observations of thesuperwind galaxy ngc1482, with both the gmrt and the vla. this galaxy has aremarkable hourglass-shaped optical emission line outflow as well as bi-polarsoft x-ray bubbles on opposite sides of the galactic disk. the low-frequency,lower-resolution radio observations show a smooth structure. from thenon-thermal emission, we estimate the available energy in supernovae, andexamine whether this would be adequate to drive the observed superwind outflow.the high-frequency, high-resolution radio images of the central starburstregion located at the base of the superwind bi-cone shows one prominent peakand more extended emission with substructure. this image has been compared withthe infrared, optical red-continuum, h_alpha, and, soft and hard x-ray imagesfrom chandra. the peak of infrared emission is the only feature which iscoincident with the prominent radio peak, and possibly defines the centre ofthe galaxy. the hi observations with the gmrt show two blobs of emission onopposite sides of the central region. these are rotating about the centre ofthe galaxy and are located at ~2.4 kpc from it. in addition, these observationsalso reveal a multicomponent hi-absorption profile against the central regionof the radio source, with a total width of ~250 km/s. the extreme blue- andred-shifted absorption components are at 1688 and 1942 km/s respectively, whilethe peak absorption is at 1836 km/s. this is consistent with the heliocentricsystemic velocity of 1850+/-20 km/s, estimated from a variety of observations.we discuss possible implications of these results.

astro-ph;0505125	outflowing material in the css quasar 3c48: evidence of jet-cloud  interaction?	we report the detection of a zabs=0.3654 associated absorption-line system inthe uv spectrum of the css quasar 3c48. the absorbing material is blue shiftedwith respect to the quasar emission-line redshift, zem=0.3700, suggesting anoutflow velocity of ~1000 km/s. we detect absorption lines over a range ofionization states from ly-beta, ly-gamma, civ, niv, svi to ovi and possibly oivand neviii. the kinematical properties of the absorption-line system aresimilar to the blue-shifted emission line gas seen in [oiii]\lambda5007(chatzichristou, vanderriest &amp; jaffe 1999), which is believed to haveinteracted with the radio jet. we study the properties of the absorbingmaterial using cloudy and find that photoionization models with solar abundanceratios (with overall metallicity in the range 0.1&lt;z/z$_\odot$&lt;1.3) are enoughto explain the observed column densities of all the species except neviii,detection of which requires confirmation. since the cooling and recombinationtime for the gas is ~10^5 yr, the consistency with the photoionization modelssuggests that any possible interaction of absorbing material with the jet musthave taken place before ~10^5 yr. the abundance ratio of nitrogen to carbon isclose to solar values, unlike in the case of most quasars, especially athigh-redshifts, which have super-solar values. we observed 3c48 with the giantmetrewave radio telescope (gmrt) to search for redshifted 21cm hi absorption.however, we did not detect any significant feature in our spectra and estimatethe 3-sigma upper limit to the optical depth to be in the range 0.001 to 0.003.however, due to the diffuse nature of the radio source, optical depths as highas 0.1 towards individual knots or compact components cannot be ruled out.

astro-ph;0605399	unification scheme and the distribution of neutral gas in compact radio  sources	we examine the consistency of hi properties with the unification scheme forradio galaxies and quasars, and any correlation with the symmetry parametersfor a sample of css and gps sources. in our sample, 15 out of 23 galaxiesexhibit 21-cm absorption as against 1 out of 9 quasars, which is broadlyconsistent with the unification scheme. also there is a tendency for thedetection rate as well as the column density for galaxies to increase with coreprominence, f_c, a statistical indicator of the orientation of the jet axis tothe line of sight. this can be understood in a scenario where radio sources arelarger than the scale of the circumnuclear hi disk so that the lines of sightto the lobes at very large inclinations do not intersect the disk. the sourcesin our sample also exhibit the known anti-correlation between hi column densityand source size. this suggests that small linear size, along with intermediatevalues of core prominence, is a good recipe for detecting 21-cm absorption incss and gps objects. some of the absorption could also be arising from cloudswhich may have interacted with the radio jet. the hi column density andvelocity shift of the primary absorption component, however, show no dependenceon the degree of misalignment and the separation ratio of the radio sources.

astro-ph;0605423	probing radio source environments via hi and oh absorption	we present the results of hi and oh absorption measurements towards a sampleof radio sources using the arecibo 305-m telescope and the gmrt. in total, 27radio sources were searched for associated 21-cm hi absorption. one totally newhi absorption system was detected against the radio galaxy 3c258, while fivepreviously known hi absorption systems, and one galaxy detected in emission,were studied with improved frequency resolution and/or sensitivity. our sampleincluded 17 gps and css objects, 4 of which exhibit hi absorption. thisdetection rate of ~25% compares with a value of ~40% by vermeulen et al. forsimilar sources. we detected neither oh emission nor absorption towards any ofthe sources that were observed at arecibo, and estimate a limit on theabundance ratio of n(hi)/n(oh)&gt;4x10^6 for 3c258. we have combined our resultswith those from other available hi searches to compile a heterogeneous sampleof 96 radio sources consisting of 27 gps, 35 css, 13 flat spectrum and 21 largesources. the hi absorption detection rate is highest (~45%) for the gps sourcesand least for the large sources. we find hi column density to be anticorrelatedwith source size, as reported earlier by pihlstr\"om et al. the hi columndensity shows no significant dependence on either redshift or luminosity, whichare themselves strongly correlated. these results suggest that the environmentsof radio sources on gps/css scales are similar at different redshifts. further,in accordance with the unification scheme, the gps/css galaxies have an hidetection rate of ~40% which is significantly higher than the detection rate(~20%) towards the gps/css quasars. also, the principal (strongest) absorptioncomponent detected towards gps sources appears blue-shifted in ~65% of thecases, in agreement with the growing evidence for jet-cloud interactions.

astro-ph;9811332	polarization of radio cores as a test of the unified schemes	in the unified schemes for extragalactic radio sources, the quasars and bllac objects are intrinsically similar to the fanaroff-riley class ii and iradio galaxies respectively, but appear to be different because they are viewedat different angles to the line-of-sight. the quasars and bl lac objects areobserved at small viewing angles while the radio galaxies lie close to theplane of the sky. in such schemes, the quasar or bl lac nucleus is hidden fromour view by a putative torus when the source is inclined at a large angle tothe line-of-sight and appears as a radio galaxy. such a scenario should alsoaffect the observed polarization properties of the cores, with the cores in theradio galaxies and weak-cored quasars being less polarized than thecore-dominated quasars and bl lacs due to faraday depolarization by themagnetoionic medium in the obscuring torus or disk. in this paper, we reportthat the core polarization of radio galaxies and weak-cored quasars is indeedmuch smaller than for the core-dominated quasars and bl lacs. we suggest thatthis is due to the depolarization caused by the obscuring torus or disk,providing further evidence in favour of the unified schemes.

astro-ph;9902252	giant radio sources	we present multi-frequency vla observations of two giant quasars, 0437-244and 1025-229, from the molonglo complete sample. these sources havewell-defined frii radio structure, possible one-sided jets, no significantdepolarization between 1365 and 4935 mhz and low rotation measure ($\mid rm\mid &lt; 20 rad/m^2$). the giant sources are defined to be those whose overallprojected size is $\geq$ 1 mpc. we have compiled a sample of about 50 knowngiant radio sources from the literature, and have compared some of theirproperties with a complete sample of 3cr radio sources of smaller sizes toinvestigate the evolution of giant sources, and test their consistency with theunified scheme for radio galaxies and quasars. we find an inverse correlationbetween the degree of core prominence and total radio luminosity, and show thatthe giant radio sources have similar core strengths to the smaller sources ofsimilar total luminosity. hence their large sizes are unlikely to be due tostronger nuclear activity. the degree of collinearity of the giant sources isalso similar to the sample of smaller sources. the luminosity-size diagramshows that the giant sources are less luminous than our sample of smaller-sized3cr sources, consistent with evolutionary scenarios where the giants haveevolved from the smaller sources losing energy as they expand to these largedimensions. for the smaller sources, radiative losses due to synchrotronradiation is more significant while for the giant sources the equipartitionmagnetic fields are smaller and inverse compton losses with the microwavebackground radiation is the dominant process. the radio properties of the giantradio galaxies and quasars are consistent with the unified scheme.
