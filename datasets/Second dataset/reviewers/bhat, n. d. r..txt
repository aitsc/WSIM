0908.0244	timing stability of millisecond pulsars and prospects for  gravitational-wave detection	analysis of high-precision timing observations of an array of approx. 20millisecond pulsars (a so-called "timing array") may ultimately result in thedetection of a stochastic gravitational-wave background. the feasibility ofsuch a detection and the required duration of this type of experiment aredetermined by the achievable rms of the timing residuals and the timingstability of the pulsars involved. we present results of the first long-term,high-precision timing campaign on a large sample of millisecond pulsars used ingravitational-wave detection projects. we show that the timing residuals ofmost pulsars in our sample do not contain significant low-frequency noise thatcould limit the use of these pulsars for decade-long gravitational-wavedetection efforts. for our most precisely timed pulsars, intrinsicinstabilities of the pulsars or the observing system are shown to contribute totiming irregularities on a five-year timescale below the 100 ns level. based onthose results, realistic sensitivity curves for planned and ongoing timingarray efforts are determined. we conclude that prospects for detection of agravitational-wave background through pulsar timing array efforts within fiveyears to a decade are good.

1006.5744	the high time resolution universe pulsar survey i: system configuration  and initial discoveries	we have embarked on a survey for pulsars and fast transients using the13-beam multibeam receiver on the parkes radio telescope. installation of adigital backend allows us to record 400 mhz of bandwidth for each beam, splitinto 1024 channels and sampled every 64 us. limits of the receiver packagerestrict us to a 340 mhz observing band centred at 1352 mhz. the factor ofeight improvement in frequency resolution over previous multibeam surveysallows us to probe deeper into the galactic plane for short duration signalssuch as the pulses from millisecond pulsars. we plan to survey the entiresouthern sky in 42641 pointings, split into low, mid and high galactic latituderegions, with integration times of 4200, 540 and 270 s respectively.simulations suggest that we will discover 400 pulsars, of which 75 will bemillisecond pulsars. with ~30% of the mid-latitude survey complete, we havere-detected 223 previously known pulsars and discovered 27 pulsars, 5 of whichare millisecond pulsars. the newly discovered millisecond pulsars tend to havelarger dispersion measures than those discovered in previous surveys, asexpected from the improved time and frequency resolution of our instrument.

1008.3607	measuring the mass of solar system planets using pulsar timing	high-precision pulsar timing relies on a solar-system ephemeris in order toconvert times of arrival (toas) of pulses measured at an observatory to thesolar system barycenter. any error in the conversion to the barycentric toasleads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically,an incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variationhaving a period and phase associated with the planet's orbital motion about thesun. by using an array of pulsars (psrs j0437-4715, j1744-1134, j1857+0943,j1909-3744), the masses of the planetary systems from mercury to saturn havebeen determined. these masses are consistent with the best-known massesdetermined by spacecraft observations, with the mass of the jovian system,9.547921(2)e-4 msun, being significantly more accurate than the mass determinedfrom the pioneer and voyager spacecraft, and consistent with but less accuratethan the value from the galileo spacecraft. while spacecraft are likely toproduce the most accurate measurements for individual solar system bodies, thepulsar technique is sensitive to planetary system masses and has the potentialto provide the most accurate values of these masses for some planets.

1101.4778	the high time resolution universe survey ii: discovery of 5 millisecond  pulsars	we present the discovery of 5 millisecond pulsars found in the mid-galacticlatitude portion of the high time resolution universe (htru) survey. thepulsars have rotational periods from ~2.3 to ~7.5 ms, and all are in binarysystems with orbital periods ranging from ~0.3 to ~150 d. in four of thesesystems, the most likely companion is a white dwarf, with minimum masses of~0.2 solar masses. the other pulsar, j1731-1847, has a very low mass companionand exhibits eclipses, and is thus a member of the "black widow" class ofpulsar binaries. these eclipses have been observed in bands centred nearfrequencies of 700, 1400 and 3000 mhz, from which measurements have been madeof the electron density in the eclipse region. these measurements have beenused to examine some possible eclipse mechanisms. the eclipse and otherproperties of this source are used to perform a comparison with the other knowneclipsing and "black widow" pulsars.  these new discoveries occupy a short-period and high-dispersion measure (dm)region of parameter space, which we demonstrate is a direct consequence of thehigh time and frequency resolution of the htru survey. the large implieddistances to our new discoveries makes observation of their companions unlikelywith both current optical telescopes and the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.the extremely circular orbits make any advance of periastron measurementshighly unlikely. no relativistic shapiro delays are obvious in any of thesystems, although the low flux densities would make their detection difficultunless the orbits were fortuitously edge-on.

1110.2562	searches for radio transients	exploration of the transient universe is an exciting and fast-emerging areawithin radio astronomy. known transient phenomena range in time scales fromsub-nanoseconds to years or longer, thus spanning a huge range in time domainand hinting a rich diversity in their underlying physical processes. transientphenomena are likely locations of explosive or dynamic events and they offertremendous potential to uncover new physics and astrophysics. a number ofupcoming next-generation radio facilities and recent advances in computing andinstrumentation have provided a much needed impetus for this field which hasremained a relatively uncharted territory for the past several decades. in thispaper we focus mainly on the class of phenomena that occur on very short timescales (i.e. from $\sim$ milliseconds to $\sim$ nanoseconds), known as {\itfast transients}, the detections of which involve considerable signalprocessing and data management challenges, given the high time and frequencyresolutions required in their explorations, the role of propagation effects tobe considered and a multitude of deleterious effects due to radio frequencyinterference. we will describe the techniques, strategies and challengesinvolved in their detections and review the world-wide efforts currently underway, both through scientific discoveries enabled by the ongoing large-scalesurveys at parkes and arecibo, as well as technical developments involving theexploratory use of multi-element array instruments such as vlba and gmrt. suchdevelopments will undoubtedly provide valuable inputs as next-generation arrayssuch as lofar and askap are designed and commissioned. with their wider fieldsof view and higher sensitivities, these instruments, and eventually the ska,hold great potential to revolutionise this relatively nascent field, therebyopening up exciting new science avenues in astrophysics.

1203.6068	the high time resolution universe survey - v: single-pulse energetics  and modulation properties of 315 pulsars	we report on the pulse-to-pulse energy distributions and phase-resolvedmodulation properties for catalogued pulsars in the southern high timeresolution universe intermediate-latitude survey. we selected the 315 pulsarsdetected in a single-pulse search of this survey, allowing a large sampleunbiased regarding any rotational parameters of neutron stars. we found thatthe energy distribution of many pulsars is well-described by a log-normaldistribution, with few deviating from a small range in log-normal scale andlocation parameters. some pulsars exhibited multiple energy statescorresponding to mode changes, and implying that some observed "nulling" mayactually be a mode-change effect. psrj1900-2600 was found to emit weakly in itspreviously-identified "null" state. we found evidence for another state-changeeffect in two pulsars, which show bimodality in their nulling time scales; thatis, they switch between a continuous-emission state and a single-pulse-emittingstate. large modulation occurs in many pulsars across the full integratedprofile, with increased sporadic bursts at leading and trailing sub-beam edges.some of these high-energy outbursts may indicate the presence of "giant pulse"phenomena. we found no correlation with modulation and pulsar period, age, orother parameters. finally, the deviation of integrated pulse energy from itsaverage value was generally quite small, despite the significant phase-resolvedmodulation in some pulsars; we interpret this as tenuous evidence of energyregulation between distinct pulsar sub-beams.

1204.2045	radio emission evolution, polarimetry and multifrequency single pulse  analysis of the radio magnetar psr j1622-4950	here we report on observations of the radio magnetar psr j1622-4950 atfrequencies from 1.4 to 17 ghz. we show that although its flux density isvarying up to a factor of ~10 within a few days, it has on average decreased bya factor of 2 over the last 700 days. at the same time, timing analysisindicates a trend of decreasing spin-down rate over our entire data set, againof about a factor of 2 over 700 days, but also an erratic variability in thespin-down rate within this time span. integrated pulse profiles are often closeto 100 per cent linearly polarized, but large variations in both the profileshape and fractional polarization are regularly observed. furthermore, thebehaviour of the position angle of the linear polarization is very complex -offsets in both the absolute position angle and the phase of the position anglesweep are often seen and the occasional presence of orthogonal mode jumpsfurther complicates the picture. however, model fitting indicates that themagnetic and rotation axes are close to aligned. finally, a single pulseanalysis has been carried out at four observing frequencies, demonstrating thatthe wide pulse profile is built up of narrow spikes of emission, with widthsthat scale inversely with observing frequency. all three of the known radiomagnetars seem to have similar characteristics, with highly polarized emission,time-variable flux density and pulse profiles, and with spectral indices closeto zero.

1208.1228	two millisecond pulsars discovered by the palfa survey and a shapiro  delay measurement	we present two millisecond pulsar discoveries from the palfa survey of thegalactic plane with the arecibo telescope. psr j1955+2527 is an isolated pulsarwith a period of 4.87 ms, and psr j1949+3106 has a period of 13.14 ms and is ina 1.9-day binary system with a massive companion. their timing solutions, basedon 4 years of timing measurements with the arecibo, green bank, nan\c{c}ay andjodrell bank telescopes, allow precise determination of spin and astrometricparameters, including precise determinations of their proper motions. for psrj1949+3106, we can clearly detect the shapiro delay. from this we measure thepulsar mass to be 1.47(+0.43/-0.31) solar masses, the companion mass to be0.85(+0.14/-0.11) solar masses and the orbital inclination to be i =79.9(+1.6/-1.9) degrees, where uncertainties correspond to +/- 1-\sigma\confidence levels. with continued timing, we expect to also be able to detectthe advance of periastron for the j1949+3106 system. this effect, combined withthe shapiro delay, will eventually provide very precise mass measurements forthis system and a test of general relativity.

1211.5887	measurement and correction of variations in interstellar dispersion in  high-precision pulsar timing	signals from radio pulsars show a wavelength-dependent delay due todispersion in the interstellar plasma. at a typical observing wavelength, thisdelay can vary by tens of microseconds on five-year time scales, far in excessof signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays, such as that induced by agravitational-wave background. measurement of these delay variations is notonly crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides anunparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. inthis paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independentred-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion canattenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. we present a robustmethod for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply itto observations from the parkes pulsar timing array. correction for dispersionvariations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. we discussscheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such asscintillation, that can exacerbate the problem. comparison with scintillationmeasurements confirms previous results that the spectral exponent of electrondensity variations in the interstellar medium often appears steeper thanexpected. we also find a discrete change in dispersion measure of psrj1603-7202 of ~2x10^{-3} cm^{-3}pc for about 250 days. we speculate that thishas a similar origin to the 'extreme scattering events' seen in other sources.in addition, we find that four pulsars show a wavelength-dependent annualvariation, indicating a persistent gradient of electron density on an auspatial scale, which has not been reported previously.

(2013) has revealed a populationof frbs in the high time resolution universe (htru) survey at high galacticlatitudes. a variety of progenitors have been proposed including cataclysmicevents at cosmological distances, galactic flare stars, and terrestrial radiofrequency interference. here we report on a search for frbs at intermediategalactic latitudes ($-15^{\circ}$ $&lt; b &lt;$ 15$^{\circ}$) in data taken as partof the htru survey. no frbs were discovered in this region. several effectssuch as dispersion, scattering, sky temperature and scintillation decrease thesensitivity by more than 3$\sigma$ in $\sim$20\% of survey pointings. includingall of these effects, we exclude the hypothesis that frbs are uniformlydistributed on the sky with 99\% confidence. this low probability implies thatadditional factors -- not accounted for by standard galactic models -- must beincluded to ease the discrepancy between the detection rates at high and lowgalactic latitudes. a revised rate estimate or another strong and heretoforeunknown selection effect in galactic latitude would provide closer agreementbetween the surveys' detection rates. the dearth of detections at low galacticlatitude disfavors a galactic origin for these bursts.

1405.7953	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iii. precursor survey and population  synthesis	the pulsar arecibo l-band feed array (palfa) survey uses the alfa 7-beamreceiver to search both inner and outer galactic sectors visible from arecibo($32^{\circ}\lesssim \ell \lesssim 77^{\circ}$ and $168^{\circ}\lesssim \ell  \lesssim 214^{\circ}$) close to the galactic plane ($|b|\lesssim5^{\circ}$)for pulsars. in this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region withpalfa, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in$\ell$ and $|b|\lesssim1^{\circ}$) and detected 45 pulsars. for both galacticmillisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detectionswith simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate thenumber of observable pulsars in the galaxy. we place 95\% confidence intervalsof 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9,000 to100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk.these are consistent with previous estimates. given the most likely populationsize in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars,respectively) we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, whencomplete, the full palfa survey should have detected $1,000\substack{+330 \\-230}$ normal pulsars and $30\substack{+200 \\ -20}$ millisecond pulsars.identical estimation techniques predict that $490\substack{+160 \\ -115}$normal pulsars and $12\substack{+70 \\ -5}$ millisecond pulsars would bedetected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the palfa survey had detected283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively.

1406.4716	limitations in timing precision due to single-pulse shape variability in  millisecond pulsars	high-sensitivity radio-frequency observations of millisecond pulsars usuallyshow stochastic, broadband, pulse-shape variations intrinsic to the pulsaremission process. these variations induce jitter noise in pulsar timingobservations; understanding the properties of this noise is of particularimportance for the effort to detect gravitational waves with pulsar timingarrays. we assess the short-term profile and timing stability of 22 millisecondpulsars that are part of the parkes pulsar timing array sample by examiningintra-observation arrival time variability and single-pulse phenomenology. in 7of the 22 pulsars, in the band centred at approximately 1400mhz, we find thatthe brightest observations are limited by intrinsic jitter. we find consistentresults, either detections or upper limits, for jitter noise in other frequencybands. psr j1909-3744 shows the lowest levels of jitter noise, which weestimate to contribute $\sim$10 ns root mean square error to the arrival timesfor hour-duration observations. larger levels of jitter noise are found inpulsars with wider pulses and distributions of pulse intensities. the jitternoise in psr j0437-4715 decorrelates over a bandwidth of $\sim$2 ghz. we showthat the uncertainties associated with timing pulsar models can be improved byincluding physically motivated jitter uncertainties. pulse-shape variationswill limit the timing precision at future, more sensitive, telescopes; it isimperative to account for this noise when designing instrumentation and timingcampaigns for these facilities.

1407.1943	wsclean: an implementation of a fast, generic wide-field imager for  radio astronomy	astronomical widefield imaging of interferometric radio data iscomputationally expensive, especially for the large data volumes created bymodern non-coplanar many-element arrays. we present a new widefieldinterferometric imager that uses the w-stacking algorithm and can make use ofthe w-snapshot algorithm. the performance dependencies of casa's w-projectionand our new imager are analysed and analytical functions are derived thatdescribe the required computing cost for both imagers. on data from themurchison widefield array, we find our new method to be an order of magnitudefaster than w-projection, as well as being capable of full-sky imaging at fullresolution and with correct polarisation correction. we predict the computingcosts for several other arrays and estimate that our imager is a factor of 2-12faster, depending on the array configuration. we estimate the computing costfor imaging the low-frequency square-kilometre array observations to be 60petaflops with current techniques. we find that combining w-stacking with thew-snapshot algorithm does not significantly improve computing requirements overpure w-stacking. the source code of our new imager is publicly released.

1411.1288	the high time resolution universe survey - xi. discovery of five  recycled pulsars and the optical detectability of survey white dwarf  companions	we present the discovery of a further five recycled pulsar systems in themid-galactic latitude portion of the high time resolution universe (htru)survey. the pulsars have rotational periods ranging from 2 ms to 66 ms, andfour are in binary systems with orbital periods between 10.8 hours and 9.0days. three of these binary systems are particularly interesting; psrj1227-6208 has a pulse period of 34.5 ms and the highest mass function of allpulsars with near-circular orbits. the circular orbit suggests that thecompanion is not another neutron star, so future timing experiments may revealone of the heaviest white dwarfs ever found ($&gt;$ 1.3 m$_\odot$). timingobservations of psr j1431$-$4715 indicate that it is eclipsed by its companionwhich has a mass indicating it belongs to the redback class of eclipsingmillisecond pulsars. psr j1653-2054 has a companion with a minimum mass of only$0.08$ m$_\odot$, placing it among the class of pulsars with low-masscompanions. unlike the majority of such systems, however, no evidence ofeclipses is seen at 1.4 ghz.

1411.1487	modelling of the spectral energy distribution of fornax a: leptonic and  hadronic production of high energy emission from the radio lobes	we present new low-frequency observations of the nearby radio galaxy fornax aat 154 mhz with the murchison widefield array, microwave flux-densitymeasurements obtained from wmap and planck data, and gamma-ray flux densitiesobtained from fermi data. we also compile a comprehensive list of previouslypublished images and flux-density measurements at radio, microwave and x-rayenergies. a detailed analysis of the spectrum of fornax a between 154 mhz and1510 mhz reveals that both radio lobes have a similar spatially-averagedspectral index, and that there exists a steep-spectrum bridge of diffuseemission between the lobes. taking the spectral index of both lobes to be thesame, we model the spectral energy distribution of fornax a across an energyrange spanning eighteen orders of magnitude, to investigate the origin of thex-ray and gamma-ray emission. a standard leptonic model for the production ofboth the x-rays and gamma-rays by inverse-compton scattering does not fit themulti-wavelength observations. our results best support a scenario where thex-rays are produced by inverse-compton scattering and the gamma-rays areproduced primarily by hadronic processes confined to the filamentary structuresof the fornax a lobes.

1412.0342	a real-time fast radio burst: polarization detection and multiwavelength  follow-up	fast radio bursts (frbs) are one of the most tantalizing mysteries of theradio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapidmultiwavelength follow-up of an frb has been possible. new instrumentation hasdecreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, andenables polarimetry to be performed on frbs for the first time. we havediscovered an frb (frb 140514) in real-time on 14 may, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 utcat the parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengthswithin hours of the event. frb 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (dm)of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z\lesssim 0.5$. frb 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularlypolarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linearpolarization $&lt;10%$. we conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to thefrb. if there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected fromcoherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by faraday rotation causedby passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. frb140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known frb fields, andlies close to a previous discovery, frb 110220; based on the difference in dmsof these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity tosampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. follow-up conductedby 12 telescopes observing from x-ray to radio wavelengths was unable toidentify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out modelsin which frbs originate from nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) supernovae and long durationgamma-ray bursts.

1503.01841	a study of multi-frequency polarization pulse profiles of millisecond  pulsars	we present high signal-to-noise ratio, multi-frequency polarization pulseprofiles for 24 millisecond pulsars that are being observed as part of theparkes pulsar timing array (ppta) project. the pulsars are observed in threebands, centred close to 730, 1400 and 3100 mhz, using a dual-band 10 cm/50 cmreceiver and the central beam of the 20 cm multibeam receiver. observationsspanning approximately six years have been carefully calibrated and summed toproduce high s/n profiles. this allows us to study the individual profilecomponents and in particular how they evolve with frequency. we also identifypreviously undetected profile features. for many pulsars we show that pulsedemission extends across almost the entire pulse profile. the pulse componentwidths and component separations follow a complex evolution with frequency; insome cases these parameters increase and in other cases they decrease withincreasing frequency. the evolution with frequency of the polarizationproperties of the profile is also non-trivial. we provide evidence that thepre- and post-cursors generally have higher fractional linear polarization thanthe main pulse. we have obtained the spectral index and rotation measure foreach pulsar by fitting across all three observing bands. for the majority ofpulsars, the spectra follow a single power-law and the position angles follow a$\lambda^2$ relation, as expected. however, clear deviations are seen for somepulsars. we also present phase-resolved measurements of the spectral index,fractional linear polarization and rotation measure. all these properties areshown to vary systematically over the pulse profile.

1504.02165	identifying the source of perytons at the parkes radio telescope	"perytons" are millisecond-duration transients of terrestrial origin, whosefrequency-swept emission mimics the dispersion of an astrophysical pulse thathas propagated through tenuous cold plasma. in fact, their similarity to frb010724 had previously cast a shadow over the interpretation of "fast radiobursts," which otherwise appear to be of extragalactic origin. until now, thephysical origin of the dispersion-mimicking perytons had remained a mystery. wehave identified strong out-of-band emission at 2.3--2.5 ghz associated withseveral peryton events. subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can begenerated at 1.4 ghz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and thetelescope is at an appropriate relative angle. radio emission escaping frommicrowave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explain all of theobserved properties of the peryton signals. now that the peryton source hasbeen identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwaves on site couldnot have caused frb 010724. this and other distinct observational differencesshow that frbs are excellent candidates for genuine extragalactic transients.

astro-ph;0207451	a clean-based method for deconvolving interstellar pulse broadening from  radio pulses	multipath propagation in the interstellar medium distorts radio pulses, aneffect predominant for distant pulsars observed at low frequencies. typically,broadened pulses are analyzed to determine the amount of propagation-inducedpulse broadening, but with little interest in determining the undistorted pulseshapes. in this paper we develop and apply a method that recovers both theintrinsic pulse shape and the pulse broadening function that describes thescattering of an impulse. the method resembles the clean algorithm used insynthesis imaging applications, although we search for the best pulsebroadening function, and perform a true deconvolution to recover intrinsicpulse structre. as figures of merit to optimize the deconvolution, we use thepositivity and symmetry of the deconvolved result along with the mean squareresidual and the number of points below a given threshold. our method makes noprior assumptions about the intrinsic pulse shape and can be used for a rangeof scattering functions for the interstellar medium. it can therefore beapplied to a wider variety of measured pulse shapes and degrees of scatteringthan the previous approaches. we apply the technique to both simulated data anddata from arecibo observations.

astro-ph;0304495	the brightest pulses in the universe: multifrequency observations of the  crab pulsar's giant pulses	we analyze the crab pulsar at ten frequencies from 0.43 to 8.8 ghz using dataobtained at the arecibo observatory. giant pulses occur only in the main andinterpulse components manifest from radio frequencies to gamma-ray energies.individual giant pulses reach brightness temperatures of at least $10^{32}$k inour data, which do not resolve the narrowest pulses, and are known to reach$10^{37}$k in nanosecond-resolution observations (hankins et al 2003). giantpulses are therefore the brightest known in the observable universe andrepresent an important milestone for theories of the pulsar emission mechanismto explain. their short durations allow them to serve as especially sensitiveprobes of the crab nebula and the interstellar medium. we analyze frequencystructure in individual giant pulses using a scintillating,amplitude-modulated,polarized shot-noise model. the frequency structureassociated with multipath propagation decorrelates on a time scale of 25 sec at1.5 ghz, which requires that multipath propagation be strongly influenced bymaterial within the crab nebula. additional frequency structure decorrelatesfaster than one spin period, as would be expected from the shot-noise patternof nanosecond duration pulses emitted by the pulsar. taking into account thecrab pulsar's locality inside a bright supernova remnant, we conclude that thebrightest pulse in a typical 1-hour observation would be most easily detectablein our lowest frequency band (0.43 ghz) to a distance of 1.6 mpc. we alsodiscuss the detection of such pulses using future instruments such as lofar andthe ska.

astro-ph;0502149	rfi identification and mitigation using simultaneous dual station  observations	rfi mitigation is a critically important issue in radio astronomy usingexisting instruments as well as in the development of next-generation radiotelescopes, such as the square kilometer array (ska). most designs for the skainvolve multiple stations with spacings of up to a few thousands of kilometersand thus can exploit the drastically different rfi environments at differentstations. as demonstrator observations and analysis for ska-like instruments,and to develop rfi mitigation schemes that will be useful in the near term, werecently conducted simultaneous observations with arecibo observatory and thegreen bank telescope (gbt). the observations were aimed at diagnosing rfi andusing the mostly uncorrelated rfi between the two sites to excise rfi fromseveral generic kinds of measurements such as giant pulses from crab-likepulsars and weak hi emission from galaxies in bands heavily contaminated byrfi. this paper presents observations, analysis, and rfi identification andexcision procedures that are effective for both time series and spectroscopyapplications using multi-station data.

astro-ph;0509732	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. i. survey strategy and first  discoveries	we report results from the initial stage of a long-term pulsar survey of thegalactic plane using the arecibo l-band feed array (alfa), a seven-beamreceiver operating at 1.4 ghz with 0.3 ghz bandwidth. the search targetsgalactic latitudes |b| &lt; 5 deg in the longitude ranges 32 deg &lt; l &lt; 77 deg and168 deg &lt; l &lt; 77 deg. data discussed here were collected over a 100 mhzpassband centered on 1.42 ghz using a spectrometer that recorded 256 channelsevery 64 microsec. in a preliminary, standard period-dm analysis, we havedetected 29 previously known pulsars and discovered 11 new ones. one of these,with a period of 69 ms and a low characteristic age of 82 kyr, is a plausiblecandidate for association with the unidentified egret source 3eg j1928+1733.another is a non-recycled pulsar in a relativistic binary with orbital periodof 3.98 hr. we also search the data for isolated dispersed pulses, a techniquethat yielded discovery of an extremely sporadic radio emitter with a spinperiod of 1.2 s. simulations we have carried out indicate that about 1000 newpulsars will be found in the alfa survey. in addition to providing a largesample for use in population analyses and for probing the magnetoionicinterstellar medium, the survey maximizes the chances of finding rapidlyspinning millisecond pulsars and pulsars in compact binary systems. our searchalgorithms will exploit the multiple data streams from alfa to discriminatebetween radio frequency interference and celestial signals, including pulsarsand possibly new classes of transient radio sources.

astro-ph;0511523	the young, highly relativistic binary pulsar j1906+0746	we report the discovery of psr j1906+0746, a young 144-ms pulsar in a highlyrelativistic 3.98-hr orbit with an eccentricity of 0.085 and expectedgravitational wave coalescence time of 300 myr. the new pulsar was found duringprecursor survey observations with the arecibo 1.4-ghz feed array system andretrospectively detected in the parkes multibeam plane pulsar survey data. fromradio follow-up observations with arecibo, jodrell bank, green bank, andparkes, we have measured the spin-down and binary parameters of the pulsar andits basic spectral and polarization properties. we also present evidence forpulse profile evolution, which is likely due to geodetic precession, arelativistic effect caused by the misalignment of the pulsar spin and totalangular momentum vectors. our measurements show that psr j1906+0746 is a youngobject with a characteristic age of 112 kyr. from the measured rate of orbitalperiastron advance 7.57+/-0.03 deg/yr, we infer a total system mass of2.61+/-0.02 msun. while these parameters suggest that the psr j1906+0746 binarysystem might be a younger version of the double pulsar system, intensivesearches for radio pulses from the companion have so far been unsuccessful. itis therefore not known whether the companion is another neutron star or amassive white dwarf. regardless of the nature of the companion, a simplecalculation suggests that the galactic birth rate of binaries similar to psrj1906+0746 is 60/myr. this implies that psr j1906+0746 will make a significantcontribution to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems.

astro-ph;0610929	simultaneous single-pulse observations of radio pulsars: v. on the  broadband nature of the pulse nulling phenomenon in psr b1133+16	we revisit the phenomenon of pulse nulling using high-quality single-pulsedata of psr b1133+16 from simultaneous multifrequency observations.observations were made at 325, 610, 1400 and 4850 mhz as part of a jointprogram between the european pulsar network and the giant metrewave radiotelescope. the pulse energy time series are analysed to derive improvedstatistics of nulling pulses as well as to investigate the frequency dependenceof the phenomenon. the pulsar is observed to be in null state for approximately15% of the time; however, we find that nulling does not always occursimultaneously at all four frequencies of observation. we characterise this"selective nulling'' as a function of frequency, separation in frequency, andcombination of frequencies. the most remarkable case is a significantly largenumber of nulls ($\approx$6%) at lower frequencies, that are marked by thepresence of a fairly narrow emission feature at the highest frequency of 4850mhz. we refer to these as "low frequency (lf) nulls." our analysis shows thatthis high frequency emission tends to occur preferentially over a narrow rangein longitude and with pulse widths typically of the order of a fewmilliseconds. we discuss the implications of our results for the pulsaremission mechanism in general and for the broadbandness of nulling phenomenonin particular. our results signify the presence of an additional process ofemission which does not turn off when the pulsar nulls at low frequencies, andbecomes more prominent at higher frequencies. our analysis also hints at apossible outer gap origin for this new population of pulses, and thus a likelyconnection to some high-energy emission processes that occur in the outer partsof the pulsar magnetosphere.

astro-ph;0702366	dispersion measure variations and their effect on precision pulsar  timing	we present an analysis of the variations seen in the dispersion measures(dms) of 20 millisecond pulsars observed as part of the parkes pulsar timingarray project. we carry out a statistically rigorous structure functionanalysis for each pulsar and show that the variations seen for most pulsars areconsistent with those expected for an interstellar medium characterised by akolmogorov turbulence spectrum. the structure functions for psrs j1045-4509 andj1909-3744 provide the first clear evidence for a large inner scale, possiblydue to ion-neutral damping. we also show the effect of the solar wind on thedms and show that the simple models presently implemented into pulsar timingpackages cannot reliably correct for this effect. for the first time we clearlyshow how dm variations affect pulsar timing residuals and how they can becorrected in order to obtain the highest possible timing precision. even withour presently limited data span, the residuals (and all parameters derived fromthe timing) for six of our pulsars have been significantly improved bycorrecting for the dm variations.
