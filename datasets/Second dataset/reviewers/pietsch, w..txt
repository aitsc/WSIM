0910.3865	x-ray emission from optical novae in m 31	the first supersoft source (sss) identification with an optical nova in m 31was based on rosat observations. twenty additional x-ray counterparts (mostlyidentified as sss by their hardness ratios) were detected using archival rosat,xmm-newton and chandra observations obtained before july 2002. based on theseresults optical novae seem to constitute the major class of sss in m 31. ananalysis of archival chandra hrc-i and acis-i observations obtained from july2004 to february 2005 demonstrated that m 31 nova sss states lasted from monthsto about 10 years. several novae showed short x-ray outbursts starting within50 d after the optical outburst and lasting only two to three months. thefraction of novae detected in soft x-rays within a year after the opticaloutburst was more than 30%. ongoing optical nova monitoring programs, opticalspectral follow-up and an up-to-date nova catalogue are essential for the x-raywork. re-analysis of archival nova data to improve positions and findadditional nova candidates are urgently needed for secure recurrent novaidentifications. dedicated xmm-newton/chandra monitoring programs for x-rayemission from optical novae covering the center area of m 31 continue toprovide interesting new results (e.g. coherent 1105s pulsations in the ssscounterpart of nova m31n 2007-12b). the sss light curves of novae allow us -together with optical information - to estimate the mass of the white dwarf, ofthe ejecta and the burned mass in the outburst. observations of the centralarea of m 31 allow us - in contrast to observations in the galaxy - to monitormany novae simultaneously and proved to be prone to find many interesting sssand nova types.

0910.5666	chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33): the enigmatic x-ray emission from  ic131	we present the first x-ray analysis of the diffuse hot ionized gas and thepoint sources in ic131, after ngc604 the second most x-ray luminous giant hiiregion in m33. the x-ray emission is detected only in the south eastern part ofic131 (named ic131-se) and is limited to an elliptical region of ~200pc inextent. this region appears to be confined towards the west by a hemisphericalshell of warm ionized gas and only fills about half that volume. although thecorresponding x-ray spectrum has 1215 counts, it cannot conclusively be toldwhether the extended x-ray emission is thermal, non-thermal, or a combinationof both. a thermal plasma model of kt_e=4.3kev or a single power law ofgamma=2.1 fit the spectrum equally well. if the spectrum is purely thermal(non-thermal), the total unabsorbed x-ray luminosity in the 0.35-8kev energyband amounts to l_x = 6.8(8.7)x10^35erg/s. among other known hii regionsic131-se seems to be extreme regarding the combination of its large extent ofthe x-ray plasma, the lack of massive o stars, its unusually high electrontemperature (if thermal), and the large fraction of l_x emitted above 2kev(~40-53%). a thermal plasma of ~4kev poses serious challenges to theoreticalmodels, as it is not clear how high electron temperatures can be produced inhii regions in view of mass-proportional and collisionless heating. if the gasis non-thermal or has non-thermal contributions, synchrotron emission wouldclearly dominate over inverse compton emission. it is not clear if the samemechanisms which create non-thermal x-rays or accelerate crs in snrs can beapplied to much larger scales of 200pc. in both cases the existing theoreticalmodels for giant hii regions and superbubbles do not explain the hardness andextent of the x-ray emission in ic131-se.

0912.0624	supersoft sources in m 31: comparing the xmm-newton deep survey, rosat  and chandra catalogues	to investigate the transient nature of supersoft sources (ssss) in m 31, wecompared sss candidates of the xmm-newton deep survey, rosat pspc surveys andthe chandra catalogues in the same field. we found 40 ssss in the xmm-newtonobservations. while 12 of the xmm-newton sources were brighter than thelimiting flux of the rosat pspc survey, only two were detected with rosat ~10yr earlier. five correlate with recent optical novae which explains why theywere not detected by rosat. the remaining 28 xmm-newton ssss have fluxes belowthe rosat detection threshold. nevertheless we found one correlation with arosat source, which had significantly larger fluxes than during the xmm-newtonobservations. ten of the xmm-newton ssss were detected by chandra with &lt;1-~6 yrbetween the observations. five were also classified as ssss by chandra. of the30 rosat ssss three were confirmed with xmm-newton, while for 11 sources otherclassifications are suggested. of the remaining 16 sources one correlates withan optical nova. of the 42 chandra very-soft sources five are classified asxmm-newton ssss, while for 22 we suggest other classifications. of theremaining 15 sources, nine are classified as transient by chandra, one of themcorrelates with an optical nova. these findings underlined the high variabilityof the sources of this class and the connection between ssss and optical novae.only three sources, were detected by all three missions as ssss. thus they arevisible for more than a decade, despite their variability.

0912.1247	recent discoveries of supersoft x-ray sources in m 31	classical novae (cne) have recently been reported to represent the majorclass of supersoft x-ray sources (ssss) in the central area of our neighbouringgalaxy m 31. this paper presents a review of results from recent x-rayobservations of m 31 with xmm-newton and chandra. we carried out a dedicatedoptical and x-ray monitoring program of cne and ssss in the central area of m31. we discovered the first ssss in m 31 globular clusters (gcs) and theirconnection to the very first discovered cn in a m 31 gc. this result may havean impact on the cn rate in gcs. furthermore, in our optical and x-raymonitoring data we discovered the cn m31n 2007-11a, which shows a very shortsss phase of 29 - 52 days. short sss states (durations &lt; 100 days) of cneindicate massive white dwarfs (wds) that are candidate progenitors ofsupernovae type ia. in the case of m31n 2007-11a, the optical and x-ray lightcurves suggest a binary containing a wd with m_wd &gt; 1.0 m_sun. finally, wepresent the discovery of the sss counterpart of the cn m31n 2006-04a. the x-raylight curve of m31n 2006-04a shows short-time variability, which might indicatean orbital period of about 2 hours.

1001.2991	j004457+4123 (sharov 21): not a remarkable nova in m31 but a background  quasar with a spectacular uv flare	we announce the discovery of a quasar behind the disk of m31, which waspreviously classified as a remarkable nova in our neighbour galaxy. the paperis primarily aimed at the outburst of j004457+4123 (sharov 21), with the firstpart focussed on the optical spectroscopy and the improvement in thephotometric database. both the optical spectrum and the broad band spectralenergy distribution of sharov 21 are shown to be very similar to that ofnormal, radio-quiet type 1 quasars. we present photometric data covering morethan a century and resulting in a long-term light curve that is densely sampledover the past five decades. the variability of the quasar is characterized by aground state with typical fluctuation amplitudes of ~0.2 mag around b~20.5,superimposed by a singular flare of ~2 yr duration (observer frame) with themaximum at 1992.81 where the uv flux has increased by a factor of ~20. thetotal energy in the flare is at least three orders of magnitudes higher thanthe radiated energy of the most luminous supernovae, provided that it comesfrom an intrinsic process and the energy is radiated isotropically. the profileof the flare light curve appears to be in agreement with the standardpredictions for a stellar tidal disruption event where a ~10 m_sun giant starwas shredded in the tidal field of a ~2...5 10^8 m_sun black hole. the shortfallback time derived from the light curve requires an ultra-close encounterwhere the pericentre of the stellar orbit is deep within the tidal disruptionradius. gravitational microlensing provides an alternative explanation, thoughthe probability of such a high amplification event is very low.

1006.0287	multi-frequency study of local group supernova remnants the curious case  of the large magellanic cloud snr j0528-6714	aims. recent atca, xmm-newton and mcels observations of the magellanic clouds(mcs) cover a number of new and known snrs which are poorly studied, such assnr j0528-6714 . this particular snr exhibits luminous radio-continuumemission, but is one of the unusual and rare cases without detectable opticaland very faint x-ray emission (initially detected by rosat and listed as object[hp99] 498). we used new multi-frequency radio-continuum surveys and newoptical observations at h{\alpha}, [s ii] and [o iii] wavelengths, incombination with xmm-newton x-ray data, to investigate the snr properties andto search for a physical explanation for the unusual appearance of this snr.  methods. we analysed the x-ray and radio-continuum spectra and presentmulti-wavelength morphological studies of this snr.  results. we present the results of new moderate resolution atca observationsof snr j0528-6714. we found that this object is a typical older snr with aradio spectral index of {\alpha}=-0.36 \pm 0.09 and a diameter of d=52.4 \pm1.0 pc. regions of moderate and somewhat irregular polarisation were detectedwhich are also indicative of an older snr. using a non-equilibrium ionisationcollisional plasma model to describe the x-ray spectrum, we find temperatureskt of 0.26 kev for the remnant. the low temperature, low surface brightness,and large extent of the remnant all indicate a relatively advanced age. thenear circular morphology indicates a type ia event.  conclusions. our study revealed one of the most unusual cases of snrs in thelocal group of galaxies - a luminous radio snr without optical counterpart and,at the same time, very faint x-ray emission. while it is not unusual to notdetect an snr in the optical, the combination of faint x-ray and no opticaldetection makes this snr very unique.

1103.2925	ikt 16: a composite snr in the smc	aims: ikt 16 is an x-ray and radio-faint supernova remnant (snr) in the smallmagellanic cloud (smc). a previous x-ray study of this snr found a hard x-raysource near its centre. using all available archival and proprietary xmm-newtondata, alongside new multi-frequency radio-continuum surveys and opticalobservations at h-alpha and forbidden [sii] and [oiii] lines, we aim toconstrain the properties of the snr and discover the nature of the hard sourcewithin. methods: we combine xmm-newton datasets to produce the highest qualityx-ray image of ikt 16 to date. we use this, in combination with radio andoptical images, to conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis of theremnant. we extract separate spectra from the snr and the bright source nearits centre, and conduct spectral fitting of both regions. results: we find ikt16 to have a radius of 37+-3 pc, with the bright source located 8+-2 pc fromthe centre. this is the largest known snr in the smc. the large size of theremnant suggests it is likely in the sedov-adiabatic phase of evolution. usinga sedov model to fit the snr spectrum, we find an electron temperature kt of1.03+-0.12 kev and an age of 14700 yr. the absorption found requires theremnant to be located deep within the smc. the bright source is fit with apower law with index 1.58+-0.07, and is associated with diffuse radio emissionextending towards the centre of the snr. we argue that this source is likely tobe the neutron star remnant of the supernova explosion, and infer itstransverse kick velocity to be 580+-100 km/s. the x-ray and radio properties ofthis source strongly favour a pulsar wind nebula (pwn) origin.

1201.1082	xmmu j0541.8-6659, a new supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud	the high sensitivity of the xmm-newton instrumentation offers the opportunityto study faint and extended sources in the milky way and nearby galaxies suchas the large magellanic cloud (lmc) in detail. the rosat pspc survey of the lmchas revealed more than 700 x-ray sources, among which there are 46 supernovaremnants (snrs) and candidates. we have observed the field around one of themost promising snr candidates in the rosat pspc catalogue, labelled [hp99] 456with xmm-newton, to determine its nature. we investigated the xmm-newton dataalong with new radio-continuum, near infrared and optical data. in particular,spectral and morphological studies of the x-ray and radio data were performed.the x-ray images obtained in different energy bands reveal two differentstructures. below 1.0 kev the x-ray emission shows the shell-like morphology ofan snr with a diameter of ~73 pc, one of the largest known in the lmc. for itsthermal spectrum we estimate an electron temperature of (0.49 +/- 0.12)kevassuming non-equilibrium ionisation. the x-ray images above 1.0 kev reveal aless extended source within the snr emission, located ~1' west of the centre ofthe snr and coincident with bright point sources detected in radio-continuum.this hard component has an extent of 0.9' (i.e. ~13 pc at a distance of ~50kpc) and a non-thermal spectrum. the hard source coincides in position with therosat source [hp99] 456 and shows an indication for substructure. we firmlyidentify a new snr in the lmc with a shell-like morphology and a thermalspectrum. assuming the snr to be in the sedov phase yields an age of ~23 kyr.we explore possible associations of the hard non-thermal emitting componentwith a pulsar wind nebula (pwn) or background active galactic nuclei (agn).

1208.0182	multi-frequency study of supernova remnants in the large magellanic  cloud. confirmation of the supernova remnant status of dem l205	we present new x-ray and radio data of the lmc snr candidate dem l205,obtained by xmm-newton and atca, along with archival optical and infraredobservations. we use data at various wavelengths to study this object and itscomplex neighbourhood, in particular in the context of the star formationactivity, past and present, around the source. we analyse the x-ray spectrum toderive some remnant's properties, such as age and explosion energy. supernovaremnant features are detected at all observed wavelengths: soft and extendedx-ray emission is observed, arising from a thermal plasma with a temperature ktbetween 0.2 kev and 0.3 kev. optical line emission is characterised by anenhanced [sii]/halpha ratio and a shell-like morphology, correlating with thex-ray emission. the source is not or only tentatively detected at near-infraredwavelengths (&lt; 10 microns), but there is a detection of arc-like emission atmid and far-infrared wavelengths (24 and 70 micron) that can be unambiguouslyassociated with the remnant. we suggest that thermal emission from dust heatedby stellar radiation and shock waves is the main contributor to the infraredemission. finally, an extended and faint non-thermal radio emission correlateswith the remnant at other wavelengths and we find a radio spectral indexbetween -0.7 and -0.9, within the range for snrs. the size of the remnant is~79x64 pc and we estimate a dynamical age of about 35000 years. we definitelyconfirm dem l205 as a new snr. this object ranks amongst the largest remnantsknown in the lmc. the numerous massive stars and the recent outburst in starformation around the source strongly suggest that a core-collapse supernova isthe progenitor of this remnant.

1208.0231	the xmm-newton survey of the small magellanic cloud	although numerous archival xmm-newton observations existed towards the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) before 2009, only a fraction of the whole galaxy wascovered. between may 2009 and march 2010 we carried out an xmm-newton survey ofthe smc, in order to obtain a complete overage of both its bar and wing.thirty-three observations of 30 different fields with a total exposure of aboutne ms filled the missing parts. we systematically processed all available smcdata from the european photon imaging camera. after rejecting observations withvery high background we included 53 archival and the 33 survey observations. weproduced images in five different energy bands. we applied astrometricboresight corrections using secure identifications of x-ray sources and combineall the images to produce a mosaic, which covers the main body of the smc. wepresent an overview of the xmm-newton observations, describe their analysis andsummarise first results which will be presented in follow-up papers in detail.here, we mainly focus on extended x-ray sources like supernova remnants (snrs)and clusters of galaxies which are seen in our x-ray images. the xmm-newtonsurvey represents the deepest complete survey of the smc in the 0.15-12.0 kevx-ray band. we propose three new snrs with low surface brightness of a few10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcmin^-2 and large extent. also several known remnantsappear larger than previously measured from x-rays or other wavelengthsextending the size distribution of smc snrs to larger values.

0712.3585	grb 070201: a possible soft gamma ray repeater in m31	the gamma-ray burst (grb) 070201 was a bright short-duration hard-spectrumgrb detected by the inter-planetary network (ipn). its error quadrilateral,which has an area of 0.124 sq. deg, intersects some prominent spiral arms ofthe nearby m31 (andromeda) galaxy. given the properties of this grb, along withthe fact that ligo data argues against a compact binary merger origin in m31,this grb is an excellent candidate for an extragalactic soft gamma-ray repeater(sgr) giant flare, with energy of 1.4x10^45 erg. analysis of rotse-iiib visiblelight observations of m31, taken 10.6 hours after the burst and covering 42% ofthe grb error region, did not reveal any optical transient down to a limitingmagnitude of 17.1. we inspected archival and proprietary xmm-newton x-rayobservations of the intersection of the grb error quadrilateral and m31,obtained about four weeks prior to the outburst, in order to look for periodicvariable x-ray sources. no sgr or anomalous x-ray pulsar (axp) candidates(periods in range 1 to 20 s) were detected. we discuss the possibility ofdetecting extragalactic sgrs/axps by identifying their periodic x-ray lightcurves. our simulations suggest that the probability of detecting the periodicx-ray signal of one of the known galactic sgrs/axps, if placed in m31, is about10% (50%), using 50 ks (2 ms) xmm-newton exposures.

1303.4306	x-ray source population study of the starburst galaxy m83 with  xmm-newton	we present the results obtained from the analysis of three xmm-newtonobservations of m83. the aims of the paper are studying the x-ray sourcepopulations in m83 and calculating the x-ray luminosity functions of x-raybinaries for different regions of the galaxy. we detected 189 sources in thexmm-newton field of view in the energy range of 0.2-12 kev. we constrainedtheir nature by means of spectral analysis, hardness ratios, studies of thex-ray variability, and cross-correlations with catalogues in x-ray, optical,infrared, and radio wavelengths. we identified and classified 12 backgroundobjects, five foreground stars, two x-ray binaries, one supernova remnantcandidate, one super-soft source candidate and one ultra-luminous x-ray source.among these sources, we classified for the first time three active galacticnuclei (agn) candidates. we derived x-ray luminosity functions of the x-raysources in m83 in the 2-10 kev energy range, within and outside the d_25ellipse, correcting the total x-ray luminosity function for incompleteness andsubtracting the agn contribution. the x-ray luminosity function inside the d_25ellipse is consistent with that previously observed by chandra. thekolmogorov-smirnov test shows that the x-ray luminosity function of the outerdisc and the agn luminosity distribution are uncorrelated with a probability ofabout 99.3%. we also found that the x-ray sources detected outside the d_25ellipse and the uniform spatial distribution of agns are spatially uncorrelatedwith a significance of 99.5%. we interpret these results as an indication thatpart of the observed x-ray sources are x-ray binaries in the outer disc of m83.

1412.8510	recurrent novae in m31	the reported positions of 964 suspected nova eruptions in m31 recordedthrough the end of calendar year 2013 have been compared in order to identifyrecurrent nova candidates. to pass the initial screen and qualify as arecurrent nova candidate two or more eruptions were required to be coincidentwithin 0.1', although this criterion was relaxed to 0.15' for novae discoveredon early photographic patrols. a total of 118 eruptions from 51 potentialrecurrent nova systems satisfied the screening criterion. to determine whatfraction of these novae are indeed recurrent the original plates and publishedimages of the relevant eruptions have been carefully compared. this procedurehas resulted in the elimination of 27 of the 51 progenitor candidates (61eruptions) from further consideration as recurrent novae, with another 8systems (17 eruptions) deemed unlikely to be recurrent. of the remaining 16systems, 12 candidates (32 eruptions) were judged to be recurrent novae, withan additional 4 systems (8 eruptions) being possibly recurrent. it is estimatedthat ~4% of the nova eruptions seen in m31 over the past century are associatedwith recurrent novae. a monte carlo analysis shows that the discoveryefficiency for recurrent novae may be as low as 10% that for novae in general,suggesting that as many as one in three nova eruptions observed in m31 arisefrom progenitor systems having recurrence times &lt;~100 yr. for plausible systemparameters, it appears unlikely that recurrent novae can provide a significantchannel for the production of type ia supernovae.

0805.0165	new xmm-newton observations of snrs in the smc	a complete overview of the supernova remnant (snr) population is required toinvestigate their evolution and interaction with the surrounding interstellarmedium in the small magellanic cloud (smc). recent xmm-newton observations ofthe smc cover three known snrs (dem s5, snr b0050-72.8, and snr b0058-71.8),which are poorly studied and are x-ray faint. we used new multi-frequencyradio-continuum surveys and new optical observations at ha, [sii], and [oiii]wavelengths, in combination with the x-ray data, to investigate theirproperties and to search for new snrs in the smc. we used x-ray sourceselection criteria and found one smc object with typical snr characteristics(hfpk 334), that was initially detected by rosat. we analysed the x-ray spectraand present multi-wavelength morphological studies of the three snrs and thenew candidate. using a non-equilibrium ionisation collisional plasma model, wefind temperatures kt around 0.18 kev for the three known remnants and 0.69 kevfor the candidate. the low temperature, low surface brightness, and largeextent of the three remnants indicates relatively large ages. the emission fromthe new candidate (hfpk 334) is more centrally peaked and the highertemperature suggests a younger remnant. our new radio images indicate that apulsar wind nebulae (pwn) is possibly associated with this object. the snrsknown in the smc show a variety of morphological structures that are relativelyuncorrelated in the different wavelength bands, probably caused by thedifferent conditions in the surrounding medium with which the remnantinteracts.

0807.2949	three x-ray transients in m31 observed with swift	the purpose of this study is to find transient x-ray sources in m31, and toinvestigate and classify their nature. three x-ray transients were observedwith swift. for each of the three x-ray transients we use the swift x-ray andoptical data together with observations from xmm-newton and chandra toinvestigate the lightcurves and the spectra of the outburst, and thereby toidentify the source types. the outburst of xmmu j004215.8+411924 lasted forabout one month. the source had a hard power-law spectrum with a photon indexof 1.6. it was previously identified as a be/x-ray binary based on the opticalidentification with a star. however, we show that with improved sourcecoordinates it is clear that the optical source is not the counterpart to thex-ray source. the source swift j004217.3+411532 had a bright outburst, afterwhich it slowly decayed over half a year. the spectrum was soft, correspondingto a thermal accretion disk with innermost temperature of 250-600 ev. thesource was not seen in the optical, and the soft spectrum indicates that thesource is most likely a black hole low mass x-ray binary. m31n 2006-11a is anova that was previously observed in the optical. we detected it both in x-raysand uv with swift half a year after the optical maximum, after which it decayedbelow the swift detection threshold within a month. the spectrum of the x-raytransient can be modelled by a black-body with a temperature of 50 ev. we usecatalogues of x-ray transients in m31 to estimate their rate, and we find alower limit of 9/yr.

astro-ph;0304308	xmm-newton observations expose agn in apparently normal galaxies	we have performed a detailed analysis of 3 optically normal galaxiesextracted from the xmm bright serendipitous source sample. thanks to the goodstatistics of the xmm-newton data, we have unveiled the presence of an agn inall of them. in particular, we detect both x-ray obscured (n_h&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2})and unobscured (n_h&lt;10^{22} cm^{-2}) agn with intrinsic 2--10 kev luminositiesin the range between 10^{42} -- 10^{43} erg s^{-1}. we find that the x-ray andoptical properties of the sources discussed here could be explained assuming astandard agn hosted by galaxies with magnitudes m_r&lt;m^*, taking properly intoaccount the absorption associated with the agn, the optical faintness of thenuclear emission with respect to the host galaxy, and the inadequate set--upand atmospheric conditions during the optical spectroscopic observations. ournew spectroscopic observations have revealed the expected agn features also inthe optical band. these results clearly show that optical spectroscopysometimes can be inefficient in revealing the presence of an agn, which insteadis clearly found from an x-ray spectroscopic investigation. this remarks theimportance of being careful in proposing the identification of x-ray sources(especially at faint fluxes) when only low quality optical spectra are in hand.this is particularly important for faint surveys (such as those with xmm-newtonand chandra), in which optically dull but x-ray active objects are being foundin sizeable numbers.

astro-ph;0610302	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy and imaging of the nuclear outflow of  the starburst galaxy ngc 253	aims: using xmm-newton data, we have aimed to study the nuclear outflow ofthe nearby starburst galaxy ngc 253 in x-rays with respect to its morphologyand to spectral variations along the outflow. methods: we analysed xmm-newtonrgs spectra, rgs brightness profiles in cross-dispersion direction, narrow bandrgs and epic images and epic pn brightness profiles of the nuclear region andof the outflow of ngc 253. results: we detect a diversity of emission linesalong the outflow of ngc 253. this includes the he-like ions of si, mg, ne ando and their corresponding ions in the next higher ionisation state.additionally transitions from fe xvii and fe xviii are prominent. the derivedtemperatures from line ratios along the outflow range from 0.21+/-0.01 to0.79+/-0.06 kev and the ratio of fe xvii lines indicates a predominantlycollisionally ionised plasma. additionally we see indications of a recombiningor underionized plasma in the fe xvii line ratio. derived electron densitiesare 0.106+/-0.018 cm^-3 for the nuclear region and 0.025+/-0.003 cm^-3 for theoutflow region closest to the centre. the rgs image in the o viii line energyclearly shows the morphology of an outflow extending out to ~750 pc along thesouth-east minor axis, while the north-west part of the outflow is not seen ino viii due to the heavy absorption by the galactic disc. this is the first timethat the hot wind fluid has been detected directly. the limb brightening seenin chandra and xmm-newton epic observations is only seen in the energy rangecontaining the fe xvii lines (550-750 ev). in all other energy ranges between400 and 2000 ev no clear evidence of limb brightening could be detected.

astro-ph;9611112	the rosat galactic plane survey: analysis of a low latitude sample area  in cygnus	we present the analysis of the point source content of a low galacticlatitude region selected from the rosat all-sky survey. the test field iscentered at l = 90deg, b = 0deg and has an area of 64.5 deg2. a total of 128soft x-ray sources are detected above a maximum likelihood of 8. cataloguesearches and optical follow-up observations show that in this direction of thegalactic plane, 85% of the sources brighter than 0.03 pspc cts/s are identifiedwith active coronae. f-k type stars represent 67% (+/-13%) of the stellaridentifications and m type stars account for 19% (+/- 6%). these resultstogether with those of similar optical campaigns demonstrate that the softx-ray population of the milky way is largely dominated by active stars. themodelling of this population suggests that most of the stars detected by rosatin this direction are younger than 1 gyr. the small number of unidentifiedsources at low x-ray flux put rather strong constraints on the hypotheticalx-ray emission from old neutron stars accreting from the interstellar medium.our observations clearly rule out models which assume no dynamical heating forthis population and a total number of nns = 10^9 neutron stars in the galaxy.if accretion on polar caps is the dominant mode then our upper limit may implynns ~ 10^8.

astro-ph;9711071	rosat pspc x-ray observations of the nearby spiral galaxy m83	the nearly face-on sbc galaxy m83 (ngc 5236) was observed for 25 ksec withthe rosat pspc. we detected 13 point-like sources in this galaxy, 10 of whichwere previously unknown. we measured extended x-ray radiation from almost thewhole optically visible galaxy. comparing the diffuse soft and hard x-rayemission components, we observed a different asymmetric distribution and aslower radial decrease of the intensity profile of the soft x-ray emission.both these results support the existence of a huge spherical gas halo of 10-15kpc radius. on the other hand, the radial scale lengths of the hard x-rayradiation, that of the thermal radio emission and the profile of the opticalsurface brightness are similar, favouring the idea that all these emissionprocesses are connected to star formation in the galaxy's disk. m83 is thefirst face-on galaxy where the diffuse x-ray emission spectrum can becharacterized by a two-temperature thermal plasma: a soft x-ray emitting warm`halo component' and an internally absorbed hot `disk component' which isdominating the emission in the hard (0.5-2.0 kev) rosat energy range. thecombination of x-ray and radio polarization observations allows an estimate ofthe plasma parameter beta = u_therm/u_magn which is found to be 0.2+/-0.1. thisresult supports the hypothesis that magnetic fields play an important role forthe evolution and structure of galactic gas haloes. the high energy input ratein the active star-forming disk of m83 seems to be responsible for the outflowof hot gas and the halo formation.

astro-ph;9801210	new active galactic nuclei detected in rosat all sky survey galaxies;  part i: verification of selection strategy	we present the first results of a program to identify so far unknown activenuclei (agn) in galaxies. candidate galactic nuclei have been selected foroptical spectroscopy from a cross-correlation of the rosat all sky survey(rass) bright source catalog with optical galaxy catalogs. a high x-ray fluxhas been used as pointer to galaxies with a high probability to contain activenuclei. only galaxies have been accepted for the program for which no activitywas noted in ned. for many of the galaxies no radial velocity was reportedbefore. the optical spectra demonstrate that the galaxies cover a redshiftrange of 0.014 to 0.13 and that most of them host active nuclei. for 75 percentof the 33 candidates the x-ray emission is caused by the agn. in additionseveral of the remaining candidates host seyfert 2/liner nuclei that, however,most certainly cannot explain the x-ray emission alone. three bl lac objectshave been detected serendipitously in galaxy fields that have been followed upby short rosat hri observations to confirm the x-ray galaxy identification withimproved position accuracy and point response function. the sources show x-rayto radio flux ratios typical for x-ray selected bl lac objects. the resultspresented in the paper prove the selection strategy as very successful todetect previously unknown agn of all seyfert 1 types in nearby galaxiesencouraging the extension of this program. the detection of new nearby agn willbe used to initiate a detailed investigation of their multi-wavelengthproperties and a comparison with the more distant agn population.

(ii) emission from the disk of the galaxy, with lx = 7e39 erg/sec, thatcan be partly resolved by the hri in 3 point-like sources with luminosities of\~6e38erg/sec each. (iii) very soft x-shaped emission from the halo, with lx =6e39 erg/sec, extending to a diameter of 27 kpc.  the x-ray luminosity of ngc 3079 is higher by a factor of 10 compared toother galaxies of similar optical luminosity and we argue that this may becaused by the presence of an agn rather than by starburst activity. theinfluence of the agn on the companion galaxies in the ngc 3079 group arediscussed.
