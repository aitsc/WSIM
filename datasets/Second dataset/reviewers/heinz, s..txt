0902.4890	the evolution of galaxy clusters across cosmic time	the large scale structure of the present universe is determined by the growthof dark matter density fluctuations and by the dynamical action of dark energyand dark matter. while much progress has been made in recent years inconstraining the cosmological parameters, and in reconstructing the evolutionin the large--scale structure of the dark matter distribution, we still lack anunderstanding of the evolution of the baryonic component of the universe.  located at nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies are the largestcollapsed structures in the universe with total masses up to 10$^{15}$m$_{\sun}$. over 80% of their mass resides in the form of dark matter. theremaining mass is composed of baryons, most of which (about 85%) is a diffuse,hot plasma that radiates primarily in x-rays. x-ray observations of theevolving cluster population provide a unique opportunity to address such openand fundamental questions as: how do hot diffuse baryons dynamically evolve indark matter potentials? how and when was the excess energy which we observe inthe intergalactic medium generated? what is the cosmic history of heavy-elementproduction and circulation?  our current knowledge comes primarily from detailed studies of clusters inthe relatively nearby universe (z$&lt;$0.5). major advances will come from highthroughput, high spectral and spatial resolution x-ray observations thatmeasure the thermodynamical properties and metal content of the first low massclusters emerging at z $\sim$ 2 and directly trace their evolution into today'smassive clusters.

nucl-ex;0004009	positron spectra from internal pair conversion observed in {238}u +  {181}ta collisions	we present new results from measurements and simulations of positron spectra,originating from 238u + 181ta collisions at beam energies close to the coulombbarrier. the measurements were performed using an improved experimental setupat the double-orange spectrometer of gsi. particular emphasis is put on thesignature of positrons from internal-pair-conversion (ipc) processes in themeasured e+ energy spectra, following the de-excitation of electromagnetictransitions in the moving ta-like nucleus. it is shown by monte carlosimulations that, for the chosen current sweeping procedure used in the presentexperiments, positron emission from discrete ipc transitions can lead to rathernarrow line structures in the measured energy spectra. the measured positronspectra do not show evidence for line structures within the statisticalaccuracy achieved, although expected from the intensities of the observed$\gamma$ transitions (e$_{\gamma}~1250-1600$ kev) and theoretical conversioncoefficients. this is due to the reduced detection efficiency for ipcpositrons, caused by the limited spatial and momentum acceptance of thespectrometer. a comparison with previous results, in which lines have beenobserved, is presented and the implications are discussed.

nucl-ex;9704007	first energy and angle differential measurements of e^+e^- -pairs  emitted by internal pair conversion of excited heavy nuclei	we present the first energy and angle resolved measurements of e+e- pairsemitted from heavy nuclei (z&gt;=40) at rest by internal pair conversion (ipc) oftransitions with energies of less than 2mev as well as recent theoreticalresults using the dwba method, which takes full account of relativisticeffects, magnetic substates and finite size of the nucleus. the 1.76mev e0transition in zr90 (sr source) and the 1.77mev m1 transition in pb207 (bisource) have been investigated experimentally using the essentially improvedset-up at the double-orange beta-spectrometer of gsi. the measurements provethe capability of the setup to cleanly identify the ipc pairs in the presenceof five orders of magnitude higher beta- and gamma background from the samesource and to yield essentially background-free sum spectra despite the largebackground. using the ability of the orange setup to directly determine theopening angle of the e+e- pairs, the angular correlation of the emitted pairswas measured. in the zr90 case the correlation could be deduced for a widerange of energy differences of the pairs. the zr90 results are in goodagreement with recent theory. the angular correlation deduced for the m1transition in pb207 is in strong disagreement with theoretical predictionsderived within the born approximation and shows almost isotropic character.this is again in agreement with the new theoretical results.

0912.1139	the complete spectrum of the neutron star x-ray binary 4u0614+091	we observed the neutron star (ns) ultra-compact x-ray binary 4u0614+091quasi-simultaneously in the radio band (vla), mid-ir/ir (spitzer/mips andirac), near-ir/optical (smarts), optical-uv (swift/uvot), soft and hard x-rays(swift/xrt and rxte). the source was steadily in its `hard state'. we detectedthe source in the whole range, for the first time in the radio band at 4.86 and8.46 ghz and in the mid-ir at 24 um, up to 100 kev. the optically thicksynchrotron spectrum of the jet is consistent with being flat from the radio tothe mid-ir band. the flat jet spectrum breaks in the range (1-4)x10^(13) hz toan optically-thin power-law synchrotron spectrum with spectral index ~-0.5.these observations allow us to estimate a lower limit on the jet radiativepower of ~3x10^(32) erg/s and a total jet power lj~10^(34) u_(0.05)^(-1)ec^(0.53) erg/s (where ec is the high-energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrumin ev and u_(0.05) is the radiative efficiency in units of 0.05). thecontemporaneous detection of the optically thin part of the compact jet and thex-ray tail above 30 kev allows us to assess the contribution of the jet to thehard x-ray tail by synchrotron self-compton (ssc) processes. we conclude that,for realistic jet size, boosting, viewing angle and energy partition, the sscemission alone, from the post-shock, accelerated, non-thermal population in thejet, is not a viable mechanism to explain the observed hard x-ray tail of theneutron star 4u0614+091.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1005.3066	evolution of the radio - x-ray coupling throughout an entire outburst of  aquila x-1	the 2009 november outburst of the neutron star x-ray binary aquila x-1 wasobserved with unprecedented radio coverage and simultaneous pointed x-rayobservations, tracing the radio emission around the full x-ray hysteresis loopof the outburst for the first time. we use these data to discuss the disc-jetcoupling, finding the radio emission to be consistent with being triggered atstate transitions, both from the hard to the soft spectral state and viceversa. our data appear to confirm previous suggestions of radio quenching inthe soft state above a threshold x-ray luminosity of about 10% of the eddingtonluminosity. we also present the first detections of aql x-1 with very longbaseline interferometry (vlbi), showing that any extended emission isrelatively diffuse, and consistent with steady jets rather than arising fromdiscrete, compact knots. in all cases where multi-frequency data wereavailable, the source radio spectrum is consistent with being flat or slightlyinverted, suggesting that the internal shock mechanism that is believed toproduce optically thin transient radio ejecta in black hole x-ray binaries isnot active in aql x-1.

1105.3206	a new snr with tev shell-type morphology: hess j1731-347	the recent discovery of the radio shell-type supernova remnant (snr),g353.6-0.7, in spatial coincidence with the unidentified tev source hessj1731-347 has motivated further observations of the source with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) cherenkov telescope array to test a possibleassociation of the gamma-ray emission with the snr. with a total of 59 hours ofobservation, representing about four times the initial exposure available inthe discovery paper of hess j1731-347, the gamma-ray morphology is investigatedand compared with the radio morphology. an estimate of the distance is derivedby comparing the interstellar absorption derived from x-rays and the oneobtained from 12co and hi observations. the deeper gamma-ray observation of thesource has revealed a large shell-type structure with similar position andextension (r~0.25{\deg}) as the radio snr, thus confirming their association.by accounting for the h.e.s.s. angular resolution and projection effects withina simple shell model, the radial profile is compatible with a thin, spatiallyunresolved, rim. together with rx j1713.7-3946, rx j0852.0-4622 and sn 1006,hess j1731-347 is now the fourth snr with a significant shell morphology at tevenergies. the derived lower limit on the distance of the snr of 3.2 kpc is usedtogether with radio and x-ray data to discuss the possible origin of thegamma-ray emission, either via inverse compton scattering of electrons or thedecay of neutral pions resulting from proton-proton interaction.

1108.2855	discovery of the source hess j1356-645 associated with the young and  energetic psr j1357-6429	several newly discovered very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-raysources in the galaxy are thought to be associated with energetic pulsars.among them, middle-aged (&gt; 1e+4 yr) systems exhibit large centre-filled vhenebulae, offset from the pulsar position, which result from the complexrelationship between the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium, and reflectthe past evolution of the pulsar. imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(iacts) have been successful in revealing extended emission from these sourcesin the vhe regime. together with radio and x-ray observations, thisobservational window allows one to probe the energetics and magnetic fieldinside these large-scale nebulae. h.e.s.s., with its large field of view,angular resolution of &lt; 0.1deg and unprecedented sensitivity, has been used todiscover a large population of such vhe sources. in this paper, the h.e.s.s.data from the continuation of the galactic plane survey (-80deg &lt; l &lt; 60deg,|b| &lt; 3deg), together with the existing multi-wavelength observations, areused. a new vhe gamma-ray source was discovered at r.a.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1201.1678	disc-jet coupling in the 2009 outburst of the black hole candidate  h1743-322	we present an intensive radio and x-ray monitoring campaign on the 2009outburst of the galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary h1743-322. with thehigh angular resolution of the very long baseline array, we resolve the jetejection event and measure the proper motions of the jet ejecta relative to theposition of the compact core jets detected at the beginning of the outburst.this allows us to accurately couple the moment when the jet ejection eventoccurred with x-ray spectral and timing signatures. we find that x-ray timingsignatures are the best diagnostic of the jet ejection event in this outburst,which occurred as the x-ray variability began to decrease and the type cquasi-periodic oscillations disappeared from the x-ray power density spectrum.however, this sequence of events does not appear to be replicated in all blackhole x-ray binary outbursts, even within an individual source. in ourobservations of h1743-322, the ejection was contemporaneous with a quenching ofthe radio emission, prior to the start of the major radio flare. thiscontradicts previous assumptions that the onset of the radio flare marks themoment of ejection. the jet speed appears to vary between outbursts, with apossible positive correlation with outburst luminosity. the compact core radiojet reactivated on transition to the hard intermediate state at the end of theoutburst, and not when the source reached the low hard spectral state.comparison with the known near-infrared behaviour of the compact jets suggestsa gradual evolution of the compact jet power over a few days near the beginningand end of an outburst.

1212.3409	measurement of the extragalactic background light imprint on the spectra  of the brightest blazars observed with h.e.s.s	the extragalactic background light (ebl) is the diffuse radiation with thesecond highest energy density in the universe after the cosmic microwavebackground. the aim of this study is the measurement of the imprint of the eblopacity to gamma-rays on the spectra of the brightest extragalactic sourcesdetected with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the originalityof the method lies in the joint fit of the ebl optical depth and of theintrinsic spectra of the sources, assuming intrinsic smoothness. analysis of atotal of ~10^5 gamma-ray events enables the detection of an ebl signature atthe 8.8 std dev level and constitutes the first measurement of the ebl opticaldepth using very-high energy (e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rays. the ebl flux density isconstrained over almost two decades of wavelengths (0.30-17 microns) and thepeak value at 1.4 micron is derived as 15 +/- 2 (stat) +/- 3 (sys) nw / m^2 sr.

1304.3510	an evolving compact jet in the black hole x-ray binary maxi j1836-194	we report striking changes in the broadband spectrum of the compact jet ofthe black hole transient maxi j1836-194 over state transitions during itsdiscovery outburst in 2011. a fading of the optical-infrared (ir) flux occurredas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening asit returned to the hard state. the optical-ir spectrum was consistent with apower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the x-rayspectrum was softest. by fitting the radio to optical spectra with a brokenpower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thinbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum. the break gradually shifted to higherfrequencies as the source hardened at x-ray energies, from ~ 10^11 to ~ 4 x10^13 hz. the radiative jet luminosity integrated over the spectrum appeared tobe greatest when the source entered the hard state during the outburst decay(although this is dependent on the high energy cooling break, which is not seendirectly), even though the radio flux was fading at the time. the physicalprocess responsible for suppressing and reactivating the jet (neither of whichare instantaneous but occur on timescales of weeks) is uncertain, but couldarise from the varying inner accretion disk radius regulating the fraction ofaccreting matter that is channeled into the jet. this provides an unprecedentedinsight into the connection between inflow and outflow, and has implicationsfor the conditions required for jets to be produced, and hence their launchingprocess.

astro-ph;0204183	cosmic rays from microquasars: a narrow component to the cr spectrum?	we propose that relativistic galactic jets like those observed in grs1915+105 and gro j1655-40 may produce small but measurable contributions to thecosmic ray (cr) spectrum. if these jets contain cold protons and heavy ions (asin ss433), it is plausible that this component will consist of a narrowspectral feature, with a mean particle energy corresponding roughly to the bulkkinetic particle energy in the beam, gamma_jet m c^2, which, based on currentestimates of gamma_jet, falls into the range of 3-10 gev. the presence ofseveral sources with different gamma_jet will lead to superposition of severalsuch peaks. additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce apowerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visibleas another spectral feature. the large metallicities measured in severalmicroquasar companions suggest that this cr component could have an anomalouscomposition compared to the bulk galactic crs. we provide estimates of theeffects of adiabatic losses, which pose the greatest challenge to models ofnarrow band cr production in microquasar jets. while the total energy containedin the microquasar cr component is highly uncertain, the cr spectrum in thevicinity of microquasars would be severely affected. ams02 will be able toprobe the low energy cr spectrum for such components and composition anomalies.the spectrally peculiar gamma-ray emission produced by interaction of the ismwith crs surrounding microquasars might be detectable by glast. if the presenceof a microquasar cr proton component can be ruled out observationally, thisargument could be turned around in favor of electron-positron jets. we showthat existing osse/gro and future integral data on the galactic 511 kev lineflux put interesting constraints on the particle content of microquasar jets.

astro-ph;0308131	ram pressure stripping and the formation of cold fronts	chandra and xmm-newton observations of many clusters reveal sharpdiscontinuities in the surface brightness, which, unlike shocks, have lower gastemperature on the x-ray brighter side of the discontinuity. for that reasonthese features are called ``cold fronts''. it is believed that some cold frontsare formed when a subcluster merges with another cluster and the ram pressureof gas flowing outside the subcluster gives the contact discontinuity thecharacteristic curved shape. while some edges may not arise directly frommergers (e.g., a496, dupke &amp; white, 2003), this paper focuses on those whicharise as contact discontinuities between a merging subcluster and the ambientcluster gas. we argue that the flow of gas past the merging subcluster inducesslow motions inside the cloud. these motions transport gas from the centralparts of the subcluster towards the interface. since in a typical cluster orgroup (even an isothermal one) the entropy of the gas in the central regions issignificantly lower than in the outer regions, the transport of the low entropygas towards the interface and the associated adiabatic expansion makes the gastemperature immediately inside the interface lower than in any other place inthe system, thus enhancing the temperature jump across the interface and makingthe ``tip'' of the contact discontinuity cool. we illustrate this picture withthe xmm-newton gas temperature map of the a3667 cluster.

astro-ph;0312576	reflections of agn outbursts in the gaseous atmosphere of m87	we combined deep chandra, rosat hri, and xmm-newton observations of m87 tostudy the impact of agn outbursts on its gaseous atmosphere. many x-rayfeatures appear to be a direct result of repetitive agn outbursts. inparticular, the x-ray cavities around the jet and counter jet are likely due tothe expansion of radio plasma, while rings of enhanced emission at 14 and 17kpc are probably shock fronts associated with outbursts that began1-2\times10^7 years ago. the effects of these shocks are also seen inbrightenings within the prominent x-ray arms. on larger scales, ~50 kpc fromthe nucleus, depressions in the surface brightness may be remnants of earlieroutbursts. as suggested for the perseus cluster (fabian et al.), our analysisof the energetics of the m87 outbursts argues that shocks may be the mostsignificant channel for agn energy input into the cooling flow atmospheres ofgalaxies, groups, and clusters. for m87, the mean power driving the shockoutburst, 2.4\times 10^{43} ergs/sec, is three times greater than the radiativelosses from the entire ``cooling flow''. thus, even in the absence of otherenergy inputs, outbursts every 3\times10^7 years are sufficient to quench theflow.

astro-ph;0407070	long term variability of cygnus x-1, iii. radio-x-ray correlations	long time scale radio-x-ray correlations in black holes during the hard statehave been found in many sources and there seems to emerge a universalunderlying relationship which quantitatively describes this behavior. althoughit would appear only natural to detect short term emission patterns in thex-ray and - with a certain time lag - in the radio, there has been littleevidence for this up to now. the most prominent source for radio-x-raycorrelations on short time scales (minutes) so far remains grs 1915+105 where asingle mass ejection could be detected successively in the x-ray, ir, and radiowavebands. we analyze a database of more than 4 years of simultaneousradio-x-ray data for cygnus x-1 from the ryle telescope and rxte pca/hexte. weconfirm the existence of a radio-x-ray correlation on long time scales,especially at hard energies. we show that apparent correlations on short timescales in the lightcurves of cygnus x-1 are most likely the coincidentaloutcome of white noise statistics. interpreting this result as a breakdown ofradio-x-ray correlations on shorter time scales, this sets a limit to the speedof the jet.

astro-ph;0409029	constraints on the role of synchrotron x-rays from jets of accreting  black holes	we present an extension of the scale invariance formalism by heinz &amp; sunyaev(2003) which includes the effects of radiative cooling on the x-ray synchrotronemission from core dominated jets and outflows. we derive the scaling relationsbetween the radio luminosity l_r, the synchrotron x-ray luminosity l_x, themass m, and the accretion rate of an accreting black hole. we argue that theinclusion of synchrotron losses into the scaling relations is required by thedata used in merloni, heinz, &amp; dimatteo (2003) to define the "fundamentalplane'' correlation between l_r, l_x, and m in agns and galactic x-raybinaries. we then fit the new scaling relations to the "fundamental plane"correlation. this allows us to derive statistical constraints on thecontribution from jet synchrotron emission to the x-rays from black holes, or,alternatively, on the particle acceleration scheme at work in these jets. wefind that, in order for jet synchrotron x-rays to be consistent with theobserved "fundamental plane" correlation, the global particle spectrum must beboth steep: f(gamma) ~ gamma^(-(3.4 (+0.6-0.5)), and unbroken down to energieswell below the radio synchrotron regime. such a steep particle distributionwould imply steeper x-ray spectra than observed in most sources contributing tothe correlation with avalailable x-ray spectral index measurements. we suggestthat, unless some assumptions of the scale invariance hypothesis are broken,another emission mechanism (likely either disk radiation and/or inverse comptonscattering in the jet) contributes significantly to the x-rays of a sizeablefraction of the sources.

astro-ph;0410282	constraints on relativistic beaming from estimators of the unbeamed flux	we review the statistical properties of relativistic doppler boostingrelevant for studies of relativistic jets from compact objects based onradio--x-ray(--mass) correlations, such as that found in black-hole x-raybinaries in the low/hard state, or the ``fundamental plane'' of merloni, heinz,&amp; dimatteo. we show that the presence of only moderate scatter in suchrelations does not necessarily imply low lorentz factors of the jets producingthe radio emission in the samples under consideration. applying doppler beamingstatistics to a large sample of xrbs and agn, we derive a limit on the width ofthe lorentz factor distribution of black holes with relativistic jets: if thex-rays are unbeamed (e.g., if they originate in the accretion disk or in theslower, innermost part of the jet), the width of the \beta\gamma distributionshould be about one order of magnitude or less. if the scatter about the``fundamental plane'' is entirely dominated by relativistic beaming, a lowerlimit on the mean lorentz factor &lt;\beta\gamma&gt; &gt; 5 can be derived. on the otherhand, if the x-rays are boosted by the same factor as the radio emission, weshow that the observed scatter cannot be reasonably explained by dopplerboosting alone.

astro-ph;0508228	a dark jet dominates the power output of the stellar black hole cygnus  x-1	accreting black holes are thought to emit the bulk of their power in thex-ray band by releasing the gravitational potential energy of the infallingmatter. at the same time, they are capable of producing highly collimated jetsof energy and particles flowing out of the system with relativistic velocities.here we show that the 10 solar mass black hole in the x-ray binary cygnus x-1is surrounded by a large-scale (about 5 pc in diameter) ring-like structurethat appears to be inflated by the inner radio jet. we estimate that in orderto sustain the observed emission of the ring, the jet of cygnus x-1 has tocarry a kinetic power that can be as high as the bolometric x-ray luminosity ofthe binary system. this result may imply that low-luminosity stellar mass blackholes as a whole dissipate the bulk of the liberated accretion power in theform of `dark', radiatively inefficient relativistic outflows, rather thanlocally in the x-ray emitting inflow.

astro-ph;0508277	estimating the kinetic luminosity function of jets from galactic x-ray  binaries	by combining the recently derived x-ray luminosity function for galacticx-ray binaries (xrbs) by grimm et al. (2002) and the radio-x-ray-mass relationof accreting black holes found by merloni et al. (2003), we derive predictionsfor the radio luminosity function and radio flux distribution (logn/logs) forxrbs. based on the interpretation that the radio-x-ray-mass relation is anexpression of an underlying relation between jet power and nuclear radioluminosity, we derive the kinetic luminosity function for galactic black holejets, up to a normalization constant in jet power. we present estimates forthis constant on the basis of known ratios of jet power to core flux for agnjets and available limits for individual xrbs. we find that, if xrb jets doindeed fall on the same radio flux--kinetic power relation as agn jets, theestimated mean kinetic luminosity of typical low/hard state jets is of theorder of &lt;w_{xrb}&gt; ~ 2x10^37 ergs/s, with a total integrated power output of w\~ 5.5x10^38 ergs/s. we find that the power carried in transient jets should beof comparable magnitude to that carried in low/hard state jets. includingneutron star systems increases this estimate to w ~ 9x10^38 ergs/s. we estimatethe total kinetic energy output from low/hard state jets over the history ofthe galaxy to be e_{xrb} ~ 7x10^56 ergs.

astro-ph;0604583	filaments, bubbles, and weak shocks in the gaseous atmosphere of m87	we present the first results from a 500 ksec chandra acis-i observation ofm87. at soft energies (0.5-1.0 kev), we detect filamentary structuresassociated with the eastern and southwestern x-ray and radio arms. manyfilaments are spatially resolved with widths of ~300 pc. this filamentarystructure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest thefilaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whoseages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. these x-ray structures may be influenced bymagnetic filamentation. at hard energies (3.5-7.5 kev), we detect a nearlycircular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguoussignature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the smbh. the densityrise in the shock is ~1.3 (mach number, m~1.2). the observed spectral hardeningin the ring corresponds to a temperature rise t_shock / t_0 ~ 1.2, or m~1.2, inagreement with the mach number derived independently from the gas density.thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumpsassociated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive blackhole. we also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressureenhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. the ~0.6' feature may beover-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radiococoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of agn activity. theover-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. the ~1' feature may bean additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. in an earlier episode, the``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.

astro-ph;0605376	a radio-emitting outflow in the quiescent state of a0620-00:  implications for modelling low-luminosity black hole binaries	deep observations with the very large array of a0620-00, performed in 2005august, resulted in the first detection of radio emission from a black holebinary at x-ray luminosities as low as 10^{-8.5} times the eddington limit. themeasured radio flux density, of 51 \pm 7 microjy at 8.5 ghz, is the lowestreported for an x-ray binary system so far, and is interpreted in terms ofpartially self-absorbed synchrotron emission from outflowing plasma. making useof the estimated outer accretion rate of a0620-00 in quiescence, we demonstratethat the outflow kinetic power must be energetically comparable to the totalaccretion power associated with such rate, if it was to reach the black holewith the standard radiative efficiency of 10 per cent. this favours a model forquiescence in which a radiatively inefficient outflow accounts for a sizablefraction of the missing energy, and, in turn, substantially affects the overalldynamics of the accretion flow. simultaneous observations in the x-ray band,with chandra, confirm the validity of a non-linear radio/x-ray correlation forhard state black hole binaries down to low quiescent luminosities, therebycontradicting some theoretical expectations. taking the mass term into account,the a0620-00 data lie on the extrapolation of the so called fundamental planeof black hole activity, which has thus been extended by more than 2 orders ofmagnitude in radio and x-ray luminosity. with the addition of the a0620-00point, the plane relation provides an empirical proof for the scale-invarianceof the jet-accretion coupling in accreting black holes over the entireparameter space observable with current instrumentation.

astro-ph;0606664	the answer is blowing in the wind: simulating the interaction of jets  with dynamic cluster atmospheres	we present numerical simulations investigating the interaction of agn jetswith galaxy clusters, for the first time taking into account the dynamic natureof the cluster gas and detailed cluster physics. the simulations successfullyreproduce the observed morphologies of radio sources in clusters. we find thatcluster inhomogeneities and large scale flows have significant impact on themorphology of the radio source and cannot be ignored a-priori wheninvestigating radio source dynamics. morphological comparison suggests that thegas in the centres of clusters like virgo and abell 4059 shows significantshear and/or rotation. we find that shear and rotation in the intra-clustermedium move large amounts of cold material back into the path of the jet,ensuring that subsequent jet outbursts encounter a sufficient column density ofgas to couple with the inner cluster gas, thus alleviating the problem ofevacuated channels discussed in the recent literature. the same effectsredistribute the excess energy delta_e deposited by the jets, making thedistribution of delta_e at late times consistent with being isotropic.

astro-ph;0703801	impact of tangled magnetic fields on agn-blown bubbles	there is growing consensus that feedback from agn is the main mechanismresponsible for stopping cooling flows in clusters of galaxies. agn are knownto inflate buoyant bubbles that supply mechanical power to the intracluster gas(icm). high reynolds number hydrodynamical simulations show that such bubblesget entirely disrupted within 100 myr, as they rise in cluster atmospheres,which is contrary to observations. this artificial mixing has consequences formodels trying to quantify the amount of heating and star formation in cool coreclusters of galaxies. it has been suggested that magnetic fields can stabilizebubbles against disruption. we perform mhd simulations of fossil bubbles in thepresence of tangled magnetic fields using the high order pencil code. we focuson the physically-motivated case where thermal pressure dominates over magneticpressure and consider randomly oriented fields with and without maximumhelicity and a case where large scale external fields drape the bubble.we findthat helicity has some stabilizing effect. however, unless the coherence lengthof magnetic fields exceeds the bubble size, the bubbles are quickly shredded.as observations of hydra a suggest that lengthscale of magnetic fields may besmaller then typical bubble size, this may suggest that other mechanisms, suchas viscosity, may be responsible for stabilizing the bubbles. however, sincefaraday rotation observations of radio lobes do not constrain large scale icmfields well if they are aligned with the bubble surface, the draping case maybe a viable alternative solution to the problem. a generic feature found in oursimulations is the formation of magnetic wakes where fields are ordered andamplified. we suggest that this effect could prevent evaporation by thermalconduction of cold halpha filaments observed in the perseus cluster.

astro-ph;9707284	analysis of the synchrotron emission from the m87 jet	we propose that the intensity changes and spectral evolution along the m87jet can be explained by adiabatic changes to the particle momentum distributionfunction and the magnetic field. this is supported by the lack of anysignificant variation in the radio-to-optical spectral index along the jet andthe moderate changes in radio brightness. assuming a simple scaling law betweenmagnetic field and density, we use the deprojection of a 2 cm vla intensity mapby sparks, biretta, &amp; macchetto (1996) to predict the spectral evolution alongthe jet. we derive limits for the magnetic field and the total pressure bycomparing our results with the spatially resolved fit to spectral data byneumann, meisenheimer, &amp; roeser (1997) of a model spectrum that cuts off atapprox 10^15 hz. to explain the weakness of synchrotron cooling along the jet,the magnetic field strength must lie below the equipartition value. althoughthe inferred pressure in the limit of nonrelativistic bulk flow lies far abovethe estimated pressure of the interstellar matter in the center of m87, bulklorentz factors gamma_jet in the range of 3 - 5 and inclination angles approxless than 25 deg lead to pressure estimates close to the ism pressure. theaverage best fit magnetic fields we derive fall in the range of 20 - 40 microg,departing from equipartition by a factor approx 1.5 - 5. this model isconsistent with the proposal by bicknell &amp; begelman (1996) that the knots inthe m87 jet are weak, oblique shocks. first-order fermi acceleration will thenhave a minimal effect on the slope of the radio-- to-optical spectrum whilepossibly accounting for the x-ray spectrum.

astro-ph;9912429	jet acceleration by tangled magnetic fields	we explore the possibility that extragalactic radio jets might be acceleratedby highly disorganized magnetic fields that are strong enough to dominate thedynamics until the terminal lorentz factor is reached. following thetwin-exhaust model by blandford &amp; rees (1974), the collimation under thisscenario is provided by the stratified thermal pressure from an externalmedium. the acceleration efficiency then depends on the pressure gradient ofthat medium. in order for this mechanism to work there must be continuoustangling of the magnetic field, changing the magnetic equation of state awayfrom pure flux freezing (otherwise conversion of poynting flux to kineticenergy flux is suppressed). this is a complementary approach to models in whichthe plasma is accelerated by large scale ordered fields. we include a simpleprescription for magnetic dissipation, which leads to tradeoffs amongconversion of magnetic energy into bulk kinetic energy, random particle energy,and radiation. we present analytic dynamical solutions of such jets, assess theeffects of radiation drag, and comment on observational issues, such as thepredicted polarization and synchrotron brightness. finally, we try to make theconnection to observed radio galaxies and gamma-ray bursts.
