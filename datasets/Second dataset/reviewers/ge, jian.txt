0909.2259	direct detection of planets orbiting large angular diameter stars:  sensitivity of an internally-occulting space-based coronagraph	high-contrast imaging observations of large angular diameter stars enablecomplementary science questions to be addressed compared to the baseline goalsof proposed missions like the terrestrial planet finder-coronagraph, newworld's observer, and others. such targets however present a practical problemin that finite stellar size results in unwanted starlight reaching thedetector, which degrades contrast. in this paper, we quantify the sensitivity,in terms of contrast, of an internally-occulting, space-based coronagraph as afunction of stellar angular diameter, from unresolved dwarfs to the largestevolved stars. our calculations show that an assortment of band-limited imagemasks can accommodate a diverse set of observations to help maximize missionscientific return. we discuss two applications based on the results: thespectro-photometric study of planets already discovered with the radialvelocity technique to orbit evolved stars, which we elucidate with the exampleof pollux b, and the direct detection of planets orbiting our closest neighbor,alpha centauri, whose primary component is on the main-sequence but subtends anappreciable angle on the sky. it is recommended that similar trade studies beperformed with other promising internal, external, and hybrid occulter designsfor comparison, as there is relevance to a host of interesting topics inplanetary science and related fields.

1004.2932	on-sky demonstration of a linear band-limited mask with application to  visual binary stars	we have designed and built the first band-limited coronagraphic mask used forground-based high-contrast imaging observations. the mask resides in the focalplane of the near-infrared camera pharo at the palomar hale telescope andreceives a well-corrected beam from an extreme adaptive optics system. itsperformance on-sky with single stars is comparable to current state-of-the-artinstruments: contrast levels of $\sim10^{-5}$ or better at 0.8" in $k_s$ afterpost-processing, depending on how well non-common-path errors are calibrated.however, given the mask's linear geometry, we are able to conduct additionalunique science observations. since the mask does not suffer from pointingerrors down its long axis, it can suppress the light from two different starssimultaneously, such as the individual components of a spatially resolvedbinary star system, and search for faint tertiary companions. in this paper, wepresent the design of the mask, the science motivation for targeting binarystars, and our preliminary results, including the detection of a candidatem-dwarf tertiary companion orbiting the visual binary star hip 48337, which weare continuing to monitor with astrometry to determine its association.

1005.5564	theory of dispersed fixed-delay interferometry for radial velocity  exoplanet searches	the dispersed fixed-delay interferometer (dfdi) represents a new instrumentconcept for high-precision radial velocity (rv) surveys for extrasolar planets.a combination of michelson interferometer and medium-resolution spectrograph,it has the potential for performing multi-object surveys, where most previousrv techniques have been limited to observing only one target at a time. becauseof the large sample of extrasolar planets needed to better understand planetaryformation, evolution, and prevalence, this new technique represents a logicalnext step in instrumentation for rv extrasolar planet searches, and has beenproven with the single-object exoplanet tracker (et) at kitt peak nationalobservatory, and the multi-object w. m. keck/marvels exoplanet tracker atapache point observatory. the development of the et instruments hasnecessitated fleshing out a detailed understanding of the physical principlesof the dfdi technique. here we summarize the fundamental theoretical materialneeded to understand the technique and provide an overview of the physicsunderlying the instrument's working. we also derive some useful analyticalformulae that can be used to estimate the level of various sources of errorgeneric to the technique, such as photon shot noise when using a fiducialreference spectrum, contamination by secondary spectra (e.g., crowded sources,spectroscopic binaries, or moonlight contamination), residual interferometercomb, and reference cross-talk error. following this, we show that the use of atraditional gas absorption fiducial reference with a dfdi can incur significantsystematic errors that must be taken into account at the precision levelsrequired to detect extrasolar planets.

1009.4636	from dust to planetesimal: the snowball phase ?	the standard model of planet formation considers an initial phase in whichplanetesimals form from a dust disk, followed by a phase of mutualplanetesimal-planetesimal collisions, leading eventually to the formation ofplanetary embryos. however, there is a potential transition phase (which wecall the "snowball phase"), between the formation of the first planetesimalsand the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been eitherignored or underestimated in previous studies. in this snowball phase, isolatedplanetesimals move on keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretionof sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. using asimplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from thedust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow beforemutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a numberof critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, theplanetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation. for systemsin which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate andwith relatively small birth size, we show that the snowball growth phase can bevery important, allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in massbefore mutual collisions take over. in such cases, the snowball growth phasecan be the dominant mode to transfer mass from the dust to planetesimals.moreover, such growth can take place within the typical lifetime of aprotoplanetary gas disk. a noteworthy result is that ... ...(see the paper).for the specific case of close binaries such as alpha centauri ... ...

1103.1932	towards detecting the 2175-{\aa} dust feature associated with strong  high redshift mg {\ss}ii absorption lines	we report detections of 39 2175-{\aa} dust extinction bump candidatesassociated with strong mg ii absorption lines at z$\sim$ 1--1.8 on quasarspectra in sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr3. these strong mg ii absorptionline systems are detected among 2,951 strong mg ii absorbers with the restequivalent width $w_r\lambda2796 &gt;$ 1.0{\aa} at $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.86$, which is partof a full sample of 7,421 strong mg ii absorbers compiled by prochter et al.(2006). the redshift range of the absorbers is chosen to allow the 2175-{\aa}extinction features to be completely covered within the sdss spectrographoperation wavelength range. an upper limit of the background quasar emissionredshift at z$=$2.1 is set to prevent the ly$\alpha$ forest lines fromcontaminating the sensitive spectral region for the 2175-{\aa} bumpmeasurements. the fm90 (fitzpatrick &amp; massa 1990) parameterization is appliedto model the optical/uv extinction curve in the rest frame of mg ii absorbersof the 2175-{\aa} bump candidates. the simulation technique developed by jianget al. (2010a, b) is used to derive the statistical significance of thecandidate 2175-{\aa} bumps. a total of 12 absorbers are detected with2175-{\aa} bumps at a 5$\sigma$ level of statistical significance, 10 aredetected at a 4$\sigma$ level and 17 are detected at a 3$\sigma$ level. most ofthe candidate bumps in this work are similar to the relatively weak 2175-{\aa}bumps observed in the large magellanic clouds (lmc) lmc2 supershell rather thanthe strong ones observed in the milky way (mw). this sample has greatlyincreased the total number of 2175-{\aa} extinction bumps measured on sdssquasar spectra. follow-up observations may rule out some of possible falsedetections and reveal the physical and chemical natures of 2175-{\aa} quasarabsorbers.

1104.1475	planet formation in highly inclined binary systems i. planetesimals jump  inwards and pile up	most detected planet-bearing binaries are in wide orbits, for which a highinclination, $i_b$, between the binary orbital plane and the plane of theplanetary disk around the primary is likely to be common. in this paper, weinvestigate the intermediate stages - from planetesimals to planetaryembryos/cores - of planet formation in such highly inclined cases. our focus ison the effects of gas drag on the planetesimals' orbital evolution, inparticular on the evolution of the planetesimals' semimajor axis distributionand their mutual relative velocities. we first demonstrate that a non-evolvingaxisymmetric disk model is a good approximation for studying the effects of gasdrag on a planetesimal in the highly inclined case ($30^\circ &lt;i_b&lt;150^\circ$).we then find that gas drag plays a crucial role, and the results can begenerally divided into two categories, i.e., the kozai-on regime and thekozai-off regime, depending on the specific value of $i_b$. for both regimes, arobust outcome over a wide range of parameters is that, planetesimalsmigrate/jump inwards and pile up, leading to a severely truncated and denseplanetesimal disk around the primary. in this compact and dense disk, collisionrates are high but relative velocities are low, providing conditions which arefavorable for planetesimal growth, and potentially allow for the subsequentformation of planets.

1105.0989	fundamental performance of a dispersed fixed delay interferometer in  searching for planets around m dwarfs	we present a new method to calculate fundamental doppler measurement limitswith a dispersed fixed-delay interferometer (dfdi) in the near infraredwavelength region for searching for exoplanets around m dwarfs in the comingdecade. it is based on calculating the q factor, a measure of flux-normalizeddoppler sensitivity in the fringing spectra created with dfdi. we calculate theq factor as a function of spectral resolution r, stellar projected rotationalvelocity v sini, stellar effective temperature t_eff and optical pathdifference (opd) of the interferometer. we also compare the dfdi q factor tothat for the popular cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph method (the directechelle (de) method). given the ir doppler measurement is likely to bedetector-limited for a while, we introduce new merit functions, which isdirectly related to photon-limited rv uncertainty, to evaluate dopplerperformance with the dfdi and de methods. we find that dfdi has strength inwavelength coverage and multi-object capability over the de for a limiteddetector resource. we simulate the performance of the infrared exoplanettracker (iret) based on the dfdi design, being considered for the nextgeneration ir doppler measurements. the predicted photon-limited rv uncertaintysuggests that iret is capable of detecting earth-like exoplanets in habitablezone around nearby bright m dwarfs if they exist. a new method is developed toquantitatively estimate the influence of telluric lines on rv uncertainty. ourstudy shows that photon-limited rv uncertainty can be reached if 99% of thestrength of telluric lines can be removed from the measured stellar spectra. atlow to moderate levels of telluric line strength removal (50% to 90%), theoptimal rv uncertainty is typically a factor of 2-3 times larger thanphoton-limited rv uncertainty.

1210.6389	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: the quasar  luminosity function from data release nine	we present a new measurement of the optical quasar luminosity function (qlf),using data from the sloan digital sky survey-iii: baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (sdss-iii: boss). from the sdss-iii data release nine(dr9), we select a uniform sample of 22,301 i&lt;=21.8 quasars over an area of2236 sq. deg with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts between 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5, fillingin a key part of the luminosity-redshift plane for optical quasar studies. wederive the completeness of the survey through simulated quasar photometry, andcheck this completeness estimate using a sample of quasars selected by theirphotometric variability within the boss footprint. we investigate the level ofsystematics associated with our quasar sample using the simulations, in theprocess generating color-redshift relations and a new quasar k-correction. weprobe the faint end of the qlf to m_i(z=2.2) = -24.5 and see a clear break inthe qlf at all redshifts up to z=3.5. we find that a log-linear relation (inlog[phi*] - m*) for a luminosity and density evolution (lede) model adequatelydescribes our data within the range 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5; across this interval the breakluminosity increases by a factor of ~2.3 while phi* declines by a factor of ~6.at z&lt;2.2 our data is reasonably well fit by a pure luminosity evolution (ple)model. we see only a weak signature of "agn downsizing", in line with recentstudies of the hard x-ray luminosity function. we compare our measured qlf to anumber of theoretical models and find that models making a variety ofassumptions about quasar triggering and halo occupation can fit our data over awide range of redshifts and luminosities.

1211.6140	very low-mass stellar and substellar companions to solar-like stars from  marvels iii: a short-period brown dwarf candidate around an active g0iv  subgiant	we present an eccentric, short-period brown dwarf candidate orbiting theactive, slightly evolved subgiant star tyc 2087-00255-1, which has effectivetemperature t_eff = 5903+/-42 k, surface gravity log (g) = 4.07+/-0.16 (cgs),and metallicity [fe/h] = -0.23+/-0.07. this candidate was discovered using datafrom the first two years of the multi-object apo radial velocity exoplanetslarge-area survey (marvels), which is part of the third phase of sloan digitalsky survey. from our 38 radial velocity measurements spread over a two-yeartime baseline, we derive a keplerian orbital fit with semi-amplitudek=3.571+/-0.041 km/s, period p=9.0090+/-0.0004 days, and eccentricitye=0.226+/-0.011. adopting a mass of 1.16+/-0.11 msun for the subgiant hoststar, we infer that the companion has a minimum mass of 40.0+/-2.5 m_jup.assuming an edge-on orbit, the semimajor axis is 0.090+/-0.003 au. the hoststar is photometrically variable at the \sim1% level with a period of\sim13.16+/-0.01 days, indicating that the host star spin and companion orbitare not synchronized. through adaptive optics imaging we also found a pointsource 643+/-10 mas away from tyc 2087-00255-1, which would have a mass of 0.13msun if it is physically associated with tyc 2087-00255-1 and has the same age.future proper motion observation should be able to resolve if this tertiaryobject is physically associated with tyc 2087-00255-1 and make tyc 2087-00255-1a triple body system. core ca ii h and k line emission indicate that the hostis chromospherically active, at a level that is consistent with the inferredspin period and measured v_{rot}*sin i, but unusual for a subgiant of thist_eff. this activity could be explained by ongoing tidal spin-up of the hoststar by the companion.

1212.4493	the z=5 quasar luminosity function from sdss stripe 82	we present a measurement of the type i quasar luminosity function at z=5using a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed quasars selected fromoptical imaging data. we measure the bright end (m_1450&lt;-26) with sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data covering ~6000 deg^2, then extend to lower luminosities(m_1450&lt;-24) with newly discovered, faint z~5 quasars selected from 235 deg^2of deep, coadded imaging in the sdss stripe 82 region (the celestial equator inthe southern galactic cap). the faint sample includes 14 quasars with spectraobtained as ancillary science targets in the sdss-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss), and 59 quasars observed at the mmt and magellantelescopes. we construct a well-defined sample of 4.7&lt;z&lt;5.1 quasars that ishighly complete, with 73 spectroscopic identifications out of 92 candidates.our color selection method is also highly efficient: of the 73 spectraobtained, 71 are high redshift quasars. these observations reach below thebreak in the luminosity function (m_1450* ~ -27). the bright end slope is steep(beta &lt;~ -4), with a constraint of beta &lt; -3.1 at 95% confidence. the breakluminosity appears to evolve strongly at high redshift, providing anexplanation for the flattening of the bright end slope reported previously. wefind a factor of ~2 greater decrease in the number density of luminous quasars(m_1450&lt;-26) from z=5 to z=6 than from z=4 to z=5, suggesting a more rapiddecline in quasar activity at high redshift than found in previous surveys. ourmodel for the quasar luminosity function predicts that quasars generate ~30% ofthe ionizing photons required to keep the universe ionized at z=5.

1303.6442	statistical properties of brown dwarf companions: implications for  different formation mechanisms	the mass domain where massive extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs overlap isstill poorly understood due to the paucity of brown dwarfs orbiting close tosolar-type stars, the so-called brown dwarf desert. in this paper we collectall of available data about close brown dwarfs around solar type stars andtheir host stars from literature and study the demographics of the brown dwarfdesert. the data clearly show a short period and a medium mass gap in the browndwarf period-mass distribution diagram ($ 35&lt;m\sin i&lt;55 m_{\rm jup}$ and$p&lt;100$ days), representing the "driest land" in the brown dwarf desert.observation biases are highly unlikely to cause this gap due to its shortperiod and medium mass, of which brown dwarfs can be easily detected byprevious rv surveys. brown dwarfs above and below this gap have significantlydifferent eccentricity distribution, which not only confirms that this gap isreal, but also implies that they may have different origins. our furtherstatistical study indicates that brown dwarfs below this gap may primarily formin the protoplanetary disk through disk gravitational instability, while browndwarfs above this gap may dominantly form like a stellar binary throughmolecular cloud fragmentation. our discoveries have offered important insightsabout brown dwarf formation mechanisms and their possible relationships withplanet and star formation.

1305.0280	marvels-1: a face-on double-lined binary star masquerading as a resonant  planetary system; and consideration of rare false positives in radial  velocity planet searches	we have analyzed new and previously published radial velocity observations ofmarvels-1, known to have an ostensibly substellar companion in a ~6- day orbit.we find significant (~100 m/s) residuals to the best-fit model for thecompanion, and these residuals are naively consistent with an interior giantplanet with a p = 1.965d in a nearly perfect 3:1 period commensuribility(|pb/pc - 3| &lt; 10^{-4}). we have performed several tests for the reality ofsuch a companion, including a dynamical analysis, a search for photometricvariability, and a hunt for contaminating stellar spectra. we find many reasonsto be critical of a planetary interpretation, including the fact that most ofthe three-body dynamical solutions are unstable. we find no evidence fortransits, and no evidence of stellar photometric variability. we havediscovered two apparent companions to marvels-1 with adaptive optics imaging atkeck; both are m dwarfs, one is likely bound, and the other is likely aforeground object. we explore false-alarm scenarios inspired by variouscuriosities in the data. ultimately, a line profile and bisector analysis leadus to conclude that the ~100 m/s residuals are an artifact of spectralcontamination from a stellar companion contributing ~15-30% of the opticallight in the system. we conclude that origin of this contamination is thepreviously detected radial velocity companion to marvels-1, which is not, aspreviously reported, a brown dwarf, but in fact a g dwarf in a face-on orbit.

1306.3157	a cautionary tale: marvels brown dwarf candidate reveals itself to be a  very long period, highly eccentric spectroscopic stellar binary	we report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopicbinary star system (tyc 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that wehad initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. at themoderate resolving power of the marvels spectrograph and the spectrographs usedfor subsequent radial-velocity (rv) measurements (r ~ &lt;30,000), this particularstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an rv signal that would beinduced by a brown dwarf companion (msin(i)~50 m_jup) to a solar-type primary.at least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a singlestar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), itsrelatively long period (p~238 days), and the approximately perpendicularorientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189degrees). as a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two setsof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the rv measurements basedon centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by anorbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit(e~0.3). only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does thetrue, double-lined nature and large rv amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. thediscovery of this binary system is an important lesson for rv surveys searchingfor substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, asurvey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives fora range of orbital parameters. finally, for surveys like marvels that lack theresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor thepeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width orshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vettingprocess.

1407.0718	accurate atmospheric parameters at moderate resolution using spectral  indices: preliminary application to the marvels survey	studies of galactic chemical and dynamical evolution in the solarneighborhood depend on the availability of precise atmospheric parameters(teff, [fe/h] and log g) for solar-type stars. many large-scale spectroscopicsurveys operate at low to moderate spectral resolution for efficiency inobserving large samples, which makes the stellar characterization difficult dueto the high degree of blending of spectral features. while most surveys usespectral synthesis, in this work we employ an alternative method based onspectral indices to determine the atmospheric parameters of a sample of nearbyfgk dwarfs and subgiants observed by the marvels survey at moderate resolvingpower (r~12,000). we have developed three codes to automatically normalize theobserved spectra, measure the equivalent widths of the indices and, through thecomparison of those with values calculated with pre-determined calibrations,derive the atmospheric parameters of the stars. the calibrations were builtusing a sample of 309 stars with precise stellar parameters obtained from theanalysis of high-resolution feros spectra. a validation test of the method wasconducted with a sample of 30 marvels targets that also have reliableatmospheric parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. ourapproach was able to recover the parameters within 80 k for teff, 0.05 dex for[fe/h] and 0.15 dex for log g, values that are lower or equal to the typicalexternal uncertainties found between different high-resolution analyzes. anadditional test was performed with a subsample of 138 stars from the elodiestellar library and the literature atmospheric parameters were recovered within125 k for teff, 0.10 dex for [fe/h] and 0.29 dex for log g. these results showthat the spectral indices are a competitive tool to characterize stars with theintermediate resolution spectra.

1408.0829	a glimpse at quasar host galaxy far-uv emission, using dlas as natural  coronagraphs	in merger-driven models of massive galaxy evolution, the luminous quasarphase is expected to be accompanied by vigorous star formation in quasar hostgalaxies. in this paper, we use high column density damped lyman alpha (dla)systems along quasar sight lines as natural coronagraphs to directly study thefar-uv (fuv) radiation from the host galaxies of luminous background quasars.we have stacked the spectra of $\sim$2,000 dla systems (n_hi&gt;10^{20.6} cm^{-2})with a median absorption redshift &lt; z &gt; = 2.6 selected from quasars observed inthe sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we detect residual fluxin the dark troughs of the composite dla spectra. the level of this residualflux significantly exceeds systematic errors in the sdss fiber sky subtraction;furthermore, the residual flux is strongly correlated with the continuumluminosity of the background quasar, while uncorrelated with dla column densityor metallicity. we conclude that the flux could be associated with the averagefuv radiation from the background quasar host galaxies (with medium redshift &lt;z &gt; = 3.1) that is not blocked by the intervening dla. assuming all of thedetected flux originates from quasar hosts, for the highest quasar luminositybin (&lt; l &gt;= 2.5x 10^{13} l_sun), the host galaxy has a fuv intensity of 1.5 +/-0.2 x 10^{40} erg s^{-1} a^{-1}; this corresponds to an unobscured uv starformation rate of 9 m_sun/yr.

1408.1523	the 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.65 evolution of the bright end of the [oii] luminosity  function	we present the [oii] luminosity function measured in the redshift range0.1&lt;z&lt;1.65 with unprecedented depth and accuracy. our measurements are based onmedium resolution flux-calibrated spectra of emission line galaxies with thefors2 instrument at vlt and with the sdss-iii/boss spectrograph. the fors2spectra and the corresponding catalog containing redshifts and line fluxes arereleased along with this paper.  in this work we use a novel method to combine the aforementioned surveys withgama, zcosmos and vvds, which have different target selection, producing aconsistent weighting scheme to derive the [oii] luminosity function.  the measured luminosity function is in good agreement with previousindependent estimates. the comparison with two state-of-the-art semi-analyticalmodels is good, which is encouraging for the production of mock catalogs of[oii] flux limited surveys. we observe the bright end evolution over 8.5 gyr:we measure the decrease of log l* from 42.4 erg/s at redshift 1.44 to 41.2 atredshift 0.165 and we find that the faint end slope flattens when redshiftdecreases.  this measurement confirms the feasibility of the target selection of futurebaryonic acoustic oscillation surveys aiming at observing [oii] flux limitedsamples.

1409.3566	tracing chemical evolution over the extent of the milky way's disk with  apogee red clump stars	we employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolutionsdss-iii/apogee spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution ofmetallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of themilky way disk. using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clumpstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h]distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/fe] at intermediatemetallicities, -0.9&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([fe/h]=+0.2) thetwo sequences smoothly merge. we investigate the effects of the apogeeselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have littlequalitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. the describedabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5&lt;r&lt;11 kpc and 0&lt;|z|&lt;2 kpcacross the galaxy. the [alpha/fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence issurprisingly constant throughout the galaxy, with little variation from regionto region (~10%). using simple galactic chemical evolution models we derive anaverage star formation efficiency (sfe) in the high-alpha sequence of ~4.5e-101/yr, which is quite close to the nearly-constant value found inmolecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. this result suggests thatthe early evolution of the milky way disk was characterized by stars thatshared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,turbulent, and molecular-dominated ism with a gas consumption timescale (1/sfe)of ~2 gyr. finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner galaxycan be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold inthe outer galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations withdistinct enrichment histories.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

astro-ph;0310689	a search for sodium absorption from comets around hd209458	we monitored the planet-bearing solar-type star hd209458 for sodiumabsorption in the region of the stellar nai d1 line that would be indicative ofcometary activity in the system. we observed the star using the het hrs withhigh s/n and high spectral resolution for 6 nights over the course of twoyears, from july 2001 to july 2003. from modelling we determine a 20%likelihood of a detection, based on a predicted number of comets similar tothat of the solar system. we find that our analytical method is able to recovera signal and our s/n is sufficient to detect this feature in the spectralregions on either side of the core of the d1 line, where it is most likely toappear. no significant absorption was detected for any of the nights based on a3 sigma detection limit. we derive upper limits on the column density of sodiumof &lt; ~6 x 10^{9} cm^{-2} for a signal in the region around the line core and &lt;\~2 x 10^{10} cm^{-2} for a signal in the core of the photospheric d1 line.these numbers are consistent with the sodium released in a single periodiccomet in our own system, though higher s/n may be necessary to uncover a signalin the core of the d1 line. implications for cometary activity in the hd209458system are discussed.

astro-ph;0402372	unveiling su aurigae in the near infrared: new high spatial resolution  results using adaptive optics	we present here new results on circumstellar nebulosity around su aurigae, at-tauri star of about 2 solar mass and 5 myrs old at 152 pc in the j, h and kbands using high resolution adaptive optics imaging (0$\farcs$30) with the pennstate ir imaging spectrograph (piris) at the 100 inch mt. wilson telescope.  a comparison with hst stis optical (0.2 to 1.1 micron) images shows that theorientation of the circumstellar nebulosity in the near-ir extends from pas 210to 270 degrees in h and k bands and up to 300 degrees in the j band. we callthe circumstellar nebulosity seen between 210 to 270 degrees as 'irnebulosity'. we find that the ir nebulosity (which extends up to 3.5 arcsecs inj band and 2.5 arcsecs in the k band) is due to scattered light from thecentral star. the ir nebulosity is either a cavity formed by the stellaroutflows or part of the circumstellar disk. we present a schematic3-dimensional geometrical model of the disk and jet of su aur based on stis andour near-ir observations. according to this model the ir nebulosity is a partof the circumstellar disk seen at high inclination angles. the extension of their nebulosity is consistent with estimates of the disk diameter of 50 to 400 auin radius, from earlier mm, k band interferometric observations and sedfittings.

astro-ph;0404151	detections of the 2175 \aa dust feature at 1.4z 1.5 from the sloan  digital sky survey	the strongest spectroscopic dust extinction feature in the milky way, thebroad absorption bump at 2175 \aa, is generally believed to be caused byaromatic carbonaceous materials -- very likely a mixture of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) molecules, the most abundant and widespread organic moleculesin the milky way galaxy. in this paper we report identifications of thisabsorption feature in three galaxies at $1.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5$ whichproduce intervening mgii absorption toward quasars discovered by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the observed spectra can be fit using galactic-typeextinction laws, characterized by parameters [r_v, e(b-v)] ~ [0.7, 0.14], [1.9,0.13], and [5.5, 0.23], respectively, where r_v=a_v/e(b-v) is thetotal-to-selective extinction ratio, e(b-v) = a_b-a_v is the color-excess.these discoveries imply that the dust in these distant quasar absorptionsystems is similar in composition to that of milky way, but with a range ofdifferent grain size distributions. the presence of complex aromatichydrocarbon molecules in such distant galaxies is important for bothastrophysical and astrobiological investigations.

astro-ph;0506766	molecular hydrogen in the damped ly alpha absorber of q1331+170	we used hst/stis to obtain the spectrum of molecular hydrogen associated withthe damped ly$\alpha$ system at $z_{\rm abs}=1.7765$ toward the quasarq1331+170 at $z_{\rm em}=2.084$. strong ${\rm h}_2$ absorption was detected,with a total ${\rm h}_2$ column density of $n({\rm h}_2)=(4.45\pm 0.36)\times10^{19} {\rm cm^{-2}}$.the molecular hydrogen fraction is $f_{{\rmh}_2}=\frac{2n_{\rm h_2}}{n_{\rm hi}+2n_{\rm h_2}}=(5.6\pm 0.7)%$, which is thegreatest value reported so far in any redshifted damped ly$\alpha$ system. thisresults from the combined effect of a relatively high dust-to-gas ratio, a lowgas temperature, and an extremely low ambient uv radiation field. based on theobserved population of $j$ states, we estimate the photo-absorption rate to be$r_{\rm abs}=(7.6\pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13} {\rm s^{-1}}$, corresponding to alocal uv radiation field of $j(1000{\rm \aa})\approx 2.1\times 10^{-3}j_{1000{\rm \aa},\odot}$, where $j_{1000{\rm \aa},\odot}$ is the uv intensityat $1000 \aa$ in the solar neighborhood. this is comparable with themetagalactic uv background intensity at this redshift, and implies an extremelylow star formation rate in the absorber's environment. the observed co-to-h$_2$column density ratio is $\frac{n_{\rm co}}{n_{\rm h_2}}&lt;2.5\times 10^{-7}$,which is similar to the value measured for diffuse molecular clouds in thegalactic ism. finally, applying the inferred physical conditions to theobserved c i fine structure excitation (songaila {\it et al.} 1994), weestimate the cosmic microwave background temperature to be $t_{\rm cmb}=(7.2\pm0.8) {\rm k}$ at $z=1.77654$, consistent with the predicted value of $7.566{\rm k}$ from the standard cosmology.

astro-ph;0702702	comparative lyot coronagraphy with extreme ao systems	as adaptive optics technology continues to improve, the stellar coronagraphwill play an ever increasing role in ground-based high-contrast imagingobservations. though several different image masks exist for the most commontype of coronagraph, the lyot coronagraph, it is not yet clear what level ofwavefront correction must be reached in order to gain, either in starlightsuppression or observing efficiency, by implementing a more sophisticateddesign. in this paper, we model image plane lyot-style coronagraphs and testtheir response to a range of wavefront correction levels, in order to identifyregimes of atmospheric compensation where the use of hard-edge, gaussian, andband-limited image masks becomes observationally advantageous. to delineateperformances, we calculate the speckle noise floor mean intensity. we find thatapodized masks provide little improvement over hard-edge masks until on-skystrehl ratios exceed $\sim0.88 \: s_{qs}$, where $s_{qs}$ is the intrinsicstrehl ratio provided by the optical system. above this value, 4th-orderband-limited masks out-perform gaussian masks by generating comparable contrastwith higher lyot stop throughput. below this level of correction, hard-edgemasks may be preferentially chosen, since they are less susceptible tolow-order aberration content. the use of higher-order band-limited masks isrelegated to situations where quasi-static residual starlight cannot besufficiently removed from the search area with speckle-nulling hardware.

astro-ph;0703344	simulations for multi-object spectrograph planet surveys	radial velocity surveys for extra-solar planets generally require substantialamounts of large telescope time in order to monitor a sufficient number ofstars. two of the aspects which can limit such surveys are the single-objectcapabilities of the spectrograph, and an inefficient observing strategy for agiven observing window. in addition, the detection rate of extra-solar planetsusing the radial velocity method has thus far been relatively linear with time.with the development of various multi-object doppler survey instruments, thereis growing potential to dramatically increase the detection rate using thedoppler method. several of these instruments have already begun usage in largescale surveys for extra-solar planets, such as flames on the vlt and keck et onthe sloan 2.5m wide-field telescope.  in order to plan an effective observing strategy for such a program, one mustexamine the expected results based on a given observing window and targetselection. we present simulations of the expected results from a genericmulti-object survey based on calculated noise models and sensitivity for theinstrument and the known distribution of exoplanetary system parameters. wehave developed code for automatically sifting and fitting the planet candidatesproduced by the survey to allow for fast follow-up observations to beconducted. the techniques presented here may be applied to a wide range ofmulti-object planet surveys.

astro-ph;9504061	a simulation of ly-alpha absorption forests in linear approximation in  cold and cold+hot dark matter models	our goal in this paper is to test some popular dark matter models by ly-alphaforest in qso spectra. recent observations of the size and velocity of ly-alphaforest clouds have indicated that the ly-alpha absorption is probably not givenby collapsed objects, but pre-collapsed regions in the baryonic density field.therefore, a linear approximation description would be able to provide valuableinformation. we developed a technique to simulate ly-alpha forest as theabsorption of such pre-collapsed regions under linear approximation regime. thesimulated ly-alpha forests in models of the standard cold dark matter (scdm),the cold plus hot dark matter (chdm), and the low-density flat cold dark matter(lcdm) have been confronted with observational features, including 1) thenumber density of ly-alpha lines and its dependencies on redshift andequivalent width; 2) the distribution of equivalent widths and its redshiftdependence; 3) clustering; and 4) the gunn-peterson effect. the "standard" chdmmodel, i.e. 60% cold and 30% hot dark matters and 10\% baryons, is found to bedifficult to pass the ly-alpha forest test, probably because it producesstructures too late and favors to form structures on large scales instead ofsmall scale objects like ly-alpha clouds. within a reasonable range of j_nu,the uv background radiation at high redshift, and delta_th, the threshold ofthe onset of gravitational collapse of the baryonic matter, the lcdm model isconsistent with observational data in all above-mentioned four aspects. themodel of scdm can also fit with observation, but it requires a smaller j_nu anda higher delta_th. this suggests that whether a significant part of thely-alpha forest lines is located in the halos of collapsed objects would becrucial to the success of scdm.

astro-ph;9708103	adaptive optics spectroscopy: preliminary theoretical results	we have done theoretical calculations and simulations for infraredspectroscopy at the mmt 6.5 m with laser guide star ao, which provides almostfull sky coverage. the results show we can expect 40-60% of the photons from aunresolved source within 0.2 arcsec diameter circle for j, h, k, l and m bandsunder typical atmospheric seeing condition at 2.2 micron. therefore, thespectrograph entrance slit size should match the 0.2 arcsec image to obtainhigh throughput. higher resolution can be achieved by narrowing down the slitsize to match the diffraction-limited image core size of about 0.1 arcsec inthe infrared. however, the throughput will be correspondingly reduced by afactor of two. due to the limited atmospheric isoplanatic angle in the j, h andk bands, the encircled photon percentage within 0.2 arcsec diameter drops from40-60% when the object is at the laser pointing direction to 20-40% when theobject is about 30 arcsec away from the laser direction. therefore, the usefulfield of view for ao multiple object spectroscopy is about 60 arcsec. furtherstudies of ir background (sky and thermal) and ir detector performance showthat spectral resolution of r = 2,000 can take full advantage of ao imageswithout much penalty due to the dark current of the ir detector and ir oh skyemission lines.  we have also studied natural guide star ao spectroscopy. more details are inthe paper.
