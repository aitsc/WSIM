0901.4364	spectroscopic observations of lyman-break galaxies at redshift ~ 4, 5  and 6 in the goods-south field	we report on observations of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey at mean redshift z~4, 5 and 6, obtainedwith fors2 spectrograph at the eso-vlt.this program has yielded spectroscopicidentifications for 114 galaxies of which 51 are at z~4, 31 at z~5, and 32 atz~6. the adopted selection criteria are effective, identifying galaxies at theexpected redshift with minimal foreground contamination. once selection effectsare properly accounted for, the rest-frame uv spectra of the higher-redshiftlbgs appear to be similar to their counterparts at z~3. as at z~3, lbgs at z~4and z~5 show lya both in emission and in absorption; when in absorption, stronginterstellar lines and red uv spectra are observed, a fact also measured at z~2and 3. at z~6, sensitivity issues bias our sample towards galaxies with lya inemission; nevertheless, these spectra appear to be similar to theirlower-redshift counterparts. as in other studies at similar redshifts, we findclear evidence that brighter lbgs tend to have weaker lya emission lines. atfixed rest-frame uv luminosity, the equivalent width of the lya emission lineis larger at higher redshifts. at all redshifts where the measurements can bereliably made, the redshift of the lya emission line turns out to be largerthan that of the interstellar absorption lines,with a median velocitydifference deltav~400 km/s at z~4 and 5, consistent with results at lowerredshifts. this shows that powerful, large-scale winds are common at highredshift.in general,there is no strong correlation between the morphology ofthe uv light and the spectroscopic properties. however, galaxies with deepinterstellar absorption lines and strong lya absorption appear to be morediffuse than galaxies with lya in emission.(abridged)

0901.4627	photometric properties of ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 in the cosmos 2  square degree field	we present results of a survey for ly alpha emitters at z=4.86 based onoptical narrowband (lambda_c=7126 angstrom, delta lambda=73 angstrom) andbroadband (b, v, r', i', and z') observations of the cosmic evolution survey(cosmos) field using suprime-cam on the subaru telescope. we find 79 laecandidates at z=4.86 over a contiguous survey area of 1.83 deg^2, down to thely alpha line flux of 1.47 x 10^-17 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. we obtain the ly alphaluminosity function with a best-fit schechter parameters of logl^*=42.9^+0.5_-0.3 ergs s^-1 and phi^* = 1.2^+8.0_-1.1 x 10^-4 mpc^-3 foralpha=-1.5 (fixed). the two-point correlation function for our lae sample isxi(r) = (r/4.4^+5.7_-2.9 mpc)^-1.90+/-0.22. in order to investigate thefield-to-field variations of the properties of ly alpha emitters, we divide thesurvey area into nine tiles of 0.5^circ x 0.5^circ each. we find that thenumber density varies with a factor of ~ 2 from field to field with highstatistical significance. however, we find no significant field-to-fieldvariance when we divide the field into four tiles with 0.7^circ x 0.7^circeach. we conclude that at least 0.5 deg^2 survey area is required to deriveaveraged properties of laes at z~5, and our survey field is wide enough toovercome the cosmic variance.

0906.1873	hst/acs morphology of lyman alpha emitters at redshift 5.7 in the cosmos  field	we present detailed morphological properties of lyman alpha emitters (laes)at z~ 5.7 in the cosmos field, based on {\it hubble space telescope} advancedcamera for surveys (acs) data. the acs imaging in the f814w filter covered 85laes of the 119 laes identified in the full two square degree field, and 47laes of them are detected in the acs images. nearly half of them are spatiallyextended with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec (~0.88 kpc at z=5.7) up to 0.4arcsec (~2.5 kpc at z=5.7). the others are nearly unresolved compact objects.two laes show double-component structures, indicating interaction or merging ofbuilding components to form more massive galaxies. by stacking the acs imagesof all the detected sources, we obtain a sersic parameter of n~0.7 with ahalf-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (0.76 kpc), suggesting that the majority ofacs detected laes have not spheroidal-like but disk-like or irregular lightprofiles. comparing acs f814w magnitudes (i_814) with subaru/suprime-cammagnitudes in the nb816, i', and z' bands, we find that the acs imaging in thef814w band mainly probes uv continuum rather than lyman alpha line emission. uvcontinuum sizes tend to be larger for laes with larger ly\alpha emissionregions as traced by the nb816 imaging. the non-detection of 38 laes in the acsimages is likely due to the fact that their surface brightness is even too lowboth in the uv continuum and lyalpha emission. estimating i_814 for the laeswith acs non-detection from the z' and nb816 magnitudes, we find that 16 ofthese are probably laes with a size larger than 0.15 arcsec in uv continuum.all these results suggest that our lae sample contains systematically largerlaes in uv continuum size than those previously studied at z~6.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

0909.4074	uv continuum slope and dust obscuration from z~6 to z~2: the star  formation rate density at high redshift	we provide a systematic measurement of the rest-frame uv continuum slope betaover a wide range in redshift (z~2-6) and rest-frame uv luminosity (0.1-2l*) toimprove estimates of the sfr density at high redshift. we utilize the deepoptical and infrared data (acs/nicmos) over the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields,as well as the udf for our primary ubvi "dropout" sample. we correct theobserved distributions for selection biases and photometric scatter. we findthat the uv-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantiallyredder at z~2-4 than it is at z~5-6. lower luminosity galaxies are also foundto be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z~2.5 and z~4. we do not find alarge number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections atz~4, and particularly at z&gt;~5, even though such sources could be readilyselected from our data. this suggests that star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~5 almostuniversally have very blue uv-continuum slopes, and that there are not likelyto be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z&gt;~5 that are missed in"dropout" searches. using the same relation between uv-continuum slope and dustextinction as found to be appropriate at z~0 and z~2, we estimate the averagedust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and uv luminosity in aconsistent way. we find that the estimated dust extinction increasessubstantially with cosmic time for the most uv luminous galaxies, but remainssmall (&lt;~2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. because these samelower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the uv, theoverall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts. we includethe contribution from ulirgs in our sfr density estimates at z~2-6, but findthat they contribute only ~20% of the total at z~2.5 and &lt;~10% at z&gt;~4.

0910.0444	spectroscopy of luminous z&gt;7 galaxy candidates and sources of  contamination in z&gt;7 galaxy searches	we present three bright z+ dropout candidates selected from deepnear-infrared (nir) imaging of the cosmos 2 square degree field. all threeobjects match the 0.8-8um colors of other published z&gt;7 candidates but arethree magnitudes brighter, facilitating further study. deep spectroscopy of twoof the candidates covering 0.64-1.02um with keck-deimos and all three covering0.94-1.10um and 1.52-1.80um with keck-nirspec detects weak spectral featurestentatively identified as ly-alpha at z=6.95 and z=7.69 in two of the objects.the third object is placed at z~1.6 based on a 24um and weak optical detection.a comparison with the spectral energy distributions of known z&lt;7 galaxies,including objects with strong spectral lines, large extinction, and largesystematic uncertainties in the photometry yields no objects with similarcolors. however, the lambda&gt;1um properties of all three objects can be matchedto optically detected sources with photometric redshifts at z~1.8, so thenon-detection in the i+ and z+ bands are the primary factors which favors a z&gt;7solution. if any of these objects are at z~7 the bright end of the luminosityfunction is significantly higher at z&gt;7 than suggested by previous studies, butconsistent within the statistical uncertainty and the dark matter halodistribution. if these objects are at low redshift, the lyman-break selectionmust be contaminated by a previously unknown population of low redshift objectswith very strong breaks in their broad band spectral energy distributions andblue nir colors. the implications of this result on luminosity functionevolution at high redshift is discussed. we show that the primary limitation ofz&gt;7 galaxy searches with broad filters is the depth of the available opticaldata.

0911.1158	the morphology of passively evolving galaxies at z ~ 2 from hst/wfc3  deep imaging in the hubble ultradeep field	we present near-ir images, obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst) andthe wfc3/ir camera, of six passive and massive galaxies at redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4(ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}; stellar mass m~10^{11} m_{sun}), selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey (goods). these images, which have aspatial resolution of ~1.5 kpc, provide the deepest view of the opticalrest-frame morphology of such systems to date. we find that the light profileof these galaxies is regular and well described by a sersic model with indextypical of today's spheroids. their size, however, is generally much smallerthan today's early types of similar stellar mass, with four out of six galaxieshaving r_e ~ 1 kpc or less, in quantitative agreement with previous similarmeasures made at rest-frame uv wavelengths. the images reach limiting surfacebrightness mu~26.5 mag arcsec^{-2} in the f160w bandpass; yet, there is noevidence of a faint halo in the galaxies of our sample, even in their stackedimage. we also find that these galaxies have very weak "morphologicalk-correction" between the rest-frame uv (from the acs z-band), and therest--frame optical (wfc3 h-band): the sersic index, physical size and overallmorphology are independent or only mildly dependent on the wavelength, withinthe errors.

0912.3007	the unusual niv]-emitter galaxy gds j033218.92-275302.7: star formation  or agn-driven winds from a massive galaxy at z=5.56	aims: we investigate the nature of the source gds j033218.92-275302.7atredshift ~ 5.56. methods: the sed of the source is well sampled by 16 bandsphotometry, from uv-optical, near infrared and mid-infrared (mid-ir).thedetection of signal in the mid-ir spitzer/irac bands 5.8, 8.0 um -- where thenebular emission contribution is less effective -- suggests the presence of abalmer break, signature of an underlying stellar population formed at earlierepochs. the optical spectrum shows a clear lya emission line together withsemi-forbidden niv] 1483.3-1486.5 also in emission. results: from the sedfitting and the lya modelling it turns out that the source seems to have anevolved component with stellar mass of ~5 x10^(10) msolar and age ~ 0.4 gyrs,and a young component with an age of ~ 0.01 gyrs and sfr in the range of 30-200msolar yr^(-1). the limits on the effective radius derived from the acs/z850and vlt/ks bands indicate that this galaxy is denser than the local ones withsimilar mass. a relatively high nebular gas column density is favored from thelya line modelling (nhi&gt;=10^(21) cm^(-2)). a vigorous outflow (~ 450 km/s) hasbeen measured from the optical spectrum,consistent with the lya modelling. fromacs observations it turns out that the region emitting lya photons is spatiallycompact and of the same order of the effective radius estimated at the ~1400arest-frame wavelength, whose emission is dominated by the stellar continuumand/or agn. the gas is blown out from the central region,but given the mass ofthe galaxy it is uncertain whether it will pollute the igm to large distances.we argue that a burst of star formation in a dense gas environment is active(possibly containing hot and massive stars and/or a low luminosity agn),superimposed to an already formed fraction of stellar mass (abridged).

1004.2120	a z=1.82 analog of local ultra-massive elliptical galaxies	we present observations of a very massive galaxy at z=1.82 which show thatits morphology, size, velocity dispersion and stellar population propertiesthat are fully consistent with those expected for passively evolvingprogenitors of today's giant ellipticals. these findings are based on a deepoptical rest-frame spectrum obtained with the multi-object infrared camera andspectrograph (moircs) on the subaru telescope of a high-z passive galaxycandidate (pbzk) from the cosmos field, for which we accurately measure itsredshift of z=1.8230 and obtain an upper limit on its velocity dispersionsigma_star&lt;326 km/s. by detailed stellar population modeling of both the galaxybroad-band sed and the rest-frame optical spectrum we derive astar-formation-weighted age and formation redshift of t_sf~1-2 gyr andz_form~2.5-4, and a stellar mass of m_star~(3-4)x10^{11} m_sun. this is inagreement with a virial mass limit of m_vir&lt;7x10^{11}m_sun, derived from themeasured sigma_star value and stellar half-light radius, as well as with thedynamical mass limit based on the jeans equations. in contrast with previouslyreported super-dense passive galaxies at z~2, the present galaxy at z=1.82appears to have both size and velocity dispersion similar to early-typegalaxies in the local universe with similar stellar mass. this suggests thatz~2 massive and passive galaxies may exhibit a wide range of properties, thenpossibly following quite different evolutionary histories from z~2 to z=0.

0708.2796	the spatial clustering of mid-ir selected star forming galaxies at z ~ 1  in the goods fields	we present the first spatial clustering measurements of z~1, 24um-selected,star forming galaxies in the great observatories origins deep survey (goods).the sample under investigation includes 495 objects in goods-south and 811objects in goods-north selected down to flux densities of f_24&gt;20 ujy andz_ab&lt;23.5 mag, for which spectroscopic redshifts are available. the medianredshift, ir luminosity and star formation rate (sfr) of the samples are z~0.8,l_ir~4.4 x 10^10 l_sun, and sfr~7.6 m_sun/yr, respectively. we measure theprojected correlation function w(r_p) on scales of r_p=0.06-10 h^-1 mpc, fromwhich we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 4.0 +- 0.4 h^-1mpc and slope of gamma=1.5 +- 0.1 for the whole f_24&gt;20ujy sample aftercombining the two fields. we find indications of a larger correlation lengthfor objects of higher luminosity, with luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,l_ir&gt;10^11 l_sun) reaching r_0~5.1 h^-1 mpc. this would imply that galaxieswith larger sfrs are hosted in progressively more massive halos, reachingminimum halo masses of ~3 x 10^12 m_sun for lirgs. we compare our measurementswith the predictions from semi-analytic models based on the millenniumsimulation. the variance in the models is used to estimate the errors in ourgoods clustering measurements, which are dominated by cosmic variance. themeasurements from the two goods fields are found to be consistent within theerrors. on scales of the goods fields, the real sources appear more stronglyclustered than objects in the millennium-simulation based catalogs, if theselection function is applied consistently. this suggests that star formationat z~0.5-1 is being hosted in more massive halos and denser environments thancurrently predicted by galaxy formation models.[truncated]

1009.1140	the great observatories origins deep survey: constraints on the lyman  continuum escape fraction distribution of lyman--break galaxies at 3.4&lt;z&lt;4.5	we use ultra-deep ultraviolet vlt/vimos intermediate-band and vlt/fors1narrow-band imaging in the goods southern field to derive limits on thedistribution of the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing radiation for l &gt;~l*(z=3) lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at redshift 3.4--4.5. only one lbg, atredshift z=3.795, is detected in its lyman continuum (lyc; s/n~5.5), thehighest redshift galaxy currently known with a direct detection. itsultraviolet morphology is quite compact (r_eff=0.8, kpc physical). three out ofseven agn are also detected in their lyc, including one at redshift z=3.951 andz850 = 26.1. from stacked data (lbgs) we set an upper limit to the averagef_esc in the range 5%--20%, depending on the how the data are selected (e.g.,by magnitude and/or redshift). we undertake extensive monte carlo simulationsthat take into account intergalactic attenuation, stellar population synthesismodels, dust extinction and photometric noise in order to explore the momentsof the distribution of the escaping radiation. various distributions(exponential, log-normal and gaussian) are explored. we find that the medianf_esc is lower than ~6% with an 84% percentile limit not larger than 20%. ifthis result remains valid for fainter lbgs down to current observationallimits, then the lbg population might be not sufficient to account for theentire photoionization budget at the redshifts considered here, with the exactdetails dependent upon the assumed ionizing background and qso contributionthereto. it is possible that f_esc depends on the uv luminosity of thegalaxies, with fainter galaxies having higher f_esc, and estimates of f_escfrom a sample of faint lbg from the hudf (i775&lt;28.5) are in broad quantitativeagreement with such a scenario.

1011.5500	spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies at redshift  beyond 7	we report the spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies atredshift &gt; 7. the galaxies were observed as part of an ultra-deep spectroscopiccampaign with fors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 ``z--banddropout'' candidates selected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey. both galaxiesshow a prominent emission line at 9735a and 9858a respectively: the lines havefluxes of ~ 1.6-1.2 x 10^(-17) erg/s/cm2 and exhibit a sharp decline on theblue side and a tail on the red side. the asymmetry is quantitativelycomparable to the observed asymmetry in z ~ 6 ly-alpha lines, where absorptionby neutral hydrogen in the igm truncates the blue side of the emission lineprofile. we carefully evaluate the possibility that the galaxies are instead atlower redshift and we are observing either [oii], [oiii] or h-alpha emission:however from the spectroscopic and the photometric data we conclude that thereare no other plausible identifications, except for ly-alpha at redshift &gt;7,implying that these are two of the most robust redshift determination forgalaxies in the reionization epoch. based on their redshifts and broad--bandphotometry, we derive limits on the star formation rate and on the ultravioletspectral slopes of the two galaxies. we argue that these two galaxies alone areunlikely to have ionized the igm in their surroundings.

1011.6569	a critical analysis of the uv luminosity function at redshift~7 from  deep wfc3 data	the study of the luminosity function (lf) of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz=7 is important for ascertaining their role in the reionization of theuniverse. we perform a detailed and critical analysis of the statistical andsystematic errors in the z~7 lf determination: we have assembled a large sampleof candidate lbgs at z~7 from different surveys, spanning a large variety ofareas and depths. in particular, we have combined data from the deep (j&lt;27.4)and ultradeep (j&lt;29.2) surveys recently acquired with the new wfc3 nir cameraon hst, over the goods-ers and the hudf fields, with ground based surveys inwide and shallow areas from vlt and subaru. we have used public acs images inthe z-band to select z-dropout galaxies, and other public data both in the blue(bvi) and in the red bands to reject possible low-redshift interlopers. we havecompared our results with extensive simulations to quantify the observationaleffects of our selection criteria as well as the effects of photometricscatter, color selections or the morphology of the candidates. we have foundthat the number density of faint lbgs at z~7 is only marginally sensitive tothe color selection adopted, but it is strongly dependent from the assumptionmade on the half light distributions of the simulated galaxies, used to correctthe observed sample for incompleteness. the slope of the faint end of the lbgslf has thus a rather large uncertainty, due to the unknown distribution ofphysical sizes of the z~7 lbgs. we conclude that galaxies at z~7 are unable toreionize the universe unless there is a significant evolution in the clumpinessof the igm or in the escape fraction of ionising photons or, alternatively,there is a large population of z~7 lbgs with large physical dimensions butstill not detected by the present observations.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1106.4308	the relative abundance of compact and normal massive early-type galaxies  and its evolution from redshift z~2 to the present	we report on the evolution of the number density and size of early-typegalaxies from z~2 to z~0. we select a sample of 563 massive (m&gt;10^{10} msun),passively evolving (ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}) and morphologically spheroidalgalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, using the panchromatic photometry and spectroscopicredshifts available in the goods fields. we combine acs and wfc3 hst images tostudy the morphology of our galaxies in their optical rest-frame in the whole0&lt;z&lt;2.5 range. we find that throughout the explored redshift range the passivegalaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological k-correction, withsize being slightly smaller in the optical than in the uv rest-frame (by ~20and ~10 at z&gt;1.2 and z&lt;1.2, respectively). we measure a significant evolutionof the mass-size relation of early-type galaxies, with the fractional incrementthat is almost independent on the stellar mass. early-type galaxies (etgs)formed at z&gt;1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of themass-size relation at z&lt;1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of thecompact galaxies and the appearance of new etgs with large sizes. we also findthat the number density of all passive early-type galaxies increases rapidly,by a factor of 5, from z~2 to z~1, and then more mildly by another factor of1.5 from z~1 to z~0. we interpret these results as the evidence that the bulkof the etgs are formed at 1&lt;z&lt;3 through a mechanism that leaves very compactremnants. at z&lt;1 the compact etgs grow gradually in size, becoming normal sizegalaxies, and at the same time new etgs with normal-large sizes are formed.

1107.1376	spectroscopic confirmation of z~7 lbgs: probing the earliest galaxies  and the epoch of reionization	we present the final results from our ultra-deep spectroscopic campaign withfors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 "z--band dropout" candidatesselected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey over three independent fields. inparticular we report on two newly discovered galaxies at redshift ~6.7 in thentt deep field: both galaxies show a ly-alpha emission line with rest-frame ewsof the order 15-20 a and luminosities of 2-4 x 10^{42} erg/s. we also presentthe results of ultra-deep observations of a sample of i-dropout galaxies, fromwhich we set a solid upper limit on the fraction of interlopers. out of the 20z-dropouts observed we confirm 5 galaxies at 6.7 &lt; z &lt; 7.1. this issystematically below the expectations drawn on the basis of lower redshiftobservations: in particular there is a significant lack of objects withintermediate ly-alpha ews (between 20 and 55 a). we conclude that the trend forthe fraction of ly-alpha emission in lbgs that is constantly increasing fromz~3 to z~6 is most probably reversed from z~6 to z~7.  explaining the observed rapid change in the lae fraction among the drop-outpopulation with reionization requires a fast evolution of the neutral fractionof hydrogen in the universe. assuming that the universe is completely ionizedat z=6 and adopting the semi-analytical models of dijkstra et al. (2011), wefind that our data require a change of the neutral hydrogen fraction of theorder delta chi_{hi} ~ 0.6 in a time delta z ~ 1, provided that the escapefraction does not increase dramatically over the same redshift interval.

1107.2653	goods-herschel measurements of the dust attenuation of typical  star-forming galaxies at high redshift: observations of uv-selected galaxies  at z~2	we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of herschel at 100 and160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate theinfrared luminosities, l(ir), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (l*)galaxies at high redshift. our sample consists of 146 uv-selected galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 in the goods-north field. supplemented withdeep very large array (vla) and spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks atthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 ghz. thecomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates andcalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with uv luminositiesl(uv)&gt;1e10 lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with a medianl(ir)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 lsun. typical galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 have a median dustobscuration l(ir)/l(uv) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correctionfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (sfr) from theunobscured uv sfr, of 5.2+/-0.6. this result is similar to that inferred fromprevious investigations of the uv, h-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and x-rayproperties of the same galaxies studied here. stacking in bins of uv slopeimplies that l* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and thatthe correlation between uv slope and dustiness is similar to that found forlocal starburst galaxies. hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxesvalidate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover thedust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. in thesimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift uvattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar anddust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

1206.1540	deep near-infrared spectroscopy of passively evolving galaxies at z&gt;1.4	[abridged] we present the results of new near-ir spectroscopic observationsof passive galaxies at z&gt;1.4 in a concentration of bzk-selected galaxies in thecosmos field. the observations have been conducted with subaru/moircs, and haveresulted in absorption lines and/or continuum detection for 18 out of 34objects. this allows us to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a sample almostcomplete to k(ab)=21. cosmos photometric redshifts are found in fair agreementoverall with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a standard deviation of ~0.05;however, ~30% of objects have photometric redshifts systematicallyunderestimated by up to ~25%. we show that these systematic offsets inphotometric redshifts can be removed by using these objects as a training set.all galaxies fall in four distinct redshift spikes at z=1.43, 1.53, 1.67 and1.82, with this latter one including 7 galaxies. sed fits to broad-band fluxesindicate stellar masses in the range of ~4-40x10^10msun and that star formationwas quenched ~1 gyr before the cosmic epoch at which they are observed. thespectra of several individual galaxies have allowed us to measure theirhdelta_f and dn4000 indices, which confirms their identification as passivegalaxies, as does a composite spectrum resulting from the coaddition of 17individual spectra. the effective radii of the galaxies have been measured onthe hst/acs f814w image, confirming the coexistence at these redshifts ofpassive galaxies which are substantially more compact than their localcounterparts with others that follow the local size-stellar mass relation. forthe galaxy with best s/n spectrum we were able to measure a velocity dispersionof 270+/-105 km/s, indicating that this galaxy lies closely on the virialrelation given its stellar mass and effective radius.

1208.0506	the size-luminosity relation at z=7 in candels and its implication on  reionization	the exploration of the relation between galaxy sizes and other physicalparameters has provided important clues for understanding galaxy formation. weuse the candels deep+wide surveys in the goods-south, uds and egs fields,complemented by data from the hudf09 program, to address the relation betweensize and luminosity at z\sim7. we select 153 z-band drop-out galaxies in sixdifferent fields characterized by a wide combination of depth and arealcoverage, ideally suited to sample without biases the observed size-magnitudeplane. detailed simulations allow us to derive the completeness as a functionof size and magnitude and to quantify measurements errors/biases. we find thatthe half light radius distribution function of z\sim7 galaxies fainter thanj=26.6 is peaked at &lt;0.1 arcsec (or equivalently 0.5 kpc proper), while atbrighter magnitudes high-z galaxies are typically larger than ~0.15 arcsec. wealso find a well defined size-luminosity relation, rh\siml^1/2. we compute theluminosity function in the hudf and p12hudf fields, finding large spatialvariation on the number density of faint galaxies. adopting the sizedistribution and the size-luminosity relation found for faint galaxies at z=7,we derive a mean slope of -1.7\pm0.1 for the luminosity function of lbgs atthis redshift. using this lf, we find that the amount of ionizing photonscannot keep the universe re-ionized if the igm is clumpy (c_hii&gt;3) and thelyman continuum escape fraction of high-z lbgs is relatively low (f_esc&lt;0.3).with future candels data, we can put severe limits to the role of galaxies inthe reionization of the universe.

1303.2689	constraining the assembly of normal and compact passively evolving  galaxies from redshift z=3 to the present with candels	we study the evolution of the number density, as a function of the size, ofpassive early-type galaxies with a wide range of stellar masses10^10&lt;m*/msun&lt;10^11.5) from z~3 to z~1, exploiting the unique dataset availablein the goods-south field, including the recently obtained wfc3 images as a partof the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey(candels). in particular, we select a sample of 107 massive (m*&gt;10^10 m_sun),passive (ssfr&lt;10^-2 gyr^-1) and morphologically spheroidal galaxies at 1.2&lt;z&lt;3,taking advantage of the panchromatic dataset available for goods, includingvlt, cfht, spitzer, chandra and hst acs+wfc3 data. we find that at 1&lt;z&lt;3 thepassively evolving early-type galaxies are the reddest and most massive objectsin the universe, and we prove that a correlation between mass, morphology,color and star-formation activity is already in place at that epoch. we measurea significant evolution in the mass-size relation of passive early-typegalaxies (etgs) from z~3 to z~1, with galaxies growing on average by a factorof 2 in size in a 3 gyr timescale only. we witness also an increase in thenumber density of passive etgs of 50 times over the same time interval. we findthat the first etgs to form at z&gt;2 are all compact or ultra-compact, whilenormal sized etgs (meaning etgs with sizes comparable to those of localcounterparts of the same mass) are the most common etgs only at z&lt;1. theincrease of the average size of etgs at 0&lt;z&lt;1 is primarily driven by theappearance of new large etgs rather than by the size increase of individualgalaxies.

1303.4400	the role of major mergers in shaping galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;4 in the vuds and  vvds surveys	the mass assembly of galaxies can proceed through different physicalprocesses. here we report on the spectroscopic identification of close physicalpairs of galaxies at redshifts 2 &lt;z &lt; 4 and discuss the impact of major mergersin shaping galaxies at these early cosmological times. we aim to identify andcharacterize close physical pairs of galaxies destined to merge and use theirproperties to infer the contribution of merging processes to the early massassembly of galaxies. we search for galaxy pairs with a transverse separationr_p &lt; 25 h^{-1} kpc and a velocity difference delta v &lt; 500 km s^{-1} using thevimos vlt deep survey (vvds) and early data from the vimos ultra deep survey(vuds) that comprise a sample of 1111 galaxies with spectroscopic redshiftsmeasurements at redshifts 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 4 in the cosmos, ecdfs, and vvds-02hfields. we analyse their spectra and associated visible and near-infraredphotometry to assess the main properties of merging galaxies that have anaverage stellar mass m_{star}=2.3 x 10^{10} m_{sun} at these redshifts. usingthe 12 physical pairs found in our sample we obtain a first estimate of themerger fraction at these rdshifts, fmerg ~(15-20)%. the pair separationsindicate that these pairs will merge within 1 gyr, on average, with eachproducing a more massive galaxy by the time the cosmic star formation peaks atz~1-2. from the average mass ratio between galaxies in the pairs, the stellarmass of the resulting galaxy after merging will be ~60% larger than the mostmassive galaxy in the pair before merging. we conclude that major merging ofgalaxy pairs is on-going at 2&lt;z&lt;4 and significantly contributing to the majorassembly phase of galaxies at this early epoch.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

1403.4230	vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds): witnessing the assembly of a massive  cluster at z~3.3	using new spectroscopic observations obtained as part of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds), we perform a systematic search for overdense environments in theearly universe ($z&gt;2$) and report here on the discovery of cl j0227-0421, amassive protocluster at $z=3.29$. this protocluster is characterized by boththe large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometricredshift members. the halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a varietyof methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{m}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that ofthe coma cluster. the properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed membergalaxies are compared with a large sample of vuds/vvds galaxies in lowerdensity field environments at similar redshifts. we find tentative evidence foran excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines ofthe protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we maybe observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. the propertiesof these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightestprotocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear andstarburst activity. the remaining member galaxies appear to havecharacteristics which are largely similar to the field population. though wefind weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation ratesamongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect tothe field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with theensemble of protostructures that are found in the full vuds sample.

1403.5466	new observations of z~7 galaxies: evidence for a patchy reionization	we present new results from our search for z~7 galaxies from deepspectroscopic observations of candidate z-dropouts in the candels fields.despite the extremely low flux limits achieved by our sensitive observations,only 2 galaxies have robust redshift identifications, one from its lyalphaemission line at z=6.65, the other from its lyman-break, i.e. the continuumdiscontinuity at the lyalpha wavelength consistent with a redshift 6.42, butwith no emission line. in addition, for 23 galaxies we present deep limits inthe lyalpha ew derived from the non detections in ultra-deep observations.using this new data as well as previous samples, we assemble a total of 68candidate z~7 galaxies with deep spectroscopic observations, of which 12 have aline detection. with this much enlarged sample we can place solid constraintson the declining fraction of ly$\alpha$ emission in z~7 lyman break galaxiescompared to z~6, both for bright and faint galaxies. applying a simpleanalytical model, we show that the present data favor a patchy reionizationprocess rather than a smooth one.

1407.3787	a 52 hours vlt/fors2 spectrum of a bright z~7 hudf galaxy: no ly-alpha  emission	we aim to determine the redshift of gds-1408, the most solid z~7 galaxycandidate lying in the hubble ultra deep field. we have used all the vltspectra of gds-1408 collected by us and two other groups with fors2 at vlt inthe last five years, for a total integration time of 52hr. the combinedspectrum is the deepest ever obtained of a galaxy in the reionization epoch. wedo not detect any emission line or continuum over the whole wavelength range,up to 10100a. based on an accurate set of simulations, we are able to put astringent upper limit of f(lya)&lt;3x10^(-18) erg/s/cm2 at 3-9 sigma in theexplored wavelength range, corresponding to a rest-frame equivalent widthew&lt;9a. combining this limit with the sed modelling we refine the redshift to bez=6.82+/- 0.1 (1-sigma). the same sed fitting indicates that gds-1408 isrelatively extinct (a1600~1) with a dust corrected star formation rate of ~ 20msol/yr. the comparison between the un-attenuated equivalent width predicted bythe case-b recombination theory and the observed upper limit, provides a limiton the effective lya escape fraction of f_(esc)^(eff)(lya)&lt;8%. even though wecannot rule out a major contribution of the inter/circum galactic medium indamping the line, a plausible interpretation is that gds-1408 is moderatelyevolved and contains sufficient gas and dust to attenuate the lya emission,before it reaches the intergalactic medium. the redshift confirmation of eventhe best z~7 candidates is very hard to achieve (unless the lya or unusuallystrong rest-uv nebular emission lines are present) with the current generationof 8-10m class telescopes. we show that both jwst and e-elt will be necessaryto make decisive progresses. currently, the increased redshift accuracyobtained with this kind of analysis makes alma an interesting option for theredshift confirmation.

1407.4233	geometry of star-forming galaxies from sdss, 3d-hst and candels	we determine the intrinsic, 3-dimensional shape distribution of star-forminggalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. inthe present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 msolare predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. wenow extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (m* &gt;1e10 msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z &lt; 2. lower-massgalaxies at z&gt;1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction ofelongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lowermasses. galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 msol (1e10 msol) are a mix of roughlyequal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z~1 (z~2). this suggests thatgalaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over manyorbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar masscomparable to that of the milky way typically first formed such sustainedstellar disks at redshift z~1.5-2. combined with constraints on the evolutionof the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation overgalaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmictime, the majority of stars formed in disks.

1409.7083	a mass threshold in the number density of passive galaxies at z$\sim$2	the process that quenched star formation in galaxies at intermediate and highredshift is still the subject of considerable debate. one way to investigatethis puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies atz~2, and its dependence on mass. here we present the results of a new studybased on very deep ks-band imaging (with the hawk-i instrument on the vlt) oftwo hst candels fields (the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) field andgoods-south). the new hawk-i data (taken as part of the hugs vlt large program)reach detection limits of ks&gt;26 (ab mag). we select a sample ofpassively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5. thanks to thedepth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend theselection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.through extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that theobserved turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at k&gt;22 is real. thishas enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescentgalaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter thanks~22(ab mag.). we show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold$m_*10^{10.8}\,{\rm m_{\odot}}$ below which the mechanism that halts the starformation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. finally we comparethe observed pbzk number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted fromfour different semi-analytic models. we find that none of the models provides astatistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescentgalaxies at these redshifts. we conclude that the mass function of quiescentgalaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demandingchallenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

1502.04708	peering through the holes: the far uv color of star-forming galaxies at  z~3-4 and the escaping fraction of ionizing radiation	we aim to investigate the effect of the escaping ionizing radiation on thecolor selection of high redshift galaxies and identify candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters. the intergalactic medium prescription of inoue etal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of bruzual&amp;charlot (2003) have been usedto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of theintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. colortracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizingradiation. at variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of igmtransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-bandcolor selection. the decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons withincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the lyc tobroad-band colors. we also demonstrate that prominent lyc sources can beselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a nullescaping ionizing radiation. the method is applied to a sample of galaxiesextracted from the goods-s field. a known lyc source at z=3.795 is successfullyrecovered as a lyc emitter candidate and another convincing candidate atz=3.212 is reported. a detailed analysis of the two sources (including theirvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar andnon-stellar (agn) contribution in the ultraviolet. conclusions: classicalbroad-band color selection of 2.5&lt;z&lt;4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusionof lyc emitters in the selected samples. large fesc in relatively brightgalaxies (l&gt;0.1l*) could be favored by the presence of a faint agn not easilydetected at any wavelength. a hybrid stellar and non-stellar (agn) ionizingemission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found amongthe uv excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported inliterature.

1503.00722	the role of bulge formation in the homogenization of stellar populations  at $z\sim2$ as revealed by internal color dispersion in candels	we use data from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations ofgalaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. we use theinternal color dispersion (icd), measured between the rest-frame uv and opticalbands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellarpopulations. the icd shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologiesof the galaxies. galaxies with the largest variation in their stellarpopulations as evidenced by high icd have disk-dominated morphologies (withs\'{e}rsic indexes $&lt; 2$) and stellar masses between $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot}&lt; 11$. there is a marked decrease in the icd as the stellar mass and/orthe s\'ersic index increases. by studying the relations between the icd andother galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, anddust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellarpopulations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-formingclumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. this phase reaches a peak forgalaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/ m_\odot}&lt; 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. in contrast,galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher s\'{e}rsic index ($n&gt; 2$) show reduced icd values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellarpopulations. this indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulgealong with a star forming disk, typical of hubble sequence galaxies, this ismost common for stellar masses $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot} &lt; 11$ and when thebulge component remains relatively small ($n&lt;2$).

1509.01101	the lyman continuum escape fraction of galaxies at z=3.3 in the  vuds-lbc/cosmos field	the lyman continuum (lyc) flux escaping from high-z galaxies into the igm isa fundamental quantity to understand the physical processes involved in thereionization epoch. we have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies atz~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of lyc photons escaping fromgalaxy halos. uv deep imaging in the cosmos field obtained with the prime focuscamera lbc at the lbt telescope was used together with a catalog ofspectroscopic redshifts obtained by the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds) to builda sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with l&gt;0.5l*. we obtained deep lbc images ofgalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.40 both in the rand deep u bands. a sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escapefractions&gt;28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, withthe exception of two marginal detections (s/n~2) in the u band, all the other 8galaxies are most likely contaminated by the uv flux of low-z interloperslocated close to the high-z targets. the average escape fraction derived fromthe stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel&lt;2%. the impliedhi photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the igmionized at z~3, as observed in the lyman forest of high-z qso spectra or by theproximity effect. these results support a scenario where high redshift,relatively bright (l&gt;0.5l*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustainthe level of ionization observed in the cosmic igm at z~3. star-forminggalaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (l&lt;&lt;l*) can be themajor contributors to the reionization of the universe only if their physicalproperties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10. alternatively,ionizing sources could be discovered looking for fainter sources among the agnpopulation at high-z.

0705.2831	multiwavelength study of massive galaxies at z~2. i. star formation and  galaxy growth	examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 with k_{vega}&lt;22 from thegreat observatories origins deep survey, we compare photometry from spitzer atmid- and far-ir, to submillimeter, radio and rest-frame ultravioletwavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formationrates (sfrs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. for z~2galaxies with moderate luminosities(l_{8um}&lt;10^{11}l_sun), we find that the sfrcan be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on localluminosity correlations. however,20--30% of massive galaxies, and nearly allthose with l_{8um}&gt;10^{11}l_sun, show a mid-ir excess which is likely due tothe presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. there isa tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and sfr for24um-detected galaxies. for a given mass, the sfr at z=2 was larger by a factorof ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star forming galaxies at z=1 and z=0,respectively. typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z=2 arerelatively 'transparent' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived(~400 myr), unlike that in local ulirgs and high redshiftsubmillimeter-selected galaxies. ulirgs are the common mode of star formationin massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergersare not the dominant trigger for this activity.current galaxy formation modelsunderpredict the normalization of the mass-sfr correlation by about a factor of4, and the space density of ulirgs by an orderof magnitude, but give betteragreement for z&gt;1.4 quiescent galaxies.

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0107324	the rest-frame optical properties of z~3 galaxies	we present the results of a near-infrared imaging survey of z~3 lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). the survey covers a total of 30 arcmin^2 and includes 118photometrically selected lbgs with k_s band measurements, 63 of which also havej band measurements, and 81 of which have spectroscopic redshifts. using thedistribution of optical {\cal r} magnitudes from previous work and {\cal r}-k_scolors for this sub-sample, we compute the rest-frame optical luminosityfunction of lbgs. at the brightest magnitudes, where it is fairly wellconstrained, this luminosity function strikingly exceeds locally determinedoptical luminosity functions. the v-band luminosity density of only theobserved bright end of the z~3 lbg luminosity function already approaches thatof all stars in the local universe. for the 81 galaxies with measuredredshifts, we investigate the range of lbg stellar populations implied by thephotometry which generally spans the range 900--5500 aa in the rest-frame.while there are only weak constraints on the parameters for most of theindividual galaxies, there are strong trends in the sample as a whole. aunified scenario which accounts for the observed trends in bright lbgs is onein which a relatively short period of very rapid star-formation (hundreds ofm_sun/yr) lasts for roughly 50--100 myr, after which both the extinction andstar-formation rate are considerably reduced and stars are formed at a morequiescent, but still rapid, rate for at least a few hundred myr. in our sample,a considerable fraction (~20%) of the lbgs have best-fit star-formation ages ~&gt;1 gyr, implied stellar masses of ~&gt; 10^10 m_sun, and are still forming stars at\~30 m_sun/yr.

0808.1727	mapping the dark matter from uv light at high redshift: an empirical  approach to understand galaxy statistics	we present a simple formalism to interpret two galaxy statistics, the uvluminosity function and two-point correlation functions for star-forminggalaxies at z~4, 5, 6 in the context of lcdm cosmology. both statistics are theresult of how star formation takes place in dm halos, and thus are used toconstrain how uv light depends on halo properties such as mass. the twomeasures were taken from the goods data, thus ideal for joint analysis. the twophysical quantities we explore are the sf duty cycle, and the range of l_uvthat a halo of mass m can have (mean and variance). the former addresses thetypical duration of sf activity in halos while the latter addresses theaveraged sf history and regularity of gas inflow into these systems. we explorevarious physical models consistent with data, and find the following: 1) thetypical duration of sf observed in the data is &lt;0.4 gyr (1 sig), 2) theinferred scaling law between l_uv and halo mass m from the observed slope ofthe lfs is roughly linear at all redshifts, and 3) l_uv for a fixed halo massdecreases with time, implying that the sf efficiency (after dust extinction) ishigher at earlier times. we explore several physical scenarios relating starformation to halo mass, but find that these scenarios are indistinguishable dueto the limited range of halo mass probed by our data. in order to discriminatebetween different scenarios, we discuss constraining the bright-faint galaxycross-correlation functions and luminosity-dependence of galaxy bias.(abridged)

astro-ph;0205142	the population of faint optically-selected agn at z~3	we discuss a sample of 29 agn (16 narrow-lined and 13 broad-lined) discoveredin a spectroscopic survey of ~1000 star-forming lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) atz~3. reaching apparent magnitudes of r_{ab}=25.5, the sample includesbroad-lined agn approximately 100 times less uv-luminous than most surveys todate covering similar redshifts, and the first statistical sample ofuv/optically-selected narrow-lined agn at high redshift. the fraction ofobjects in our survey with clear evidence for agn activity is ~3%. asubstantial fraction, perhaps even most, of these objects would not have beendetected in even the deepest existing x-ray surveys. we argue that these agnare plausibly hosted by the equivalent of lbgs. the uv luminosities of thebroad-lined agn in the sample are compatible with eddington-limited accretiononto black holes that satisfy the locally determined m_{bh} versus m_{bulge}relation given estimates of the stellar masses of lbgs. the clusteringproperties of the agn are compatible with their being hosted by objects similarto lbgs. the implied lifetime of the active agn phase in lbgs, if it occurssome time during the active star-formation phase, is ~10^7 years.

0808.2391	star formation rates in lyman break galaxies: radio stacking of lbgs in  the cosmos field and the sub-$\mu$jy radio source population	we present an analysis of the radio properties of large samples of lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at $z \sim 3$, 4, and 5 from the cosmos field. the medianstacking analysis yields a statistical detection of the $z \sim 3$ lbgs (u-banddrop-outs), with a 1.4 ghz flux density of $0.90 \pm 0.21 \mu$jy. the stackedemission is unresolved, with a size $&lt; 1"$, or a physical size $&lt; 8$kpc. thetotal star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is $31\pm 7$$m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, based on the radio-fir correlation in low redshift starforming galaxies. the star formation rate derived from a similar analysis ofthe uv luminosities is 17 $m_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for uvdust attenuation. the simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factoris 1.8 at uv wavelengths. however, this factor is considerably smaller than thestandard attenuation factor $\sim 5$, normally assumed for lbgs. we discusspotential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dustattenuation factor at $z \ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. conversely,the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematicallylower at very high redshift. two possible causes for a suppressed radioluminosity are: (i) increased inverse compton cooling of the relativisticelectron population due to scattering off the increasing cmb at high redshift,or (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. the radiodetections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud agn fractionof 0.3%. one source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a'submm galaxy').

astro-ph;0511289	spitzer observations of massive red galaxies at high redshift	we investigate the properties of massive galaxies at z=1-3.5 using hstobservations, ground-based near-ir imaging, and spitzer space telescopeobservations at 3-24 micron. we identify 153 distant red galaxies (drgs) withj-k &gt; 2.3 mag (vega) in the southern goods field. this sample is approximatelycomplete in stellar mass for passively evolving galaxies above 10^11 solarmasses and z &lt; 3. the galaxies identified by this selection are roughly splitbetween objects whose optical and near-ir rest-frame light is dominated byevolved stars combined with ongoing star formation, and galaxies whose light isdominated by heavily reddened starbursts. very few of the galaxies (&lt; 10%) haveno indication of current star formation. using sfr estimates that include thereradiated ir emission, the drgs at z=1.5-3 with stellar masses &gt; 10^11 solarmasses have specific sfrs (sfrs per unit stellar mass) ranging from 0.2 to 10gyr^-1, with a mean value of ~2.4 gyr^-1. the drgs with stellar masses &gt; 10^11solar masses and 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 have integrated specific sfrs greater the globalvalue over all galaxies. in contrast, we find that galaxies at z = 0.3-0.75with these stellar masses have integrated specific sfrs less than the globalvalue, and more than an order of magnitude lower than that for massive drgs atz = 1.5-3. at z &lt; 1, lower-mass galaxies dominate the overall cosmic massassembly. this suggests that the bulk of star formation in massive galaxiesoccurs at early cosmic epochs and is largely complete by z~1.5.

astro-ph;0601367	the great observatories origins deep survey vlt/fors2 spectroscopy in  the goods-south field: part ii	we present the second campaign of the eso/goods program of spectroscopy offaint galaxies in the goods-south field. objects were selected as candidatesfor vlt/fors2 observations primarily based on the expectation that thedetection and measurement of their spectral features would benefit from thehigh throughput and spectral resolution of fors2. the reliability of theredshift estimates is assessed using the redshift-magnitude and color-redshiftdiagrams and comparing the results with public data. 807 spectra of 652individua targets have been obtained in service mode with the fors2spectrograph at the eso/vlt, providing 501 redshift determinations. the typicalredshift uncertainty is estimated to be sigma_z ~ 0.001. galaxies have beenselected adopting three different color criteria and using the photometricredshifts.the resulting redshift distribution typically spans two redshiftdomains: from z=0.5 to 2 and z=3.5 to 6.2. in particular, 94 b435-,v606-,i775"dropout" lyman break galaxies have been observed, yielding redshifts for 65objects in the interval 3.4&lt;z&lt;6.2. three sources have been serendipitouslydiscovered in the redshift interval 4.8&lt;z&lt;5.5. together with the previousrelease, 930 sources have now been observed and 724 redshift determinationshave been carried out. the reduced spectra and the derived redshifts arereleased to the community through the eso web pagehttp://www.eso.org/science/goods/. large scale structures are clearly detectedat z=0.666, 0.734, 1.096, 1.221, 1.300, and 1.614. a sample of 34 sources withtilted [oii]3727 emission has been identified, 32 of them in the redshift range0.9&lt;z&lt;1.5.

astro-ph;0602064	ultraviolet-to-far-infrared properties of local star-forming galaxies	we present the results of a multiwavelength study of nearby galaxies, aimedat understanding the relation between the ultraviolet and far-infrared emissionin star-forming galaxies. the dataset comprises new ultraviolet (fromhst/stis), ground-based halpha, and radio continuum observations, together witharchival infrared data (from iras and iso). the local galaxies are used asbenchmarks for comparison of the infrared-to-ultraviolet properties with twopopulations of high-redshift galaxies: the sub-millimeter star-forming galaxiesdetected by scuba and the ultraviolet-selected lyman break galaxies. inaddition, the long wavelength baseline covered by the present data enables usto compare the star formation rates (sfrs) derived from the observedultraviolet, halpha, infrared, and radio luminosities, and to gauge the impactof dust opacity in the local galaxies. we also derive a new calibration for thenon-thermal part of the radio sfr estimator, based on the comparison of 1.4 ghzmeasurements with a new estimator of the bolometric luminosity of the starforming regions. we find that more actively star forming galaxies show higherdust opacities, in line with previous results. we find that the localstar-forming galaxies have lower f(205um)/f(uv) ratio, by two-three orders ofmagnitude than the submillimeter-selected galaxies, and may have similar orsomewhat higher f(205um)/f(uv) than lyman break galaxies. the f(205um)/f(uv)ratio of the local galaxy population may be influenced by the cool dustemission in the far-infrared heated by non-ionizing stellar populations, whichmay be reduced or absent in the lbgs.

astro-ph;0606696	the morphological diversities among star-forming galaxies at high  redshifts in the great observatories origins deep survey (goods)	we have used the hst/acs images to identify 4700 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)in goods. we present the results from a parametric analysis of the 2-d surfacebrightness profiles, for 1333 lbgs at z &gt; 2.5 with rest-frame uv(1600 angstrom)ab magnitude &lt; -20.5. based on the sersic index, n, which measures the profileshape, we find that about 40% of lbgs at z=3 have light profiles close toexponential, and only 30% have the high concentrations seen for spheroids.about 30% of lbgs appear to have multiple cores or disturbed morphologiessuggestive of close pairs or on-going mergers. the fraction of spheroid-like (n&gt; 2.5) lbgs decreases by about 15% from z = 5 to 3. a comparison of lbgs withthe starburst galaxies at z = 1.2, shows that the fraction of spheroid-likeprofiles is about 20% higher among lbgs. the ellipticity distribution for lbgsexhibits a pronounced skew towards high ellipticities (&gt; 0.5), which cannot beexplained by morphologies similar to the local disks and spheroids viewed atrandom orientations. the peak of the distribution evolves toward lowerellipticities, from 0.7 at z = 4 to 0.5 at z = 3. at z = 1.2 the distributionis relatively flat as seen among the present-day galaxies. the dominance ofelongated morphologies among lbgs suggests that in a significant fraction ofthem we may be witnessing star-formation in clumps along gas-rich filaments, orthe earliest gas-rich bars that encompass essentially the entire visiblegalaxy. similar features are found to be ubiquitous in hydrodynamicalsimulations in which galaxy formation at high redshifts occurs in filamentaryinflows of dynamically cold gas within the dark matter halos, and involves gas-rich mergers.

astro-ph;0612182	lyman break galaxies in the vlt/fors2 spectroscopic campaign in the  goods-s field	we present initial results from our ongoing campaign of spectroscopicidentifications of lyman--break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 4, 5 and 6 with fors2 atthe eso vlt. the sample of lbgs is selected from the hst/acs images in thegoods southern field (cdf--s), and here we discuss the spectroscopic propertiesof 103 lbgs that we have cofirmed in the redshift interval 3.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.3, ofwhich 34 at z&gt;5 and 27 between 5.5 and 6.3. as for lbgs at lower redshifts, wefind that lbgs with lya in emission are characterized by weaker intestellarabsorption lines and bluer uv continua than galaxies whose lya is observed inabsorption. no correlation between the lya properties and the apparentelongation of the uv morphology of the galaxies is observed, suggesting thatgeometrical effects are not the cause of the spectral differences. a trend ofincreasing lya equivalent width with decreasing luminosity is also observed. wealso present new measures of the uv luinosity function of lbgs.

astro-ph;0612344	photometric redshifts of galaxies in cosmos	we measure photometric redshifts and spectral types for galaxies in thecosmos survey. we use template fitting technique combined with luminosityfunction priors and with the option to simultaneously estimate dust extinction(i.e. e(b-v)) for each galaxy.our estimated redshifts are accurate to i&lt;25 andz~1.2.  using simulations with sampling and noise characteristics similar to those incosmos, the accuracy and reliability is estimated for the photometric redshiftsas a function of the magnitude limits of the sample, s/n ratios and the numberof bands used. from the simulations we find that the ratio of derived 95%confidence interval in the redshift probability distribution to the estimatedphotometric redshift (d95) can be used to identify and exclude the catastrophicfailures in the photometric redshift estimates.  we compare the derived redshifts with high-reliability spectroscopicredshifts for a sample of 868 normal galaxies with z &lt; 1.2 from zcosmos.considering different scenarios, depending on using prior, no prior and/orextinction, we compare the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for thissample. this corresponds to an rms scatter of 0.031, with a small number ofoutliers (&lt;2.5%). we also find good agreement (rms=0.10) between photometricand spectroscopic redshifts for type ii agns.  we compare results from our photometric redshift procedure with three otherindependent codes and find them in excellent agreement. we show preliminaryresults, based on photometric redshifts for the entire cosmos sample (to i &lt; 25mag.).

astro-ph;0701318	the spitzer legacy survey of the hst-acs 2 sq. deg. cosmos field: survey  strategy and first analysis	the spitzer-cosmos survey (s-cosmos) is a legacy program (cycles 2+3)designed to carry out a uniform deep survey of the full 2 sq deg cosmos fieldin all seven spitzer bands (3.6, 4.5, 5.6, 8.0, 24.0, 70.0, 160.0 u). thispaper describes the survey parameters, mapping strategy, data reductionprocedures, achieved sensitivities to date, and the complete data set forfuture reference. we show that the observed infrared backgrounds in thes-cosmos field are within 10% of the predicted background levels. thefluctuations in the background at 24u have been measured and do not show anysignificant contribution from cirrus, as expected. in addition, we report onthe number of asteroid detections in the low galactic latitude cosmos field. weuse the cycle 2 s-cosmos data to determine preliminary number counts, andcompare our results with those from previous spitzer legacy surveys (e.g.swire, goods). the results from this "first analysis" confirm that the s-cosmossurvey will have sufficient sensitivity with irac to detect ~ l* disks andspheroids out to z ~ 3, and with mips to detect ultraluminous starbursts andagn out to z ~3 at 24u and out to z ~1.5-2 at 70u and 160u.

astro-ph;9602024	spectroscopic confirmation of a population of normal star-forming  galaxies at redshifts z&gt;3	we report the discovery of a substantial population of star--forming galaxiesat $3.0 \simlt z \simlt 3.5$. these galaxies have been selected using colorcriteria sensitive to the presence of a lyman continuum break superposed on anotherwise very blue far-uv continuum, and then confirmed with deep spectroscopyon the w. m. keck telescope. the surface density of galaxies brighter than r=25with 3 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 is $0.4\pm0.07$ galaxies arcmin$^{-2}$, approximately 1.3\% ofthe deep counts at these magnitudes; this value applies both to ``random''fields and to fields centered on known qsos. the corresponding co-moving spacedensity is approximately half that of luminous ($l \simgt l^{\ast}$)present--day galaxies. our sample of $z &gt; 3$ galaxies is large enough that wecan begin to detail the spectroscopic characteristics of the population as awhole. the spectra of the $z&gt;3$ galaxies are remarkably similar to those ofnearby star-forming galaxies, the dominant features being stronglow--ionization interstellar absorption lines and high--ionization stellarlines, often with p-cygni profiles characteristic of wolf-rayet and o--starwinds. lyman $\alpha$ emission is generally weak ($&lt; 20$ \aa\ rest equivalentwidth) and is absent for &gt;50% of the galaxies. the star formation rates,measured directly from the far-uv continua, lie in the range 4-25 $h_{50}^{-2}$m$\sun$ yr$^{-1}$ for $q_0=0.5$. together with the morphological properties ofthe $z&gt;3$ galaxy population, which we discuss in a companion paper (giavalisco\et 1996), all of these findings strongly suggest that we have identified thehigh-redshift counterparts of the spheroid component of present--day luminousgalaxies. in any case, it is clear that massive galaxy formation was alreadywell underway by $z \sim 3.5$.

astro-ph;9708125	a large structure of galaxies at redshift z~3 and its cosmological  implications	we report the discovery of a highly significant concentration of galaxies ata redshift of &lt;z&gt;=3.090. the structure is evident in a redshift histogram ofphotometrically selected ``lyman break'' objects in a 9' by 18' field in whichwe have obtained 78 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 2.0 &lt; z &lt;3.4. thedimensions of the structure projected on the plane of the sky are at least11'by 8', or 14h_{70}^{-1} by 10h_{70}^{-1} mpc (comoving; \omega_m=1). theconcentration contains 15 galaxies and one faint (r=21.7) qso. we consider thestructure in the context of a number of cosmological models and argue thatlyman-break galaxies must be very biased tracers of mass, with an effectivebias on mass scale m~10^{15}m_{\sun} ranging from b~2 for \omega_m=0.2 to b &gt;~6for \omega_m=1. in a cold dark matter scenario the large bias values suggestthat individual lyman-break galaxies are associated with dark halos of massm~10^{12} m_{\sun}, reinforcing the interpretation of these objects as theprogenitors of massive galaxies at the present epoch. preliminary results ofspectroscopy in additional fields suggest that such large structures are commonat z~3, with about one similar structure per survey field. the implied spacedensity is consistent with the possibility that we are observing moderatelyrich clusters of galaxies in their early non-linear evolution. finally, thespectrum of one of the qsos discovered in our survey (z_{em} = 3.356) exhibitsmetal line absorption systems within the 3 redshift bins having the largestnumber of galaxies in field, z = 2.93, 3.09, and 3.28. these results are thefirst from an ongoing ``targeted'' redshift survey designed to explore thenature and distribution of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 2.7 &lt;~ z&lt;~ 3.4.

astro-ph;9811399	lyman break galaxies at z&gt;4 and the evolution of the uv luminosity  density at high redshift	we present initial results of a survey for star-forming galaxies in theredshift range 3.8 &lt; z &lt; 4.5. this sample consists of a photometric catalog of244 galaxies culled from a total solid angle of 0.23 square degrees to anapparent magnitude of i_{ab}=25.0. spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.61 &lt;z &lt; 4.81 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies; their median redshift is&lt;z&gt;=4.13. selecting these galaxies in a manner entirely analogous to our largesurvey for lyman break galaxies at smaller redshift (2.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.4) allows arelatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integratedluminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. over the same range of uvluminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z~4 and z~3are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the totalintegrated uv luminosity densities (rho_{uv}(z=3)/rho_{uv}(z=4) = 1.1 +/-0.3).we see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the starformation density inferred from fainter photometric lyman-break galaxies in thehubble deep field (hdf). if the true luminosity density at z~4 is somewhathigher than implied by the hdf, as our ground-based sample suggests, then theemissivity of star formation as a function of redshift is essentially constantfor all z&gt;1 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made. thissuggests that there is no obvious peak in star formation activity, and that theonset of substantial star formation in galaxies occurs at z &gt; 4.5.

astro-ph;9910144	lyman alpha imaging of a proto-cluster region at &lt;z&gt;=3.09	we present very deep imaging observations, through a narrow-band filter tunedto lyman alpha at &lt;z = 3.09&gt;, of a volume containing a significant over-densityof galaxies at this redshift previously discovered in our survey forcontinuum-selected lyman break galaxies (lbgs). the new observations are usedin conjunction with our spectroscopic results on lbgs to compare theeffectiveness of continuum and emission line searches for star forming galaxiesat high redshift, and to extend the search for members of the structure at &lt;z&gt;=3.09 to much fainter continuum luminosities. we find that only 20-25 percent ofall galaxies at a given uv continuum luminosity would be flagged as narrow-bandexcess objects subject to the typical limits w_lya &gt; 80 angstroms in theobserved frame. the density enhancement of strong lyman alpha emitters in thisfield is consistent with that inferred from the analysis of the spectroscopiclyman break galaxy sample in the same region (6+/-1), but extends to continuumluminosities up to 2 magnitudes fainter. there is no evidence for asignificantly higher fraction of large lyman alpha line equivalent widths atfaint continuum luminosities. by combining the 24 spectroscopic members of thez=3.09 ``spike'' with the narrow-band candidates, we are able to produce asample of 162 objects which are either known or likely members of this largestructure. we have also discovered two extremely large and diffuse lyman alphaemitting ``blobs'', which have physical extents &gt;100/h kpc and lyman alpha linefluxes 20-40 times larger than the typical line emitters at the same redshiftsin the field. the possible nature of the ``blobs'' is discussed.

0810.3108	two bright submillimeter galaxies in a z=4.05 proto-cluster in  goods-north, and accurate radio-infrared photometric redshifts	we present the serendipitous discovery of z=4.05 molecular gas co emissionlines with the iram plateau de bure interferometer coincident with gn20 andgn20.2, two luminous submillimeter galaxies (smgs) in the great observatoriesorigins deep survey north field (goods-n). these are among the most distantsubmillimeter-selected galaxies reliably identified through co emission andalso some of the most luminous known. in terms of co to bolometricluminosities, stellar mass and star formation rates (sfrs), these newlydiscovered z&gt;4 smgs are similar to z~1.5-3 smgs studied to date. these z~4 smgshave much higher specific sfrs than typical b-band dropout lyman break galaxiesat the same redshift. the stellar mass-sfr correlation for normal galaxies doesnot seem to evolve much further, between z~2 and z~4. a significant z=4.05spectroscopic redshift spike is observed in goods-n, and a strong spatialoverdensity of b-band dropouts and irac selected z&gt;3.5 galaxies appears to becentered on the gn20 and gn20.2 galaxies. this suggests a proto-clusterstructure with total mass ~10^14 msun. using photometry at mid-ir, submm andradio wavelengths, we show that reliable photometric redshifts (dz/(1+z)~0.1)can be derived for smgs over 1&lt;z&lt;4. this new photometric redshift technique hasbeen used to provide a first estimate of the space density of 3.5&lt;z&lt;6hyper-luminous starburst galaxies, and to show that they contributesubstantially to the sfr density at early epochs. many of these high-redshiftstarbursts will be within reach of herschel. we find that the radio to mid-irflux density ratio can be used to select z&gt;3.5 starbursts, regardless of theirsubmm/mm emission [abridged].
