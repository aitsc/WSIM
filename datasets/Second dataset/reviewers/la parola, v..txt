0704.1297	the exceptionally extended flaring activity in the x-ray afterglow of  grb 050730 observed with swift and xmm-newton	we present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of swiftand xmm-newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) grb 050730. thex-ray afterglow of grb 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposedintense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitudein time. seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ksafter the burst were observed. the underlying decay of the afterglow was welldescribed by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 sand t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. the temporal decay slopes before, between andafter these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. the spectrum of the x-rayafterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with anabsorbing column density n_h=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.strong x-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. in themajority of the flares (6/7) the ratio delta_t/t_p between the duration of theevent and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.we showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first threeflares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, asexpected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshedshocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slowmoving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. theevent fully satisfies the e_p-e_iso amati relation while is not consistent withthe e_p-e_jet ghirlanda relation.

0905.1266	variability of low-luminosity agns: a simultaneous x-ray/uv look with  swift	we present the results of an investigation of the x-ray and uv properties offour liners observed with swift, aimed at constructing good s/n and strictlysimultaneous uv-x-ray seds. in the current paradigm, liner emission isdominated by geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient radiation flows(riafs) as opposed to radiatively efficient, geometrically thin accretion disksthought to power higher luminosity agns (seyferts and qsos). however, somerecent studies have found more similarities than differences between the sedsof liners and those of more luminous agns, suggesting that liners are poweredby the same mechanisms active in higher luminosity agns. our new observationsallow us to test this idea. in particular, xrt affords long and sensitivemonitoring of the x-ray emission. we detect significant variability in m81 and,for the first time, in ngc 3998. the maximum amplitude variations over timescales of some hours are 30% in both m81 and ngc 3998. ngc 3998 exhibits avariation of the same amplitude on a time scale of 9 days. m81 variessignificantly over 2 years, with a maximum change of a factor 2 in 6 months.the x-ray variability detected in 2 of our sources, and in particular in ngc3998, puts into question the interpretation of their powering mechanism as aninefficient accretion flow, because one of the characteristics of this model isthe lack of variability. the identification of ngc 3998 with a low power agnappears more viable.

0909.5109	swift/xrt monitoring of the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j18483-0311 for an entire orbital period	igr j18483-0311 is an x-ray pulsar with transient x-ray activity, belongingto the new class of high mass x-ray binaries called supergiant fast x-raytransients. this system is one of the two members of this class, together withigr j11215-5952, where both the orbital (18.52d) and spin period (21s) areknown. we report on the first complete monitoring of the x-ray activity alongan entire orbital period of a supergiant fast x-ray transient. these swiftobservations, lasting 28d, cover more than one entire orbital phaseconsecutively. they are a unique data-set, which allows us to constrain thedifferent mechanisms proposed to explain the nature of this new class of x-raytransients. we applied the new clumpy wind model for blue supergiants developedby ducci et al. (2009), to the observed x-ray light curve. assuming aneccentricity of e=0.4, the x-ray emission from this source can be explained interms of the accretion from a spherically symmetric clumpy wind, composed ofclumps with different masses, ranging from 10^{18}g to 5x 10^{21}g.

1009.0522	the palermo swift-bat hard x-ray catalogue iii. results after 54 months  of sky survey	we present the second palermo swift-bat hard x-ray catalogue obtained byanalysing data acquired in the first 54 months of the swift mission. using oursoftware dedicated to the analysis of data from coded mask telescopes, weanalysed the bat survey data in three energy bands (15-30 kev, 15-70 kev,15-150 kev), obtaining a list of 1256 detections above a significance thresholdof 4.8 standard deviations. the identification of the source counterparts ispursued using two strategies: the analysis of field observations of soft x-rayinstruments and cross-correlation of our catalogue with source databases.thesurvey covers 50% of the sky to a 15--150 kev flux limit of 1.0 x 10^-11 ergs^-1 cm^-2 and 9.2 x 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 for |b|&lt; 10 degrees and |b|&gt; 10degrees, respectively. the second palermo swift-bat hard x-ray catalogueincludes 1079 (86%) hard x-ray sources with an associated counterpart (26 witha double association and 2 with a triple association) and 177 bat excesses(14%) that still lack a counterpart. the distribution of the bat sources amongthe different object classes consists of 19% galactic sources, 57%extragalactic sources, and 10% sources with a counterpart at softer energieswhose nature has not yet been determined. about half of the bat associatedsources lack a counterpart in the rosat catalogues. this suggests that eithermoderate or strong absorption may be preventing their detection in the rosatenergy band. the comparison of our bat catalogue with the fermi large areatelescope first source catalogue identifies 59 bat/fermi correspondences: 48blazars, 3 seyfert galaxies, 1 interacting galaxy, 3 high mass x-ray binaries,and 4 pulsars/supernova remnants. this small number of correspondencesindicates that different populations make the sky shine in these two differentenergy bands.

0708.3553	a study of the prompt and afterglow emission of the short grb 061201	our knowledge of the intrinsic properties of short duration gamma-ray burstshas relied, so far, only upon a few cases for which the estimate of thedistance and an extended, multiwavelength monitoring of the afterglow have beenobtained. we carried out multiwavelength observations of the short grb 061201aimed at estimating its distance and studying its properties. we performed aspectral and timing analysis of the prompt and afterglow emission and discussthe results in the context of the standard fireball model. a clear temporalbreak was observed in the x-ray light curve about 40 minutes after the bursttrigger. we find that the spectral and timing behaviour of the x-ray afterglowis consistent with a jet origin of the observed break, although the opticaldata can not definitively confirm this and other scenarios are possible. nounderlying host galaxy down to r~26 mag was found after fading of the opticalafterglow. thus, no secure redshift could be measured for this burst. thenearest galaxy is at z=0.111 and shows evidence of star formation activity. wediscuss the association of grb 061201 with this galaxy and with the aco s 995galaxy cluster, from which the source is at an angular distance of 17'' and8.5', respectively. we also test the association with a possible undetected,positionally consistent galaxy at z~1. in all these cases, in the jetinterpretation, we find a jet opening angle of 1-2 degrees.

1009.4699	galaxy clusters in the swift/bat era ii: 10 more clusters detected above  15 kev	we report on the discovery of 10 additional galaxy clusters detected in theongoing swift/bat all-sky survey. among the newly bat-discovered clusters thereare: bullet, abell 85, norma, and pks 0745-19. norma is the only cluster, amongthose presented here, which is resolved by bat. for all the clusters we performa detailed spectral analysis using xmm-newton and swift/bat data to investigatethe presence of a hard (non-thermal) x-ray excess. we find that in most casesthe clusters' emission in the 0.3-200kev band can be explained by amulti-temperature thermal model confirming our previous results. for twoclusters (bullet and abell 3667) we find evidence for the presence of a hardx-ray excess. in the case of the bullet cluster, our analysis confirms thepresence of a non-thermal, power-law like, component with a 20-100 kev flux of3.4 \times 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 as detected in previous studies. for abell 3667the excess emission can be successfully modeled as a hot component (kt=~13kev).we thus conclude that the hard x-ray emission from galaxy clusters (except thebullet) has most likely thermal origin.

1010.2085	suzaku and swift-bat observations of a newly discovered compton-thick  agn	obscured agn are fundamental to understand the history of super massive blackhole growth and their influence on galaxy formation. however, the compton-thickagn (nh&gt;1e24 cm^-2) population is basically unconstrained, with less than fewdozen confirmed compton-thick agn found and studied so far. a way to selectheavily obscured agn is to compare the x-ray emission below 10 kev (which isstrongly depressed) with the emission from other bands less affected by theabsorption, i.e. the ir band. to this end, we have cross-correlated the 2xmmcatalogue with the iras point source catalogue and, by using the x-ray toinfrared flux ratio and x-ray colors, we selected a well defined sample ofcompton-thick agn candidates at z&lt;0.1. the aim of this work is to confirm thenature and to study one of these local compton-thick agn candidates, the nearby(z=0.029) seyfert 2 galaxy iras 04507+0358, by constraining the amount ofintrinsic absorption (nh) and thus the intrinsic luminosity. to this end weobtained deep (100 ks) suzaku observations (ao4 call) and performed a joint fitwith swift-bat data. we analyzed xmm-newton, suzaku and swift-bat data and wepresent here the results of this broad-band (0.4-100 kev) spectral analysis. wefound that the broad-band x-ray emission of iras 04507+0358 requires a largeamount of absorption (larger than 1e24 cm^-2) to be well reproduced, thusconfirming the compton-thick nature of this source. in particular, the mostprobable scenario is that of a mildly (nh (1.3-1.5)x1e24 cm^-2, l(2-10 kev)(5-7)x1e43 erg s^-1) compton-thick agn.

1102.4546	the swift-bat survey reveals the orbital period of three high-mass x-ray  binaries	a growing number of previously hidden galactic x-ray sources are now detectedwith recent surveys performed by the integral and swift satellites. most ofthese new sources eluded past surveys due to their large local x-ray extinctionand consequent low soft x-ray flux. the swift-bat performs daily monitoring ofthe sky in an energy band (15-150 kev) which is only marginally affected byx-ray extinction, thus allowing for the search of long periodicities in thelight curve and identification of the nature of the x-ray sources. we performeda period search using the folding technique in the swift-bat light curves ofthree integral sources: igr j05007-7047, igr j13186-6257 and igr j17354-3255.their periodograms show significant peaks at 30.77$\pm$0.01 d, 19.994$\pm$0.01d and 8.448$\pm$0.002 d, respectively. we estimate the significance of thesefeatures from the chi squared distribution of all the trials, finding aprobability less than 1.5$\times10^{-4}$ that the detections occurred due tochance. we complement our analysis with the study of their broadband x-rayemission. we identify the periodicities with the orbital periods of thesources. the periods are typical for the wind accretors x-ray binaries and wesupport this identification showing that also their energy spectra arecompatible with an x-ray spectral emission characteristic of high-mass x-raybinaries. the spectrum of igr j05007-704 that resides in the large magellaniccloud, does not show any intrinsic local absorption, whereas the spectra of thegalactic sources igr j17354-3255 and igr j13186-6257 may be affected by a localabsorber. the folded light curve for igr j13186-6257 suggests a possible becompanion star.

1112.3965	swift follow-up observations of unclassified asca sources	we present swift follow-up observations of a sample of 35 unclassified faintx-ray sources drawn from the asca galactic centre and plane surveys. our shortpointed xrt observations allow detections down to a limiting 0.3-10 kev flux of~1e-13 erg cm-2 s-1, which translates into a luminosity of ~1e33 erg s-1 for anassumed distance of d=8 kpc. the brightest source in our sample reaches amaximum 0.3-10 kev luminosity of ~2e36 (d/8kpc)^2 erg s-1 during ourobservations. we detect 16 (46%) of the asca sources with the xrt, while 19were not detected during our program. since we are probing the faint end of theasca source populations, we expect a large fraction of the non-detections to bedue to the eddington bias. this is strengthened by the fact that we find theobserved xrt count rates to be predominantly lower than expected based on thereported asca intensities. investigation of the asca properties and long-termx-ray variability leads us to conclude that the non-detections likely includetwo spurious asca detections and three objects that are variable or transientx-ray sources. for the 16 xrt-detected sources we obtain positional accuraciesof ~2-4", which significantly improves upon their asca uncertainties of ~1'. weuse the x-ray spectra and variability to characterise these objects. mostappear to be faint, persistent x-ray emitters that have highly absorbedspectra. based on their x-ray properties we identify three accreting compactobjects: one confirmed (ax j1754.2-2754) and one candidate (ax j1538.3-5541)x-ray binary, and one possible magnetically accreting white dwarf (axj1620.1-5002). furthermore, we use the improved positions of xrt-detectedsources to search for counterparts in simultaneously obtained swift/uvot imagesand possible associations with cataloged sources at various wavelengths. thisreveals three possible main sequence stars amongst our sample.

1206.2357	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts: x-ray afterglow  luminosity and its correlation with the prompt emission	we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x-ray afterglowluminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selectedsub-sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) nearly complete inredshift (~90%). being free of selection effects (except flux limit), thissample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical propertiesof grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. the afterglow x-rayluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropicenergy e_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso and the rest frame peakenergy e_peak. we find that the rest frame afterglow x-ray luminosity docorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of eachcorrelation decreases over time. this result is in agreement with the idea thatthe grb x-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination ofdifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,respectively. in particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallowdecay phase often observed in grb x-ray light curves are powered by activityfrom the central engine. the existence of the l_x-e_iso correlation at latetimes (t_rf &gt; 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among differentbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the promptemission.

1208.0169	evidence for a resonant cyclotron line in igr j16493-4348 from the  swift-bat hard x-ray survey	resonant absorption cyclotron features are a key diagnostic tool to directlymeasure the strength of the magnetic field of accreting neutron stars. however,typical values for cyclotron features lie in the high-energy part of thespectrum between 20 kev and 50 kev, where detection is often damped by the lowstatistics from single pointed observations. we show that long-term monitoringcampaign performed with swift-bat of persistently, but faint, accretinghigh-mass x-ray binaries is able to reveal in their spectra the presence ofcyclotron features. we extracted the average swift-bat 15-150 kev spectrum fromthe 54 months long swift-bat survey of the high-mass x-ray source igrj16493-4348. to constrain the broadband spectrum we used soft x-ray spectrafrom swift-xrt and suzaku pointed observations. we model the spectra using aset of phenomenological models usually adopted to describe the energy spectrumof accreting high-mass x-ray binaries; irrespective of the models we used, wefound significant improvements in the spectral fits adding to the models abroad (10 kev width) absorption feature, with best-fitting energy estimatebetween 30 and 33 kev, that we interpret as evidence for a resonant cyclotronabsorption feature. we also discuss instrumental issues related to the use ofswift-bat for this kind of studies and the statistical method to weight theconfidence level of this detection. correcting for the gravitational redshiftof a 1.4 m$_{\sun}$ neutron star, the inferred surface magnetic field is bsurf3.7 x 10^{12} gauss. the spectral parameters of igr j16493-4348 fit well withempirical correlations observed when the whole sample of high-mass binarieswith detected cyclotron features is considered.

1209.0706	the x-ray variability history of markarian 3	we aim at constraining the geometry of the reprocessing matter in the nearbyprototypical seyfert 2 galaxy markarian 3 by studying the time evolution ofspectral components associated to the primary agn emission and to itscompton-scattering. we have analyzed archival spectroscopic observations ofmarkarian 3 taken over the last 12 years with the xmm-newton, suzaku and swiftobservatories, as well as data taken during a monitoring campaign activated byus in 2012. the timescale of the compton-reflection component variability(originally discovered by asca in the mid-'90s) is ~64 days. this upper limitimproves by more than a factor of 15 previous estimates of thecompton-reflection variability timescale for this source. when the light curveof the compton-reflection continuum in the 4-5 kev band is correlated with the15-150 kev swift/bat curve a delay ~1200 days is found. the cross-correlationresults are dependent on the model used to fit the spectra, although thedetection of the compton-reflection component variability is independent of therange of models employed to fit the data. reanalysis of an archival chandraimage of markarian 3 indicates that the compton-reflection and the fe k-alphaemitting regions are extended to the north up to ~300 pc. the combination ofthese findings suggests that the optically-thick reprocessor in markarian 3 isclumpy. there is mounting experimental evidence for the structure of theoptically-thick gas and dust in the nuclear environment of nearby heavilyobscured agn to be extended and complex. we discuss possible modifications tothe standard unification scenarios encompassing this complexity. markarian 3,exhibiting x-ray absorption and reprocessing on widely different spatialscales, is an ideal laboratory to test these models (abridged).

1210.4652	timing accuracy of the swift x-ray telescope in wt mode	the x-ray telescope (xrt) on board swift was mainly designed to providedetailed position, timing and spectroscopic information on gamma-ray burst(grb) afterglows. during the mission lifetime the fraction of observing timeallocated to other types of source has been steadily increased. in this paper,we report on the results of the in-flight calibration of the timingcapabilities of the xrt in windowed timing read-out mode. we use observationsof the crab pulsar to evaluate the accuracy of the pulse period determinationby comparing the values obtained by the xrt timing analysis with the valuesderived from radio monitoring. we also check the absolute time reconstructionmeasuring the phase position of the main peak in the crab profile and comparingit both with the value reported in literature and with the result that weobtain from a simultaneous rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) observation. wefind that the accuracy in period determination for the crab pulsar is of theorder of a few picoseconds for the observation with the largest data time span.the absolute time reconstruction, measured using the position of the crab mainpeak, shows that the main peak anticipates the phase of the position reportedin literature for rxte by ~270 microseconds on average (~150 microseconds whendata are reduced with the attitude file corrected with the uvot data). theanalysis of the simultaneous swift-xrt and rxte proportional counter array(pca) observations confirms that the xrt crab profile leads the pca profile by~200 microseconds. the analysis of xrt photodiode mode data and bat event datashows a main peak position in good agreement with the rxte, suggesting thediscrepancy observed in xrt data in windowed timing mode is likely due to asystematic offset in the time assignment for this xrt read out mode.

1401.1972	a magnetar powering the ordinary monster grb 130427a?	we present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (grb)130427a under the hypothesis that the grb central engine is anaccretion-powered magnetar. in this framework, initially proposed to explaingrbs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion ofmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to theaccretion rate. the emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces areable to pause accretion. we show that the x-ray and optical afterglow is wellexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contributionfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. our modelling does not require anycontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglowlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. wederive the magnetic field ($b\sim 10^{16}$ g) and the spin period ($p\sim 20$ms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimumluminosity for accretion. this minimum luminosity results well below the promptemission luminosity of grb 130427a, providing a strong consistency check forthe scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuousaccretion onto the magnetar. this is in agreement with the relatively long spinperiod of the magnetar. grb 130427a was a well monitored grb showing a verystandard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that anaccretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long grbs.

0705.3977	new flaring of an ultraluminous x-ray source in ngc 1365	we have studied a highly variable ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) in thefornax galaxy ngc 1365, with a series of 12 chandra and xmm-newton observationsbetween 2002 and 2006. in 2006 april, the source peaked at a luminosity ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3-10 kev band (similar to the maximum luminosity foundby asca in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. the x-rayspectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. when thesource is seen at x-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg/s, an additional softthermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk)contributes ~ 1/4 of the x-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute &lt; 10%of the flux. at the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detectedaround 0.5-2 kev; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. thepower-law is always hard, with a photon index gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter attimes), as is generally the case with bright ulxs. we speculate that thissource and perhaps most other bright ulxs are in a high/hard state: as theaccretion rate increases well above the eddington limit, more and more power isextracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels,and is used to power a comptonizing corona, jet or wind. the observed thermalcomponent comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius betweenouter standard disk and comptonizing inner region moves further out and tolower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. this produces theobserved appearance of a large, cool disk. based on x-ray luminosity andspectral arguments, we suggest that this accreting black hole has a likely mass~ 50-150 msun (even without accounting for possible beaming).

astro-ph;0509689	swift xrt observations of the afterglow of grb 050319	swift discovered the high redshift grb 050319 with the burst alert telescopeand began observing with its narrow field instruments only 225 s after theburst onset. the afterglow x-ray emission was monitored by the xrt up to 28days after the burst. the light curve shows a decay with three differentphases, each characterized by a distinct slope: an initial steep decay with apower law index of ~ 5.5, a second phase characterized by a flat decay slope of\~ 0.54, and a third phase with a decay slope of ~ 1.14. during the first phasethe spectral energy distribution is softer than in the following two phases andthe photon index is consistent with the grb prompt spectrum. the extrapolationof the bat light curve to the xrt band suggests that the initial fast decayingphase of the xrt afterglow might be the low energy tail of the prompt emission.the second break in the afterglow light curve occurs about 27000 s after theburst. the spectral energy distribution before and after the second break doesnot change and it can be tentatively interpreted as a jet break or the end of adelayed or continuous energy injection phase.

astro-ph;0509737	detection of a huge explosion in the early universe	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are bright flashes of high energy photons that canlast from about 10 milliseconds to 10 minutes. their origin and nature havepuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the firstx-ray afterglows of long (&gt; 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the firstoptical and radio counterparts were found. these measurements established thatlong grbs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminousstar-forming host galaxies. they are likely produced in core-collapseexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativisticjets (collapsar model). internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of therelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slowmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. these shocksare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularlyshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinctinternal collision. the expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellarmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible forproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the x-ray, optical andradio bands. here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the mostdistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to adistance of 13 billion light-years from earth, corresponding to a time when theuniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old. the discovery of agamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive starsonly 700 million years after the big bang. the very high redshift burstsrepresent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the universecame out of the dark ages.

astro-ph;0510677	swift observations of the x-ray bright grb 050315	this paper discusses swift observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 050315(z=1.949) from 80 s to 10 days after the onset of the burst. the x-ray lightcurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.however, both the prompt hard x-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the bat)and the first ~ 300 s of x-ray emission (observed by the xrt) can be explainedby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. extrapolating the batlight curve into the xrt band suggests the rapidly decaying, early x-rayemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strongsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray emission may be relatedto the simple temporal and spectral character of this x-ray rich grb. theprompt (bat) spectrum was a steep down to 15 kev, and appeared to continuethrough the xrt bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with theamati relation. following the initial steep decline the x-ray afterglow did notfade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index ofalpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.the apparent `plateau' in the x-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep x-ray lightcurves revealed by swift. if the second afterglow break is identified with ajet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying e_gamma&gt; 10^50 erg.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0602236	grb 050505: a high redshift burst discovered by swift	we report the discovery and subsequent multi-wavelength afterglow behaviourof the high redshift (z = 4.27) gamma ray burst grb 050505. this burst is thethird most distant burst, measured by spectroscopic redshift, discovered aftergrb 000131 (z = 4.50) and grb 050904 (z = 6.29). grb 050505 is a long grb witha multipeaked gamma-ray light curve, with a duration of t_90 = 63+/-2 s and aninferred isotropic release in gamma-rays of ~4.44 x 10^53 ergs in the 1-10^4kev rest frame energy range. the swift x-ray telescope followed the afterglowfor 14 days, detecting two breaks in the light curve at 7.4(+/-1.5) ks and 58.0(+9.9/-15.4) ks after the burst trigger. the power law decay slopes before,between and after these breaks were 0.25 (+0.16/-0.17), 1.17 (+0.08/-0.09) and1.97 (+0.27/-0.28) respectively. the light curve can also be fit with a`smoothly broken' power law model with a break observed at ~ t+18.5 ks, withdecay slopes of ~0.4 and ~1.8 before and after the break respectively. thex-ray afterglow shows no spectral variation over the course of the swiftobservations, being well fit with a single power law of photon index ~1.90.this behaviour is expected for the cessation of continued energisation of theism shock followed by a break caused by a jet, either uniform or structured.neither break is consistent with a cooling break. the spectral energydistribution indeed shows the cooling frequency to be below the x-ray but aboveoptical frequencies. the optical -- x-ray spectrum also shows that there issignificant x-ray absorption in excess of that due to our galaxy but verylittle optical/uv extinction, with e(b-v) ~0.10 for a smc-like extinctioncurve.

astro-ph;0602497	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments. indeed, swift-bat triggered on aprecursor ~570s before the main burst peak, and this allowed swift to repointthe narrow field instruments to the burst position ~350s before the main burstoccurred. grb 060124 also triggered konus-wind, which observed the promptemission in a harder gamma-ray band (up to 2mev). thanks to these exceptionalcircumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission canbe studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges. while the x-ray emission(0.2-10kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst, the optical component follows adifferent pattern, likely indicating a different origin, possibly the onset ofexternal shocks. the prompt grb spectrum shows significant spectral evolution,with both the peak energy and the spectral index varying. as observed inseveral long grbs, significant lags are measured between the hard- andlow-energy components, showing that this behaviour extends over 3 decades inenergy. the grb peaks are also much broader at soft energies. this is relatedto the temporal evolution of the spectrum, and can be accounted for by assumingthat the electron spectral index softened with time. the burst energy(e_iso~5x10^{53} erg) and average peak energy (e_p~300kev) make grb 060124consistent with the amati relation. the x-ray afterglow is characterized by adecay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

astro-ph;0610570	swift observations of grb050904: the most distant cosmic explosion ever  observed	swift discovered the high redshift (z=6.29) grb050904 with the burst alerttelescope (bat) and began observing with its narrow field instruments 161 safter the burst onset. this gamma-ray burst is the most distant cosmicexplosion ever observed. because of its high redshift, the x-ray telescope(xrt) and bat simultaneous observations provide 4 orders of magnitude ofspectral coverage (0.2-150 kev; 1.4-1090 kev in the source rest frame) at avery early source-frame time (22 s). grb050904 was a long, multi-peaked, brightgrb with strong variability during its entire evolution. the light curveobserved by the xrt is characterized by the presence of a long flaring activitylasting up to 1-2 hours after the burst onset in the burst rest frame, with noevidence of a smooth power-law decay following the prompt emission as seen inother grbs. however, the bat tail extrapolated to the xrt band joins the xrtearly light curve and the overall behavior resembles that of a very long grbprompt. the spectral energy distribution softens with time, with the photonindex decreasing from -1.2 during the bat observation to -1.9 at the end of thexrt observation. the dips of the late x-ray flares may be consistent with anunderlying x-ray emission arising from the forward shock and with theproperties of the optical afterglow reported by tagliaferri et al. (2005b). weinterpret the bat and xrt data as a single continuous observation of the promptemission from a very long grb. the peculiarities observed in grb050904 could bedue to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the universe;very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide anexplanation.

astro-ph;0701450	attributes of flares in gamma ray bursts: sample i	we discuss some of the preliminary results and findings derived from theanalysis of a first sample of flares detected by the xrt on board swift. theanalysis shows that the morphology of flares is the one we expect from thecollision of ultra-relativistic shells as it happens during the internal shockmodel proposed by rees and meszaros in 1994. furthermore the delta(t)/t ratioand the decay-time to rise-time ratio have mean values that are in goodagreement with the values observed in the prompt emission pulses that arebelieved to originate from internal shocks. the conclusion is that the flareanalysis favors the internal shock as due to shells that have been ejected bythe central engine after the prompt emission. the central engine seems toremain active and capable of generating large amounts of energy also at latertimes. more data are needed to establish whether or not some of the flarescould be due to shells that have been emitted with small lorentz factor at thetime of the prompt emission and generate later time flares due to the catch upof these shells.

astro-ph;0702220	swift observations of grb 070110: an extraordinary x-ray afterglow  powered by the central engine	we present a detailed analysis of swift multi-wavelength observations of grb070110 and its remarkable afterglow. the early x-ray light curve, interpretedas the tail of the prompt emission, displays a spectral evolution already seenin other gamma-ray bursts. the optical afterglow shows a shallow decay up to ~2d after the burst, which is not consistent with standard afterglow models. themost intriguing feature is a very steep decay in the x-ray flux at ~20 ks afterthe burst, ending an apparent plateau. the abrupt drop of the x-ray light curverules out an external shock as the origin of the plateau in this burst andimplies long-lasting activity of the central engine. the temporal and spectralproperties of the plateau phase point towards a continuous central engineemission rather than the episodic emission of x-ray flares. we suggest that theobserved x-ray plateau is powered by a spinning down central engine, possibly amillisecond pulsar, which dissipates energy at an internal radius beforedepositing energy into the external shock.

astro-ph;0702371	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: temporal properties and morphology	we present the first systematic investigation of the morphological and timingproperties of flares in grbs observed by swift/xrt. we consider a large sampledrawn from all grbs detected by swift, integral and hete-2 prior to 2006 jan31, which had an xrt follow-up and which showed significant flaring. our sampleof 33 grbs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69flares. the strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clearanti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time ofoccurrence. fitting each x-ray flare with a gaussian model, we find that themean ratio of the width and peak time is &lt;delta t / t &gt; = 0.13+/-0.10, albeitwith a large scatter. late flares at times &gt; 2000 seconds have long durations,delta t&gt;300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.we further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulsesdetected in the prompt phase by bat and the number of x-ray flares detected byxrt, finding no correlation. however, we find that the distribution ofintensity ratios between successive bat prompt pulses and that betweensuccessive xrt flares is the same, an indication of a common origin forgamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares. all evidence indicates that flares areindeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standardfireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.while all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flaresmay also be explained by refreshed shocks. however, 10 can only be explained byprolonged activity of the central engine.
