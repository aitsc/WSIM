0901.2567	a population of weak metal-line absorbers surrounding the milky way	we report on the detection of a population of weak metal-line absorbers inthe halo or nearby intergalactic environment of the milky way. usinghigh-resolution ultraviolet absorption-line spectra of bright qsos obtainedwith the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis), along six sight lines wehave observed unsaturated, narrow absorption in oi and siii together withmildly saturated cii absorption at high radial velocities (|v_lsr|=100-320km/s). the measured oi column densities are small, implying that thesestructures represent lyman-limit systems and sub-lyman-limit system with hicolumn densities &lt; 3x10^18 cm^-2, thus below the detection limits of current21cm all-sky surveys of high-velocity clouds (hvcs). the absorbers apparentlyare not directly associated with any of the large high-column density hvccomplexes, but rather represent isolated, partly neutral gas clumps embedded ina more tenuous, ionized gaseous medium situated in the halo or nearbyintergalactic environment of the galaxy. we speculate that this absorberpopulation represents the local analog of weak mgii systems that are commonlyobserved in the circumgalactic environment of low- and high-redshift galaxies.

0902.0208	the magellanic bridge as a dla system: physical properties of cold gas  toward pks0312-770	we measure the physical properties of a local multi-component absorption-linesystem at v_sol ~ 200 km/s toward the quasar pks0312-770 behind the magellanicbridge (mb) using hubble space telescope stis spectroscopy in conjunction withphotoionization modeling. at an impact parameter of ~ 10 kpc from the smallmagellanic cloud (smc), this sightline provides a unique opportunity to probethe chemical properties and ionization structure in a nearby absorption linesystem with a column density of logn(hi) ~ 20.2, at the transition betweendamped lyman alpha (dla) and sub-dla systems. we find that metallicity of -1.0&lt; logz &lt; -0.5 and ionization parameter of -6 &lt; logu &lt; -5 for threelow-ionization components and logu ~ -2.6 for one high-ionization component.one component at v_sol = 207 km/s shows an alpha-element abundance log(si/h) ~-5.0, making it ~ 0.2 dex more metal rich than both smc h ii regions and starswithin the mb and the smc. the n/si ratio in this component is log(n/si) =-0.3+/-0.1, making it comparable to other n-poor dwarf galaxies and ~ 0.2 dexlower than h ii regions in the smc. another component at v_sol = 236 km/s showsa similar si/h ratio but has log(n/si) = -1.0+/-0.2, indicating a nitrogendeficiency comparable to that seen in the most n-poor dla systems. thesedifferences imply different chemical enrichment histories between componentsalong the same sightline. our results suggest that, if these absorbers arerepresentative some fraction of dla systems, then 1) dla systems along singlesight-lines do not necessarily represent the global properties of the absorbingcloud, and b) the chemical composition within a given dla cloud may beinhomogeneous.

1004.2043	a bare molecular cloud at z~0.45	several neutral species (mgi, sii, cai, fei) have been detected in a weakmgii absorption line system (w_r(2796)~0.15 angstroms) at z~0.45 along thesightline toward he0001-2340. these observations require extreme physicalconditions, as noted in d'odorico (2007). we place further constraints on theproperties of this system by running a wide grid of photoionization models,determining that the absorbing cloud that produces the neutral absorption isextremely dense (~100-1000/cm^3), cold (&lt;100 k), and has significant molecularcontent (~72-94%). structures of this size and temperature have been detectedin milky way co surveys, and have been predicted in hydrodynamic simulations ofturbulent gas. in order to explain the observed line profiles in all neutraland singly ionized chemical transitions, the lines must suffer from unresolvedsaturation and/or the absorber must partially cover the broad emission lineregion of the background quasar. in addition to this highly unusual cloud,three other ordinary weak mgii clouds (within densities of ~0.005/cm^3 andtemperatures of ~10000k) lie within 500 km/s along the same sightline. wesuggest that the "bare molecular cloud", which appears to reside outside of agalaxy disk, may have had in situ star formation and may evolve into anordinary weak mgii absorbing cloud.

1008.2953	the physical conditions of the intrinsic n v narrow absorption line  systems of three quasars	we employ detailed photoionization models to infer the physical conditions ofintrinsic narrow absorption line systems found in high resolution spectra ofthree quasars at z=2.6-3.0. we focus on a family of intrinsic absorberscharacterized by n v lines that are strong relative to the ly-alpha lines. theinferred physical conditions are similar for the three intrinsic n v absorbers,with metallicities greater than 10 times the solar value (assuming a solarabundance pattern), and with high ionization parameters (log u ~ 0). thus, weconclude that the unusual strength of the n v lines results from a combinationof partial coverage, a high ionization state, and high metallicity. we considerwhether dilution of the absorption lines by flux from the broad-emission lineregion can lead us to overestimate the metallicities and we find that this isan unlikely possibility. the high abundances that we infer are not surprisingin the context of scenarios in which metal enrichment takes place very early onin massive galaxies. we estimate that the mass outflow rate in the absorbinggas (which is likely to have a filamentary structure) is less than a few solarmasses per year under the most optimistic assumptions, although it may beembedded in a much hotter, more massive outflow.

1008.4581	mid-infrared evidence for accelerated evolution in compact group  galaxies	compact galaxy groups are at the extremes of the group environment, with highnumber densities and low velocity dispersions that likely affect member galaxyevolution. to explore the impact of this environment in detail, we examine thedistribution in the mid-infrared (mir) 3.6-8.0 micron colorspace of 42 galaxiesfrom 12 hickson compact groups in comparison with several control samples,including the lvl+sings galaxies, interacting galaxies, and galaxies from thecoma cluster. we find that the hcg galaxies are strongly bimodal, withstatistically significant evidence for a gap in their distribution. incontrast, none of the other samples show such a marked gap, and only galaxiesin the coma infall region have a distribution that is statistically consistentwith the hcgs in this parameter space. to further investigate the cause of thehcg gap, we compare the galaxy morphologies of the hcg and lvl+sings galaxies,and also probe the specific star formation rate (ssfr) of the hcg galaxies.while galaxy morphology in hcg galaxies is strongly linked to position with mircolorspace, the more fundamental property appears to be the ssfr, or starformation rate normalized by stellar mass. we conclude that the unusual mircolor distribution of hcg galaxies is a direct product of their environment,which is most similar to that of the coma infall region. in both cases, galaxydensities are high, but gas has not been fully processed or stripped. wespeculate that the compact group environment fosters accelerated evolution ofgalaxies from star-forming and neutral gas-rich to quiescent and neutralgas-poor, leaving few members in the mir gap at any time.

1201.1287	examining the role of environment in a comprehensive sample of compact  groups	(abridged) compact groups, with their high number densities, small velocitydispersions, and an interstellar medium that has not been fully processed,provide a local analog to conditions of galaxy interactions in the earlieruniverse. the frequent and prolonged gravitational encounters that occur incompact groups affect the evolution of the constituent galaxies in a myriad ofways, for example gas processing and star formation. recently, a statisticallysignificant "gap" has been discovered mid-infrared irac colorspace of compactgroup galaxies. this gap is not seen in field samples and is a new example ofhow the compact group environment may affect the evolution of member galaxies.in order to investigate the origin and nature of this gap, we have compiled asample of 49 compact groups. we find that a statistically significant deficitof galaxies in this gap region of irac colorspace is persistant in this sample,lending support to the hypothesis that the compact group environment inhibitsmoderate ssfrs. we note a curvature in the colorspace distribution, which isfully consistent with increasing dust temperature as the activity in a galaxyincreases. this full sample of 49 compact groups allows us to subdivide thedata according to physical properties of the groups. an analysis of thesesubsamples indicates that neither projected physical diameter nor density showa trend in colorspace within the values represented by this sample. wehypothesize that the apparent lack of a trend is due to the relatively smallrange of properties in this sample. thus, the relative influence of stochasticeffects becomes dominant. we analyze spectral energy distributions of membergalaxies as a function of their location in colorspace and find that galaxiesin different regions of mir colorspace contain dust with varying temperaturesand/or pah emission.

1212.1151	intragroup and galaxy-linked diffuse x-ray emission in hickson compact  groups	isolated compact groups of galaxies (cgs) present a range of dynamicalstates, group velocity dispersions, and galaxy morphologies with which to studygalaxy evolution, particularly the properties of gas both within the galaxiesand in the intragroup medium. as part of a large, multiwavelength examinationof cgs, we present an archival study of diffuse x-ray emission in a subset ofnine hickson compact groups observed with the chandra x-ray observatory. wefind that seven of the groups in our sample exhibit detectable diffuseemission. however, unlike large-scale emission in galaxy clusters, the diffusefeatures in the majority of the detected groups are linked to the individualgalaxies, in the form of both plumes and halos likely as a result of starformation or agn activity, as well as in emission from tidal features. unlikeprevious studies from earlier x-ray missions, hcgs 31, 42, 59, and 92 are foundto be consistent with the lx-t relationship from clusters within the errors,while hcgs 16 and 31 are consistent with the cluster lx-sigma relation, thoughthis is likely coincidental given that the hot gas in these two systems islargely due to star formation. we find that lx increases with decreasing grouphi to dynamical-mass ratio with tentative evidence for a dependance in x-rayluminosity on hi morphology whereby systems with intragroup hi indicative ofstrong interactions are considerably more x-ray luminous than passivelyevolving groups. we also find a gap in the lx of groups as a function of thetotal group specific star formation rate. our findings suggest that the hot gasin these groups is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and these systems are notlow-mass analogs of rich groups or clusters, with the possible exception of hcg62.

1301.1345	the milky way halo as a qso absorption-line system. new results from an  hst/stis absorption-line catalogue of galactic high-velocity clouds	we use archival uv absorption-line data from hst/stis to statisticallyanalyse the absorption characteristics of the high-velocity clouds (hvcs) inthe galactic halo towards more than 40 extragalactic background sources. wedetermine absorption covering fractions of low- and intermediate ions (oi, cii,siiii, mgii, feii, siiii, civ, and siiv) in the range fc = 0.20 - 0.70. fordetailed analysis we concentrate on siii absorption components in hvcs, forwhich we investigate the distribution of column densities, b-values, and radialvelocities. combining information for siii and mgii, and using a geometricalhvc model we investigate the contribution of hvcs to the absorption crosssection of strong mgii absorbers in the local universe. we estimate that thegalactic hvcs would contribute on average ~52 % to the total strong mgii crosssection of the milky way, if our galaxy were to be observed from an exteriorvantage point. we further estimate that the mean projected covering fraction ofstrong mgii absorption in the milky way halo and disc from an exterior vantagepoint is fc(smgii) = 0.31 for a halo radius of r = 61 kpc. these numbers,together with the observed number density of strong mgii absorbers at lowredshift, indicate that the contribution of infalling gas clouds (i.e., hvcanalogues) in the halos of milky way-type galaxies to the cross section ofstrong mgii absorbers is &lt;34 %. these findings are in line with the idea thatoutflowing gas (e.g., produced by galactic winds) in the halos of more activelystar-forming galaxies dominate the absorption-cross section of strong mgiiabsorbers in the local universe.

0801.1692	exploratory study of the x-ray properties of quasars with intrinsic  narrow absorption lines	we have used archival chandra and xmm-newton observations of quasars hostingintrinsic narrow uv absorption lines (intrinsic nals) to carry out anexploratory survey of their x-ray properties. our sample consists of threeintrinsic-nal quasars and one "mini-bal" quasar, plus four quasars withoutintrinsic absorption lines for comparison. these were drawn in a systematicmanner from an optical/uv-selected sample. the x-ray properties ofintrinsic-nal quasars are indistinguishable from those of "normal" quasars. wedo not find any excess absorption in quasars with intrinsic nals, with upperlimits of a few times 10^22 cm^-2. we compare the x-ray and uv properties ofour sample quasars by plotting the equivalent width and blueshift velocity ofthe intrinsic nals and the x-ray spectral index against the "optical-to-x-ray"slope, alpha-ox. when bal quasars and other agns with intrinsic nals areincluded, the plots suggest that intrinsic-nal quasars form an extension of thebal sequences and tend to bridge the gap between bal and "normal" quasars.observations of larger samples of intrinsic-nal quasars are needed to verifythese conclusions. we also test two competing scenarios for the location of thenal gas in an accretion-disk wind. our results strongly support a location ofthe nal gas at high latitudes above the disk, closer to the disk axis than thedense bal wind. we detect excess x-ray absorption only in q0014+8118, whichdoes not host intrinsic nals. the absorbing medium very likely corresponds toan intervening system at z=1.1, which also produces strong absorption lines inthe rest-frame uv spectrum of this quasar. in the appendix we discuss theconnection between uv and x-ray attenuation and its effect on alpha-ox.

0801.2452	super-solar metallicity in weak mg ii absorption systems at z ~ 1.7	through photoionization modeling, constraints on the physical conditions ofthree z ~ 1.7 single-cloud weak mg ii systems (w_r(2796) &lt; 0.3a) are derived.constraints are provided by high resolution r = 45,000, high signal-to-noisespectra of the three quasars he0141-3932, he0429-4091, and he2243-6031 which wehave obtained from the eso archive of vlt/uves. results are as follows:  (1) the single-cloud weak mg ii absorption in the three z ~ 1.7 systems isproduced by clouds with ionization parameters of -3.8 &lt; logu &lt; -2.0 and sizesof 1-100 pc.  (2) in addition to the low-ionization phase mg ii clouds, all systems need anadditional 1-3 high-ionization phase c iv clouds within 100 km/s of the mg iicomponent. the ionization parameters of the c iv phases range from -1.9 &lt; logu&lt; -1.0, with sizes of tens of parsecs to kiloparsecs.  (3) two of the three single-cloud weak mg ii absorbers have near-solar orsuper-solar metallicities, if we assume a solar abundance pattern. althoughsuch large metallicities have been found for z &lt; 1 weak mg ii absorbers, theseare the first high metallicities derived for such systems at higher redshifts.  (4) two of the three weak mg ii systems also need additional low-metallicity,broad lya absorption lines, offset in velocity from the metal-line absorption,in order to reproduce the full lya profile.  (5) metallicity in single-cloud weak mg ii systems are more than an order ofmagnitude larger than those in damped lya systems at z ~ 1.7. in fact, thereappears to be a gradual decrease in metallicity with increasing n(hi), fromthese, the most metal-rich lya forest clouds, to lyman limit systems, tosub-dlas, and finally to the dlas.

1307.6559	the optical green valley vs mid-ir canyon in compact groups	compact groups of galaxies provide conditions similar to those experienced bygalaxies in the earlier universe. recent work on compact groups has led to thediscovery of a dearth of mid-infrared transition galaxies (mirtgs) in irac (3.6- 8.0 micron) color space (johnson et al. 2007; walker et al. 2012) as well asat intermediate specific star formation rates (tzanavaris et al. 2010).however, we find that in compact groups these mid-infrared (mid-ir) transitiongalaxies in the mid-infrared dearth have already transitioned to the optical([g-r]) red sequence. we investigate the optical color-magnitude diagram (cmd)of 99 compact groups containing 348 galaxies and compare the optical cmd withmid-ir color space for compact group galaxies. utilizing redshifts availablefrom sdss, we identified new galaxy members for 6 groups. by combining opticaland mid-ir data, we obtain information on both the dust and the stellarpopulations in compact group galaxies. we also compare with more isolatedgalaxies and galaxies in the coma cluster, which reveals that, similar toclusters, compact groups are dominated by optically red galaxies. while we findthat compact group transition galaxies lie on the optical red sequence,lvl+sings mid-ir transition galaxies span the range of optical colors. thedearth of mid-ir transition galaxies in compact groups may be due to a lack ofmoderately star forming low mass galaxies; the relative lack of these galaxiescould be due to their relatively small gravitational potential wells. thismakes them more susceptible to this dynamic environment, thus causing them tomore easily lose gas or be accreted by larger members.

(2007) survey of 2 &lt; z(em) &lt; 4quasars that selects systems using similar techniques. we confirm the existenceof so-called "strong n v" intrinsic systems (where the equivalent width of h ily alpha is small compared to n v 1238) presented in that work, but find noconvincing cases of "strong c iv" intrinsic systems at low redshift/luminosity.moreover, we also report on the existence of "strong o vi" systems. from acomparison of partial coverage results as a function of ion, we conclude thatsystems selected by the n v ion have the highest probability of beingintrinsic. by contrast, the c iv and o vi ions are poor selectors. of the 30 ovi systems tested, only two of the systems in the spectrum on 3c 351 showconvincing evidence for partial coverage. however, there is a 3-sigma excess inthe number of absorbers near the quasar redshift (|delta v| &lt;= 5000 km/s) overabsorbers at large redshift differences. in at least two cases, the associatedo vi systems are known not to arise close to the accretion disk of the quasar.

1404.5514	the cos/uves absorption survey of the magellanic stream. iii:  ionization, total mass, and inflow rate onto the milky way	dynamic interactions between the two magellanic clouds have flung largequantities of gas into the halo of the milky way, creating the magellanicstream, the magellanic bridge, and the leading arm (collectively referred to asthe magellanic system). in this third paper of a series studying the magellanicgas in absorption, we analyze the gas ionization level using a sample of 69hubble space telescope/cosmic origins spectrograph sightlines that pass throughor within 30 degrees of the 21 cm-emitting regions. we find that 81% (56/69) ofthe sightlines show uv absorption at magellanic velocities, indicating that thetotal cross section of the magellanic system is ~11 000 square degrees, oraround a quarter of the entire sky. using observations of the si iii/si iiratio together with cloudy photoionization modeling, we calculate that thetotal mass (atomic plus ionized) of the magellanic system is ~2.0 billion solarmasses, with the ionized gas contributing over twice as much mass as the atomicgas. this is larger than the current-day interstellar h i mass of bothmagellanic clouds combined, indicating that they have lost most of theirinitial gas mass. if the gas in the magellanic system survives to reach thegalactic disk over its inflow time of ~0.5-1.5 gyr, it will represent anaverage inflow rate of ~3.7-6.7 solar masses per year, potentially raising thegalactic star formation rate. however, multiple signs of an evaporativeinteraction with the hot galactic corona indicate that the stream may notsurvive its journey to the disk fully intact, and will instead add material to(and cool) the corona.

1405.6718	some like it hot: linking diffuse x-ray luminosity, baryonic mass, and  star formation rate in compact groups of galaxies	we present an analysis of the diffuse x-ray emission in 19 compact groups ofgalaxies (cgs) observed with chandra. the hottest, most x-ray luminous cgsagree well with the galaxy cluster x-ray scaling relations in $l_x-t$ and$l_x-\sigma$, even in cgs where the hot gas is associated with only thebrightest galaxy. using spitzer photometry, we compute stellar masses andclassify hcgs 19, 22, 40, and 42 and rscgs 32, 44, and 86 as fossil groupsusing a new definition for fossil systems that includes a broader range ofmasses. we find that cgs with total stellar and hi masses $\gtrsim10^{11.3}$m$_\odot$ are often x-ray luminous, while lower-mass cgs only sometimes exhibitfaint, localized x-ray emission. additionally, we compare the diffuse x-rayluminosity against both the total uv and 24 $\mu$m star formation rates of eachcg and optical colors of the most massive galaxy in each of the cgs. the mostx-ray luminous cgs have the lowest star formation rates, likely because thereis no cold gas available for star formation, either because the majority of thebaryons in these cgs are in stars or the x-ray halo, or due to gas strippingfrom the galaxies in cgs with hot halos. finally, the optical colors that tracerecent star formation histories of the most massive group galaxies do notcorrelate with the x-ray luminosities of the cgs, indicating that perhaps thecurrent state of the x-ray halos is independent of the recent history ofstellar mass assembly in the most massive galaxies.

1407.5998	monitoring the variability of intrinsic absorption lines in quasar  spectra	we have monitored 12 intrinsic narrow absorption lines (nals) in five quasarsand seven mini-broad absorption lines (mini-bals) in six quasars for a periodof 4-12 years (1-3.5 years in the quasar rest-frame). we present theobservational data and the conclusions that follow immediately from them, as aprelude to a more detailed analysis. we found clear variability in theequivalent widths (ews) of the mini-bal systems but no easily discerniblechanges in their profiles. we did not detect any variability in the nal systemsnor in narrow components that are often located at the center of mini-balprofiles. variations in mini-bal ews are larger at longer time intervals,reminiscent of the trend seen in variable broad absorption lines. if we assumethat the observed variations result from changes in the ionization state of themini-bal gas, we infer lower limits to the gas density $\sim$ 10$^3$-10$^5$cm$^{-3}$ and upper limits on the distance of the absorbers from the centralengine of order a few kpc. motivated by the observed variability properties, wesuggest that mini-bals can vary because of fluctuations of the ionizingcontinuum or changes in partial coverage while nals can vary primarily becauseof changes in partial coverage.

1506.01028	an extreme metallicity, large-scale outflow from a star-forming galaxy  at z ~ 0.4	we present a detailed analysis of a large-scale galactic outflow in the cgmof a massive (m_h ~ 10^12.5 msun), star-forming (6.9 msun/yr), sub-l* (0.5l_b*) galaxy at z=0.39853 that exhibits a wealth of metal-line absorption inthe spectra of the background quasar q 0122-003 at an impact parameter of 163kpc. the galaxy inclination angle (i=63 degree) and the azimuthal angle (phi=73degree) imply that the qso sightline is passing through the projectedminor-axis of the galaxy. the absorption system shows a multiphase,multicomponent structure with ultra-strong, wide velocity spread ovi (logn =15.16\pm0.04, v_{90} = 419 km/s) and nv (logn = 14.69\pm0.07, v_{90} = 285km/s) lines that are extremely rare in the literature. the highly ionizedabsorption components are well explained as arising in a low density (10^{-4.2}cm^{-3}), diffuse (10 kpc), cool (10^4 k) photoionized gas with a super-solarmetallicity ([x/h] &gt; 0.3). from the observed narrowness of the lyb profile, thenon-detection of siv absorption, and the presence of strong civ absorption werule out equilibrium/non-equilibrium collisional ionization models. thelow-ionization photoionized gas with a density of 10^{-2.5} cm^{-3} and ametallicity of [x/h] &gt; -1.4 is possibly tracing recycled halo gas. we estimatean outflow mass of ~2x10^{10} msun, a mass-flow rate of ~54 msun/yr, a kineticluminosity of ~9x10^{41} erg/s, and a mass loading factor of ~8 for theoutflowing high-ionization gas. these are consistent with the properties of"down-the-barrel" outflows from infrared-luminous starbursts as studied byrupke et al. such powerful, large-scale, metal-rich outflows are the primarymeans of sufficient mechanical and chemical feedback as invoked in theoreticalmodels of galaxy formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0005586	low and high ionization absorption properties of mg ii  absorption-selected galaxies at intermediate redshifts. ii. taxonomy,  kinematics, and galaxies	[abridged] we examine a sample of 45 mg ii absorption-selected systems overthe redshift range 0.4 to 1.4. mg ii and fe ii absorption profiles wereobserved at a resolution of ~6 km/s with hires/keck. lyman-alpha and c iv datawere measured in archival fos/hst spectra (~230 km/s). we perform amultivariate analysis of w(mgii), w(feii), w(civ) and w(lya) (rest-frame)equivalent widths and the mg ii kinematic spread. we find five categories of mgii absorbers: "classic", "c iv-deficient", "single/weak", "double", and"dla/hi-rich". there is a strong connection between low-ionization kinematicsand the location of an absorber on the w(civ)-w(mgii) plane. in most absorbersa significant fraction of the c iv arises in a phase separate from mg ii. manyof the c iv profiles are resolved in the fos spectra due to velocitystructure.. for 16 galaxies, we compare the available absorption-lineproperties (taken from churchill et al. 2000, paper i) to the galaxy propertiesbut find no significant (greater than 3-sigma) correlations, although severalsuggestive trends are apparent. we compare the locations of our intermediateredshift absorbers on the w(civ)-w(mgii) plane with those of lower and higherredshift data taken from the literature and find evidence for evolution that isconnected with the mg ii kinematics. we discuss the potential of using theabove categorizations of absorbers to understand the evolution in theunderlying physical processes giving rise to the gas and governing itsionization phases and kinematics.

(2) weak systems account for somewhere between 25% to 100% of the z &lt;1 lyman alpha forest clouds in the range 15.8&lt;log n(hi)&lt;16.8 cm^-2. (3) atleast seven of 15 systems have two or more ionization phases of gas (multiphasemedium). (4) we identify a subset of weak mgii absorber that we term``iron-rich''. these clouds are not alpha-group enhanced and are constrained tohave sizes of ~10 pc. at that size, to produce the observed redshift pathdensity, they would need to outnumber l* galaxies by approximately six ordersof magnitude.  we discuss these results and the implications that the iron-rich systemsrequire enrichment from type ia supernovae. further, we address how starclusters or supernova remnants in dwarf galaxies might give rise to absorberswith the inferred properties. this would imply far larger numbers of suchobjects than are presently known, even locally. we compare the weak systems tothe weak kinematic subsystems in strong mgii absorbers and to galactic highvelocity clouds.

0808.2651	the chemical and ionization conditions in weak mg ii absorbers	we present an analysis of the chemical and ionization conditions in a sampleof 100 weak mg ii absorbers identified in the vlt/uves archive of quasarspectra. using a host of low ionization lines associated with each absorber inthis sample, and on the basis of ionization models, we infer that themetallicity in a significant fraction of weak mg ii clouds is constrained tovalues of solar or higher, if they are sub-lyman limit systems. based on theobserved constraints, we present a physical picture in which weak mg iiabsorbers are predominantly tracing two different astrophysicalprocesses/structures. a significant population of weak mg ii clouds, those inwhich n(fe ii) is much less than n(mg ii), identified at both low (z ~ 1) andhigh (z ~ 2) redshift, are potentially tracing gas in the extended halos ofgalaxies, analogous to the galactic high velocity clouds. these absorbers mightcorrespond to alpha-enhanced interstellar gas expelled from star-forminggalaxies, in correlated supernova events. on the other hand, n(feii)approximately equal to n(mg ii) clouds, which are prevalent only at lowerredshifts (z &lt; 1.5), must be tracing type ia enriched gas in small, highmetallicity pockets in dwarf galaxies, tidal debris, or other intergalacticstructures.

astro-ph;0512238	the nature of weak mgii absorbing structures	we consider geometries and possible physical models for weak low ionizationabsorbers based on the relative incidence of low and high ionization absorptionsystems. we found a total of 16 metal-line systems, with low and/or highionization absorption detected in our survey of weak low ionization absorptionsystems from the archive of hst/stis data. the weak low ionization absorberstrace an abundant population of metal-enriched regions (close to solarmetallicity). generally, models show that these systems have a ~10pc region ofhigher density gas and a ~1kpc region of lower density phase of higherionization absorption. we compare absorption systems detected in low and/orhigh ionization gas and find the following: 1) all but 1 of the 10 weak lowionization systems have a related high ionization phase. in 3 cases the highionization gas has only a single component, kinematically centered on the lowionization absorption, and in the other 6 cases there are additional highionization components offset in velocity. the system, toward quasar 3c 273, donot have a high ionization cloud; 2) there are just 6 systems with only a highionization phase as compared to the 9 systems with both low and high ionizationphases; 3) the high ionization absorption in weak low ionization systems is, onaverage, stronger than in systems with only high ionization absorption; 4) thekinematic structure of the high ionization in weak low ionization systems issimilar to that in high ionization only systems. we find that filamentary andsheetlike geometries are favored, due to the relatively small observedcross-section of high ionization only systems. although low ionizationabsorbers are not closely associated with luminous galaxies, they arise intheir immediate environments within the cosmic web.

astro-ph;9411012	competition of supermassive black holes and galactic spheroids in the  destruction of globular clusters	the globular clusters that we observe in galaxies may be only a fraction ofthe initial population. among the evolutionary influences on the population isthe destruction of globular clusters by tidal forces as the cluster movesthrough the field of influence of a disk, a bulge, and/or a putative nuclearcomponent (black hole). we have conducted a series of n-body simulations ofglobular clusters on bound and marginally bound orbits through potentials thatinclude black hole and spheroidal components. the degree of concentration ofthe spheroidal component can have a considerable impact on the extent to whicha globular cluster is disrupted. if half the mass of a $10^{10} \msun$ spheroidis concentrated within 800pc, then only black holes with masses $&gt;10^9 \msun$can have a significant tidal influence over that already exerted by the bulge.however, if the matter in the spheroidal component is not so stronglyconcentrated toward the center of the galaxy, a more modest central black hole(down to $10^8 \msun$) could have a dominant influence on the globular clusterdistribution, particularly if many of the clusters were initially on highlyradial orbits. our simulations show that the stars that are stripped from aglobular cluster follow orbits with roughly the same eccentricity as theinitial cluster orbit, spreading out along the orbit like a ``string ofpearls''. since only clusters on close to radial orbits will suffer substantialdisruption, the population of stripped stars will be on orbits of higheccentricity.

astro-ph;9503010	comparison of n-body simulations to statistical observations of galaxy  pairs	n-body simulations were conducted of pairs of galaxies with a 3:1 mass ratioon parabolic orbits, in order to quantify the effect of dynamical friction. theeffects of varying the ratio of the dark matter halo size to the distance ofclosest approach were explored. once the dark matter halos are fullyoverlapping, the more massive simulated galaxies achieve a larger maximumseparation after the first encounter despite the increased dynamical frictioncaused by the more extended halos. projected separation and radial velocityhistograms were generated by "observing" the simulation results at varioustimes and from various orientations. these histograms were compared withobservations of galaxy pairs (charlton &amp; salpeter 1991; chengalur, salpeter, &amp;terzian 1993) with the result that large halo radii (~200 - 600 kpc) and widedistances of closest approach are generally favored. it is difficult toreconcile the small radial velocity differences that have been observed (medianof ~ 30 km/s, chengalur et al. 1993) with the simulations when we sample allparts of the orbits equally. including an additional population of wide pairsthat have just recently reached "turnabout" from the hubble flow would lowerthe median velocity differences. models suggest that additional data for pairsat intermediate separations should have a somewhat larger median velocitydifference than the wide pairs. very narrow pairs include galaxies which areinteracting, and whose gaseous components respond to forces other than gravity.if consistently small $\delta v$ are measured from neutral hydrogen velocitiesin a larger sample of narrow pairs, pressure forces and dissipation effects onthe gaseous components could be responsible.

(2) observed large anticoincidentn(hi) are not consistent with a single population of smooth sphericalabsorbers, which should exhibit sharp cut--offs at small n(hi) in the n(hi)distribution. (3) there is marginal evidence that the observed rms value ofvelocity differences between coincident lines increases with dlos separation asis expected for disk/slab--like absorbers that have systematic velocity fields.(4) the observed velocity dispersion along a single los is small compared tothe rms difference between widely separated los, which is not consistent withmodels of cloudlets moving isotropically within a spherical structure. overall,only a smooth disk/slab--like model with systematic velocities remainsconsistent with the inferred properties of a single population of lyman-alphaabsorbers.

astro-ph;9510160	the formation of dwarf galaxies in tidal debris: a study of the compact  group environment	from r-band images of 42 hickson compact groups, we present a sample of 47candidate dwarf galaxies that are associated with the tidal tails and arms inthe groups. the candidates, found in 15 tidal features, have r magnitudes andmasses (for m/l = 1) in the ranges -16.5 &lt; m_r - 5 log h_{75} &lt; -11.5 and2x10^6 m_{\odot} &lt; m &lt; 2x10^8 m_{\odot}, respectively. their masses andlocations are compared to the predictions of theoretical/n-body tidal dwarfformation scenarios. considering the longevity of tidal debris in the compactgroup environment and the results of this survey, we estimate the contributionof the tidal dwarf formation mechanism to the population of dwarf galaxiesobserved at large in compact groups. if the majority of our dwarf galaxycandidates are confirmed as being gravitationally bound stellar systems, then asignificant fraction, perhaps as much as one-half, of the dwarf population incompact groups is the product of interactions among giant parent galaxies.

astro-ph;9601121	mgii absorbers: halos or disks?	we challenge the conventional view that the majority of mgii/lyman limitabsorbers are extended halos of galaxies comprised of ``clouds'' withnear-unity covering factor. the gaseous disks of spiral galaxies are known toextend to large radii and likely contribute a significant cross-section forabsorption. we perform a monte-carlo survey of qso fields in which the modelgalaxies have mgii absorbing ``clouds'' in a spherical halo or in a randomlyoriented disk. for both geometries, models that recover the observed propertiesof mgii absorbers have only a 70-80% covering factor. therefore, regardless ofabsorber geometry, a survey of randomly selected qso fields should yield anon-negligible number of non-absorbing galaxies at small impact parameters.very few have been observed (steidel (1995)). however, selection effects areimportant, and once the observational procedures are applied to our modelfields we find that this result is expected. since both spherical halo and diskmodels can be made consistent with survey results, we present tests fordiscerning the geometric distribution of absorbing gas from hubble spacetelescope images and high resolution spectra.

astro-ph;9601152	probing lyman-alpha absorbers in cosmological simulations with double  lines of sight	we perform a double line of sight (dlos) analysis of the lyman-alpha foreststructures that form and evolve in cosmological n-body/hydrodynamicsimulations. pairs of simulated spectra, extracted from lines of sightseparated by distances from d=12.5kpc up to 800kpc, and a ``control sample'' ofunrelated lines of sight, are analyzed at redshifts 3, 2, and 1. coincidentline samples are defined for hi column density thresholds of nco = 10^{12.5},10^{13}, and 10^{14} per square cm. we find that: 1) under the assumption of asingle structure size, a bayesian analysis yields sizes that are larger forsmaller nco, and at fixed nco the size decreases with decreasing redshift.however, these derived sizes are found to increase with increasing d indicatingthat the assumption of a single structure size is invalid. 2) the columndensities of coincident pairs are highly correlated for small d, withincreasing scatter as d is increased, consistent with structures that have acentrally peaked n(hi) that decreases gradually with radius. 3) the velocitydifference distribution for coincident lines is very narrow for small d, andwidens as d is increased to meet the expectation for chance coincidences inunrelated lines of sight. this behavior is indicative of organized motionwithin the structures. 4) for small d, the distribution of anticoincident linecolumn densities, nac, falls steeply as nac increases from the cutoff value,but has a significant tail at large values which is inconsistent with apopulation of spherical absorbers with sharp edges, and consistent with aflattened geometry. the conclusions reached on the basis of the dlos analysisare validated by an examination of the three-dimensional structures andvelocity flows in the simulation data.

astro-ph;9604106	qso absorption line systems as a probe of galaxies like the milky way	quasar absorption lines provide detailed information on the chemical,kinematic, and ionization conditions in galaxies and their environments, andprovide a means for studying the evolution of these conditions back to theepoch of the first quasars. among the collection of absorbing structures alongthe lines of sight to quasars there is an evolutionary sequence of galaxiesthat represent predecessors of the milky way and provide a direct view of itshistory. absorption spectra of lines of sight through the milky way and throughnearby galaxies reveal a variety of chemical species, ionization conditions,and kinematic substructures. these absorption profiles are produced by lowdensity gas distributed in rotating disks, high velocity halo clouds, satellitegalaxies and their debris, superbubbles, and other sub-galactic gaseousfragments. guided by knowledge gained by studying nearby galaxies, we aredeveloping interpretations of the variety of observed absorption signatures.images of .4 &lt; z &lt; 1 galaxies responsible for mgii absorption also allow us toexplore the statistical connections between the galaxy properties and theirgaseous content. quasar absorption lines are fast becoming a powerfulevolutionary probe of gaseous conditions in the milky way.

astro-ph;9707273	the distribution of gas in and around galaxies	a consensus is developing on the nature of various populations of absorbersat different redshift regimes and in particular on their relationships togalaxies at those epochs. as one example we discuss the population of z &lt; 1mgii absorbers. kinematic models are presented that show this population to beconsistent with some combination of halo and disk kinematics and not with apure disk or halo model. in contrast, the 2 &lt; z &lt; 3 civ absorbers are likely torepresent a mix of already formed halos and protogalactic clumps in the processof assembly. clues could be provided by the level at which siiv traces the samekinematic components as civ (relative to how it traces lower ionization gas)and this is illustrated by a simple application of principal componentsanalysis. it remains uncertain how much unambiguous information it will bepossible to extract about the detailed properties of the gas along the line ofsight through an individual absorption profile. however, ratios of various lowand high ionization transitions along the line of sight can be combined withinsights gained from kinematic models and from observations of galaxyproperties. there is reason for optimism that we will progress toward a pointwhen we will someday study the interstellar medium and gaseous halos andenvironments of absorbing galaxies at close to the same level as we study thesecomponents in the milky way.

astro-ph;9712235	the kinematic composition of mgii absorbers	the study of galaxy evolution using quasar absorption lines requires anunderstanding of what components of galaxies and their surroundings arecontributing to the absorption in various transitions. this paper considers thekinematic composition of the class of 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 mgii absorbers,particularly addressing the question of what fraction of this absorption isproduced in halos and what fraction arises from galaxy disks. we design modelswith various fractional contributions from radial infall of halo material andfrom a rotating thick disk component. we generate synthetic spectra from linesof sight through model galaxies and compare the resulting ensembles of mgiiprofiles with the 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 sample observed with hires/keck. we apply abattery of statistical tests and find that pure disk and pure halo models canbe ruled out, but that various models with rotating disk and infall/halocontributions can produce an ensemble that is nearly consistent with the data.a discrepancy in all models that we considered requires the existence of akinematic component intermediate between halo and thick disk. the variety ofmgii profiles can be explained by the gas in disks and halos of galaxies notvery much different than galaxies in the local universe.  in any one case there is considerable ambiguity in diagnosing the kinematiccomposition of an absorber from the low ionization high resolution spectraalone. future data will allow galaxy morphologies, impact parameters, andorientations, feii/mgii of clouds, and the distribution of high ionization gasto be incorporated into the kinematic analysis. combining all these data willpermit a more accurate diagnosis of the physical conditions along the line ofsight through the absorbing galaxy.

astro-ph;9803122	an aluminum enhanced cloud in a civ absorber at z = 1.94	in the z=1.94 civ absorption line system in the spectrum of quasar q1222+228(z_em=2.04), we find two clouds which have contrasting physical conditions,although they are only at a 17 km/s velocity separation. in the first cloudsiii, siiv, and cii are detected, and alii and aliii column density limits inconjunction with photoionization models allow us to infer that this cloud has alarge si abundance and a small al abundance relative to a solar abundancepattern. this pattern resembles that of galactic metal-poor halo stars, whichmust have formed from such high redshift gas. the second cloud, in contrast,has detected alii and aliii (also siiv and cii), but no detected siii. wedemonstrate, using photoionization models, that al/si must be greater than(al/si)_sun in this unusual cloud. such a ratio is not found in absorptionprofiles looking through milky way gas. it cannot be explained by dustdepletion since al depletes more severely than si. comparing to other al-richenvironments, we speculate about the processes and conditions that could giverise to this abundance pattern.

astro-ph;9805174	the luminosity function of galaxies in compact groups	from r-band images of 39 hickson compact groups (hcgs), we use galaxy countsto determine a luminosity function extending to m_r=-14.0, approximately twomagnitudes deeper than previous compact group luminosity functions. we findthat a single schechter function is a poor fit to the data, so we fit acomposite function consisting of separate schechter functions for the brightand faint galaxies. the bright end is best fit with m^*=-21.6 and alpha=-0.52and the faint end with m^*=-16.1 and alpha=-1.17. the decreasing bright endslope implies a deficit of intermediate luminosity galaxies in our sample ofhcgs and the faint end slope is slightly steeper than that reported for earlierhcg luminosity functions. furthermore, luminosity functions of subsets of oursample reveal more substantial dwarf populations for groups with x-ray halos,groups with tidal dwarf candidates, and groups with a dominant elliptical orlenticular galaxy. collectively, these results support the hypothesis thatwithin compact groups, the initial dwarf galaxy population is replenished by"subsequent generations" formed in the tidal debris of giant galaxyinteractions.

astro-ph;9807131	the population of weak mg ii absorbers i. a survey of 26 qso hires/keck  spectra	we present a search for "weak" mgii absorbers [those with w_r(2796) &lt; 0.3 ain the hires/keck spectra of 26 qsos. we found 30, of which 23 are newlydiscovered. the spectra are 80% complete to w_r(2796) = 0.02 a and have acumulative redshift path of ~17.2 for the redshift range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.4. thenumber of absorbers per unit redshift, dn/dz, is seen to increase as theequivalent width threshold is decreased; we obtained dn/dz = 1.74+/-0.10 forour 0.02 &lt;= w_r(2796) &lt; 0.3 a sample. the equivalent width distribution followsa power law with slope -1.0; there is no turnover down to w_r(2796) = 0.02 a at&lt;z&gt; = 0.9. weak absorbers comprise at least 65% of the total mgii absorptionpopulation, which outnumbers lyman limit systems (lls) by a factor of3.8+/-1.1; the majority of weak mgii absorbers must arise in sub-llsenvironments. tentatively, we predict that ~5% of the lyman-alpha forest cloudswith w_r(1215) &gt; 0.1 a will have detectable mgii absorption to w_r,min(2796) =0.02 a and that this is primarily a high-metallicity selection effect (z/z_sun]&gt; -1). this implies that mgii absorbing structures figure prominently astracers of sub-lls environments where gas has been processed by stars. wecompare the number density of w_r(2796) &gt; 0.02 a absorbers with that of bothhigh and low surface brightness galaxies and find a fiducial absorber size of35h^-1 to 63h^-1 kpc, depending upon the assumed galaxy population and theirabsorption properties. the individual absorbing "clouds" have w_r(2796) &lt;= 0.15a and their narrow (often unresolved) line widths imply temperatures of ~25,000k. we measured w_r(1548) from civ in fos/hst archival spectra and, based uponcomparisons with feii, found a range of ionization conditions (low, high, andmulti-phase) in absorbers selected by weak mgii.

astro-ph;9809042	the multiple phases of interstellar and halo gas in a possible group of  galaxies at z~1	we used hires/keck profiles (r=6 km/s) of mgii and feii in combination withfos/hst spectra (r=230 km/s) to place constraints on the physical conditions(metallicities, ionization conditions, and multi-phase distribution) ofabsorbing gas in three galaxies at z=0.9254, 0.9276, and 0.9343 along the lineof sight to pg 1206+459. the chemical and ionization species covered in thefos/hst spectra are hi, siii, cii, nii, feiii, siiii, siiv, niii, ciii, civ,svi, nv, and ovi, with ionization potentials ranging from 13.6 to 138 ev. themultiple mgii clouds exhibit complex kinematics and the civ, nv and ovi areexceptionally strong in absorption. we assumed that the mgii clouds arephotoionized by the extra-galactic background and determined the allowed rangesof their physical properties as constrained by the absorption strengths in thefos spectra. a main result of this paper is that the low resolution spectra canprovide meaningful constraints on the physical conditions of the mgii clouds,including allowed ranges of cloud to cloud variations within a system. we findthat the mgii clouds, which have a typical size of ~100 pc, give rise to thesiiv, the majority of which arises in a single, very large (~5 kpc), higherionization cloud. however, the mgii clouds cannot account for the strong civ,nv, and ovi absorption. we conclude that the mgii clouds are embedded inextended (10-20 kpc), highly ionized gas that gives rise to civ, nv, ovi; theseare multi-phase absorption systems. the high ionization phases have near-solarmetallicity and are consistent with galactic-like coronae surrounding theindividual galaxies, as opposed to a very extended common "halo" encompassingall three galaxies.

astro-ph;9812019	distortion of globular clusters by galactic bulges	one of the external fields that influences the population of globularclusters is that due to galactic bulges. in extreme situations, perigalacticdistances $r_p \le 100$ pc, globular clusters could suffer total disruption ina single passage. a more common scenario is that for cluster orbits with $r_p\ge 200$ pc. we investigate the effects of tidal forces from a bulge on theshape of globular clusters for this type of encounters. we find distortionscharacterized by ``twisting isophotes'' and consider the potential forobservability of this effect. in the milky way, a typical globular cluster mustpass within several hundred pc of the center to experience substantialdistortion, and it is possible that this has happened recently to one or twopresent day clusters. we estimate that this distortion could be observed evenfor globulars in dense fields toward the bulge. in more extreme environmentssuch as giant ellipticals or merger products with newly formed globulars, thiseffect could be more common, extending out to orbits that pass within 1 kpc ofthe bulge center. this would lead to a substantial shift in the eccentricitydistribution of globulars in those galaxies.

astro-ph;9901197	the distribution of high redshift galaxy colors: line of sight  variations in neutral hydrogen absorption	we model, via monte carlo simulations, the distribution of observed u-b, b-v,v-i galaxy colors in the range 1.75&lt;z&lt;5 caused by variations in theline-of-sight opacity due to neutral hydrogen (hi). we also include hi internalto the source galaxies. even without internal hi absorption, comparison of thedistribution of simulated colors to the analytic approximations of madau (1995)and madau et al (1996) reveals systematically different mean colors andscatter. differences arise in part because we use more realistic distributionsof column densities and doppler parameters. however, there are alsomathematical problems of applying mean and standard deviation opacities, andsuch application yields unphysical results. these problems are corrected usingour monte carlo approach. including hi absorption internal to the galaxiesgeneraly diminishes the scatter in the observed colors at a given redshift, butfor redshifts of interest this diminution only occurs in the colors using thebluest band-pass. internal column densities &lt; 10^17 cm^2 do not effect theobserved colors, while column densities &gt; 10^18 cm^2 yield a limitingdistribution of high redshift galaxy colors. as one application of ouranalysis, we consider the sample completeness as a function of redshift for asingle spectral energy distribution (sed) given the multi-color selectionboundaries for the hubble deep field proposed by madau et al (1996). we arguethat the only correct procedure for estimating the z&gt;3 galaxy luminosityfunction from color-selected samples is to measure the (observed) distributionof redshifts and intrinsic sed types, and then consider the variation in colorfor each sed and redshift. a similar argument applies to the estimation of theluminosity function of color-selected, high redshift qsos.

astro-ph;9902341	intrinsic narrow absorption lines in hires/keck spectra of a sample of  six quasars	in the course of a large intervening mgii survey of 25 quasars, the civemission lines of six (three radio-loud and three radio-quiet) were observedserendipitously. in four of these six quasars, we detected associated narrowabsorption lines. three of these four quasars are radio-quiet while the otheris radio-loud. as a result of the original target selection, the small sampleof six quasars is unbiased towards finding associated civ absorption lines. inthree of these four cases, the absorption line optical-depth ratios deviatefrom the prediction based on atomic physics, suggesting that the backgroundphoton source(s) are only partially covered by the absorbing medium and, byextension, that the absorption lines are intrinsic to the quasar. we have usedthe method of barlow &amp; sargent to determine the effective coverage fraction ofbackground source(s) and we have extended it to constrain the coverage fractionof the continuum and broad-emission line sources separately. we have alsoapplied this refined method to the narrow intrinsic absorption lines in threeadditional quasars for which the necessary data were available from theliterature. we find that in two objects from our sample, the continuum sourcemust be partially covered regardless of the covering factor of theemission-line source. we discuss these results in the context of the propertiesof absorption lines observed in different types of active galaxies and relatedoutflow phenomena. we cannot distinguish between possible mechanisms for theorigin of the partial coverage signature although we do consider possibleobservational tests. finally, we speculate on how the gas responsible for thenarrow lines may be related to the accretion disk wind that may be responsiblefor the broad absorption lines observed in some quasars.

0706.0515	the kinematic evolution of strong mgii absorbers	we consider the evolution of strong (w_r(2796) &gt; 0.3a) mgii absorbers, mostof which are closely related to luminous galaxies. using 20 high resolutionquasar spectra from the vlt/uves public archive, we examine 33 strong mgiiabsorbers in the redshift range 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. we compare and supplement thissample with 23 strong mgii absorbers at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.4 observed previously withhires/keck. we find that neither equivalent width nor kinematic spread (theoptical depth weighted second moment of velocity) of mgii2796 evolve. however,the kinematic spread is sensitive to the highest velocity component, andtherefore not as sensitive to additional weak components at intermediatevelocities relative to the profile center. the fraction of absorbing pixelswithin the full velocity range of the system does show a trend of decreasingwith decreasing redshift. most high redshift systems (14/20) exhibit absorptionover the entire system velocity range, which differs from the result for lowredshift systems (18/36) at the 95% level. this leads to a smaller number ofseparate subsystems for high redshift systems because weak absorping componentstend to connect the stronger regions of absorption. we hypothesize that lowredshift mgii profiles are more likely to represent well formed galaxies, manyof which have kinematics consistent with a disk/halo structure. high redshiftmgii profiles are more likely to show evidence of complex protogalacticstructures, with multiple accretion or outflow events. although these resultsare derived from measurements of gas kinematics, they are consistent withhierarchical galaxy formation evidenced by deep galaxy surveys.
