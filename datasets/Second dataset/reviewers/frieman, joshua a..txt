0902.3702	cosmological constraints from the sdss maxbcg cluster catalog	we use the abundance and weak lensing mass measurements of the sdss maxbcgcluster catalog to simultaneously constrain cosmology and the richness--massrelation of the clusters. assuming a flat \lambdacdm cosmology, we find\sigma_8(\omega_m/0.25)^{0.41} = 0.832\pm 0.033 after marginalization over allsystematics. in common with previous studies, our error budget is dominated bysystematic uncertainties, the primary two being the absolute mass scale of theweak lensing masses of the maxbcg clusters, and uncertainty in the scatter ofthe richness--mass relation. our constraints are fully consistent with the wmapfive-year data, and in a joint analysis we find \sigma_8=0.807\pm 0.020 and\omega_m=0.265\pm 0.016, an improvement of nearly a factor of two relative towmap5 alone. our results are also in excellent agreement with and comparable inprecision to the latest cosmological constraints from x-ray cluster abundances.the remarkable consistency among these results demonstrates that clusterabundance constraints are not only tight but also robust, and highlight thepower of optically-selected cluster samples to produce precision constraints oncosmological parameters.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0908.2598	the baryonic acoustic feature and large-scale clustering in the sdss lrg  sample	we examine the correlation function \xi of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) luminous red galaxy sample (lrg) at large scales (60&lt;s&lt;400 mpc/h) usingthe final data release (dr7; 105,831 lrgs between 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47). using mockcatalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and largerscale signal are consistent with lcdm at the 1.5\sigma level. the signal at155&lt;s&lt;200 mpc/h tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; thisslight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the lrgs. fittingdata to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain thepeak position at s_p=103.6+3.6-2.4 mpc/h when fitting the range 60&lt;s&lt;150 mpc/h(1\sigma uncertainties measured from the mocks. this redshift-space distances_p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r_s after taking intoaccount matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxyclustering bias. mock catalogs show that the probability that a dr7-sizedsample would not have an identifiable peak is at least 10%. as a consistencycheck of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s_p to obtain the distanced_v=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3) relative to the acoustic scale. we findr_s/d_v(z=0.278)=0.1394+-0.0049. this result is in excellent agreement withpercival et. al (2009), who examine roughly the same data set, but using thepower spectrum. comparison with other determinations in the literature are alsoin very good agreement. we have tested our results against a battery ofpossible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimatedsample variance.

0908.4274	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  hubble diagram and cosmological parameters	we present measurements of the hubble diagram for 103 type ia supernovae(sne) with redshifts 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.42, discovered during the first season (fall2005) of the sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey. these datafill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift sn ia surveys. wecombine the sdss-ii measurements with new distance estimates for published sndata from the essence survey, the supernova legacy survey, the hubble spacetelescope, and a compilation of nearby sn ia measurements. combining the snhubble diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the sdssluminous red galaxy sample and with cmb temperature anisotropy measurementsfrom wmap, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and omega_m, assuming aspatially flat cosmological model (fwcdm) with constant dark energy equation ofstate parameter, w. for the fwcdm model and the combined sample of 288 sne ia,we find w = -0.76 +- 0.07(stat) +- 0.11(syst), omega_m = 0.306 +- 0.019(stat)+- 0.023(syst) using mlcs2k2 and w = -0.96 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.12(syst), omega_m= 0.265 +- 0.016(stat) +- 0.025(syst) using the salt-ii fitter. we trace thediscrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame uv modelcombined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; thesedifferences mostly affect the distance estimates for the snls and hstsupernovae. we present detailed discussions of systematic errors for bothlight-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies inrest-frame $u$-band. for the salt-ii approach, we also see strong evidence forredshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (beta). restricting theanalysis to the 136 sne ia in the nearby+sdss-ii samples, we find much betteragreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties.

0908.4280	snana: a public software package for supernova analysis	we describe a general analysis package for supernova (sn) light curves,called snana, that contains a simulation, light curve fitter, and cosmologyfitter. the software is designed with the primary goal of using sne ia asdistance indicators for the determination of cosmological parameters, but itcan also be used to study efficiencies for analyses of sn rates, estimatecontamination from non-ia sne, and optimize future surveys. several sn modelsare available within the same software architecture, allowing technicalfeatures such as k-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models,and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. new andimproved light-curve models can be easily added. the software works witharbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by severalcollaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. this software isnot intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergocontinual improvements from the community as more is learned about sne. belowwe give an overview of the snana capabilities, as well as some of itslimitations. interested users can find software downloads and more detailedinformation from the manuals at http://www.sdss.org/supernova/snana.html .

0910.5597	type ii-p supernovae from the sdss-ii supernova survey and the  standardized candle method	we apply the standardized candle method (scm) for type ii plateau supernovae(sne ii-p), which relates the velocity of the ejecta of a sn to its luminosityduring the plateau, to 15 sne ii-p discovered over the three season run of thesloan digital sky survey - ii supernova survey. the redshifts of these sne -0.027 &lt; z &lt; 0.144 - cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature;in particular, our sne ii-p sample contains nearly as many sne in the hubbleflow (z &gt; 0.01) as all of the current literature on the scm combined. we findthat the sdss sne have a very small intrinsic i-band dispersion (0.22 mag),which can be attributed to selection effects. when the scm is applied to thecombined sdss-plus-literature set of sne ii-p, the dispersion increases to 0.29mag, larger than the scatter for either set of sne separately. we show that thestandardization cannot be further improved by eliminating sne with positiveplateau decline rates, as proposed in poznanski et al. (2009). we thoroughlyexamine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the scm to beuseful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the fe iivelocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompassthe intrinsic variations of type ii-p sne will be needed.

1001.0738	photometric estimates of redshifts and distance moduli for type ia  supernovae	large planned photometric surveys will discover hundreds of thousands ofsupernovae (sne), outstripping the resources available for spectroscopicfollow-up and necessitating the development of purely photometric methods toexploit these events for cosmological study. we present a light-curve fittingtechnique for sn ia photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation in which theredshift is determined simultaneously with the other fit parameters. weimplement this "lcfit+z" technique within the frameworks of the mlcs2k2 andsalt-ii light-curve fit methods and determine the precision on the redshift anddistance modulus. this method is applied to a spectroscopically confirmedsample of 296 sne ia from the sdss-ii supernova survey and 37 publiclyavailable sne ia from the supernova legacy survey (snls). we have also appliedthe method to a large suite of realistic simulated light curves for existingand planned surveys, including sdss, snls, and lsst. when intrinsic sn colorfluctuations are included, the photo-z precision for the simulation isconsistent with that in the data. finally, we compare the lcfit+z photo-zprecision with previous results using color-based sn photo-z estimates.

1001.3428	the rise and fall of type ia supernova light curves in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we analyze the rise and fall times of type ia supernova (sn ia) light curvesdiscovered by the sdss-ii supernova survey. from a set of 391 light curvesk-corrected to the rest frame b and v bands, we find a smaller dispersion inthe rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. this is inqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations inradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of thedecline rates. the differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggestthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properlymodel the range of sn ia light curve shapes. we select a subset of 105 lightcurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves anddevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall timesindependently. we find the average time from explosion to b-band peakbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days. our average rise time is shorter than the19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different lightcurve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. we findthat slow declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that thedistribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single-peaked. thisdistribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was firstsuggested by strovink (2007) from an analysis of a small set of local sne ia.we divide the sdss-ii sample in half based on the rise minus fall value, tr-tf&lt;= 2 days and tr-tf&gt;2 days, to search for differences in their host galaxyproperties and hubble residuals; we find no difference in host galaxyproperties or hubble residuals in our sample.

1001.4995	measurements of the rate of type ia supernovae at redshift z &lt; ~0.3 from  the sdss-ii supernova survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) ratebased on data from the sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey.the adopted sample of supernovae (sne) includes 516 sne ia at redshift z\lesssim 0.3, of which 270 (52%) are spectroscopically identified as sne ia.the remaining 246 sne ia were identified through their light curves; 113 ofthese objects have spectroscopic redshifts from spectra of their host galaxy,and 133 have photometric redshifts estimated from the sn light curves. based onconsideration of 87 spectroscopically confirmed non-ia sne discovered by thesdss-ii sn survey, we estimate that 2.04+1.61-0.95 % of the photometric sne iamay be misidentified. the sample of sne ia used in this measurement representsan order of magnitude increase in the statistics for sn ia rate measurements inthe redshift range covered by the sdss-ii supernova survey. if we assume a snia rate that is constant at low redshift (z &lt; 0.15), then the sn observationscan be used to infer a value of the sn rate of rv = (2.69+0.34+0.21-0.30-0.01)x10^{-5} sne yr^{-1} mpc-3 (h0 /(70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}))^{3} at a mean redshiftof ~ 0.12, based on 79 sne ia of which 72 are spectroscopically confirmed.however, the large sample of sne ia included in this study allows us to placeconstraints on the redshift dependence of the sn ia rate based on the sdss-iisupernova survey data alone. fitting a power-law model of the sn rateevolution, r_v(z) = a_p x ((1 + z)/(1 + z0))^{\nu}, over the redshift range 0.0&lt; z &lt; 0.3 with z0 = 0.21, results in a_p = (3.43+0.15-0.15) x 10^{-5} sneyr^{-1} mpc-3 (h0 /(70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}))^{3} and \nu = 2.04+0.90-0.89.

1005.2413	galaxy clustering in the completed sdss redshift survey: the dependence  on color and luminosity	we measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in thesdss dr7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation functionw_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. we interpret our measurements using halooccupation distribution (hod) modeling assuming a lambda-cdm cosmology. theamplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for l &lt; l_* and increasessharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(&gt;l)=1.06+0.23(l/l_*)^{1.12}.at fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), atrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. theindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations arestrikingly different. blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)with luminosity, at all scales. the large-scale clustering of red galaxiesshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at l &gt; 4l_*, but thelowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 l_*) show very strong clustering onscales r_p &lt; 2 mpc/h. most of the observed trends can be naturally understoodwithin the lcdm+hod framework. the growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflectsan overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in theminimum host halo mass mmin. the mass at which a halo has, on average, onesatellite galaxy brighter than l is m_1 ~ 17 mmin(l) over most of theluminosity range. the growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxiesreflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in highmass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that isespecially marked at low luminosities. our extensive measurements, provided intabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxyformation, a firm grounding of semi-empirical models of the galaxy population,and new cosmological tests.

1005.4687	the effect of host galaxies on type ia supernovae in the sdss-ii  supernova survey	we present an analysis of the host galaxy dependencies of type ia supernovae(sne ia) from the full three year sample of the sdss-ii supernova survey. werediscover, to high significance, the strong correlation between host galaxytypeand the width of the observed sn light curve, i.e., fainter, quicklydeclining sne ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly decliningia's favor star-forming galaxies. we also find evidence (at between 2 to 3sigma) that sne ia are ~0.1 magnitudes brighter in passive host galaxies, thanin star-forming hosts, after the sn ia light curves have been standardizedusing the light curve shape and color variations: this difference in brightnessis present in both the salt2 and mcls2k2 light curve fitting methodologies. wesee evidence for differences in the sn ia color relationship between passiveand star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the mlcs2k2 technique, we see thatsne ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of r_v ~1, while sne ia instar-forming hosts require r_v ~2. the significance of these trends depends onthe range of sn colors considered. we demonstrate that these effects can beparameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a confidence of&gt;4 sigma) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical fitto our data. our results suggest that future cosmological analyses of sn iasamples should include host galaxy information.

1008.4797	single or double degenerate progenitors? searching for shock emission in  the sdss-ii type ia supernovae	from the set of nearly 500 spectroscopically confirmed type~ia supernovae andaround 10,000 unconfirmed candidates from sdss-ii, we select a subset of 108confirmed sne ia with well-observed early-time light curves to search forsignatures from shock interaction of the supernova with a companion star. noevidence for shock emission is seen; however, the cadence and photometric noisecould hide a weak shock signal. we simulate shocked light curves using sn iatemplates and a simple, gaussian shock model to emulate the noise properties ofthe sdss-ii sample and estimate the detectability of the shock interactionsignal as a function of shock amplitude, shock width, and shock fraction. wefind no direct evidence for shock interaction in the rest-frame $b$-band, butplace an upper limit on the shock amplitude at 9% of supernova peak flux ($m_b&gt; -16.6$ mag). if the single degenerate channel dominates type~ia progenitors,this result constrains the companion stars to be less than about 6 $m_{\odot}$on the main sequence, and strongly disfavors red giant companions.

1010.2749	a mismatch in the ultraviolet spectra between low-redshift and  intermediate-redshift type ia supernovae as a possible systematic uncertainty  for supernova cosmology	we present keck high-quality rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) through opticalspectra of 21 type ia supernovae (sne ia) in the redshift range 0.11 &lt; z &lt; 0.37and a mean redshift of 0.22 that were discovered during the sloan digital skysurvey-ii (sdss-ii) sn survey. using the broad-band photometry of the sdsssurvey, we are able to reconstruct the sn host-galaxy spectral energydistributions (seds), allowing for a correction for the host-galaxycontamination in the sn ia spectra. comparison of composite spectra constructedfrom a subsample of 17 high-quality spectra to those created from alow-redshift sample with otherwise similar properties shows that the keck/sdsssne ia have, on average, extremely similar rest-frame optical spectra but showa uv flux excess. this observation is confirmed by comparing synthesizedbroad-band colors of the individual spectra, showing a difference in meancolors at the 2.4 - 4.4 sigma level for various uv colors. we further see aslight difference in the uv spectral shape between sne with low-mass andhigh-mass host galaxies. additionally, we detect a relationship between theflux ratio at 2770 and 2900 a and peak luminosity that differs from thatobserved at low redshift. we find that changing the uv sed of an sn ia withinthe observed dispersion can change the inferred distance moduli by ~0.1 mag.this effect only occurs when the data probe the rest-frame uv. we suggest thatthis discrepancy could be due to differences in the host-galaxy population ofthe two sn samples or to small-sample statistics.

0709.1153	cross-correlation weak lensing of sdss galaxy clusters i: measurements	this is the first in a series of papers on the weak lensing effect caused byclusters of galaxies in sloan digital sky survey. the photometrically selectedcluster sample, known as maxbcg, includes ~130,000 objects between redshift 0.1and 0.3, ranging in size from small groups to massive clusters. we split theclusters into bins of richness and luminosity and stack the surface densitycontrast to produce mean radial profiles. the mean profiles are detected over arange of scales, from the inner halo (25 kpc/h) well into the surrounding largescale structure (30 mpc/h), with a significance of 15 to 20 in each bin. thesignal over this large range of scales is best interpreted in terms of thecluster-mass cross-correlation function. we pay careful attention to sources ofsystematic error, correcting for them where possible. the resulting signals arecalibrated to the ~10% level, with the dominant remaining uncertainty being theredshift distribution of the background sources. we find that the profilesscale strongly with richness and luminosity. we find the signal within a givenrichness bin depends upon luminosity, suggesting that luminosity is moreclosely correlated with mass than galaxy counts. we split the samples byredshift but detect no significant evolution. the profiles are not welldescribed by power laws. in a subsequent series of papers we invert theprofiles to three-dimensional mass profiles, show that they are well fit by ahalo model description, measure mass-to-light ratios and provide a cosmologicalinterpretation.

0709.1162	cross-correlation weak lensing of sdss galaxy clusters iii:  mass-to-light ratios	we present measurements of the excess mass-to-light ratio measuredaroundmaxbcg galaxy clusters observed in the sdss. this red sequence clustersample includes objects from small groups with masses ranging from ~5x10^{12}to ~10^{15} m_{sun}/h. using cross-correlation weak lensing, we measure theexcess mass density profile above the universal mean \delta \rho(r) = \rho(r) -\bar{\rho} for clusters in bins of richness and optical luminosity. we alsomeasure the excess luminosity density \delta l(r) = l(r) - \bar{l} measured inthe z=0.25 i-band. for both mass and light, we de-project the profiles toproduce 3d mass and light profiles over scales from 25 kpc/ to 22 mpc/h. fromthese profiles we calculate the cumulative excess mass m(r) and excess lightl(r) as a function of separation from the bcg. on small scales, where \rho(r)&gt;&gt; \bar{\rho}, the integrated mass-to-light profile may be interpreted as thecluster mass-to-light ratio. we find the m/l_{200}, the mass-to-light ratiowithin r_{200}, scales with cluster mass as a power law with index 0.33+/-0.02.on large scales, where \rho(r) ~ \bar{\rho}, the m/l approaches an asymptoticvalue independent of cluster richness. for small groups, the mean m/l_{200} ismuch smaller than the asymptotic value, while for large clusters it isconsistent with the asymptotic value. this asymptotic value should beproportional to the mean mass-to-light ratio of the universe &lt;m/l&gt;. we find&lt;m/l&gt;/b^2_{ml} = 362+/-54 h (statistical). there is additional uncertainty inthe overall calibration at the ~10% level. the parameter b_{ml} is primarily afunction of the bias of the l &lt;~ l_* galaxies used as light tracers, and shouldbe of order unity. multiplying by the luminosity density in the same bandpasswe find \omega_m/b^2_{ml} = 0.02+/-0.03, independent of the hubble parameter.

1103.2497	line profiles of intermediate redshift type ia supernovae	we present the temporal evolution of line profiles ranging from nearultraviolet to optical wavelengths by analyzing 59 subaru telescope spectra ofnormal type ia supernovae (sne ia) in the intermediate redshift range (0.05 &lt; z&lt; 0.4) discovered by the sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernovasurvey. we derive line velocities, peak wavelengths and pseudo-equivalentwidths (pews) of these lines. additionally, we compare the line profiles aroundthe date of maximum brightness with those from their nearby counterparts. wefind that line profiles represented by their velocities and pews forintermediate redshift sne ia are consistent with their nearby counterpartswithin 2 $\sigma$. these findings support the picture that sne ia are a"standard" candle for the intermediate redshift range as has been shown betweensne ia at nearby and high redshifts. there is a hint that the "mgii \lambda4300" pew distribution for intermediate redshift sne ia is larger than for thenearby sample, which could be interpreted as a difference in the progenitorabundance.

1110.5517	spectroscopic properties of star-forming host galaxies and type ia  supernova hubble residuals in a nearly unbiased sample	we examine the correlation between supernova host galaxy properties and theirresiduals on the hubble diagram. we use supernovae discovered during the sloandigital sky survey ii - supernova survey, and focus on objects at a redshift ofz &lt; 0.15, where the selection effects of the survey are known to yield acomplete type ia supernova sample. to minimize the bias in our analysis withrespect to measured host-galaxy properties, spectra were obtained for nearlyall hosts, spanning a range in magnitude of -23 &lt; m_r &lt; -17. in contrast toprevious works that use photometric estimates of host mass as a proxy forglobal metallicity, we analyze host-galaxy spectra to obtain gas-phasemetallicities and star-formation rates from host galaxies with active starformation. from a final sample of ~ 40 emission-line galaxies, we find thatlight-curve corrected type ia supernovae are ~ 0.1 magnitudes brighter inhigh-metallicity hosts than in low-metallicity hosts. we also find asignificant (&gt; 3{\sigma}) correlation between the hubble residuals of type iasupernovae and the specific star-formation rate of the host galaxy. we commenton the importance of supernova/host-galaxy correlations as a source ofsystematic bias in future deep supernova surveys.

1202.2716	semi-empirical catalog of early-type galaxy-halo systems: dark matter  density profiles, halo contraction and dark matter annihilation strength	with sdss galaxy data and halo data from up-to-date n-body simulations weconstruct a semi-empirical catalog (sec) of early-type systems by making aself-consistent bivariate statistical match of stellar mass (m_star) andvelocity dispersion (sigma) with halo virial mass (m_vir). we then assignstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each systemin the sec using their observed correlations with m_star and sigma.simultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using thespherical jeans equation. the resulting dark matter density profiles deviate ingeneral from the dissipationless profile of nfw or einasto and their mean innerdensity slope and concentration vary systematically with m_vir. statisticaltests of the distribution of profiles at fixed m_vir rule out the nullhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by n-body simulations form_vir ~&lt; 10^{13.5-14.5} m_solar. these dark matter profiles imply that darkmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region ofhalos with m_vir ~&lt; 10^{13.5-14.5} m_solar supporting halo contraction. themain characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter densitywithin the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically upto ~ 3-4 at m_vir = 10^{12} m_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a meanof &lt;alpha&gt; ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter ofrms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} m_solar ~&lt; m_vir ~&lt; 10^{13-14} m_solar steeperthan the nfw profile (alpha=1). based on our results we predict that halos ofnearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies can, in principle, be promisingtargets for gamma-ray emission from dark matter annihilation.

1203.1088	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. vi. constraints on dark  energy and the evolution of massive galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the final lens sample from the sloandigital sky survey quasar lens search (sqls). the number distribution of acomplete subsample of 19 lensed quasars selected from 50,836 source quasars iscompared with theoretical expectations, with particular attention to theselection function. assuming that the velocity function of galaxies does notevolve with redshift, the sqls sample constrains the cosmological constant to\omega_\lambda=0.79^{+0.06}_{-0.07}(stat.)^{+0.06}_{-0.06}(syst.) for a flatuniverse. the dark energy equation of state is found to be consistent with w=-1when the sqls is combined with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) measurements or results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap). we also obtain simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters andredshift evolution of the galaxy velocity function, finding no evidence forredshift evolution at z&lt;1 in any combinations of constraints. for instance,number density evolution quantified as \nu_n=d\ln\phi_*/d\ln(1+z) and thevelocity dispersion evolution \nu_\sigma=d\ln\sigma_*/d\ln(1+z) are constrainedto \nu_n=1.06^{+1.36}_{-1.39}(stat.)^{+0.33}_{-0.64}(syst.) and\nu_\sigma=-0.05^{+0.19}_{-0.16}(stat.)^{+0.03}_{-0.03}(syst.) respectivelywhen the sqls result is combined with bao and wmap for flat models with acosmological constant. we find that a significant amount of dark energy ispreferred even after fully marginalizing over the galaxy evolution parameters.thus the statistics of lensed quasars robustly confirm the accelerated cosmicexpansion.

1206.5320	the impact of camera optical alignments on weak lensing measures for the  dark energy survey	telescope point spread function (psf) quality is critical for realising thepotential of cosmic weak lensing observations to constrain dark energy and testgeneral relativity. in this paper we use quantitative weak gravitationallensing measures to inform the precision of lens optical alignment, withspecific reference to the dark energy survey (des). we compute optics spotdiagrams and calculate the shear and flexion of the psf as a function ofposition on the focal plane. for perfect optical alignment we verify the highquality of the des optical design, finding a maximum psf contribution to theweak lensing shear of 0.04 near the edge of the focal plane. however this canbe increased by a factor of approximately three if the lenses are only justaligned within their maximum specified tolerances. we calculate the e andb-mode shear and flexion variance as a function of de-centre or tilt of eachlens in turn. we find tilt accuracy to be a few times more important thande-centre, depending on the lens considered. finally we consider the compoundeffect of de-centre and tilt of multiple lenses simultaneously, by samplingfrom a plausible range of values of each parameter. we find that the compoundeffect can be around twice as detrimental as when considering any one lensalone. furthermore, this combined effect changes the conclusions about whichlens is most important to align accurately. for des, the tilt of the first twolenses is the most important.

1211.4480	cosmology with photometrically-classified type ia supernovae from the  sdss-ii supernova survey	we present the cosmological analysis of 752 photometrically-classified typeia supernovae (sne ia) obtained from the full sloan digital sky survey ii(sdss-ii) supernova (sn) survey, supplemented with host-galaxy spectroscopyfrom the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). ourphotometric-classification method is based on the sn typing technique of sakoet al. (2011), aided by host galaxy redshifts (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.55). snana simulationsof our methodology estimate that we have a sn ia typing efficiency of 70.8%,with only 3.9% contamination from core-collapse (non-ia) sne. we demonstratethat this level of contamination has no effect on our cosmological constraints.we quantify and correct for our selection effects (e.g., malmquist bias) usingsimulations. when fitting to a flat lambdacdm cosmological model, we find thatour photometric sample alone gives omega_m=0.24+0.07-0.05 (statistical errorsonly). if we relax the constraint on flatness, then our sample providescompetitive joint statistical constraints on omega_m and omega_lambda,comparable to those derived from the spectroscopically-confirmed three-yearsupernova legacy survey (snls3). using only our data, the statistics-onlyresult favors an accelerating universe at 99.96% confidence. assuming aconstant wcdm cosmological model, and combining with h0, cmb and lrg data, weobtain w=-0.96+0.10-0.10, omega_m=0.29+0.02-0.02 and omega_k=0.00+0.03-0.02(statistical errors only), which is competitive with similar spectroscopicallyconfirmed sne ia analyses. overall this comparison is re-assuring, consideringthe lower redshift leverage of the sdss-ii sn sample (z&lt;0.55) and the lack ofspectroscopic confirmation used herein. these results demonstrate the potentialof photometrically-classified sne ia samples in improving cosmologicalconstraints.

1304.6431	properties of type ia supernovae inside rich galaxy clusters	we used the gmbcg galaxy cluster catalogue and sdss-ii supernovae data withredshifts measured by the boss project to identify 48 sne ia residing in richgalaxy clusters and compare their properties with 1015 sne ia in the field.their light curves were parametrised by the salt2 model and the significance ofthe observed differences was assessed by a resampling technique. to test oursamples and methods, we first looked for known differences between sne iaresiding in active and passive galaxies. we confirm that passive galaxies hostsne ia with smaller stretch, weaker colour-luminosity relation [$\beta$ of2.54(22) against 3.35(14)], and that are $\sim$ 0.1 mag more luminous afterstretch and colour corrections. we show that only 0.02 per cent of randomsamples drawn from our set of sne ia in active galaxies can reach these values.reported differences in the hubble residuals scatter could not be detected,possibly due to the exclusion of outliers. we then show that, while most fieldand cluster sne ia properties are compatible at the current level, theirstretch distributions are different ($\sim3\sigma$): besides having a higherconcentration of passive galaxies than the field, the cluster's passivegalaxies host sne ia with an average stretch even smaller than those in fieldpassive galaxies (at 95 per cent confidence). we argue that the older age ofpassive galaxies in clusters is responsible for this effect since, as we show,old passive galaxies host sne ia with smaller stretch than young passivegalaxies ($\sim4\sigma$).

1307.8062	optimising spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys: same-sky  benefits for dark energy and modified gravity	the combination of multiple cosmological probes can produce measurements ofcosmological parameters much more stringent than those possible with anyindividual probe. we examine the combination of two highly correlated probes oflate-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey withphotometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortionsfrom a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. we choose generic survey designs sothat our results are applicable to a range of current and future photometricredshift (e.g. kids, des, hsc, euclid) and spectroscopic redshift (e.g. desi,4most, sumire) surveys. combining the surveys greatly improves their power tomeasure both dark energy and modified gravity. an independent, non-overlappingcombination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than 4 times larger thanthat produced by either survey alone. the powerful synergies between thesurveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints areorthogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly 2 ordersof magnitude larger than either alone. our projected angular power spectrumformalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when thesurveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariancematrix. we calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of thesecross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. we find nearly afactor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity.the exact forecast figures of merit and same-sky benefits can be radicallyaffected by a range of forecasts assumption, which we explore methodically in asensitivity analysis. we show that that our fiducial assumptions produce robustresults which give a good average picture of the science return from combiningphotometric and spectroscopic surveys.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0108013	galaxy mass and luminosity scaling laws determined by weak gravitational  lensing	we present new measurements of scaling laws relating the luminosity ofgalaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. early imagingand spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to make weaklensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast delta sigma_+ aroundclasses of lens objects. this surface mass density contrast as a function ofradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (gmcf). becausespectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass anddistance scales are well constrained. the gmcf measured around ~31,000 lensesis well fit by a power law of the form  delta sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (r/1 mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h m_sun pc^-2.  we compare this gmcf to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and findthat it varies strongly with all three. we quantify these variations bycomparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, m_260, to thegalaxy luminosity. while m_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluestband u', there is a simple, linear relation between m_260 and luminosity inredder bands (g', r', i', and z'). we test the universality of thesemass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral andelliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. we findremarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'and z'. this consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that themeasured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that theintegrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the darkmatter environments in which they form.

astro-ph;0111058	higher order moments of the angular distribution of galaxies from early  sdss data	we present initial results for counts in cells statistics of the angulardistribution of galaxies in early data from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). we analyze a rectangular stripe $2.5^\circ$ wide, coveringapproximately 160 sq. degrees, containing over $10^6$ galaxies in the apparentmagnitude range $18 &lt; r^\prime &lt; 22$, with areas of bad seeing, contaminationfrom bright stars, ghosts, and high galactic extinction masked out. this surveyregion, which forms part of the sdss early data release, is the same as thatfor which two-point angular clustering statistics have recently been computed.the third and fourth moments of the cell counts, $s_3$ (skewness) and $s_4$(kurtosis), constitute the most accurate measurements to date of thesequantities (for $r^\prime &lt; 21$) over angular scales $0.015^\circ-0.3^\circ$.they display the approximate hierarchical scaling expected from non-linearstructure formation models and are in reasonable agreement with the predictionsof $\lambda$-dominated cold dark matter models with galaxy biasing thatsuppresses higher order correlations at small scales. the results are ingeneral consistent with previous measurements in the apm, edsgc, and deeprangesurveys. these results suggest that the sdss imaging data are free ofsystematics to a high degree and will therefore enable determination of theskewness and kurtosis to 1% and less then 10%, as predicted by colombi,szapudi, &amp; szalay (1998).

astro-ph;0208100	probing dark energy with supernovae: exploiting complementarity with the  cosmic microwave background	a primary goal for cosmology and particle physics over the coming decade willbe to unravel the nature of the dark energy that drives the acceleratedexpansion of the universe. in particular, determination of theequation-of-state of dark energy, w equivalent p/rho, and its time variation,dw/dz, will be critical for developing theoretical understanding of the newphysics behind this phenomenon. type ia supernovae (sne) and cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropy are each sensitive to the dark energyequation-of-state. sne alone can determine w(z) with some precision, while cmbanisotropy alone cannot because of a strong degeneracy between the matterdensity omega_m and w. however, we show that the planck cmb mission cansignificantly improve the power of a deep sne survey to probe w and especiallydw/dz. because cmb constraints are nearly orthogonal to sne constraints in theomega_m-w plane, for constraining w(z) planck is more useful than precisedetermination of omega_m. we discuss how the cmb/sne complementarity impactsstrategies for the redshift distribution of a supernova survey to determinew(z) and conclude that a well-designed sample should include a substantialnumber of supernovae out to redshifts z ~ 2.

astro-ph;0301280	on departures from a power law in the galaxy correlation function	we measure the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) from the sloan digitalsky survey for a flux-limited sample of 118,000 galaxies and for a volumelimited subset of 22,000 galaxies with absolute magnitude m_r&lt;-21. bothcorrelation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fitpower law, in particular a change in slope at r_p~1-2 mpc/h. these departuresare stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relativelyluminous galaxies. we show that the inflection point in w_p(r_p) can benaturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according towhich it marks the transition from a large scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in separate dark matter halos to a small scale regime dominated by galaxypairs in the same dark matter halo. for example, given the dark halo populationpredicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projectedcorrelation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by amodel in which the mean number of m_r&lt;-21 galaxies in a halo of mass m&gt;m_1=4.74x 10^{13}\msun/h is &lt;n&gt;_m=(m/m_1)^{0.89}, with 75% of the galaxies residing inless massive, single-galaxy halos. this physically motivated model has the samenumber of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the w_p(r_p) data better,with a \chi^2/d.o.f.=0.93 compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom,incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). departuresfrom a power-law correlation function encode information about the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter halos. higher precision measurements of thesedepartures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias andprovide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0401578	halo model analysis of cluster statistics	we use the halo model formalism to provide expressions for cluster abundancesand bias, as well as estimates for the correlation matrix between theseobservables. off-diagonal elements due to scatter in the mass tracer scalingwith mass are included, as are observational effects such as biases/scatter inthe data, detection rates (completeness), and false detections (purity). weapply the formalism to a hypothetical volume limited optical survey where thecluster mass tracer is chosen to be the number of member galaxies assigned to acluster. such a survey can strongly constrain $\sigma_8$($\delta\sigma_8\approx 0.05$), the power law index $\alpha$ where$&lt;n_{gal}|m&gt;= 1+(m/m_1)^\alpha$ ($\delta\alpha\approx0.03$), and perhaps eventhe hubble parameter ($\delta h\approx 0.07$). we find cluster abundances andbias not well suited for constraining $\omega_m$ or the amplitude $m_1$. wealso find that without bias information $\sigma_8$ and $\alpha$ are degenerate,implying constraints on the former are strongly dependent on priors used forthe latter and vice-versa. the degeneracy stems from an intrinsic scalingrelation of the halo mass function, and hence it should be present regardlessof the mass tracer used in the survey.

astro-ph;0402080	probing the evolution of the dark energy density with future supernova  surveys	the time dependence of the dark energy density can be an important clue tothe nature of dark energy in the universe. we show that future supernova datafrom dedicated telescopes (such as snap), when combined with data of nearbysupernovae, can be used to determine how the dark energy density $\rho_x(z)$depends on redshift, if $\rho_x(z)$ is not too close to a constant. forquantitative comparison, we have done an extensive study of a number of darkenergy models. based on these models we have simulated data sets in order toshow that we can indeed reconstruct the correct sign of the time dependence ofthe dark energy density, outside of a degeneracy region centered on $1+w_0 =-w_1 z_{max}/3$ (where $z_{max}$ is the maximum redshift of the survey, e.g.,$z_{max}=1.7$ for snap). we emphasize that, given the same data, one can obtainmuch more information about the dark energy density directly (and its timedependence) than about its equation of state.

astro-ph;0408003	cosmology and the halo occupation distribution from small-scale galaxy  clustering in the sloan digital sky survey	we use the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) of a volume-limitedsubsample of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy redshift catalogueto measure the halo occupation distribution (hod) of the galaxies of thesample. simultaneously, we allow the cosmology to vary within cosmologicalconstraints imposed by cosmic microwave background experiments in a lambda-cdmmodel. we find that combining w_p(r_p) for this sample alone with theobservations by wmap, acbar, cbi and vsa can provide one of the most precisetechniques available to measure cosmological parameters. for a minimal flatsix-parameter lambda-cdm model with an hod with three free parameters, we findomega_m=0.278^{+0.027}_{-0.027}, sigma_8=0.812^{+0.028}_{-0.027}, andh_0=69.8^{+2.6}_{-2.6}km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}; these errors are significantlysmaller than from cmb alone and similar to those obtained by combining cmb withthe large-scale galaxy power spectrum assuming scale-independent bias. thecorresponding hod parameters describing the minimum halo mass and thenormalization and cut-off of the satellite mean occupation arem_min=(3.03^{+0.36}_{-0.36})x 10^{12} h^{-1} m_sun, m_1 =(4.58^{+0.60}_{-0.60})x 10^{13} h^{-1} m_sun, and kappa=4.44^{+0.51}_{-0.69}.when more parameters are added to the hod model, the error bars on the hodparameters increase because of degeneracies, but the error bars on thecosmological parameters do not increase greatly. similar modeling for othergalaxy samples could reduce the statistical errors on these results, while morethorough investigations of the cosmology dependence of nonlinear halo bias andhalo mass functions are needed to eliminate remaining systematic uncertainties,which may be comparable to statistical uncertainties.

astro-ph;9301011	minimal microwave anisotropy from perturbations induced at late times	aside from primordial gravitational instability of the cosmological fluid,various mechanisms have been proposed to generate large-scale structure atrelatively late times, including, e.g., ``late-time'' cosmological phasetransitions. in these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearlyhomogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidlysometime after the primordial plasma recombines. on this basis, it wassuggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leavingrelatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (mbr) anisotropy.in this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level ofinhomogeneity observed at present. since the growth of the inhomogeneityinvolves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generatesignificant mbr anisotropy via the sachs-wolfe effect. moreover, we show thatthe large-angle mbr anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growthof inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the sameinhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. in ``realistic'' scenariosone can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabaticfluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. the value of anyparticular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, butonly by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently``pathological''.

astro-ph;9306018	the three-point function as a probe of models for large-scale structure	we analyze the consequences of models of structure formation for higher-order($n$-point) galaxy correlation functions in the mildly non-linear regime.several variations of the standard $\omega=1$ cold dark matter model withscale-invariant primordial perturbations have recently been introduced toobtain more power on large scales, 20 h$^{-1}$ mpc, e.g., low-matter-density(non-zero cosmological constant) models, `tilted' primordial spectra, andscenarios with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter. they also include modelswith an effective scale-dependent bias, such as the cooperative galaxyformation scenario of bower, etal. (1993). we show that higher-order galaxycorrelation functions can provide a useful test of such models and candiscriminate between models with true large-scale power in the density fieldand those where the galaxy power arises from scale-dependent bias: a bias withrapid scale-dependence leads to a dramatic decrease of the hierarchicalamplitudes at large scales. current observational constraints on thethree-point amplitudes $q_3$ and $s_3$ can place limits on the biasparameter(s) and appear to disfavor, but not yet rule out, the hypothesis thatscale-dependent bias is responsible for the extra power observed on largescales.

astro-ph;9608068	weak lensing and the measurement of q0 from type ia supernovae	on-going projects to discover type ia supernovae at redshifts z = 0.3 - 1,coupled with improved techniques to narrow the dispersion in sn ia peakmagnitudes, have renewed the prospects for determining the cosmic decelerationparameter q_0. we estimate the expected uncertainty in the hubble diagramdetermination of q_0 due to weak lensing by structure in the universe, whichstochastically shifts the apparent brightness of distant standard candles.although the results are sensitive to the density power spectrum on smallscales, the induced flux dispersion sigma_m &lt; 0.04 omega_{m,0}^{1/2} mag forsources at z \leq 0.5, well below the ``intrinsic" spread of nearby sn iamagnitudes, sigma_m \simeq 0.2 mag. thus, density inhomogeneities do notsignificantly impact the current program to measure q_0, in contrast to arecent claim. if, however, light-curve shape and other calibrators can reducethe effective intrinsic spread to 0.1 mag at high z, then weak lensing couldincrease the observed spread by 30% in an omega_{m,0}=1 universe for sne at z &gt;1.

astro-ph;9704075	non-linear evolution of the bispectrum of cosmological perturbations	the bispectrum, the three-point function of density fluctuations in fourierspace, is the lowest order statistic that carries information about the spatialcoherence of large-scale structures. for gaussian initial conditions, when thedensity fluctuation amplitude is small, tree-level (leading order) perturbationtheory predicts a characteristic dependence of the bispectrum on the shape ofthe triangle formed by the three wave vectors. this configuration dependenceprovides a signature of gravitational instability, and departures from it ingalaxy catalogs can be interpreted as due to bias, that is, non-gravitationaleffects. on the other hand, n-body simulations indicate that the reducedthree-point function becomes relatively shape-independent in the stronglynon-linear regime. in order to understand this non-linear transition and assessthe domain of reliability of shape-dependence as a probe of bias, we calculatethe one-loop (next-to-leading order) corrections to the bispectrum inperturbation theory. we compare these results with measurements in numericalsimulations with scale-free and cdm initial power spectra. we find that theone-loop corrections account very well for the departures from the tree-levelresults measured in numerical simulations on weakly non-linear scales. in thisregime, the reduced bispectrum qualitatively retains its tree-level shape, butthe amplitude can change significantly. at smaller scales, the reducedbispectrum in the simulations starts to flatten, an effect which can bepartially understood from the one-loop results. in the strong clusteringregime, where perturbation theory breaks down entirely, the simulation resultsconfirm that the reduced bispectrum has almost no dependence on triangle shape,in rough agreement with the hierarchical ansatz.

0809.4475	discovery of a very bright, strongly-lensed z=2 galaxy in the sdss dr5	we report on the discovery of a very bright z = 2.00 star-forming galaxy thatis strongly lensed by a foreground z=0.422 luminous red galaxy (lrg). thissystem was found in a systematic search for bright arcs lensed by lrgs andbrightest cluster galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey data release 5sample. follow-up observations on the subaru 8.2m telescope on mauna kea andthe astrophysical research consortium 3.5m telescope at apache pointobservatory confirmed the lensing nature of this system. a simple lens modelfor the system, assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution,yields an einstein radius of 3.82 +/- 0.03 arcsec or 14.8 +/- 0.1 kpc/h at thelens redshift. the total projected mass enclosed within the einstein radius is2.10 +/- 0.03 x 10^12 m_sun/h, and the magnification factor for the sourcegalaxy is 27 +/- 1. combining the lens model with our gvriz photometry, we findan (unlensed) star formation rate for the source galaxy of 32 m_sun/h / yr,adopting a fiducial constant star formation rate model with an age of 100 myrand e(b-v) = 0.25. with an apparent magnitude of r = 19.9, this system is amongthe very brightest lensed z &gt;= 2 galaxies, and provides an excellentopportunity to pursue detailed studies of the physical properties of anindividual high-redshift star-forming galaxy.

hep-ph;9208239	large- and small-scale constraints on power spectra in $\omega=1$  universes	the cold dark matter (cdm) model of structure formation, normalized on largescales, leads to excessive pairwise velocity dispersions on small scales. in anattempt to circumvent this problem, we study three scenarios (all with$\omega=1$) which have more large-scale power and less small-scale power thanthe cdm model: 1) an admixture of cold and hot dark matter; 2) cold dark matterwith a non-scale-invariant, power-law primordial power spectrum; and 3) colddark matter with coupling of dark matter to a long-range vector field. despitethe {reduced} small-scale power, when such models are evolved in the nonlinearregime to large amplitude, the velocities on small scales are actually {\itincreased} over cdm with the same value of $\sigma_8$. this `flip-over', indisagreement with the expectation from linear perturbation theory, arises fromthe nonlinear coupling of the extra power on large scales with shorterwavelengths. however, due to the extra large-scale power, the recent cobe dmrresults indicate smaller amplitudes for these models, $\sigma_8 \sim 0.5 -0.7$, than for cdm (for which $\sigma_8 \sim 1.2$). therefore, when normalizedto cobe on large scales, such models do lead to reduced velocities on smallscales and they produce fewer halos compared with cdm. quantitatively it seems,however, that models that produce sufficiently low small-scale velocities failto produce an adequate distribution of halos.
