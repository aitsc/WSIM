0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0707.0937	vlt observations of the central compact object in the vela jr. supernova  remnant	x-ray observations have unveiled the existence of enigmatic point-likesources at the center of young (a few kyrs) supernova remnants. these sources,known as central compact objects (ccos), are thought to be neutron starsproduced by the supernova explosion, although their x-ray phenomenology makesthem markedly different from all the other young neutron stars discovered sofar.the aim of this work is to search for the optical/ir counterpart of thevela junior cco and to understand the nature of the associated halpha nebuladiscovered by pellizzoni et al. (2002).}{we have used deep optical (r band) andir (j,h,ks bands) observations recently performed by our group with the eso vltto obtain the first deep, high resolution images of the field with the goal ofresolving the nebula structure and pinpointing a point-like source possiblyassociated with the neutron star.our r-band image shows that both the nebula'sflux and its structure are very similar to the halpha ones, suggesting that thenebula spectrum is dominated by pure halpha line emission. however, the nebulais not detected in our ir observations, whick makes it impossible to toconstrain its spectrum. a faint point-like object (j&gt;22.6, h~21.6, ks ~ 21.4)compatible with the neutron star's chandra x-ray position is detected in our irimages (h and ks) but not in the optical one (r &gt; 25.6), where it is buried bythe nebula background. the nebula is most likely a bow-shock produced by theneutron star motion through the ism or, alternatively, a photo-ionizationnebula powered by uv radiation from a hot neutron star.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1009.5539	study of the gamma-ray source 1agl j2022+4032 in the cygnus region	identification of gamma-ray-emitting galactic sources is a long-standingproblem in astrophysics. one such source, 1agl j2022+4032, coincident with theinterior of the radio shell of the supernova remnant gamma cygni (snrg78.2+2.1) in the cygnus region, has recently been identified by fermi as agamma-ray pulsar, lat psr j2021+4026. we present long-term observations of 1aglj2022+4032 with the agile gamma-ray telescope, measuring its flux and lightcurve. we compare the light curve of 1agl j2022+4032 with that of 1aglj2021+3652 (psr j2021+3651), showing that the flux variability of 1aglj2022+4032 appears to be greater than the level predicted from statistical andsystematic effects and producing detailed simulations to estimate theprobability of the apparent observed variability. we evaluate the possibilitythat the gamma-ray emission may be due to the superposition of two or morepoint sources, some of which may be variable, considering a number of possiblecounterparts. we consider the possibility of a nearby x-ray quiet microquasarcontributing to the flux of 1agl j2022+4032 to be more likely than thehypotheses of a background blazar or intrinsic gamma-ray variabilty of lat psrj2021+4026.

1101.5100	x-ray and optical observations of the closest isolated radio pulsar	with a parallactic distance of 170 pc, psr j2144-3933 is the closest isolatedradio pulsar currently known. it is also the slowest (p = 8.51 s) and leastenergetic (edot = 2.6e28 erg/s) radio pulsar; its radio emission is difficultto account for with standard pulsar models, since the position of psrj2144-3933 in the period-period derivative diagram is far beyond the typicalradio `death lines'. here we present the first deep x-ray and opticalobservations of psr j2144-3933, performed in 2009 with xmm-newton and europeansouthern observatory (eso)/very large telescope (vlt), from which we derive,assuming a blackbody emission spectrum, a surface temperature upper limit of2.3e5 k for a 13 km radius neutron star, 4.4e5 k for a 500 m radius hot spotand 1.9e6 k for a 10 m radius polar cap. in addition, our non-detection of psrj2144-3933 constrains its non-thermal luminosity to be &lt;30 per cent and &lt;2 percent of the pulsar rotational energy loss in the 0.5-2 kev x-ray band and inthe b optical band, respectively.

1102.4754	detection of continuum radio emission associated with geminga	a deep very large array observation of the geminga pulsar field led to thediscovery, at a higher than 10 sigma significance level, of radio emissiontrailing the neutron star proper motion. this 10-arcsec-long radio feature,detected with a flux of 0.4 mjy at 4.8 ghz, is marginally displaced (2.7\pm1.8arcsec) from the pulsar (which, at any rate, is unlikely to contribute withmagnetospheric pulsed emission more than 15% to the total observed radioluminosity, about 1e26 erg/s) and positionally coincident with the x-ray axialtail recently discovered by chandra and ascribed to the pulsar wind nebula(pwn). overall, the geminga radio tail is compatible with the scenario of asynchrotron-emitting pwn, but the present data do not allow us to discriminatebetween different (and not always necessarily mutually exclusive) possibleprocesses for producing that. if this radio feature does not result fromintrinsic peculiarities of geminga, but its proximity and radio-quiet nature(both helping in not hindering the faint diffuse radio emission), otherrelatively near and energetic radio-quiet pulsars could show similar structuresin dedicated interferometric observations.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1207.6288	the agile monitoring of cygnus x-3: transient gamma-ray emission and  spectral constraints	we present the agile-grid monitoring of cygnus x-3, during the period betweennovember 2007 and july 2009. we report here the whole agile-grid monitoring ofcygnus x-3 in the agile "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that thegamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern ofmultiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrumby assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. seven intense gamma-rayevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or twodays. these durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-rayemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than theresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid whichthen cools as it propagates outwards. cross-correlating the agile-grid lightcurve with x-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events ofgamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectralx-ray states (rxte/asm count rate &gt; 3 counts/s), that coincide with local andoften sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux (swift/bat count rate &lt; 0.02counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] thesegamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of theaccretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jetand subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] finally, we examine leptonic andhadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenariosare valid. in the leptonic model - based on inverse compton scatterings ofmildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the wolf-rayet companionstar and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contributeto the overall hard x-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermalpower-law tail sometimes seen during special soft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1310.4029	an updated list of agile bright gamma-ray sources and their variability  in pointing mode	we present a variability study of a sample of bright gamma-ray (30 mev -- 50gev) sources. this sample is an extension of the first agile catalogue ofgamma-ray sources (1agl), obtained using the complete set of agile observationsin pointing mode performed during a 2.3 year period from july 9, 2007 untiloctober 30, 2009. the dataset of agile pointed observations covers a long timeinterval and its gamma-ray data archive is useful for monitoring studies ofmedium-to-high brightness gamma-ray sources. in the analysis reported here, weused data obtained with an improved event filter that covers a wider field ofview, on a much larger (about 27.5 months) dataset, integrating data onobservation block time scales, which mostly range from a few days to thirtydays.  the data processing resulted in a better characterized source list than 1aglwas, and includes 54 sources, 7 of which are new high galactic latitude (|bii|&gt;= 5) sources, 8 are new sources on the galactic plane, and 20 sources from theprevious catalogue with revised positions. eight 1agl sources (2 high-latitudeand 6 on the galactic plane) were not detected in the final processing eitherbecause of low ob exposure and/or due to their position in complex galacticregions. we report the results in a catalogue of all the detections obtained ineach single ob, including the variability results for each of these sources. inparticular, we found that 12 sources out of 42 or 11 out of 53 are variable,depending on the variability index used, where 42 and 53 are the number ofsources for which these indices could be calculated. seven of the 11 variablesources are blazars, the others are crab pulsar+nebula, ls i +61{\deg}303, cygx-3, and 1aglr j2021+4030.

0802.0350	psr j0737-3039: interacting pulsars in x-rays	we present the results of a ~230 ks long x-ray observation of therelativistic double-pulsar system psr j0737-3039 obtained with the xmm-newtonsatellite in 2006 october. we confirm the detection in x-rays of pulsedemission from psr j0737-3039a (psr a), mostly ascribed to a soft non-thermalpower-law component (photon index ~ 3.3) with a 0.2-3 kev luminosity of~1.9e+30 erg/s (assuming a distance of 500 pc). for the first time, pulsedx-ray emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) is also detected in part of theorbit. this emission, consistent with thermal radiation with temperature kt=30ev and a bolometric luminosity of ~1e+32 erg/s, is likely powered by heating ofpsr b's surface caused by psr a's wind. a hotter (~130 ev) and fainter (~5e+29erg/s) thermal component, probably originating from back-falling particlesheating polar caps of either psr a or psr b is also required by the data. nosigns of x-ray emission from a bow-shock between psr a's wind and theinterstellar medium or psr b's magnetosphere are present. the upper limit onthe luminosity of such a shock component (~1e+29 erg/s) constrains the windmagnetization parameter sigma of psr a to values greater than 1.

1401.3573	the agile alert system for gamma-ray transients	in recent years, a new generation of space missions offered greatopportunities of discovery in high-energy astrophysics. in this article wefocus on the scientific operations of the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid)onboard the agile space mission. the agile-grid, sensitive in the energy rangeof 30 mev-30 gev, has detected many gamma-ray transients of galactic andextragalactic origins. this work presents the agile innovative approach to fastgamma-ray transient detection, which is a challenging task and a crucial partof the agile scientific program. the goals are to describe: (1) the agilegamma-ray alert system, (2) a new algorithm for blind search identification oftransients within a short processing time, (3) the agile procedure forgamma-ray transient alert management, and (4) the likelihood of ratio teststhat are necessary to evaluate the post-trial statistical significance of theresults. special algorithms and an optimized sequence of tasks are necessary toreach our goal. data are automatically analyzed at every orbital downlink by analert pipeline operating on different timescales. as proper flux thresholds areexceeded, alerts are automatically generated and sent as sms messages tocellular telephones, e-mails, and push notifications of an application forsmartphones and tablets. these alerts are crosschecked with the results of twopipelines, and a manual analysis is performed. being a small scientific-classmission, agile is characterized by optimization of both scientific analysis andground-segment resources. the system is capable of generating alerts within twoto three hours of a data downlink, an unprecedented reaction time in gamma-rayastrophysics.

1412.4252	x-ray coherent pulsations during a sub-luminous accretion disk state of  the transitional millisecond pulsar xss j12270-4859	we present the first detection of x-ray coherent pulsations from thetransitional millisecond pulsar xss j12270-4859, while it was in a sub-luminousaccretion disk state characterized by a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 5e33 erg/s(assuming a distance of 1.4 kpc). pulsations were observed by xmm-newton at anrms amplitude of (7.7 +/- 0.5)% with a second harmonic stronger than the thefundamental frequency, and were detected when the source is neither flaring nordipping. the most likely interpretation of this detection is that matter fromthe accretion disk was channelled by the neutron star magnetosphere andaccreted onto its polar caps. according to standard disk accretion theory, forpulsations to be observed the mass in-flow rate in the disk was likely largerthan the amount of plasma actually reaching the neutron star surface; anoutflow launched by the fast rotating magnetosphere then probably took place,in agreement with the observed broad-band spectral energy distribution. we alsoreport about the non-detection of x-ray pulsations during a recent observationperformed while the source behaved as a rotationally-powered radio pulsar.

0805.1808	monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift. i. behavior  outside outbursts	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a new class of hmxbs discoveredthanks to the monitoring of the galactic plane performed with the integralsatellite in the last 5 years. these sources display short outbursts(significantly shorter than typical be/x-ray binaries) with a peak luminosityof a few 1e36 erg/s. the quiescent level, measured only in a few sources, isaround 1e32 erg/s. we are performing a monitoring campaign with swift of foursfxts (igrj16479-4514, xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 andaxj1841.0-0536/igrj18410-0535). we report on the first four months of swiftobservations, started on 2007 october 26. we detect a low level x-ray activityin all four sfxts which demonstrates that these transient sources accretematter even outside their outbursts. this fainter x-ray activity is composed ofmany flares with a large flux variability, on timescales of thousands ofseconds. the lightcurve variability is also evident on larger timescales ofdays, weeks and months, with a dynamic range of more than one order ofmagnitude in all four sfxts. the x-ray spectra are typically hard, with anaverage 2-10 kev luminosity during this monitoring of about 1e33-1e34 erg/s. wedetected pulsations from the pulsar axj1841.0-0536, with a period of4.7008+/-0.0004 s. this monitoring demonstrates that these transients spendmost of the time accreting matter, although at a much lower level (~100-1000times lower than during the bright outbusts), and that the true quiescence,characterized by a soft spectrum and a luminosity of a few 1e32 erg/s, observedin the past only in a couple of members of this class, is probably a very rarestate.

1512.03241	long term study of the double pulsar j0737-3039 with xmm-newton: pulsar  timing	the relativistic double neutron star binary psr j0737-3039 shows clearevidence of orbital phase-dependent wind-companion interaction, both in radioand x-rays. in this paper we present the results of timing analysis of psrj0737-3039 performed during 2006 and 2011 xmm-newton large programs thatcollected ~20,000 x-ray counts from the system. we detected pulsations from psrj0737-3039a (psr a) through the most accurate timing measurement obtained byxmm-newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. psr a's pulseprofile in x-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spinprecession that occurred within the time span of observations. this yields aconstraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentumaxis delta_a ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radiodata. we confirmed pulsed emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) in x-rays evenafter its disappearance in radio. the unusual phenomenology of psr b's x-rayemission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a lossof pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. we hypothesize that this isdue to the interaction of psr a's wind with psr b's magnetosphere andorbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto psr b closed field lines.finally, the analysis of the full xmm-newton dataset provided evidences oforbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shockscenario between psr a's wind and psr b's magnetosphere.
