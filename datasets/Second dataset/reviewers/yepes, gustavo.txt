0905.3134	constrained simulations of the local universe: ii. the nature of the  local hubble flow	using a suite of n-body simulations in different cold dark matter (cdm)scenarios, with cosmological constant (\lcdm) and without (ocdm, scdm), westudy the hubble flow (\sigh) in local volumes (lv) around local group (lg)like objects found in these simulations, and compare the numerical results withthe most recent observations. we show that \lcdm and ocdm models exhibit thesame behavior of \sigh. hence, we demonstrate that the observed coldness of thehubble flow is not likely to be a manifestation of the dark energy, contrary toprevious claims. the coldness does not constitute a problem by itself but itposes a problem to the standard \lcdm model only if the mean density within thelocal volume is greater than twice the mean matter cosmic density. the lack ofblueshifted galaxies in the lv, outside of the lg can be considered as anothermanifestation of the coldness of the flow. finally, we show that the maindynamical parameter that affects the coldness of the flow is the relativeisolation of the lg, and the absence of nearby milky way like objects within adistance of about $3\mpc$.

0909.1916	the grouping, merging and survival of subhaloes in the simulated local  group	we use a simulation performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study a realistic local group-like object. weemploy this group as a numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of thepopulation of its subhaloes from the point of view of the effects it may haveon the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. we focus on the processesof tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and groupingbefore infall. the tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition betweenthe phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occursat the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape oftheir mass function with redshift. although the satellites often form groups,they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. theinfall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiardistribution of the local group satellites, but only if it occurred recently.mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an earlystage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 gyr ago, when they are still outside thehost haloes. such events could thus contribute to the formation of more distantearly type milky way companions. once the subhaloes enter the host halo themergers become very rare.

0909.4423	constrained simulations of the local group: on the radial distribution  of substructures	we examine the properties of satellites found in high resolution simulationsof the local group. we use constrained simulations designed to reproduce themain dynamical features that characterize the local neighborhood, i.e. withintens of mpc around the local group (lg). specifically, a lg-like object isfound located within the 'correct' dynamical environment and consisting ofthree main objects which are associated with the milky way, m31 and m33. byrunning two simulations of this lg from identical initial conditions - one withand one without baryons modeled hydrodynamically - we can quantify the effectof gas physics on the $z=0$ population of subhaloes in an environment similarto our own. we find that above a certain mass cut, $m_{\rm sub} &gt;2\times10^{8}h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ subhaloes in hydrodynamic simulations are moreradially concentrated than those in simulations with out gas. this is caused bythe collapse of baryons into stars that typically sit in the central regions ofsubhaloes, making them denser. the increased central density of such a subhalo,results in less mass loss due to tidal stripping than the same subhalosimulated with only dark matter. the increased mass in hydrodynamic subhaloeswith respect to dark matter ones, causes dynamical friction to be moreeffective, dragging the subhalo towards the centre of the host. this results inthese subhaloes being effectively more radially concentrated then their darkmatter counterparts.

1001.3162	the large scale bias of dark matter halos: numerical calibration and  model tests	we measure the clustering of dark matter halos in a large set ofcollisionless cosmological simulations of the flat lcdm cosmology. halos areidentified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the massaround isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is deltatimes the background. we calibrate fitting functions for the large scale biasthat are adaptable to any value of delta we examine. we find a ~6% scatterabout our best fit bias relation. our fitting functions couple to the halo massfunctions of tinker et. al. (2008) such that bias of all dark matter isnormalized to unity. we demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos ishigher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of sheth,mo, &amp; tormen (2001), and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapsemodel for the rarest halos. halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halosidentified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos withthe canonical delta=200 overdensity by ~10%. in contrast to our previousresults on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolvesvery weakly with redshift, if at all. we use our numerical results, both forthe mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background splitmodel for halo bias. we find that the peak-background split achieves areasonable agreement with the numerical results, but ~20% residuals remain,both at high and low masses.

1002.2853	the impact of baryonic physics on the shape and radial alignment of  substructures in cosmological dark matter haloes	we use two simulations performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study both the shape and radial alignment of (thedark matter component of) subhaloes; one of the simulations is a dark matteronly model while the other run includes all the relevant gas physics and starformation recipes. we find that the involvement of gas physics does not have astatistically significant effect on either property -- at least not for themost massive subhaloes considered in this study. however, we observe in bothsimulations including and excluding gasdynamics a (pronounced) evolution of thedark matter shapes of subhaloes as well as of the radial alignment signal sinceinfall time. further, this evolution is different when positioned in thecentral and outer regions of the host halo today; while subhaloes tend tobecome more aspherical in the central 50% of their host's virial radius, theradial alignment weakens in the central regime while strengthening in the outerparts. we confirm that this is due to tidal torquing and the fact thatsubhaloes at pericentre move too fast for the alignment signal to respond.

0708.0229	too small to form a galaxy: how the uv background determines the baryon  fraction	the cosmic ultraviolet background (uvb) heats the intergalactic medium (igm),as a result the gas in dark matter halos below a certain mass is too hot tocool within a hubble time. the uvb effectively suppresses the formation ofdwarf galaxies. using high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulationswe show that photo heating leads to small baryon fractions in halos below ~6x10^9 h^{-1}m_sun, independent of the cosmic environment. the simulations arecarried out assuming a homogeneous uvb with flux densities as given by haardt &amp;madau (1996). a halo may stop to condense gas significantly after the universeis reionised, namely when its mass falls below the characteristic mass scaleset by the photo heating. assuming a spherical halo model we derive thischaracteristic mass analytically and identify the main mechanisms that preventthe gas from cooling in small halos. the theoretically derived characteristicmass is smaller than the one obtained from observations. increasing the energyper ionising photon by a factor between four and eight would be sufficient toreconcile both. this is equivalent to an average temperature of the igm of ~10^4 k. in this sense the faint end of the luminosity function may serve as acalorimeter for the igm.

1003.4544	strong lensing in the marenostrum universe: biases in the cluster lens  population	strong lensing is one of the most direct probes of the mass distribution inthe inner regions of galaxy clusters. it can be used to constrain the densityprofiles and to measure the mass of the lenses. moreover, the abundance ofstrong lensing events can be used to constrain the structure formation and thecosmological parameters through the so-called "arc-statistics" approach.however, several issues related to the usage of strong lensing clusters incosmological applications are still controversial, leading to the suspect thatseveral biases may affect this very peculiar class of objects. with this studywe aim at better understanding the properties of galaxy clusters which canpotentially act as strong lenses. we do so by investigating the properties of alarge sample of galaxy clusters extracted from the n-body/hydrodynamicalsimulation marenostrum universe. we explore the correlation between the crosssection for lensing and many properties of clusters, like the mass, thethree-dimensional and projected shapes, their concentrations, the x-rayluminosity and the dynamical activity. we find that the probability of strongalignments between the major axes of the lenses and the line of sight is agrowing function of the lensing cross section. in projection, the strong lensesappear rounder within r200, but we find that their cores tend to be moreelliptical as the lensing cross section increases. we also find that thecluster concentrations estimated from the projected density profiles tend to bebiased high. the x-ray luminosity of strong lensing clusters is higher thanthat of normal lenses of similar mass and redshift. this is particularsignificant for the least massive lenses. finally, we find that the strongestlenses generally exhibit an excess of kinetic energy within the virial radius,indicating that they are more dynamically active than usual clusters.

1005.3139	reionization of the local group of galaxies	we present the first detailed structure formation and radiative transfersimulations of the reionization history of our cosmic neighbourhood. to thisend, we follow the formation of the local group of galaxies and nearby clustersby means of constrained simulations, which use the available observationalconstraints to construct a representation of those structures which reproducestheir actual positions and properties at the present time. we find that thereionization history of the local group is strongly dependent on the assumedphoton production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorlyconstrained. if sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is'photon-rich', the local group is primarily ionized externally by the nearbyclusters. alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is'photon-poor' the local group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.the mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications forthe evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxypopulations and primordial stellar populations. this therefore provides animportant avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies ofour nearby structures.

1010.1531	the preferred direction of infalling satellite galaxies in the local  group	using a high resolution dm simulation of the local group (lg), conductedwithin the framework of the constrained local universe simulation (clues)project, we investigate the nature of how satellites of the mw and m31 areaccreted. satellites of these galaxies are accreted anisotropically, enteringthe virial radius of their hosts from specific "spots" with respect to thelarge scale structure. furthermore, material which is tidally stripped fromthese satellites is also, at z=0, distributed anisotropically and ischaracterized by an ellipsoidal sub-volume embedded in the halo. the angularpattern created by the locus of satellite infall points and the projectedstripped dm is investigated within a coordinate system determined by thelocation of the lg companion and the simulated virgo cluster across concentricshells ranging from 0.1 to 5 r_vir. remarkably, the principal axis of theellipsoidal sub-volume shows a coherent alignment extending from well withinthe halo to a few r_vir. a spherical harmonics transform applied to the angulardistributions confirms the visual impression: namely, the angular distributionsof both the satellites entry points and stripped dm is dominated by the l=2quadrupole term, whose major principal axis is aligned across the shellsconsidered. it follows that the structure of the outer (r&gt;0.5 r_vir) regions ofthe main halos is closely related to the cosmic web within which it isembedded. given the hypothesis that a large fraction of the stellar halo of themilky way has been accreted from satellites, the present results can be appliedto the stellar halo of the mw and m31. we predict that the remnants of tidallystripped satellites should be embedded in streams of material composed of darkmatter and stars. the present results can therefore shed light on the existenceof satellites embedded within larger streams of matter, such as the segue 2satellite.

1104.0949	haloes gone mad: the halo-finder comparison project	[abridged] we present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter haloproperties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. thesecodes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (fof),spherical-overdensity (so) and phase-space based algorithms. we furtherintroduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allowshalo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against thosepresented here. this set includes mock haloes containing various levels anddistributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as acosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. all thehalo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location ofour mock haloes. they further returned lists of particles (potentially)belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of thecircular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. all the findersbased in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was locatedclose to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the massrecovered varies from finder to finder. those finders based in phase spacecould resolve central substructure although they found difficulties inaccurately recovering its properties. via a resolution study we found that mostof the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than30-40 particles. however, also here the phase space finders excelled byresolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. by comparing the halo findersusing a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkablywell on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass,position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).

1105.0573	large scale environmental bias of the qso line of sight proximity effect	we analyse the proximity zone of the intergalactic matter aroundhigh-redshift quasars in a cosmological environment. in a box of 64 h-1 mpcbase length we employ dark matter only simulations. for estimating the hydrogentemperature and density distribution we use the effective equation of state.hydrogen is assumed to be in photoionisation equilibrium with a modelbackground flux which is fit to recent observations of the mean optical depthand transmission flux statistics. at redshifts z = 3, 4, and 4.8, we selectmodel quasar positions at the centre of the 20 most massive halos and 100 lessmassive halos identified in the simulation. from each assumed quasar positionwe cast 100 random lines of sight for two box length including the changes inthe ionisation fractions by the qso flux field and derive mock ly{\alpha}spectra. the proximity effect describes the dependence of the mean normalisedoptical depth {\xi} = {\tau}eff, qso/{\tau}eff, ly{\alpha} as a function of theratio of the ionisation rate by the qso and the background field, {\omega} ={\gamma}qso/{\gamma}uvb, i.e. the profile {\xi} = (1 + {\omega}/a)-0.5, where astrength parameter a is introduced. the strength parameter measures thedeviation from the theoretical background model and is used to quantify anyinfluence of the environmental density field. we reproduce an unbiasedmeasurement of the proximity effect which is not affected by the host halomass. the scatter between different lines of sight and different quasar hostpositions increases with decreasing redshift. around the host halos, we findonly a slight average overdensity in the proximity zone at comoving radii of 1&lt; rc &lt; 10h-1 mpc. however, a clear power-law correlation of the strengthparameter with the average overdensity in rc is found, showing anoverestimation of the ionising background in overdense regions and anunderestimation in underdense regions.

1107.2944	renegade subhaloes in the local group	using a dark matter only constrained local universe simulation (clues) weexamine the existence of subhaloes that change their affiliation from one ofthe two prominent hosts in the local group (i.e. the milky way and theandromeda galaxy) to the other, and call these objects "renegade subhaloes". inlight of recent claims that the two magellanic clouds (mcs) may have originatedfrom another region (or even the outskirts) of the local group or that theyhave been spawned by a major merger in the past of the andromeda galaxy, weinvestigate the nature of such events. however, we cannot confirm that renegadesubhaloes enter as deep into the potential well of their present host nor thatthey share the most simplest properties with the mcs, namely mass and relativevelocity. our simulation rather suggests that these renegade subhaloes appearto be flying past one host before being pulled into the other. a merger is notrequired to trigger such an event, it is rather the distinct environment of oursimulated local group facilitating such behavior. since just a small fractionof the full z=0 subhalo population are renegades, our study indicates that itwill be intrinsically difficult to distinguish them despite clear differencesin their velocity, radial distribution, shape and spin parameter distributions.

1107.4366	disentangling the dark matter halo from the stellar halo	the outer haloes of the milky way and andromeda galaxies contain as muchimportant information on their assembly and formation history as the propertiesof the discs resident in their centres. in this paper we have used theconstrained local universe simulation project to disentangle the stellar and dmcomponent of three galaxies that resemble the mw, m31 and m33 using both dmonly and dm + gas-dynamical simulations. stars that are accreted insubstructures and then stripped follow a completely different radialdistribution than the stripped dm: the stellar halo is much more centrallyconcentrated than dm. in order to understand how the same physical process canlead to different z=0 radial profiles, we examined the potential at accretionof each stripped particle. we found that star particles sit at systematicallyhigher potentials than dm, making them harder to strip. we then searched for athreshold in the potential of accreted particles \phi_[th], above which dmparticles behave as star particles. we found such a threshold at &gt;16\phi_{subhalo}, where \phi_{subhalo} is the potential at a subhaloes edge atthe time of accretion. thus a rule as simple as selecting particles accordingto their potential at accretion is able to reproduce the effect that thecomplicated physics of star formation has on the stellar distribution. thisniversal result reproduces the stellar halo to an accuracy of within ~2%.studies which make use of dm particles as a proxy for stars will undoubtedlymiscalculate their proper radial distribution and structure unless particlesare selected according to their potential at accretion. furthermore, we haveexamined the time it takes to strip a given star or dm particle afteraccretion. we find that, owing to their higher binding energies, stars takelonger to be stripped than dm. the stripped dm halo is thus considerably olderthan the stripped stellar halo.

1107.5045	too small to succeed? lighting up massive dark matter subhaloes of the  milky way	using constrained local universe simulations (clues) of the formation of thelocal group in a cosmological context we investigate the recently highlightedproblem that the majority of the most massive dark subhaloes of the milky wayare too dense to host any of its bright satellites. in particular, we examinethe influence of baryonic processes and find that they leave a twofold effecton the relation between the peak of the rotation curve and its position (vmaxand rmax). satellites with a large baryon fraction experience adiabaticcontraction thus decreasing rmax while leaving vmax more or less unchanged.subhaloes with smaller baryon fractions undergo a decrease in vmax possibly dueto outflows of material. furthermore, the situation of finding subhaloes insimulations that lie outside the confidence interval for possible hosts of thebright mw dwarf spheroidals, appears to be far more prominent in cosmologieswith a high sigma8 normalisation and depends on the mass of the host. weconclude that the problem cannot be simply solved by including baryonicprocesses and hence demands further investigations.

1108.5736	halo contraction effect in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation	the condensation of gas and stars in the inner regions of dark matter halosleads to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. while this effect isbased on simple gravitational physics, the question of its validity inhierarchical galaxy formation has led to an active debate in the literature. weuse a collection of several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations to study the halo contraction effect in systems ranging from dwarfgalaxies to clusters of galaxies, at high and low redshift. the simulations arerun by different groups with different codes and include hierarchical merging,gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback. we show that in all ourcases the inner dark matter density increases relative to the matchingsimulation without baryon dissipation, at least by a factor of several. thestrength of the contraction effect varies from system to system and cannot bereduced to a simple prescription. we present a revised analytical model thatdescribes the contracted mass profile to an rms accuracy of about 10%. themodel can be used to effectively bracket the response of the dark matter haloto baryon dissipation. the halo contraction effect is real and must be includedin modeling of the mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

1201.3365	the cosmic web and the orientation of angular momenta	we use a 64$h^{-1}$mpc dark matter (dm) only cosmological simulation toexamine the large scale orientation of haloes and substructures with respectthe cosmic web. a web classification scheme based on the velocity shear tensoris used to assign to each halo in the simulation a web type: knot, filament,sheet or void. using $\sim10^6$ haloes that span ~3 orders of magnitude in massthe orientation of the halo's spin and the orbital angular momentum ofsubhaloes with respect to the eigenvectors of the shear tensor is examined. wefind that the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes tends to align with theintermediate eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor for all haloes in knots,filaments and sheets. this result indicates that the kinematics ofsubstructures located deep within the virialized regions of a halo isdetermined by its infall which in turn is determined by the large scalevelocity shear, a surprising result given the virilaized nature of haloes. thenon-random nature of subhalo accretion is thus imprinted on the angularmomentum measured at z = 0. we also find that haloes' spin axis is aligned withthe third eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor in filaments and sheets: thehalo spin axis points along filaments and lies in the plane of cosmic sheets.

1201.3367	a kinematic classification of the cosmic web	a new approach for the classification of the cosmic web is presented. inextension of the previous work of hahn et al.

0704.3385	constrained simulations of the local universe: i. mass and motion in the  local volume	it has been recently claimed that there is no correlation between thedistribution of galaxies and their peculiar velocities within the local volume(lv), namely a sphere of r=7/h mpc around the local group (lg). it has beenthen stated that this implies that either locally dark matter is notdistributed in the same way as luminous matter, or peculiar velocities are notdue to fluctuations in mass. to test that statement a set of constrained n-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. the simulations were performed within theflat-lambda, open and flat matter only cdm cosmogonies. two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-lambda and open cdm models were performed forcomparison. lg-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real lgenvironment. the local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachlv is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation. we conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and thelocal gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos.moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiarvelocities of halos. the exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. uponconsidering all matter inside the lvs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models. the main conclusion is that the lack ofcorrelation between the local gravitation and the peculiar velocity fieldsaround lg-like objects is naturally expected in the cdm cosmologies.

1204.0515	size matters: the non-universal density profile of subhaloes in sph  simulations and implications for the milky way's dsphs	we use dark matter only and full hydrodynamical constrained local universesimulations (clues) of the formation of the local group to study the densityprofile of subhaloes of the simulated milky way and andromeda galaxies. we showthat the einasto model provides the best description of the subhaloes' densityprofile, as opposed to the more commonly used nfw profile or any generalisationof it. we further find that the einasto shape parameter \nein\ is stronglycorrelated with the total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of anon-universality of the subhaloes' density profile. we observe that the effectof mass loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and thehydrodynamical run, is the reduction of the shape parameter \nein\ between theinfall and the present time. assuming now that the dsphs of our galaxy followthe einasto profile and using the maximum and minimum values of \nein\ from ourhydrodynamical simulation as a gauge, we can improve the observationalconstraints on the \rmax-\vmax\ pairs obtained for the brightest satellitegalaxies of the milky way. when considering only the subhaloes with$-13.2\lesssim m_v\lesssim-8.8$, i.e. the range of luminosity of the classicaldwarfs, we find that all our simulated objects are consistent with the observeddsphs if their haloes follow the einasto model with $1.6\lesssim n_{\rm e}\lesssim5.3$. the numerically motivated einasto profile for the observed dsphswill alleviate the recently presented "massive failures" problem.

1207.4438	the music of galaxy clusters i: baryon properties and scaling relations  of the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	we introduce the marenostrum-multidark simulations of galaxy clusters (music)dataset, one of the largest sample of hydrodynamically simulated galaxyclusters with more than 500 clusters and 2000 groups. the objects have beenselected from two large n-body simulations and have been resimulated at highresolution using sph together with relevant physical processes (cooling, uvphotoionization, star formation and different feedback processes). we focus onthe analysis of the baryon content (gas and star) of clusters in the musicdataset both as a function of aperture radius and redshift. the results fromour simulations are compared with the most recent observational estimates ofthe gas fraction in galaxy clusters at different overdensity radii. when theeffects of cooling and stellar feedbacks are included, the music clusters showa good agreement with the most recent observed gas fractions quoted in theliterature. a clear dependence of the gas fractions with the total cluster massis also evident. the impact of the aperture radius choice, when comparingintegrated quantities at different redshifts, is tested: the standarddefinition of radius at a fixed overdensity with respect to critical density iscompared with a definition based on the redshift dependent overdensity withrespect to background density. we also present a detailed analysis of thescaling relations of the thermal sz (sunyaev zel'dovich) effect derived frommusic clusters. the integrated sz brightness, y, is related to the clustertotal mass, m, as well as, the m-y counterpart, more suitable for observationalapplications. both laws are consistent with predictions from the self-similarmodel, showing a very low scatter. the effects of the gas fraction on the y-mscaling and the presence of a possible redshift dependence on the y-m scalingrelation are also explored.

1211.0536	dwarf galaxies and the cosmic web	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group ofgalaxies to identify a mechanism that enables the removal of baryons fromlow-mass halos without appealing to feedback or reionization. as the localgroup forms, matter bound to it develops a network of filaments and pancakes.this moving web of gas and dark matter drifts and sweeps a large volume,overtaking many halos in the process. the dark matter content of these halos isunaffected but their gas can be efficiently removed by ram-pressure. the lossof gas is especially pronounced in low-mass halos due to their lower bindingenergy and has a dramatic effect on the star formation history of affectedsystems. this "cosmic web stripping" may help to explain the scarcity of dwarfgalaxies compared with the numerous low-mass halos expected in \lambda cdm andthe large diversity of star formation histories and morphologies characteristicof faint galaxies. although our results are based on a single high-resolutionsimulation, it is likely that the hydrodynamical interaction of dwarf galaxieswith the cosmic web is a crucial ingredient so far missing from galaxyformation models.

1212.0095	the halo mass function through the cosmic ages	in this paper we investigate how the halo mass function evolves withredshift, based on a suite of very large (with n_p = 3072^3 - 6000^3 particles)cosmological n-body simulations. our halo catalogue data spans a redshift rangeof z = 0-30, allowing us to probe the mass function from the dark ages to thepresent. we utilise both the friends-of-friends (fof) and spherical overdensity(so) halofinding methods to directly compare the mass function derived usingthese commonly used halo definitions. the mass function from so haloes exhibitsa clear evolution with redshift, especially during the recent era of darkenergy dominance (z &lt; 1). we provide a redshift-parameterised fit for the somass function valid for the entire redshift range to within ~20% as well as ascheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary overdensities.the fof mass function displays a weaker evolution with redshift. we provide a`universal' fit for the fof mass function, fitted to data across the entireredshift range simultaneously, and observe redshift evolution in our dataversus this fit. the relative evolution of the mass functions derived via thetwo methods is compared and we find that the mass functions most closely matchat z=0. the disparity at z=0 between the fof and so mass functions resides intheir high mass tails where the collapsed fraction of mass in so haloes is ~80%of that in fof haloes. this difference grows with redshift so that, by z&gt;20,the so algorithm finds a ~50-80% lower collapsed fraction in high mass haloesthan does the fof algorithm, due in part to the significant over-linkingeffects known to affect the fof method.

1303.2690	the kinematics of the local group in a cosmological context	recent observations constrained the tangential velocity of m31 with respectto the milky way (mw) to be v_tan&lt;34.4 km/s and the radial velocity to be inthe range v_rad=-109+/- 4.4 km/s (van der marel et al. 2012). in this study weuse a large volume high resolution n-body cosmological simulation (bolshoi)together with three constrained simulations to statistically study thiskinematics in the context of the lcdm. the comparison of the ensembles ofsimulated pairs with the observed lg at the 1-sigma level in the uncertaintieshas been done with respect to the radial and tangential velocities, the reducedorbital energy (e_tot), angular momentum (l_orb) and the dimensionless spinparameter, lambda. our main results are: (i) the preferred radial andtangential velocities for pairs in lcdm are v_rad=-80+/-20 km/s, v_tan=50+/-10km/s, (ii) pairs around that region are 3 to 13 times more common than pairswithin the observational values, (iii) 15%to 24% of lg-like pairs in lcdm haveenergy and angular momentum consistent with observations while (iv) 9% to 13%of pairs in the same sample show similar values in the inferred dimensionlessspin parameter. it follows that within current observational uncertainties thequasi-conserved quantities that characterize the orbit of the lg, i.e. e_tot,r_orb and lambda, do not challenge the standard lcdm model, but the model is intension with regard to the actual values of the radial and tangentialvelocities. this might hint to a problem of the lcdm model to reproduce theobserved lg.

1305.5557	cold versus warm dark matter simulations of a galaxy group	the differences between cold (cdm) and warm (wdm) dark matter in theformation of a group of galaxies is examined by running two identicalsimulations where in the wdm case the initial power spectrum has been alteredto mimic a 1kev dark matter particle. the cdm initial conditions wereconstrained to reproduce at z = 0 the correct local environment within which a"local group" (lg) of galaxies may form. two significant differences betweenthe two simulations are found. while in the cdm case a group of galaxies thatresembles the real lg forms, the wdm run fails to reproduce a viable lg,instead forming a diffuse group which is still expanding at z = 0. this issurprising since, due to the suppression of small scale power in its powerspectrum, wdm is naively expected to only affect the collapse of small haloesand not necessarily the dynamics on a scale of a group of galaxies. furthermorethe concentration of baryons in halo center's is greater in cdm than in wdm andthe properties of the disks differ.

1307.3285	modelling baryon acoustic oscillations with perturbation theory and  stochastic halo biasing	in this work we investigate the generation of mock halo catalogues based onperturbation theory and nonlinear stochastic biasing with the novelpatchy-code. in particular, we use augmented lagrangian perturbation theory(alpt) to generate a dark matter density field on a mesh starting from gaussianfluctuations and to compute the peculiar velocity field. alpt is based on acombination of second order lpt (2lpt) on large scales and the sphericalcollapse model on smaller scales. we account for the systematic deviation ofperturbative approaches from n-body simulations together with halo biasingadopting an exponential bias model. we then account for stochastic biasing bydefining three regimes: a low, an intermediate and a high density regime, usinga poisson distribution in the intermediate regime and the negative binomialdistribution to model over-dispersion in the high density regime. since wefocus in this study on massive halos, we suppress the generation of halos inthe low density regime. the various nonlinear and stochastic biasingparameters, and density thresholds (five) are calibrated with the largebigmultidark n-body simulation to match the power spectrum of the correspondinghalo population. our mock catalogues show power spectra, both in real- andredshift-space, which are compatible with n-body simulations within about 2% upto k ~ 1 h mpc^-1 at z = 0.577 for a sample of halos with the typical bosscmass galaxy number density. the corresponding correlation functions arecompatible down to a few mpc. we also find that neglecting over-dispersion inhigh density regions produces power spectra with deviations of 10% at k ~ 0.4 hmpc^-1. these results indicate the need to account for an accurate statisticaldescription of the galaxy clustering for precise studies of large-scalesurveys.

1310.3740	halo abundance matching: accuracy and conditions for numerical  convergence	accurate predictions of the abundance and clustering of dark matter haloesplay a key role in testing the standard cosmological model. here, weinvestigate the accuracy of one of the leading methods of connecting thesimulated dark matter haloes with observed galaxies -- the halo abundancematching (ham) technique. we show how to choose the optimal values of the massand force resolution in large-volume n-body simulations so that they provideaccurate estimates for correlation functions and circular velocities for haloesand their subhaloes -- crucial ingredients of the ham method. at the 10%accuracy, results converge for 50 particles for haloes and 150 particles forprogenitors subhaloes. in order to achieve this level of accuracy a number ofconditions should be satisfied. the force resolution for the smallest resolved(sub)haloes should be in the range (0.1-0.3)rs, where rs is the scale radius of(sub)haloes. the number of particles for progenitors of subhaloes should be150. we also demonstrate that the two-body scattering plays a minor role forthe accuracy of n-body simulations thanks to the relatively small number ofcrossing-times of dark matter in haloes, and the limited force resolution ofcosmological simulations.

1312.0105	dark matter in the local universe	we review how dark matter is distributed in our local neighbourhood from anobservational and theoretical perspective. we will start by describing firstthe dark matter halo of our own galaxy and in the local group. then we proceedto describe the dark matter distribution in the more extended area known as thelocal universe. depending on the nature of dark matter, numerical simulationspredict different abundances of substructures in local group galaxies, in thenumber of void regions and in the abundance of low rotational velocity galaxiesin the local universe. by comparing these predictions with the most recentobservations, strong constrains on the physical properties of the dark matterparticles can be derived. we devote particular attention to the results fromthe constrained local universe simulations (clues) project, a special set ofsimulations whose initial conditions are constrained by observational data fromthe local universe. the resulting simulations are designed to reproduce theobserved structures in the nearby universe. the clues provides a numericallaboratory for simulating the local group of galaxies and exploring the physicsof galaxy formation in an environment designed to follow the observed localuniverse. it has come of age as the numerical analogue of near-field cosmology.

1312.0276	cosmic variance of the local hubble flow in large-scale cosmological  simulations	the increasing precision in the determination of the hubble parameter hasreached a per cent level at which large-scale cosmic flows induced byinhomogeneities of the matter distribution become non-negligible. here we uselarge-scale cosmological n-body simulations to study statistical properties ofthe local hubble parameter as measured by local observers. we show that thedistribution of the local hubble parameter depends not only on the scale ofinhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in thecosmic web and what reference frame is used. observers located in random darkmatter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at randompositions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect isstronger from the halo rest frames compared to the cmb rest frame. we comparethe predictions for the local hubble parameter with observational constraintsbased on type ia supernovae (snia) and cmb observations. due to cosmicvariance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the hubbleconstant determined from nearby snia may differ from that measured from the cmbby 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. this scatter is too smallto significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between currentmeasurements assuming a flat lcdm model. however, for observers located in thecentres of the largest voids permitted by the standard lcdm model, we find thathubble constant measurements from snia would be biased high by 5 per cent,rendering this tension inexistent in this extreme case.

0802.1917	on the relation between radial alignment of dark matter subhalos and  host mass in cosmological simulations	we explore the dependence of the radial alignment of subhalos on the mass ofthe host halo they orbit in. as the effect is seen on a broad range of scalesincluding massive clusters as well as galactic systems it only appears naturalto explore this phenomenon by means of cosmological simulations covering thesame range in masses. we have 25 well resolved host dark matter halos at ourdisposal ranging from 10^15 msun/h down to 10^12 msun/h each consisting oforder of a couple of million particles within the virial radius. we observethat subhalos tend to be more spherical than isolated objects. both thedistributions of sphericity and triaxiality of subhalos are gaussiandistributed with peak values of s approx. 0.80 and t approx. 0.56, irrespectiveof host mass. interestingly we note that the radial alignment is independent ofhost halo mass and the distribution of \cos\theta (i.e. the angle between themajor axis e_a of each subhalo and the radius vector of the subhalo in thereference frame of the host) is well fitted by a simple power law p(\cos\theta)proportional to \cos^4\theta with the same fitting parameters for all hosthalos.

1401.2992	the music of galaxy clusters ii: x-ray global properties and scaling  relations	we present the x-ray properties and scaling relations of a large sample ofclusters extracted from the marenostrum multidark simulations of galaxyclusters (music) dataset. we focus on a sub-sample of 179 clusters at redshiftz~0.11, with 3.2e14m_sun/h&lt;m_vir&lt;2e15msun/h, complete in mass. we employed thex-ray photon simulator phox to obtain synthetic chandra observations and deriveobservable-like global properties of the intracluster medium (icm), as x-raytemperature (t_x) and luminosity (l_x). t_x is found to slightly under-estimatethe true mass-weighted temperature, although tracing fairly well the clustertotal mass. we also study the effects of t_x on scaling relations with clusterintrinsic properties: total (m_500) and gas (m_g500) mass; integrated comptonparameter (y_sz) of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) thermal effect; y_x=m_g500 t_x.we confirm that y_x is a very good mass proxy, with a scatter on m_500-y_x andy_sz-y_x lower than 5%. the study of scaling relations among x-ray, intrinsicand sz properties indicates that music clusters reasonably resemble theself-similar prediction, especially for correlations involving t_x. theobservational approach also allows for a more direct comparison with realclusters, from which we find deviations mainly due to the physical descriptionof the icm, affecting t_x and, particularly, l_x.

1401.5005	hydrodynamical simulations of coupled and uncoupled quintessence models  i: halo properties and the cosmic web	we present the results of a series of adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations ofseveral quintessence models (both with a free and an interacting scalar field)in comparison to a standard \lcdm\ cosmology. for each we use $2\times1024^3$particles in a $250$\hmpc\ periodic box assuming wmap7 cosmology. in this workwe focus on the properties of haloes in the cosmic web at $z=0$. the web isclassified into \emph{voids}, \emph{sheets}, \emph{filaments} and \emph{knots}depending on the eigenvalues of the velocity shear tensor, which are anexcellent proxy for the underlying overdensity distribution. we find that theproperties of objects classified according to their surrounding environmentshows a substantial dependence on the underlying cosmology; for example, while$v_{\rm max}$ shows average deviations of $\approx5$ per cent across thedifferent models when considering the full halo sample, comparing objectsclassified according to their environment, the size of the deviation can be aslarge as $20$ per cent.  we also find that halo spin parameters are positively correlated to thecoupling, whereas halo concentrations show the opposite behaviour. furthermore,when studying the concentration-mass relation in different environments, wefind that in all cosmologies underdense regions have a larger normalization anda shallower slope. while this behaviour is found to characterize all themodels, differences in the best-fit relations are enhanced in (coupled) darkenergy, thus providing a clearer prediction for this class of models.

1405.5540	the imprint of reionization on the star formation histories of dwarf  galaxies	we explore the impact of cosmic reionization on nearby isolated dwarfgalaxies using a compilation of sfhs estimated from deep hst data and acosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the local group. the nearby dwarfsshow a wide diversity of star formation histories; from ancient systems thathave largely completed their star formation $\sim 10$ gyr ago to young dwarfsthat have formed the majority of their stars in the past $\sim 5$ gyr totwo-component systems characterized by the overlap of comparable numbers of oldand young stars. taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips tolower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4&lt;t$/gyr $&lt;8$), a feature thatwe trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. reionizationheats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low masshalos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that correspondsto a virial temperature of $\sim 2 \times 10^4 $ $\mathrm{k}$ at $z_{\rmreion}$.  the loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity ofearly-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early starformation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single oldstellar component prevails. in halos below the threshold at $z_{\rm reion}$,reionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lastsuntil the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cooland form stars. young stellar components therefore dominate in dwarfs whosehalos assemble late and thus form few stars before reionization. two-componentsystems may be traced to late mergers of individual examples of the twoaforementioned cases. the relative dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearbydwarfs might thus be the clearest signature yet identified of the imprint ofcosmic reionization on the star formation history of dwarf galaxies.

0803.2706	toward a halo mass function for precision cosmology: the limits of  universality	we measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set ofcollisionless cosmological simulations of flat lcdm cosmology and investigateits evolution at z&lt;~2. halos are identified as isolated density peaks, andtheir masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specificoverdensities. we argue that these spherical overdensity masses are moredirectly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using thefriends-of-friends algorithm (fof), and are therefore preferable for accurateforecasts of halo abundances. our simulation set allows us to calibrate themass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10^{11} msol/h &lt; m &lt;10^{15} msol/h, to &lt;~ 5%. we derive fitting functions for the halo massfunction in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 andearlier epochs. in addition to these formulae, which improve on previousapproximations by 10-20%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot berepresented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. theamplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by ~20-50%,depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. we also find evidence forredshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.

1410.4684	hunting down systematics in baryon acoustic oscillations after cosmic  high noon	future dark energy experiments will require better and more accuratetheoretical predictions for the baryonic acoustic oscillations (bao) signaturein the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. here, we use large n-bodysimulations of the \lambdacdm planck cosmology to study any possible systematicshifts and damping in bao due to the impact of nonlinear gravitational growthof structure, scale dependent and non-local bias, and redshift-spacedistortions. the effect of cosmic variance is largely reduced by dividing thetracer power spectrum by that from a bao-free simulation starting with the samephases. this permits us to study with unprecedented accuracy (better than 0.02%for dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos) small shifts of the pristine baowavenumbers towards larger k, and non-linear damping of bao wiggles in thepower spectrum of dark matter and halo populations in the redshift range z=0-1.for dark matter, we provide an accurate parametrization of the evolution of\alpha as a function of the linear growth factor d(z). for halo samples, withbias ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, we measure a typical bao shift of ~0.25%,observed in real-space, which does not show an appreciable evolution withredshift within the uncertainties. moreover, we report a constant shift as afunction of halo bias. we find a different evolution of the damping of theacoustic feature in all halo samples as compared to dark matter with haloessuffering less damping, and also find some weak dependence on bias. a largerbao shift and damping is measured in redshift-space which can be well explainedby linear theory due to redshift-space distortions. a clear modulation in phasewith the acoustic scale is observed in the scale-dependent halo bias due to thepresence of the baryonic acoustic oscillations.

1501.05520	halo mass distribution reconstruction across the cosmic web	we study the relation between halo mass and its environment from aprobabilistic perspective. we find that halo mass depends not only on localdark matter density, but also on non-local quantities such as the cosmic webenvironment and the halo-exclusion effect. given these accurate relations, wehave developed the hadron-code (halo mass distribution reconstruction), atechnique which permits us to assign halo masses to a distribution of haloes inthree-dimensional space. this can be applied to the fast production of mockgalaxy catalogues, by assigning halo masses, and reproducing accurately thebias for different mass cuts. the resulting clustering of the halo populationsagree well with that drawn from the bigmultidark $n$-body simulation: the powerspectra are within 1-$\sigma$ up to scales of $k=0.2\,h\,{\rm mpc}^{-1}$, whenusing augmented lagrangian perturbation theory based mock catalogues. only themost massive haloes show a larger deviation. for these, we find evidence of thehalo-exclusion effect. a clear improvement is achieved when assigning thehighest masses to haloes with a minimum distance separation. we also computethe 2- and 3-point correlation functions, and find an excellent agreement with$n$-body results. our work represents a quantitative application of the cosmicweb classification. it can have further interesting applications in themulti-tracer analysis of the large-scale structure for future galaxy surveys.

1507.08724	bayesian redshift-space distortions correction from galaxy redshift  surveys	we present a bayesian reconstruction method which maps a galaxy distributionfrom redshift-space to real-space inferring the distances of the individualgalaxies. the method is based on sampling density fields assuming a lognormalprior with a likelihood given by the negative binomial distribution functionmodelling stochastic bias. we assume a deterministic bias given by a power lawrelating the dark matter density field to the expected halo or galaxy field.coherent redshift-space distortions are corrected in a gibbs-sampling procedureby moving the galaxies from redshift-space to real-space according to thepeculiar motions derived from the recovered density field using linear theorywith the option to include tidal field corrections from second order lagrangianperturbation theory. the virialised distortions are corrected by samplingcandidate real-space positions (being in the neighbourhood of the observationsalong the line of sight), which are compatible with the bulk flow correctedredshift-space position adding a random dispersion term in high densitycollapsed regions. the latter are defined according to the eigenvalues of thehessian. this approach presents an alternative method to estimate the distancesto galaxies using the three dimensional spatial information, and assumingisotropy. hence the number of applications is very broad. in this work we showthe potential of this method to constrain the growth rate up to $k$ ~ 0.3 $h$mpc$^{-1}$. furthermore it could be useful to correct for photo-metric redshifterrors, and to obtain improved bao reconstructions.

1510.04900	cosmicflows constrained local universe simulations	this paper combines observational datasets and cosmological simulations togenerate realistic numerical replicas of the nearby universe. these latter areexcellent laboratories for studies of the non-linear process of structureformation in our neighborhood. with measurements of radial peculiar velocitiesin the local universe (cosmicflows-2) and a newly developed technique, weproduce constrained local universe simulations (clues). to assess the qualityof these constrained simulations, we compare them with random simulations aswell as with local observations. the cosmic variance, defined as the meanone-sigma scatter of cell-to-cell comparison between two fields, issignificantly smaller for the constrained simulations than for the randomsimulations. within the inner part of the box where most of the constraintsare, the scatter is smaller by a factor 2 to 3 on a 5 mpc/h scale with respectto that found for random simulations. this one-sigma scatter obtained whencomparing the simulated and the observation-reconstructed velocity fields isonly 104 +/- 4 km/s i.e. the linear theory threshold. these two resultsdemonstrate that these simulations are in agreement with each other and withthe observations of our neighborhood. for the first time, simulationsconstrained with observational radial peculiar velocities resemble the localuniverse up to a distance of 150 mpc/h on a scale of a few tens of megaparsecs.when focusing on the inner part of the box, the resemblance with our cosmicneighborhood extends to a few megaparsecs (&lt; 5 mpc/h). the simulations providea proper large scale environment for studies of the formation of nearbyobjects.

1511.00011	cosmic dawn (coda): the first radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of  reionization and galaxy formation in the local universe	cosmic reionization by starlight from early galaxies affected theirevolution, thereby impacting reionization, itself. star formation suppression,for example, may explain the observed underabundance of local group dwarfsrelative to n-body predictions for cold dark matter. reionization modellingrequires simulating volumes large enough ~(100 mpc)^3 to sample reionization"patchiness", while resolving millions of galaxy sources above ~10^8 msun,combining gravitational and gas dynamics with radiative transfer. modelling thelocal group requires initial cosmological density fluctuations pre-selected toform the well-known structures of the local universe today. cosmic dawn("coda") is the first such fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation ofreionization of the local universe. our new hybrid cpu-gpu code,ramses-cudaton, performs hundreds of radiative transfer and ionizationrate-solver timesteps on the gpus for each hydro-gravity timestep on the cpus.coda simulated (91 mpc)^3 with 4096^3 particles and cells, to redshift 4.23, onornl supercomputer titan, utilizing 8192 cores and 8192 gpus. globalreionization ended slightly later than observed. however, a simple temporalrescaling which brings the evolution of ionized fraction into agreement withobservations also reconciles ionizing flux density, cosmic star formationhistory, cmb electron scattering optical depth and galaxy uv luminosityfunction with their observed values. haloes below ~3 x 10^9 msun were severelyaffected by the rising uv background: photoionization heating suppressed theirstar formation. for most of reionization, star formation was dominated byhaloes between 10^10 - 10^11msun. intergalactic filaments display sheathedstructures, with hot envelopes surrounding cooler cores, but do notself-shield, unlike regions denser than 100 rho_average.

1511.03731	nifty galaxy cluster simulations ii: radiative models	we have simulated the formation of a massive galaxy cluster (m$_{200}^{\rmcrit}$ = 1.1$\times$10$^{15}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$) in a $\lambda$cdm universe using10 different codes (ramses, 2 incarnations of arepo and 7 of gadget), modelinghydrodynamics with full radiative subgrid physics. these codes includesmoothed-particle hydrodynamics (sph), spanning traditional and advanced sphschemes, adaptive mesh and moving mesh codes. our goal is to study theconsistency between simulated clusters modeled with different radiativephysical implementations - such as cooling, star formation and agn feedback. wecompare images of the cluster at $z=0$, global properties such as mass, andradial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. we findthat, with respect to non-radiative simulations, dark matter is more centrallyconcentrated, the extent not simply depending on the presence/absence of agnfeedback. the scatter in global quantities is substantially higher than fornon-radiative runs. intriguingly, adding radiative physics seems to have washedaway the marked code-based differences present in the entropy profile seen fornon-radiative simulations in sembolini et al. (2015): radiative physics +classic sph can produce entropy cores. furthermore, the inclusion/absence ofagn feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellarcontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and afalling central entropy profile. however, agn feedback does strongly affect theoverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducingsensibly the stellar fraction.

1511.06188	mergers and the outside-in formation of dwarf spheroidals	we use a cosmological simulation of the formation of the local group toexplore the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidalgalaxies. we find that a number of simulated dwarfs form "outside-in", with anold, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentratedmetal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like sculptor orsextans. we focus on a few examples where stars form in two populationsdistinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. thespatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; theold stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young populationforms largely in situ. the older component results from a first episode of starformation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects ofstellar feedback and reionization. the younger component forms when a lateaccretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. the effect of mergers isto disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasingtheir central density relative to the young population. we argue thatdwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systemswith multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of ageand metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.

astro-ph;0004333	on the supernovae heating of intergalactic medium	we present estimates of the energy input from supernovae (sne) into theintergalactic medium using (i) recent measurements of si and fe abundances inthe intracluster medium (icm) and (ii) self-consistent gasdynamical galaxyformation simulations that include processes of cooling, star formation, snefeedback, and a multi-phase model of the interstellar medium. we estimate theenergy input from observed abundances using two different assumptions: (i)spatial uniformity of metal abundances in the icm and (ii) radial abundancegradients. we show that these two cases lead to energy input estimates whichare different by an order of magnitude, highlighting a need for observationaldata on large-scale abundance gradients in clusters. analysis of galaxyformation results and estimates from observed fe and si abundances indicatesthat the sne energy input can be important for heating of the entire icm(providing energy of ~1 kev per particle) only if the icm abundances areuniform and the efficiency of gas heating by sn explosions is close to 100%(implying that all of the initial kinetic energy of the explosion goes intoheating of the icm). we conclude that unless these most favorable conditionsare met, sne alone are unlikely to provide sufficient energy input to heat allof the cluster icm and may need to be supplemented or even substituted by someother heating process(es).

astro-ph;0501304	dwarf galaxies in voids: suppressing star formation with photo-heating	we study structure formation in cosmological void regions usinghigh-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. despite being significantlyunderdense, voids are populated abundantly with small dark matter halos whichshould appear as dwarf galaxies if their star formation is not suppressedsignificantly. we here investigate to which extent the cosmologicaluv-background photo-evaporates baryons out of halos of dwarf galaxies, andthereby limits their cooling and star formation rates. assuming a haardt &amp;madau uv-background with reionisation at redshift z=6, our samples of simulatedgalaxies show that halos with masses below a characteristic mass of m_c(z=0) =6.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} m_sun are baryon-poor, but in general not completely empty,because baryons that are in the condensed cold phase or are already locked upin stars resist evaporation. in halos with mass m &lt; m_c, we find thatphoto-heating suppresses further cooling of gas. the redshift and uv-backgrounddependent characteristic mass m_c(z) can be understood from the equilibriumtemperature between heating and cooling at a characteristic overdensity of\delta ~ 1000. if a halo is massive enough to compress gas to this densitydespite the presence of the uv background, gas is free to `enter' the condensedphase and cooling continues in the halo, otherwise it stalls. by analysing themass accretion histories of dwarf galaxies in voids, we show that they canbuild up a significant amount of condensed mass at early times before the epochof reionisation. later on, the amount of mass in this phase remains roughlyconstant, but the masses of the dark matter halos continue to increase.(abridged)

astro-ph;0501452	imprints of mass accretion on properties of galaxy clusters	a large scale sph+n-body simulation (gadget) of the concordance lcdm universeis used to investigate orientation and angular momentum of galaxy clusters atz=0 in connection with their recent accretion histories. the basic clustersample comprises the 3000 most massive friends-of-friends halos found in the500 mpc/h simulation box. two disjoint sub-samples are constructed, using themass ratio of the two most massive progenitors at z=0.5 m_2 / m_1 (m_1 &lt; m_2),namely a recent major merger sample and a steady accretion mode sample. themass of clusters in the merger sample is on average ~43% larger than the massof the two progenitors (m_1 + m_2), whereas in the steady accretion mode samplea smaller increase of ~25% is found. the separation vector connecting the twomost massive progenitor halos at z=0.5 is strongly correlated with theorientation of the cluster at z=0. the angular momentum of the clusters in therecent major merger sample tends to be parallel to orbital angular momentum ofthe two progenitors, whereas the angular momentum of the steady accretion modesample is mainly determined by the angular momentum of the most massiveprogenitor. the long range correlations for the major and the minor principalaxes of cluster pairs extend to distances of ~100 mpc/h. weak angular momentumcorrelations are found for distances &lt; 20 mpc/h. within these ranges the majoraxes tend to be aligned with the connecting line of the cluster pairs whereasminor axes and angular momenta tend to be perpendicular to this line. aseparate analysis of the two sub-samples reveals that the long rangecorrelations are independent of the mass accretion mode. thus orientation andangular momentum of galaxy clusters is mainly determined by the accretion alongthe filaments independently of the particular accretion mode.

astro-ph;0703164	shape, spin and baryon fraction of clusters in the marenostrum universe	the marenostrum universe is one of the largest cosmological  sph simulation done so far. it consists of $1024^3$ dark and  $1024^3$ gas particles in a box of 500 $h^{-1}$ mpc on a side. here we studythe shapes and spins of the dark matter and gas components of the 10,000 mostmassive objects extracted from the simulation as well as the gas fraction inthose objects. we find that the shapes of objects tend to be prolate both inthe dark matter and gas. there is a clear dependence of shape on halo mass, themore massive ones being less spherical than the less massive objects. the gasdistribution is nevertheless much more spherical than the dark matter, althoughthe triaxiality parameters of gas and dark matter differ only by a few percentand it increases with cluster mass. the spin parameters of gas and dark mattercan be well fitted by a lognormal distribution function. on average, the spinof gas is 1.4 larger than the spin of dark matter. we find a similar behaviorfor the spins at higher redshifts, with a slightly decrease of the spin ratiosto 1.16 at $z=1.$ the cosmic normalized baryon fraction in the entire clustersample ranges from $y_b = 0.94$, at $z=1$ to $y_b = 0.92$ at $z=0$. at bothredshifts we find a slightly, but statistically significant decrease of $y_b$with cluster mass.

astro-ph;9712281	numerical simulations of galaxy formation: cooling, heating, star  formation	formation of luminous matter in the universe is a complicated process, whichincludes many processes and components. it is the vastly different scalesinvolved in the process (from star formation on few parsec scales to galaxyclusters and superclusters on megaparsecs scales) and numerous ill-understoodprocesses, which make the whole field a maze of unsolved, but excitingproblems. we present new approximations for numerical treatment of multiphaseism forming stars. the approximations were tested and calibrated usingn-body+fluid numerical simulations. we specifically target issues related witheffects of unresolved lumpinesses of the gas. we show that the degree offreedom is much smaller than naively expected because of self-regulating natureof the process of global star formation. one of the problems of numericalsimulations is related with the uncertainties of approximation of thesupernovae (sn) feedback. it is often assumed that the feedback is mainly dueto momentum transferred by sn in to the ism. we argue that this may not betrue. we present a realistic example of gas actively forming stars with shortcooling time for which the sf feedback is important, but the kinetic energy ofthe gas motion due to sn is negligibly small as compared with the thermalenergy of gas.

0705.4477	the future of the local large scale structure: the roles of dark matter  and dark energy	we study the distinct effects of dark matter and dark energy on the futureevolution of nearby large scale structures using constrained n-bodysimulations. we contrast a model of cold dark matter and a cosmologicalconstant (lcdm) with an open cdm (ocdm) model with the same matter densityomega_m =0.3 and the same hubble constant h=0.7. already by the time the scalefactor increased by a factor of 6 (29 gyr from now in lcdm; 78 gyr from now inocdm) the comoving position of the local group is frozen. well before thatepoch the two most massive members of the local group, the milky way andandromeda, will merge. however, as the expansion rates of the scale factor inthe two models are different, the local group will be receding in physicalcoordinates from virgo exponentially in a lcdm model and at a roughly constantvelocity in an ocdm model. more generally, in comoving coordinates the futurelarge scale structure will look like a sharpened image of the presentstructure: the skeleton of the cosmic web will remain the same, but clusterswill be more `isolated' and the filaments will become thinner. this impliesthat the long-term fate of large scale structure as seen in comovingcoordinates is determined primarily by the matter density. we conclude thatalthough the lcdm model is accelerating at present due to its dark energycomponent while the ocdm model is non accelerating, their large scale structurein the future will look very similar in comoving coordinates.
