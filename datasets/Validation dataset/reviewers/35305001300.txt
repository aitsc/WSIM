In view of the characteristics of laser remelting, a travel heat source combined with the surface loads was designed by analyzing both the temperature relativity of the thermal physical parameters of material and the latent heat and the effect of convection radiation on temperature field. A computing model of transient temperature field of three-dimension moving laser remelting on 0.45% carbon steel was built up by using ANSYS parametric design language. The results show that increasing laser power has little influence on the thickness of the hardened zone, however, the surface morphology of the remelted track is coarse due to the great increase of the molten pool. Compared with laser power, scanning rate has less influence on the temperature field distribution of the workpiece. Three different zones form after laser remelting, i.e. remelted zone, hardened zone and substrate. The obtained experimental results show a good agreement with the simulation results, which indicates that the established numerical model is correct and reliable. The model provides a guide for study on the formation and solidification mechanism of laser remelting and the results can be used to optimize the processing parameters.

Theoretical analysis reveals that the circuit current is determined mainly by the diode at the discharge end and the body resistance of silicon. With the discharge continuing, the current is blocked by the increase of avalanche voltage of the diode due to high temperature, but is boosted by the decrease of body resistance due to heat transfer. As a result, a U-type discharge current curve is generated; i.e., the discharge current is high on the both sides and flat in the middle. To verify the theoretical analysis, a P-type solar silicon with resistivity of 2.1 Ω·cm was machined by WEDM in experiments, and a single pulse discharge current waveform was picked up.

A thermal-mechanical coupling finite element model of laser cladding by using uniform shape and convex shape laser spot was established. The results show that laser cladding with uniform shape spot has a typical character of quick heating and cooling rate as the conventional laser manufacturing. However, laser cladding with convex shape beam could preheat and slow cooling rate of sample to some extent, and reduce the temperature gradient between the clad area and non-clad zone. In addition, the thermal stress of clad layer with convex shape laser beam is lower than the uniform shape laser spot dose, so it can effectively reduce crack of the clad layer.

The effect of different process parameters (laser power, scanning rate) on the micro-topography, composition and micro-hardness of the sintered area is studied by means of scanning electron telescope, X-ray diffractometer and micro-hardness tester. At a laser power of 900 W and a scanning rate of 0.7 m/min, the test shows good laser sintering performance and high sintered density. Meanwhile, it indicates that WC particles are molten into dendritic crystals and evenly dispersed in the matrix, and that the reinforced particles are arrested by the solid-liquid interface. The fact that WC particles are well dispersed in the matrix improves the performance of the bulk sintering. According to the test, we have obtained a set of optimal process parameters in production of sintered metal bulks, high in hardness and compact in construction. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

79955060416	Research on electrical discharge machining characteristics and mode of providing power of germanium crystal	Unilateral conductibility and superficial electrochemical properties represented in n-type germanium crystal electrical discharge machining (EDM) are researched in a bid to reveal the special characteristics of this material during EDM process. It is discovered that the n-type germanium crystal EDM cannot be sustained, and this is due to electrolysis emergence on the contact surface of providing power and consequently forming non-conducting insoluble oxide blocking the gap between the contact surfaces. In order to prevent electrolysis from occurring, a method to apply carbon paste coating on the contact surface is designed. On the other hand, for the purpose of removing non-conducting insoluble oxide on the contact surface, the method of electrode servo power providing is designed. Then the two power providing methods are compared. Results show that the former is able to improve the power providing condition of n-type germanium crystal for a certain period of time but can't achieve the long-term stability, while the latter can assure the steady lower inter-electrode resistance and the persistent effect of power providing. Through the wire-cut EDM (WEDM) experiment, special phenomena of semiconductor material in electrical discharge machining are preliminarily revealed, which include inter-electrode current climbing up, thermal stress erosion being dominant in the discharge erosion and polarity effect required to be analyzed in depth. © 2011 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

The unit energy erosion volume of single-crystal silicon is 4 times as large as that of 45 steel by the calculation, from which an idea was proposed that the erosion process of single-crystal silicon is the result of a combined action of melting erosion and thermal stress spalling. The volume of melting erosion and thermal stress spalling of the silicon was calculated from simulation, the volume of thermal stress spalling is 4.6 times as large as that of melting erosion, this result is basically consistent with energy analysis result.

Through attaching mechanical vibration to a piece of silicon, the efficiency of perforation under the conditions of different amplitudes and frequencies was studied. Experiments show that with the larger amplitude, EDM efficiency first increases and then reduces; as the frequency becomes larger, the efficiency of perforation improves gradually. The reasons are that: the larger amplitude, the better the chip removal, the lower the short-circuit rate, the higher the discharge rate. However, when the amplitude is greater than the discharge gap, the silicon hits with the tool electrode directly, the discharge rate declines. On the other hand, the larger the frequency, the higher the pulse utilization rate. At last, a hole whose diameter is 0.3 mm and the ratio of depth to diameter is 25.3 and a equilateral triangle hole whose side is 0.9 mm were achieved on P-type silicon whose resistivity is 2.1 Ω · cm.

Based on the simulation, using swinging jet-electrodeposition method, it was easier for metal ions to reach and deposit on inside of the already deposited dendrite clusters, therefore, the branch-like morphology of fractal growth was altered and the porous interlaced dendrites at different jet speeds and electrolyte temperatures were obtained. Results indicate that, as the depositing probability decreases, the formation of dendrite clusters turns into dense interlaced structure; as the jet speed increases, the dendritic growth has an obvious change into interlaced, porous and uniform structure with enlarged pores. When the jet speed is highest, the formation of the dendrite changes into dense growth again. Meanwhile, the fractal dimension decreases along with the increase of jetting speed. As the electrolyte temperature increases, dendrite morphology changes to dense structure, accompanied by an increase in the fractal dimension.

Subsequently, with layer by layer guidance in scanning and swinging jet-electrodeposition, the dendrites were guided to interlace with each other along the scanning direction, forming three-dimensional porous tissues. The porous tissues under different swinging numbers and step-sizes were analyzed and the controllable interlaced growth model of dendrites was established at the same time. The result shows that the morphological evolution of porous tissues proves the accuracy of this growth model. With a small swinging number, the neighbor dendrites are difficult to interlace with each other. When the swinging number is relatively large the massive branches come into being at the interlaced spots along the horizontal direction. As the step-size increases, the pores of porous tissues become larger in size. The morphology of porous tissues is well controlled by the regulation of process parameters and control conditions.

As the deposition current density changed, the coating microstructure shifted from a cellular-like to a non-cellular one that was observed to have a dense, uniform and smooth surface. In addition, the preferred orientation became the (111) plane when the coating was deposited with an optimum current density of 39-8 A dm22.
