0902.4759	non-gaussianity as a probe of the physics of the primordial universe and  the astrophysics of the low redshift universe	a new and powerful probe of the origin and evolution of structures in theuniverse has emerged and been actively developed over the last decade. in thecoming decade, non-gaussianity, i.e., the study of non-gaussian contributionsto the correlations of cosmological fluctuations, will become an importantprobe of both the early and the late universe. specifically, it will play aleading role in furthering our understanding of two fundamental aspects ofcosmology and astrophysics: (i) the physics of the very early universe thatcreated the primordial seeds for large-scale structures, and (ii) thesubsequent growth of structures via gravitational instability and gas physicsat later times. to date, observations of fluctuations in the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) and the large-scale structure of the universe (lss) havefocused largely on the gaussian contribution as measured by the two-pointcorrelations (or the power spectrum) of density fluctuations. however, an evengreater amount of information is contained in non-gaussianity and a largediscovery space therefore still remains to be explored. many observationalprobes can be used to measure non-gaussianity, including cmb, lss,gravitational lensing, lyman-alpha forest, 21-cm fluctuations, and theabundance of rare objects such as clusters of galaxies and high-redshiftgalaxies. not only does the study of non-gaussianity maximize the sciencereturn from a plethora of present and future cosmological experiments andobservations, but it also carries great potential for important discoveries inthe coming decade.

0910.1066	axion cosmology revisited	the misalignment mechanism for axion production depends on thetemperature-dependent axion mass. the latter has recently been determinedwithin the interacting instanton liquid model (iilm), and provides for thefirst time a well-motivated axion mass for all temperatures. we reexamine theconstraints placed on the axion parameter space in the light of this new massfunction. we find an accurate and updated constraint $ f_a \le 2.8(\pm2)\times10^{11}\units{gev}$ or $m_a \ge 21(\pm2) \units{\mu ev}$ from the misalignmentmechanism in the classic axion window (thermal scenario). however, this issuperseded by axion string radiation which leads to $ f_a \lesssim3.2^{+4}_{-2} \times 10^{10} \units{gev}$ or $m_a \gtrsim 0.20 ^{+0.2}_{-0.1}\units{mev}$. in this analysis, we take care to precisely compute the effectivedegrees of freedom and, to fill a gap in the literature, we present accuratefitting formulas. we solve the evolution equations exactly, and find thatanalytic results used to date generally underestimate the full numericalsolution by a factor 2-3. in the inflationary scenario, axions induceisocurvature fluctuations and constrain the allowed inflationary scale $h_i$.taking anharmonic effects into account, we show that these bounds are actuallyweaker than previously computed. considering the fine-tuning issue of themisalignment angle in the whole of the anthropic window, we derive new boundswhich open up the inflationary window near $\theta_a \to \pi$. in particular,we find that inflationary dark matter axions can have masses as high as0.01--1$\units{mev}$, covering the whole thermal axion range, with values of$h_i$ up to $10^9$gev. quantum fluctuations during inflation exclude dominantdark matter axions with masses above $m_a\lesssim 1$mev.

0911.2491	cosmic string power spectrum, bispectrum and trispectrum	we use analytic calculations of the post-recombination gravitational effectsof cosmic strings to estimate the resulting cmb power spectrum, bispectrum andtrispectrum. we place a particular emphasis on multipole regimes relevant forforthcoming cmb experiments, notably the planck satellite. these calculationsuse a flat sky approximation, generalising previous work by integrating stringcontributions from last scattering to the present day, finding the dominantcontributions to the correlators for multipoles l &gt; 50. we find a well-behavedshape for the string bispectrum (without divergences) which is easilydistinguishable from the inflationary bispectra which possess significantacoustic peaks. we estimate that the nonlinearity parameter characterising thebispectrum is approximately f_nl \sim -20 (given present string constraintsfrom the cmb power spectrum. we also apply these unequal time correlatormethods to calculate the trispectrum for parrallelogram configurations, againvalid over a large range of angular scales relevant for wmap and planck, aswell as on very small angular scales. we find that, unlike the bispectrum whichis suppressed by symmetry considerations, the trispectrum for cosmic strings islarge. our current estimate for the trispectrum parameter is tau_nl \sim 10^5,which may provide one of the strongest constraints on the string model asestimators for the trispectrum are developed.

0912.5516	general cmb and primordial bispectrum estimation i: mode expansion,  map-making and measures of f_nl	we present a detailed implementation of two bispectrum estimation methodswhich can be applied to general non-separable primordial and cmb bispectra. themethod exploits bispectrum mode decompositions on the domain of allowedwavenumber or multipole values. concrete mode examples constructed fromsymmetrised tetrahedral polynomials are given, demonstrating rapid convergencefor known bispectra. we use these modes to generate simulated cmb maps of highresolution (l &gt; 2000) given an arbitrary primordial power spectrum andbispectrum or an arbitrary late-time cmb angular power spectrum and bispectrum.by extracting coefficients for the same separable basis functions from anobservational map, we are able to present an efficient and general f_nlestimator for a given theoretical model. the estimator has two versionscomparing theoretical and observed coefficients at either primordial or latetimes, thus encompassing a wider range of models, including secondaryanisotropies, lensing and cosmic strings. we provide examples and validation ofboth f_nl estimation methods by direct comparison with simulations in awmap-realistic context. in addition, we show how the full bispectrum can beextracted from observational maps using these mode expansions, irrespective ofthe theoretical model under study. we also propose a universal definition ofthe bispectrum parameter f_nl for more consistent comparison betweentheoretical models. we obtain wmap5 estimates of f_nl for the equilateral modelfrom both our primordial and late-time estimators which are consistent witheach other, as well as with results already published in the literature. thesegeneral bispectrum estimation methods should prove useful for the analysis ofnongaussianity in the planck satellite data, as well as in other contexts.
{fenge}
1004.2915	general cmb and primordial trispectrum estimation	we present trispectrum estimation methods which can be applied to generalnon-separable primordial and cmb trispectra. we present a general optimalestimator for the connected part of the trispectrum, for which we derive aquadratic term to incorporate the effects of inhomogeneous noise and masking.we describe a general algorithm for creating simulated maps with givenarbitrary (and independent) power spectra, bispectra and trispectra. we proposea universal definition of the trispectrum parameter $t_{nl}$, so that theintegrated bispectrum on the observational domain can be consistently comparedbetween theoretical models. we define a shape function for the primordialtrispectrum, together with a shape correlator and a useful parametrisation forvisualizing the trispectrum. we derive separable analytic cmb solutions in thelarge-angle limit for constant and local models. we present separable modedecompositions which can be used to describe any primordial or cmb bispectra ontheir respective wavenumber or multipole domains. by extracting coefficients ofthese separable basis functions from an observational map, we are able topresent an efficient estimator for any given theoretical model with anonseparable trispectrum. the estimator has two manifestations, comparing thetheoretical and observed coefficients at either primordial or late times. thesemode decomposition methods are numerically tractable with order $l^5$operations for the cmb estimator and approximately order $l^6$ for the generalprimordial estimator (reducing to order $l^3$ in both cases for a special classof models). we also demonstrate how the trispectrum can be reconstructed fromobservational maps using these methods.
{fenge}
1006.1642	the cmb bispectrum	we use a separable mode expansion estimator with wmap data to estimate thebispectrum for all the primary families of non-gaussian models. we review thelate-time mode expansion estimator methodology which can be applied to anynon-separable primordial and cmb bispectrum model, and we demonstrate how themethod can be used to reconstruct the cmb bispectrum from an observational map.we extend the previous validation of the general estimator using local mapsimulations. we apply the estimator to the coadded wmap 5-year data,reconstructing the wmap bispectrum using $l&lt;500$ multipoles and $n=31$orthonormal 3d eigenmodes. we constrain all popular nearly scale-invariantmodels, ensuring that the theoretical bispectrum is well-described by aconvergent mode expansion. constraints from the local model $ \fnl=54.4\pm29.4$ and the equilateral model $\fnl=143.5\pm 151.2$ ($\fnl = 25.1\pm 26.4$)are consistent with previously published results. (here, we use a nonlinearityparameter $\fnl$ normalised to the local case, to allow more direct comparisonbetween different models.) notable new constraints from our method includethose for the constant model $\fnl = 35.1 \pm 27.4 $, the flattened model $\fnl= 35.4\pm 29.2$, and warm inflation $\fnl = 10.3\pm 27.2$. we investigatefeature models surveying a wide parameter range in both the scale and phase,and we find no significant evidence of non-gaussianity in the models surveyed.we propose a measure $\barfnl$ for the total integrated bispectrum and findthat the measured value is consistent with the null hypothesis that cmbanisotropies obey gaussian statistics. we argue that this general bispectrumsurvey with the wmap data represents the best evidence for gaussianity to dateand we discuss future prospects, notably from the planck satellite.

1008.1730	rapid separable analysis of higher order correlators in large scale  structure	we present an efficient separable approach to the estimation andreconstruction of the bispectrum and the trispectrum from observational (orsimulated) large scale structure data. this is developed from general cmb(poly-)spectra methods which exploit the fact that the bispectrum andtrispectrum in the literature can be represented by a separable mode expansionwhich converges rapidly (with $n_\textrm{max}={\cal{o}}(30)$ terms). with aneffective grid resolution $l_\textrm{max}$ (number of particles/grid points$n=l_\textrm{max}^3$), we present a bispectrum estimator which requires only${\cal o}(n_\textrm{max} \times l_\textrm{max}^3)$ operations, along with acorresponding method for direct bispectrum reconstruction. this method isextended to the trispectrum revealing an estimator which requires only ${\calo}(n_\textrm{max}^{4/3} \times l_\textrm{max}^3)$ operations. the complexity incalculating the trispectrum in this method is now involved in the originaldecomposition and orthogonalisation process which need only be performed oncefor each model. however, for non-diagonal trispectra these processes presentlittle extra difficulty and may be performed in ${\cal o}(l_\textrm{max}^4)$operations. a discussion of how the methodology may be applied to thequadspectrum is also given. an efficient algorithm for the generation ofarbitrary nongaussian initial conditions for use in n-body codes using thisseparable approach is described. this prescription allows for the production ofnongaussian initial conditions for arbitrary bispectra and trispectra. a briefoutline of the key issues involved in parameter estimation, particularly in thenon-linear regime, is also given.

1012.6039	optimal trispectrum estimators and wmap constraints	we present an implementation of an optimal cmb trispectrum estimator whichaccounts for anisotropic noise and incomplete sky coverage. we use a generalseparable mode expansion which can and has been applied to constrain bothprimordial and late-time models. we validate our methods on large angularscales using known analytic results in the sachs-wolfe limit. we present thefirst near-optimal trispectrum constraints from wmap data on the cubic term oflocal model inflation $ g_{\rm nl} = (1.6 \pm 7.0)\times 10^5$, for theequilateral model $t_{\rm nl}^{\rm{equil}}=(-3.11\pm 7.5)\times 10^6 $ and forthe constant model $t_{\rm nl}^{\rm{const}}=(-1.33\pm 3.62)$. these results,particularly the equilateral constraint, are relevant to a number ofwell-motivated models (such as dbi and k-inflation) with closely correlatedtrispectrum shapes. we also use the trispectrum signal predicted for cosmicstrings to provide a conservative upper limit on the string tension $g\mu \le1.1\times 10^{-6}$ (at 95% confidence), which is largely background and modelindependent. all these new trispectrum results are consistent with a gaussianuniverse. we discuss the importance of constraining general classes oftrispectra using these methods and the prospects for higher precision with theplanck satellite.
{fenge}
1105.2791	optimal polyspectra estimation	we show that full inverse covariance weighting can be naturally incorporatedinto modal estimation methods making them optimal for the cmb power spectrum,bispectrum and trispectrum, as well as in other 3d applications. modalestimation methods are highly efficient requiring inversion of only an nmax xnmax covariance matrix, where nmax is the limited number of modes needed todescribe both the theoretical model and the noise which affects it (in contrastto the full lmax^2 x lmax^2 inverse covariance weighting). a wmap resolutionimplementation for modal bispectrum estimation is discussed and shown to yieldoptimal constraints for local and other models at lmax =500 and nmax &lt;= 50. wealso discuss further improvements by characterising and preconditioning thecovariance matrix using a single bispectrum variance shape induced by the noiseand mask. we describe optimal modal estimation in general terms applicable topolyspectra of any order in a formalism that can be extended beyond theisotropic case. we use the example of anisotropic noise in bispectrumestimation to show the completeness of the isotropic modal basis and thenecessity of subtracting a linear estimator term for optimality, removingcross-terms in the variance. we briefly discuss applications to the cmb powerspectrum and trispectrum, as well as large-scale structure.

1204.6318	effects and detectability of quasi-single field inflation in the  large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background	quasi-single field inflation predicts a peculiar momentum dependence in thesqueezed limit of the primordial bispectrum which smoothly interpolates betweenthe local and equilateral models. this dependence is directly related to themass of the isocurvatons in the theory which is determined by thesupersymmetry. therefore, in the event of detection of a non-zero primordialbispectrum, additional constraints on the parameter controlling themomentum-dependence in the squeezed limit becomes an important question. weexplore the effects of these non-gaussian initial conditions on large-scalestructure and the cosmic microwave background, with particular attention to thegalaxy power spectrum at large scales and scale-dependence corrections togalaxy bias. we determine the simultaneous constraints on the two parametersdescribing the qsf bispectrum that we can expect from upcoming large-scalestructure and cosmic microwave background observations. we find that forrelatively large values of the non-gaussian amplitude parameters, but stillwell within current uncertainties, galaxy power spectrum measurements will beable to distinguish the qsf scenario from the predictions of the local model. acmb likelihood analysis, as well as fisher matrix analysis, shows that there isalso a range of parameter values for which planck data may be able distinguishbetween qsf models and the related local and equilateral shapes. given thedifferent observational weightings of the cmb and lss results, degeneracies canbe significantly reduced in a joint analysis.

1207.5678	fast estimation of gravitational and primordial bispectra in large scale  structures	we present the implementation of a fast estimator for the full dark matterbispectrum of a three-dimensional particle distribution relying on a separablemodal expansion of the bispectrum. the computational cost of accuratebispectrum estimation is negligible relative to simulation evolution, so theisotropic bispectrum can be used as a standard diagnostic whenever the powerspectrum is evaluated. as an application we measure the evolution ofgravitational and primordial dark matter bispectra in $n$-body simulations withgaussian and non-gaussian initial conditions of the local, equilateral,orthogonal and flattened shape. the results are compared to theoretical modelsusing a 3d visualisation, 3d shape correlations and the cumulative bispectrumsignal-to-noise, all of which can be evaluated extremely quickly. our measuredbispectra are determined by $\mathcal{o}(50)$ coefficients, which can be usedas fitting formulae in the nonlinear regime and for non-gaussian initialconditions. in the nonlinear regime with $k&lt;2h\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-1}$, we find anexcellent correlation between the measured dark matter bispectrum and a simplemodel based on a `constant' bispectrum plus a (nonlinear) tree-levelgravitational bispectrum. in the same range for non-gaussian simulations, wefind an excellent correlation between the measured additional bispectrum and aconstant model plus a (nonlinear) tree-level primordial bispectrum. wedemonstrate that the constant contribution to the non-gaussian bispectrum canbe understood as a time-shift of the constant mode in the gravitationalbispectrum, which is motivated by the one-halo model. the final amplitude ofthis extra non-gaussian constant contribution is directly related to theinitial amplitude of the constant mode in the primordial bispectrum. we alsocomment on the effects of regular grid and glass initial conditions on thebispectrum.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5063	planck 2013 results. ii. low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the data processing pipeline of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi) data processing centre (dpc) to create and characterizefull-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44 and 70ghz. in particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,starting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. data are continuouslycalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. skysignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based onsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. noise propertiesare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. a destriping code(madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information intosky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. noise covariancematrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on lfi and planckproducts, are also produced. main beams are estimated down to the -20 db levelusing jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration ofthe focal plane.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).
{fenge}
1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1410.4860	cmb power spectrum of nambu-goto cosmic strings	we improve predictions of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) powerspectrum induced by cosmic strings by using source terms obtained fromnambu-goto network simulations in an expanding universe. we use threehigh-resolution cosmic string simulations that cover the entire period fromrecombination until late-time $\lambda$ domination to calculate unequal timecorrelators (uetcs) for scalar, vector and tensor components of thecosmic-string energy-momentum tensor. we calculate the cmb angular powerspectrum from strings in two ways. first, to aid comparison with previous work,we fit our simulated uetcs to those obtained from different parametercombinations from the unconnected segment model and then calculate the cmbpower spectra using these parameters to represent the string network. secondand more accurately, we decompose the uetcs into their correspondingeigenvalues and eigenvectors and input them directly into an einstein-boltzmannsolver to calculate the power spectrum for each of the three simulation timeperiods. we combine the three simulations together, using each of them in itsrelevant redshift range and we obtain overall power spectra in temperature andpolarisation channels. finally, we use the power spectra obtained with thelatest planck and bicep2 likelihoods to obtain constraints on the cosmic stringtension.

1410.5046	constraints on the nambu-goto cosmic string contribution to the cmb  power spectrum in light of new temperature and polarisation data	cosmic strings generate vector and tensor modes in the b-channel ofpolarization, as well as the usual temperature power spectrum and e-modepolarization spectrum. we use the power spectrum obtained from high-resolutionnambu-goto cosmic string simulations together with the planck and bicep2likelihoods to explore the degeneracies appearing between cosmic strings andother cosmological parameters in different inflationary scenarios, as well asthe constraints that can be imposed on cosmic strings in each of thesesituations. in standard $\lambda$cdm, the planck likelihood yields an upperlimit $g\mu&lt;1.49 \times 10^{-7}$ (95% confidence). we also analyse thepossibility of explaining the bb power spectrum signal recently detected by thebicep2 probe. we find that cosmic strings alone are able to explain only partof the b-mode polarization signal. apart from the standard $\lambda$cdm model,we look at the following non-minimal parameters: the running of the spectralindex, non-zero tensor-to-scalar ratio, additional degrees of freedom($n_{eff}$) and sterile neutrinos. we find that in both planck and bicep2scenarios adding $n_{eff}$ induces degeneracies between cosmic strings and$n_{eff}$ and other $\lambda$cdm parameters. with $n_{eff}$ a largercontribution from cosmic strings is allowed, even favoured, but after combiningwith large-scale structure data, such as baos, strings remain stronglyconstrained.

1410.5114	combining power spectrum and bispectrum measurements to detect  oscillatory features	the simplest inflationary models present us with few observable parameters todiscriminate between them. a detection of features in the spectra of primordialdensity perturbations could provide valuable insights and lead to stringenttests of models of the early universe. so far, searches for oscillatoryfeatures have not produced statistically significant results. in this work weconsider a combined search for features in the power spectrum and bispectrum.we show that possible dependencies between the estimates of feature modelamplitudes based on the two- and three-point correlators are largelystatistically independent under the assumption of the null hypothesis of anearly gaussian featureless cmb. building on this conclusion we propose anoptimal amplitude estimator for a combined search and study the look-elsewhereeffect in feature model surveys. in particular we construct analytic models forthe distribution of amplitude estimates that allow for a reliable assessment ofthe significance of potential findings. we also propose a well-behavedintegrated statistic that is designed to detect evidence for models exhibitingfeatures at multiple frequencies.

1412.6152	polyspectra searches for sharp oscillatory features in cosmic microwave  sky data	we undertake a thorough search for signatures of sharp oscillatory featuresin the wmap9 power spectrum and bispectrum as well as in the planck powerspectrum. for the first time, we carry out searches in both the power spectrumand bispectrum simultaneously, employing well-defined look-elsewhere statisticsto assess significances in a rigorous manner. developing efficient methods toscan power spectrum likelihoods for oscillatory features, we present resultsfor the phenomenological bare sine and cosine modulations, allowing validationagainst existing planck likelihood surveys, as well as templates that includethe correct sharp feature scaling. in particular, we study degeneracies betweenfeature and cosmological parameters. for frequencies beyond the scale set bythe acoustic peaks, the dependencies are realised through uninterestingadjustments of the comoving distance to last scattering. hence, it issufficient to keep cosmological parameters fixed and employ fast gaussianapproximations to the likelihood as a function of the feature model amplitude.in cases where results can be compared to the literature, our method showsexcellent agreement. we supplement results from the planck likelihood with ananalysis based on the planck smica component separation map that, working onthe assumption that the component separation algorithm is reliable, allows forthe inclusion of a larger sky fraction. in principle, this allows us to placethe most stringent constraints to date on the amplitudes of feature models inthe temperature power spectrum. invoking the wmap bispectrum, we perform acombined power spectrum and bispectrum survey. we use and slightly generalisestatistics developed in previous work to reliably judge the significance oflarge feature model amplitude estimates. we conclude that our results areentirely consistent with a featureless realisation of a gaussian cmb.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1510.03103	using inpainting to construct accurate cut-sky cmb estimators	the direct evaluation of manifestly optimal, cut-sky cmb power spectrum andbispectrum estimators is numerically very costly, due to the presence ofinverse-covariance filtering operations. this justifies the investigation ofalternative approaches. in this work, we mostly focus on an inpaintingalgorithm that was introduced in recent cmb analyses to cure cut-skysuboptimalities of bispectrum estimators. first, we show that inpainting canequally be applied to the problem of unbiased estimation of power spectra. wethen compare the performance of a novel inpainted cmb temperature powerspectrum estimator to the popular apodised pseudo-$c_l$ (pcl) method anddemonstrate, both numerically and with analytic arguments, that inpainted powerspectrum estimates significantly outperform pcl estimates. finally, we studythe case of cut-sky bispectrum estimators, comparing the performance of threedifferent approaches: inpainting, apodisation and a novel low-l leaning scheme.providing an analytic argument why the local shape is typically most affectedwe mainly focus on local type non-gaussianity. our results show that inpaintingallows to achieve optimality also for bispectrum estimation, but interestinglyalso demonstrate that appropriate apodisation, in conjunction with low-lcleaning, can lead to comparable accuracy.

1511.02022	characterising the matter bispectrum of large-scale structure: halo  models, perturbation theory and a three-shape model	we study the matter bispectrum of large-scale structure by comparing thepredictions of different perturbative and phenomenological models with the fullthree-dimensional bispectrum from $n$-body simulations estimated using modalmethods. we show that among the perturbative approaches, effective field theorysucceeds in extending the range of validity furthest on intermediate scales, atthe cost of free additional parameters. by studying the halo model, we showthat although it is satisfactory in the deeply non-linear regime, it predicts adeficit of power on intermediate scales, worsening at redshifts $z&gt;0$. bycomparison with the $n$-body bispectrum on those scales, we show that there isa significant squeezed component underestimated in the halo model. on the basisof these results, we propose a new `three-shape' model, based on thetree-level, squeezed and constant bispectrum shapes we identified in the halomodel; after calibration this fits the simulations on all scales and redshiftsof interest. this method provides a prototype bispectrum \textsc{halofit}-likemethodology that could be used to describe and test parameter dependencies andshould be relevant for the bispectrum of weak gravitational lensing and widerapplications.

0705.3395	velocity-dependent models for non-abelian/entangled string networks	we develop velocity-dependent models describing the evolution of stringnetworks that involve several types of interacting strings, each with adifferent tension. these incorporate the formation of y-type junctions withlinks stretching between colliding strings, while always ensuring energyconservation. these models can be used to describe network evolution fornon-abelian strings as well as cosmic superstrings. the application to $z_{n}$strings in which interactions are topologically constrained, demonstrates thata scaling regime is generally reached which involves a hierarchy of stringdensities with the lightest most abundant. we also study hybrid networks ofcosmic superstrings, where energetic considerations are more important indetermining interaction outcomes. we again find that networks tend towardsscaling, with the three lightest network components being dominant and havingcomparable number densities, while the heavier string states are suppressed. amore quantitative analysis depends on the precise calculation of the stringinteraction matrix using the underlying string or field theory. nevertheless,these results provide further evidence that the presence of junctions in astring network does not obstruct scaling.

astro-ph;9607130	relic gravitational waves from cosmic strings: updated constraints and  opportunities for detection	we examine the spectrum of gravitational radiation emitted by a network ofcosmic strings, with emphasis on the observational constraints and theopportunities for detection. the analysis improves over past work, as we use aphenomenological model for the radiation spectrum emitted by a cosmic stringloop. this model attempts to include the effect of the gravitationalback-reaction on the radiation emission by an individual loop with a highfrequency cut-off in the spectrum. comparison of the total spectrum due to anetwork of strings with the recently improved bound on the amplitude of astochastic gravitational wave background, due to measurements of noise inpulsar signal arrival times, allows us to exclude a range of values of $\mu$,the cosmic string linear mass density, for certain values of cosmic string andcosmological parameters. we find the conservative bound $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 5.4 (\pm1.1) \times 10^{-6}$ which is consistent with all other limits. we considervariations of the standard cosmological scenario, finding that an under dense,$\omega_0 &lt; 1$ universe has little effect on the spectrum, whereas the portionof the spectrum probed by gravitational wave detectors is strongly sensitive tothe thermal history of the cosmological fluid. we discuss the opportunity forthe observation of this stochastic background by resonant mass and laserinterferometer gravitational wave detectors.

astro-ph;9802216	cosmic axions	the current cosmological constraints on a dark matter axion are reviewed. wedescribe the basic mechanisms by which axions are created in the earlyuniverse, both in the standard thermal scenario in which axion strings form andin inflationary models. in the thermal scenario, the dominant process for axionproduction is through the radiative decay of an axion string network, whichimplies a dark matter axion of mass m_a ~ 100 microev with specified largeuncertainties. an inflationary phase does not affect this string bound if thereheat temperature is high t_reh &gt; f_a or, conversely, for t_reh &lt; f_a, if thehubble parameter during inflation is large h_1 &gt; f_a; in both cases, stringsform and we return to the standard picture with a m_a ~ 100 microev dark matteraxion. inflationary models with f_a &gt; h_1 &gt; t_reh face strong cmbr constraintsand require `anthropic misalignment' fine-tuning in order to produce a darkmatter axion; in this case, some inflation models are essentially incompatiblewith a detectable axion, while others can be engineered to allow a dark matteraxion anywhere in a huge mass range below m_a &lt; 1 mev. we endeavour to clarifythe sometimes confusing and contradictory literature on axion cosmology.

hep-ph;0107171	on the evolution of abelian-higgs string networks	we study the evolution of abelian-higgs string networks in large-scalenumerical simulations in both a static and expanding background. we measure theproperties of the network by tracing the motion of the string cores, for thefirst time estimating the rms velocity of the strings and the invariant stringlength, that is, the true network energy density. these results are comparedwith a velocity-dependent one scale model for cosmic string network evolution.this incorporates the contributions of loop production, massive radiation andfriction to the energy loss processes that are required for scaling evolution.we use this analysis as a basis for discussing the relative importance of thesemechanisms for the evolution of the network. we find that the loop distributionstatistics in the simulations are consistent with the long-time scaling of thenetwork being dominated by loop production. making justifiable extrapolationsto cosmological scales, these results appear to be consistent with the standardpicture of local string network evolution in which loop production andgravitational radiation are the dominant decay mechanisms.

hep-ph;0410349	cosmic string evolution in higher dimensions	we obtain the equations of motion for cosmic strings in extensions of the 3+1frw model with extra dimensions. from these we derive a generalisation of thevelocity-dependent one-scale (vos) model for cosmic string network evolutionwhich we apply, first, to a higher-dimensional isotropic $d+1$ frw model and,second, to a 3+1 frw model with static flat extra dimensions. in the formercase the string network does not achieve a scaling regime because of thediminishing rate of string intersections ($d&gt;3$), but this can be avoided inthe latter case by considering compact, small extra dimensions, for which thereis a reduced but still appreciable string intercommuting probability. we notethat the velocity components lying in the three expanding dimensions arehubble-damped, whereas those in the static extra dimensions are only veryweakly damped. this leads to the pathological possibility, in principle, thatstring motion in the three infinite dimensions can come to a halt preventingthe strings from intersecting, with the result that scaling is not achieved andthe strings irreversibly dominate the early universe. we note criteria by whichthis can be avoided, notably if the spatial structure of the network becomesessentially three-dimensional, as is expected for string networks produced inbrane inflation. applying our model to a brane inflation setting, we findscaling solutions in which the effective 3d string motion does not necessarilystop, but it is slowed down because of the excitations trapped in the extradimensions. these effects are likely to influence cosmic string networkevolution for a long period after formation and we discuss their more generalimplications.

0812.3413	the shape of primordial non-gaussianity and the cmb bispectrum	we present a set of formalisms for comparing, evolving and constrainingprimordial non-gaussian models through the cmb bispectrum. we describe improvedmethods for efficient computation of the full cmb bispectrum for any general(non-separable) primordial bispectrum, incorporating a flat sky approximationand a new cubic interpolation. we review all the primordial non-gaussian modelsin the present literature and calculate the cmb bispectrum up to l &lt;2000 foreach different model. this allows us to determine the observationalindependence of these models by calculating the cross-correlation of their cmbbispectra. we are able to identify several distinct classes of primordialshapes - including equilateral, local, warm, flat and feature (non-scaleinvariant) - which should be distinguishable given a significant detection ofcmb non-gaussianity. we demonstrate that a simple shape correlator provides afast and reliable method for determining whether or not cmb shapes are wellcorrelated. we use an eigenmode decomposition of the primordial shape tocharacterise and understand model independence. finally, we advocate astandardised normalisation method for $f_{nl}$ based on the shapeautocorrelator, so that observational limits and errors can be consistentlycompared for different models.
