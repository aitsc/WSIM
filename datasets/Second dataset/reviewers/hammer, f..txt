0901.0718	a forming, dust enshrouded disk at z=0.43: the first example of a late  type disk rebuilt after a major merger?	abreg: by combining hst/udf imagery with kinematics from vlt/giraffe wederive a physical model of distant galaxy j033245.11-274724.0 in a way similarto what can be done in the nearby universe. here we study the properties of adistant compact lirgs galaxy. given the photometric and spectro photometricaccuracies, we can decompose the galaxy in sub components and correct them forreddening. the galaxy is dominated by a dust enshrouded disk revealed by udfimagery. the disk radius is half that of the milky way and the galaxy have asfr=20mo/yr. morphology and kinematics show that gas and stars together spiralinwards rapidly to feed the disk and the central regions. a combined system ofa bar and two non rotating spiral arms regulates the material accretion,induces large sigma, with sigma larger than 100 km/s and redistributes theangular momentum (am). the detailed physical properties resemble to theexpectations from modeling a merger of two equal mass, gaseous rich galaxies,0.5 gyr after the merger. in its later evolution, this galaxy could become alate type galaxy which falls on the t-f relation, with an am mostly induced bythe orbital am of the merger.

0902.0361	the elaboration of spiral galaxies: morpho-kinematics analyses of their  progenitors with images	the images project aims at measuring the velocity fields of a representativesample of 100 massive galaxies at z=0.4-0.75, selected in the cdfs, the cfrsand the hdfs fields. it uses the world-unique mode of multiple integral fieldunits of flames/ giraffe at vlt. the resolved-kinematics data allow us tosample the large scale motions at ~ few kpc scale for each galaxy. they havebeen combined with the deepest hst/acs, spitzer (mips and irac) and vlt/fors2ever achieved observations. most intermediate redshift galaxies show anomalousvelocity fields: 6 gyrs ago, half of the present day spirals were out ofequilibrium and had peculiar morphologies. the wealth of the data in thesefields allow us to modelize the physical processes in each galaxy with anaccuracy almost similar to what is done in the local universe. these detailedanalyses reveal the importance of merger processes, including their remnantphases. together with the large evolution of spiral properties, this points outthe importance of disk survival and strengthens the disk rebuilding scenario.this suggests that the hierarchical scenario may apply to the elaboration ofdisk galaxies as it does for ellipticals.

0903.3961	the baryonic content and tully-fisher relation at z~0.6	[abr.] using the multi-integral-field spectrograph giraffe at vlt, weprevisouly derived the stellar-mass tully-fisher relation (smtfr) at z~0.6, andfound that the distant relation is systematically offset by roughly a factor oftwo toward lower masses. we extend the study of the evolution of the tfr byestablishing the first distant baryonic tfr. to derive gas masses in distantgalaxies, we estimate a gas radius and invert the schmidt-kennicutt law betweenstar formation rate and gas surface densities. we find that gas extends fartherout than the uv light from young stars, a median of ~30%. we present the firstbaryonic tfr (btfr) ever established at intermediate redshift and show that,within an uncertainty of +/-0.08 dex, the zeropoint of the btfr does not appearto evolve between z~0.6 and z=0. the absence of evolution in the btfr over thepast 6 gyr implies that no external gas accretion is required for distantrotating disks to sustain star formation until z=0 and convert most of theirgas into stars. finally, we confirm that the larger scatter found in thedistant smtfr, and hence in the btfr, is caused entirely by major mergers. thisscatter results from a transfer of energy from bulk motions in the progenitors,to random motions in the remnants, generated by shocks during the merging.shocks occurring during these events naturally explain the large extent ofionized gas found out to the uv radius in z~0.6 galaxies. all the resultspresented in this paper support the ``spiral rebuilding scenario'' of hammerand collaborators, i.e., that a large fraction of local spiral disks have beenreprocessed during major mergers in the past 8 gyr.

0903.3962	the hubble sequence: just a vestige of merger events?	abr: we investigate whether the hubble sequence can be reproduced by therelics of merger events. we verify that, at zmed=0.65, the abundant populationof anomalous starbursts is mainly linked to the local spirals. theirmorphologies are dominated by young stars and are related to their ionised-gaskinematics. we show that both morphologies and kinematics can be reproduced byusing gas modelling from barnes' (2002) study of major mergers. using ourmodelling to estimate the gas-to-stars transformation during a merger, weidentify the gas fraction in the progenitors to be generally above 50%. alldistant and massive starbursts can be distributed along a temporal sequencefrom the first passage to the nuclei fusion and then to the disk rebuildingphase. it confirms that the rebuilding spiral disk scenario is possibly animportant channel for the formation of present-day disks in spirals. becausehalf of the present-day spirals had peculiar morphologies and anomalouskinematics at zmed=0.65, they could indeed be in major mergers phases 6 gyrsago, and almost all at z~1. it is time now to study in detail the formation ofspiral disks and of their substructures, including bulge, disks, arms, bars,rings that may mainly originate from instabilities created during the lastmajor merger.

0904.1621	a surviving disk from a galaxy collision at z=0.4	spiral galaxies dominate the local galaxy population. disks are known to befragile with respect to collisions. thus it is worthwhile to probe under whichconditions a disk can possibly survive such interactions. we present a detailedmorpho-kinematics study of a massive galaxy with two nuclei,j033210.76--274234.6, at z=0.4. the morphological analysis reveals that theobject consists of two bulges and a massive disk, as well as a faint blue ring.combining the kinematics with morphology we propose a near-center collisionmodel to interpret the object. we find that the massive disk is likely to havesurvived the collision of galaxies with an initial mass ratio of ~4:1. then-body/sph simulations show that the collision possibly is a single-shot polarcollision with a very small pericentric distance of ~1 kpc and that the remnantof the main galaxy will be dominated by a disk. the results support the disksurvival hypothesis. the survival of the disk is related to the polar collisionwith an extremely small pericentric distance. with the help of n-body/sphsimulations we find the probability of disk survival is quite large regardlesswhether the two galaxies merge or not.

0906.2805	how was the hubble sequence 6 gyrs ago?	the way galaxies assemble their mass to form the well-defined hubble sequenceis amongst the most debated topic in modern cosmology. one difficulty is tolink distant galaxies to those at present epoch. we aim at establishing howwere the galaxies of the hubble sequence, 6 gyrs ago. we intend to derive apast hubble sequence that can be causally linked to the present-day one. weselected samples of nearby galaxies from the sdss and of distant galaxies fromthe goods survey. we verified that each sample is representative of galaxies.we further showed that the observational conditions necessary to retrieve theirmorphological classification are similar in an unbiased way. morphologicalanalysis has been done in an identical way for all galaxies in the two samples.we found an absence of number evolution for elliptical and lenticular galaxies,which strikingly contrasts with the strong evolution of spiral and peculiargalaxies. spiral galaxies were 2.3 times less abundant in the past, that isexactly compensated by the strong decrease by a factor 5 of peculiar galaxies.it strongly suggests that more than half of the present-day spirals hadpeculiar morphologies, 6 gyrs ago, and this has to be accounted by any scenarioof galactic disk evolution and formation. the past hubble sequence can be usedto test these scenarios as well as to test evolution of fundamental planes forspirals and bulges.

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

1002.2013	comparing six evolutionary population synthesis models through spectral  synthesis on galaxies	we compare six popularly used evolutionary population synthesis (eps) models(bc03, cb07, ma05, galev, grasil, vazdekis/miles) through fitting the fulloptical spectra of six representative types of galaxies (star-forming andcomposite galaxies, seyfert 2s, liners, e+a and early-type galaxies), which aretaken from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). throughout our paper, we usethe simple stellar populations (ssps) from each eps model and the softwarestarlight to do our fits. our main results are: using different eps models theresulted numerical values of contributed light fractions change obviously, eventhough the dominant populations are consistent. the stellar populationsynthesis does depend on the selection of age and metallicity, while it doesnot depend on the stellar evolution track much. the importance of youngpopulations decreases from star-forming, composite, seyfert 2, liner toearly-type galaxies, and e+a galaxies lie between composite galaxies andseyfert 2s in most cases. we conclude that different eps models do derivedifferent stellar populations, so that it is not reasonable to directly comparestellar populations estimated from different eps models. to get reliableresults, we should use the same eps model for the compared samples.

1004.3683	a large sample of low surface brightness disc galaxies from the sdss-  ii. metallicities in surface brightness bins	we study the spectroscopic properties of a large sample of low surfacebrightness galaxies (lsbgs) (with b-band central surface brightness mu0(b)&gt;22mag arcsec^(-2)) selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4(sdss-dr4) main galaxy sample. a large sample of disk-dominated high surfacebrightness galaxies (hsbgs, with mu0(b)&lt;22 mag arcsec^(-2)) are also selectedfor comparison simultaneously. to study them in more details, these samplegalaxies are further divided into four subgroups according to mu0(b) (in unitsof mag arcsec^(-2)): vlsbgs (24.5-22.75),ilsbgs (22.75-22.0), ihsbgs(22.0-21.25), and vhsbgs (&lt;21.25). the diagnostic diagram from spectralemission-line ratios shows that the agn fractions of all the four subgroups aresmall (&lt;9%). the 21,032 star-forming galaxies with good quality spectroscopicobservations are further selected for studying their dust extinction,strong-line ratios, metallicities and stellar mass-metallicities relations. thevlsbgs have lower extinction values and have less metal-rich and massivegalaxies than the other subgroups. the oxygen abundances of our lsbgs are notas low as those of the hii regions in lsbgs studied in literature, which couldbe because our samples are more luminous, and because of the differentmetallicity calibrations used. we find a correlation between 12+log(o/h) andmu0(b) for vlsbgs, ilsbgs and ihsbgs but show that this could be a result ofcorrelation between mu0(b) and stellar mass and the well-known mass-metallicityrelation. this large sample shows that lsbgs span a wide range in metallicityand stellar mass, and they lie nearly on the stellar mass vs. metallicity andn/o vs. o/h relations of normal galaxies. this suggests that lsbgs and hsbgshave not had dramatically different star formation and chemical enrichmenthistories.

1004.4336	the star formation histories of red and blue low surface brightness disk  galaxies	we study the star formation histories (sfh) and stellar populations of 213red and 226 blue nearly face-on low surface brightness disk galaxies (lsbgs),which are selected from the main galaxy sample of sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release seven (dr7). we also want to compare the stellarpopulations and sfh between the two groups. the sample of both red and bluelsbgs have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio in the spectral continua. we obtaintheir absorption-line indices (e.g. mg_2, h\delta_a), d_n(4000) and stellarmasses from the mpa/jhu catalogs to study their stellar populations and sfh.moreover we fit their optical spectra (stellar absorption lines and continua)by using the spectral synthesis code starlight on the basis of the templates ofsimple stellar populations (ssps). we find that red lsbgs tend to be relativelyolder, higher metallicity, more massive and have higher surface mass densitythan blue lsbgs. the d_n(4000)-h\delta_a plane shows that perhaps red and bluelsbgs have different sfh: blue lsbgs are more likely to be experiencing asporadic star formation events at the present day, whereas red lsbgs are morelikely to form stars continuously over the past 1-2 gyr. moreover, the fractionof galaxies that experienced recent sporadic formation events decreases withincreasing stellar mass. furthermore, two sub-samples are defined for both redand blue lsbgs: the sub-sample within the same stellar mass range of 9.5 &lt;=log(m_\star/m_\odot) &lt;= 10.3, and the surface brightness limiting sub-samplewith \mu_0(r) &lt;= 20.7 mag arcsec^{-2}. they show consistent results with thetotal sample in the corresponding relationships, which confirm that our resultsto compare the blue and red lsbgs are robust.

0708.1648	the direct oxygen abundances of metal-rich galaxies derived from  electron temperature	we aim to derive the electron temperature te in the gas of metal-richstar-forming galaxies, which can be obtained from their ratios of auroral lines[o ii]7320,7330 to nebular lines [o ii]3727, in order to establish a morerobust mass-metallicity relationship, and compare the te-based (o/h) abundanceswith those from empirical strong-line calibrations, such as r23. we obtained 27spectra by stacking the spectra of several hundred (even several thousand)star-forming galaxies selected from the sdss-dr4 in each of the 27 stellar massbins from log(m*) ~8.0 to 10.6 (logmsun). this "stack" method sufficientlyimproves the signal-to-noise ratio of the auroral lines [o ii]7320,7330, whichallow us to reliably obtain the electron temperature t2 in the low ionizationregion from the ratio of [o ii]7320,7330 to [o ii]3727, then t3 in the highionization region from t2 by using a relation, and then the direct (o/h)abundances from te. the results show that the empirical r23 method willoverestimate the log(o/h) by 0.2 to 0.6 dex for these moderate metal-richgalaxies. the new metal-mass relationship of the galaxies with moderatemetallicities is fitted by a linear fit (12+log(o/h) =6.223+0.231*logm*)confirming that empirical methods significantly overestimate (o/h). we alsoderived their (n/o) abundance ratios on the basis of the te method, which areconsistent with the combination of the primary and secondary components ofnitrogen. for actual use, we re-derive the relations of 12+log(o/h)(bay) vs.logm* and 12+log(o/h)(bay) vs. logr23 from the sdss-dr4 data, which are a bitdifferent from those derived from dr2.

0708.1650	checking the reliability of equivalent width r23 for estimating  metallicities of galaxies	we verify whether the o/h abundances of galaxies can be derived from theequivalent width (ew) r23 instead of the extinction-corrected flux r23, andeventually propose a method of improving the reliability of this empiricalmethod, which is often used for the non-flux calibrated spectra of galaxies. weselect 37,173 star-forming galaxies from the sdss-dr2, which offers a widerange of properties to test the ew method. the ew-r23 method brings with it asignificant bias: for the bulk of sdss galaxies, it may affect thedetermination of log(o/h) by factors ranging from -0.2 to 0.1 dex and for somegalaxies by factors ranging from -0.5 to 0.2 dex. we characterize thisdiscrepancy (or bias) by alpha = (i_[oii]/i_hbeta)/(ew_[oii]/ew_hbeta), whichis virtually independent of dust extinction, while tightly correlating withdn(4000), although at a lower significance, with (g-r) colors. the ew-r23method cannot be used as a proxy for the extinction-corrected flux r23 method.  from analytical third-order polynomial fits of alpha versus (g-r) colors, wehave been able to correct the ew-r23 method. with this additional and easycorrection, the ew-r23 method provides o/h abundance values similar to thosederived from the extinction-corrected flux r23 method with an accuracy of ~0.1dex for &gt;92% of the sdss galaxies.

0704.2177	unravelling the morphologies of luminous compact galaxies using the  hst/acs goods survey	(abridged) luminous compact galaxies (lcgs) (m_b &lt; -20, r_{1/2} &lt; 4.5kpc andew_{0}(oii) &gt;15\aa) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxypopulations over the last ~8 gyr history of the universe. due to theirinherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of theirmorphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. in this work we use thehigh angular resolution imaging data, from the hst/acs goods survey, to studythe quantitative morphology of a complete sample of lcgs in the redshift range0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. we have derived structural parameters for a representativesample of 39 lcgs selected from the goods-s field, using full 2-dimensionalsurface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the fourfilters available. b-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphologicalclassification. we then use the rest frame b band bulge flux fraction (b/t) todetermine the morphological class of the galaxies. mergers were essentiallyidentified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensityin the rest frame b band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish themfrom hii regions. we derive the following morphological mix for our sample ofintermediate redshift lcgs: mergers: ~36%, disk dominated: ~22%, s0: ~20%,early types: ~7%, irr/tadpole: ~15%. we establish that our sample lcgs areintermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of log(m/m_{\odot})=10.32.we also derive dust enshrouded sfr values ranging from a few to ~65$m_{\odot}$/year using spitzer 24$\mu m$ data. we estimate a factor ~11 fall inthe comoving number density of blue lcgs from redshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 to thecurrent epoch. we finally discuss the evolutionary scenario of these lcgs whichmight give us some clues regarding their descendants in the local universe.

1010.0679	does m31 result from an ancient major merger?	the numerous streams in the m31 halo are currently assumed to be due tomultiple minor mergers. here we use the gadget2 simulation code to test whetherm31 could have experienced a major merger in its past history. it results thata 3+/-0.5:1 gaseous rich merger with r(per)=25+/-5 kpc and a polar orbit canexplain many properties of m31 and of its halo. the interaction and the fusionmay have begun 8.75+/-0.35 gyr and 5.5 +/-0.5 gyr ago, respectively. with analmost quiescent star formation history before the fusion we retrieve fractionsof bulge, thin and thick disks as well as relative fractions of intermediateage and old stars in both the thick disk and the giant stream. the giant streamis caused by returning stars from a tidal tail previously stripped from thesatellite prior to the fusion. these returning stars are trapped intoelliptical orbits or loops for almost a hubble time period. large loops arealso predicted and they scale rather well with the recently discovered featuresin the m31 outskirts. we demonstrate that a single merger could explainfirst-order (intensity and size), morphological and kinematical properties ofthe disk, thick disk, bulge and streams in the halo of m31, as well as thedistribution of stellar ages, and perhaps metallicities. it challengesscenarios assuming one minor merger per feature in the disk (10 kpc ring) or atthe outskirts (numerous streams &amp; thick disk). further constraints will help toproperly evaluate the impact of such a major event to the local group.

1109.0992	x-shooter gto: chemical analysis of a sample of emp candidates	context: extremely metal-poor stars (emp) are very rare objects that hold intheir atmospheres the fossil record of the chemical composition of the earlyphases of galactic evolution. finding these objects and determining theirchemical composition provides important constraints on these early phases.aims: using a carefully designed selection method, we chose a sample ofcandidate emp stars from the low resolution spectra of the sloan digital skysurvey and observed them with x-shooter at the vlt to confirm theirmetallicities and determine abundances for as many elements as possible.method: the x-shooter spectra are analysed by means of one-dimensional,plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. corrections for the granulationeffects are computed using co5bold hydrodynamical simulations. results: all thecandidates are confirmed to be emp stars, proving the efficiency of ourselection method within about 0.5 dex. the chemical composition of this sampleis compatible with those of brighter samples, suggesting that the stars in thegalactic halo are well mixed. conclusions these observations show that it isfeasible to observe, in a limited amount of time, a large sample of about onehundred stars among emp candidates selected from the sdss. such a size ofsample will allow us, in particular, to confirm or refute the existence of avertical drop in the galactic halo metallicity distribution function around[fe/h] ~ -3.5.

1202.4454	loops formed by tidal tails as fossil records of a major merger	many haloes of nearby disc galaxies contain faint and extended features,including loops, which are often interpreted as relics of satellite infall inthe main galaxy's potential well. in most cases, however, the residual nucleusof the satellite is not seen, although it is predicted by numericalsimulations. we test whether such faint and extended features can be associatedto gas-rich, major mergers, which may also lead to disc rebuilding and thus bea corner stone for the formation of spiral galaxies. using the treesph codegadget-2, we model the formation of an almost bulge-less galaxy similar to ngc5907 (b/t $\le$ 0.2) after a gas-rich major merger. we indeed find that 3:1major mergers can form features similar to the loops found in many galactichaloes, including in ngc 5907, and can reproduce an extended thin disc, abulge, as well as the pronounced warp of the gaseous disc. even though itremains difficult to fully cover the large volume of free parameters, thepresent modelling of the loops in ngc 5907 proves that they could well be theresult of a major merger. it has many advantages over the satellite infallscenario; e.g., it solves the problem of the visibility of the satelliteremnant, and it may explain some additional features in the ngc 5907 halo, aswell as some gas properties of this system. for orbital parameters derived fromcosmological simulations, the loops in ngc 5907 can be reproduced by majormergers (3:1 to 5:1) and possibly by intermediate mergers (5:1 to 12:1). themajor merger scenario thus challenges the minor merger one and could explainmany properties that haloes of spiral galaxies have in common, including theirred colours and the presence of faint extended features.

1203.2612	an extremely primitive halo star	the early universe had a chemical composition consisting of hydrogen, heliumand traces of lithium1, almost all other elements were created in stars andsupernovae. the mass fraction, z, of elements more massive than helium, iscalled "metallicity". a number of very metal poor stars have been found some ofwhich, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen andoxygen. for theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of starswith metallicities lower than z=1.5e-5, it has been suggested that low massstars (m&lt;0.8m\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form untilthe interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated tolie in the range 1.5e-8\leqz\leq1.5e-6, although competing theories claimingthe contrary do exist. here we report the chemical composition of a star with avery low z\leq6.9e-7 (4.5e-5 of that of the sun) and a chemical pattern typicalof classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment ofcarbon, nitrogen and oxygen. this shows that low mass stars can be formed atvery low metallicity. lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicityextension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. lithiumdepletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperaturesabove two million k in its history, which points to rather particular formationcondition or internal mixing process, for low z stars.

1203.6248	a decrease of the gas exchanges between galaxies and the igm, from 12 to  6 billion years ago	using a representative sample of 65 intermediate mass galaxies at z \sim 0.6,we have inves- tigated the interplay between the main ingredients of chemicalevolution: metal abundance, gas mass, stellar mass and sfr. all quantities havebeen estimated using deep spectroscopy and photometry from uv to ir andassuming an inversion of the schmitt-kennicutt law for the gas fraction. sixbillion years ago, galaxies had a mean gas fraction of 32% \pm 3, i.e. twicethat of their local counterparts. using higher redshift samples from theliterature, we explore the gas-phases and estimate the evolution of the meangas fraction of distant galaxies over the last 11 gy. the gas fractionincreases linearly at the rate of 4% per gyr from z \sim 0 to z \sim 2.2. wealso demonstrate for a statistically representative sample that &lt; 4% of the z\sim 0.6 galaxies are undergoing outflow events, in sharp contrast with z \sim2.2 galaxies. the observed co-evolution of metals and gas over the past 6 gyrfavours a scenario in which the population of intermediate mass galaxiesevolved as closed-systems, converting their own gas reservoirs into stars.

0711.0611	first detection of a minor merger a z~0.6	numerical simulations predict that minor mergers are an important channel forthe mass assembly of galaxies. however, minor mergers are relatively difficultto detect using imaging, especially at high redshift. while such events aremuch less violent than major mergers, they can nevertheless leave severalfeatures on the kinematical structures of remnant galaxies which could bedetected using 3d spectroscopy. we present the first direct detection of aminor merger in a z~0.6 galaxy. such events could indeed be good candidates toexplain the kinematics of perturbed rotating disks observed with giraffe atz~0.6. we present photometric and kinematical evidence of such an event in acombined analysis of three-band hst/acs imaging and vlt/giraffe 2d-kinematics.using these data, we are able to demonstrate that a minor merger of arelatively small satellite (mass ratio ~1:18) is occurring in this galaxy. wealso derive a total sfr ~21mo/yr. minor mergers could be one of the physicalprocesses explaining the kinematics of perturbed rotating disks, whichrepresent ~25% of emission line intermediate mass galaxies at z~0.6. 3dspectroscopy appears to be a very good tool to identify minor mergers indistant (and local) galaxies.

1205.2404	the properties of a large volume-limited sample of face-on low surface  brightness disk galaxies	we select a large volume-limited sample of low surface brightness galaxies(lsbgs, 2,021) to investigate their statistical properties and theirdifferences from high surface brightness galaxies (hsbgs, 3,639) in details.the distributions of stellar masses of lsbgs and hsbgs are nearly the same andthey have the same median values. thus this volume-limited sample have goodcompleteness and further remove the effect of stellar masses on their otherproperties when we compare lsbgs and hsbgs. we found that lsbgs tend to havelower stellar metallicities, and lower effect dust attenuations indicating thatthey have lower dust, than hsbgs. the lsbgs have relatively higher stellarmass-to-light ratios, higher gas fraction, lower star forming rates (sfrs), andlower specific sfrs than hsbgs. moreover, with the decreasing surfacebrightness, gas fraction increase, while the sfrs and specific sfrs decreaserapidly for the sample galaxies. this could mean that the star formationhistories between lsbgs and hsbgs are different, hsbgs may have stronger starforming activities than lsbgs.

1206.0008	galaxy disks do not need to survive in the l-cdm paradigm: the galaxy  merger rate out to z~1.5 from morpho-kinematic data	about two-thirds of present-day, large galaxies are spirals such as the milkyway or andromeda, but the way their thin rotating disks formed remainsuncertain. observations have revealed that half of their progenitors, sixbillion years ago, had peculiar morphologies and/or kinematics, which excludethem from the hubble sequence. major mergers, i.e., fusions between galaxies ofsimilar mass, are found to be the likeliest driver for such strongpeculiarities. however, thin disks are fragile and easily destroyed by suchviolent collisions, which creates a critical tension between the observedfraction of thin disks and their survival within the l-cdm paradigm. here weshow that the observed high occurrence of mergers amongst their progenitors isonly apparent and is resolved when using morpho-kinematic observations whichare sensitive to all the phases of the merging process. this provides anoriginal way of narrowing down observational estimates of the galaxy mergerrate and leads to a perfect match with predictions by state-of-the-art l-cdmsemi-empirical models with no particular fine-tuning needed. these resultsimply that half of local thin disks do not survive but are actually rebuiltafter a gas-rich major merger occurring in the past nine billion years, i.e.,two-thirds of the lifetime of the universe. this emphasizes the need to studyhow thin disks can form in halos with a more active merger history thanpreviously considered, and to investigate what is the origin of the gasreservoir from which local disks would reform.

1207.2472	characterizing the red optical sky background fluctuations from  narrow-band imaging	the detection and characterization of the physical properties of very distantgalaxies will be one the prominent science case of all future extremely largetelescopes, including the 39m e-elt. multi-object spectroscopic instruments arepotentially very important tools for studying these objects, and in particularfiber-based concepts. however, detecting and studying such faint and distantsources will require subtraction of the sky background signal (i.e., between ohairglow lines) with an accuracy of ~1%. this requires a precise and accurateknowledge of the sky background temporal and spatial fluctuations. using fors2narrow-band filter imaging data, we are currently investigating what are thefluctuations of the sky background at ~9000a. we present preliminary results ofsky background fluctuations from this study over spatial scales reaching ~4arcmin, as well as first glimpses into the temporal variations of suchfluctuations over timescales of the order of the hour. this study (and othercomplementary on-going studies) will be essential in designing thenext-generation fiber-fed instruments for the e-elt.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1309.4913	x-shooter gto: evidence for a population of extremely metal-poor,  alpha-poor stars	the extremely metal-poor stars are the direct descendants of the firstgeneration stars. they carry the chemical signature of the pristine universe atthe time they formed, shortly after the big bang. we aim to derive informationabout extremely metal-poor stars from their observed spectra. four extremelymetal-poor stars were selected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) andobserved during the guaranteed observing time of x-shooter. the x-shooterspectra were analysed using an automatic code, mygisfos, which is based on atraditional analysis method. it makes use of a synthetic grid computed fromone-dimensional, plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. the lowmetallicity derived from the sdss spectra is confirmed here. two kinds of starsare found. two stars are confirmed to be extremely metal-poor, with no evidenceof any enhancement in carbon. the two other stars are strongly enhanced incarbon. we could not derive iron abundance for one of them, while [ca/h] isbelow -4.5. two of the stars are members of the rare population of extremelymetal-poor stars low in alpha elements.

1406.1190	the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at z~0.6: reinstating major  mergers	the relation between the star formation rate and the stellar mass ofstar-forming galaxies has been used to argue that major mergers cannot be themain driver of star formation. here, we re-examine these arguments using therepresentative images-cdfs sample of star-forming galaxies at z=0.4-0.75,taking advantage of their previously established classification intopre-fusion, fusion, and relaxing galaxy mergers. contrary to previous claims,we show there is no tension between the main sequence scatter and the averageduration of the fusion star formation rate sfr peak. we confirm previousestimates of the fraction of sfr due to morphologically-selected galaxies(~23%) or the sfr enhancement due to major merger during the fusion phase(~10%). however, galaxy mergers are not instantaneous processes, which impliesthat the total fraction of the sfr associated to galaxies undergoing majormergers must account for the three merger phases. when doing so, galaxiesinvolved in major mergers are found to represent 53-88% of the total sfr atz~0.6. the fraction of lirgs in the fusion phase is found to be in agreementwith the observed morphological fraction of lirgs without disks and with theobserved and expected major merger rates at z&lt;1.5.

1407.0483	comparing the host galaxies of type ia, type ii and type ibc supernovae	we compare the host galaxies of 902 supernovae, including sne ia, sne ii andsne ibc, which are selected by cross-matching the asiago supernova catalog withthe sdss data release 7. we further selected 213 galaxies by requiring thelight fraction of spectral observations $&gt;$15%, which could represent well theglobal properties of the galaxies. among them, 135 galaxies appear on thebaldwin-phillips-terlevich diagram, which allows us to compare the hosts interms of star-forming, agns (including composites, liners and seyfert 2s) and"absorp" (their related emission-lines are weak or non-existence) galaxies. thediagrams related to parameters d$_n$(4000), h$\delta_a$, stellar masses, sfrsand specific sfrs for the sne hosts show that almost all sne ii and most of sneibc occur in sf galaxies, which have a wide range of stellar mass and lowd$_n$(4000). the sne ia hosts as sf galaxies follow similar trends. asignificant fraction of sne ia occurs in agns and absorp galaxies, which aremassive and have high d$_n$(4000). the stellar population analysis fromspectral synthesis fitting shows that the hosts of sne ii have a youngerstellar population than hosts of sne ia. these results are compared with thoseof the 689 comparison galaxies where the sdss fiber captures less than 15% ofthe total light. these comparison galaxies appear biased towards higher12+log(o/h) ($\sim$0.1dex) at a given stellar mass. therefore, we believe theaperture effect should be kept in mind when the properties of the hosts fordifferent types of sne are discussed.

0803.2370	images ii. a surprisingly low fraction of undisturbed rotating spiral  disks at z~0.6: the morpho-kinematical relation 6 gyrs ago	we present a first combined analysis of the morphological and dynamicalproperties for the intermediate mass galaxy evolution sequence (images) sample.it is a representative sample of 52 z~0.6 galaxies with mstell from 1.5 to 1510^10msun and possessing 3d resolved kinematics and hst deep imaging in atleast two broad band filters. we aim at evaluate robustly the evolution ofrotating spirals since z~0.6, as well as to test the different schemes forclassifying galaxies morphologically. we used all the information provided bymulti-band images, color maps and 2 dimensional light fitting to assign to eachobject a morphological class. we divided our sample between spiral disks,peculiar objects, compact objects and mergers. using our morphologicalclassification scheme, 4/5 of identified spirals are rotating disks and morethan 4/5 of identified peculiar galaxies show complex kinematics, whileautomatic classification methods such as concentration-asymmetry and gini-m20severely overestimate the fraction of relaxed disk galaxies. using thismethodology, we find that the fraction of rotating spirals has increased by afactor ~ 2 during the last 6 gyrs, a much higher fraction that found previouslybased on morphologies alone. these rotating spiral disks are forming stars veryrapidly, doubling their stellar masses over the last 6 gyrs, while most oftheir stars have been formed few gyrs earlier, which reveals the presence of alarge gas supply. because they are likely the progenitors of local spirals, wecan conjecture how their properties are evolving. their disks show someevidence for an inside-out growth and the gas supply/accretion is not maderandomly as the disk need to be stable in order to match the local diskproperties.

0803.3002	images-iii: the evolution of the near-infrared tully-fisher relation  over the last 6 gyr	using the multi-integral field spectrograph giraffe at vlt, we have derivedthe k-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) at z~0.6 for a representative sample of65 galaxies with emission lines. we confirm that the scatter in the z~0.6 tfris caused by galaxies with anomalous kinematics, and find a positive and strongcorrelation between the complexity of the kinematics and the scatter that theycontribute to the tfr. considering only relaxed-rotating disks, the scatter,and possibly also the slope of the tfr, do not appear to evolve with z. wedetect an evolution of the k-band tfr zero point between z~0.6 and z=0, which,if interpreted as an evolution of the k-band luminosity of rotating disks,would imply that a brightening of 0.66+/-0.14 mag occurs between z~0.6 and z=0.any disagreement with the results of flores et al. (2006) are attributed toboth an improvement of the local tfr and the more detailed accurate measurementof the rotation velocities in the distant sample. most of the uncertainty canbe explained by the relatively coarse spatial-resolution of the kinematicaldata. because most rotating disks at z~0.6 are unlikely to experience furthermerging events, one may assume that their rotational velocity does not evolvedramatically. if true, our result implies that rotating disks observed at z~0.6are rapidly transforming their gas into stars, to be able to double theirstellar masses and be observed on the tfr at z=0. the rotating disks observedare indeed emission-line galaxies that are either starbursts or lirgs, whichimplies that they are forming stars at a high rate. thus, a significantfraction of the rotating disks are forming the bulk of their stars within 6 to8 gyr, in good agreement with former studies of the evolution of the m-zrelation.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

1506.07791	grb host galaxies with vlt/x-shooter: properties at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.3	long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) are associated with the death of massive stars.their host galaxies therefore represent a unique class of objects tracing starformation across the observable universe. indeed, recently accumulated evidenceshows that grb hosts do not differ substantially from general population ofgalaxies at high (z &gt; 2) redshifts. however, it has been long recognised thatthe properties of z &lt; 1.5 hosts, compared to general star-forming population,are unusual. to better understand the reasons for the supposed difference inlgrb hosts properties at z &lt; 1.5, we obtained vlt/x- shooter spectra of sixhosts lying in the redshift range of 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. some of these hosts havebeen observed before, yet we still lack well constrained information on theircharacteristics such as metallicity, dust extinction and star formation rate.we search for emission lines in the vlt/x-shooter spectra of the hosts andmeasure their fluxes. we perform a detailed analysis, estimating host averageextinction, star-formation rates, metallicities and electron densities wherepossible. measured quantities of our hosts are compared to a larger sample ofpreviously observed grb hosts at z &lt; 2. star-formation rates and metallicitiesare measured for all the hosts analyzed in this paper and metallicities arewell determined for 4 hosts. the mass-metallicity relation, the fundamentalmetallicity relation and sfrs derived from our hosts occupy similar parameterspace as other host galaxies investigated so-far at the same redshift. wetherefore conclude that grb hosts in our sample support the found discrepancybetween the properties of low-redshift grb hosts and the general population ofstar- forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0011218	luminous compact galaxies at intermediate redshifts: progenitors of  bulges of massive spirals ?	vlt spectra of 14 luminous compact galaxies (lcgs) reveal strong metallicabsorption line sytems as well as narrow and intense emission lines. their gasextinction is found to be large (av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision oftheir star formation rate (sfr) to an average value of ~ 40 mo/yr. largeextinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in onefield observed by iso. gas metal abundances in lcgs have about half the solarvalue. we argue that lcgs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.lcgs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-daybulges. as in present-day galactic bulges, lcg stars show a wide range ofabundances. thus, observing lcgs allows us to directly witness an importantstage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior tothat of the disk. the gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likelyto be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled outfrom interacting companion galaxies. some lcgs also show evidence for thebeginning of a disk formation. if the above scenario holds for most lcgs, weestimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulkof their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 gyr, atredshifts less than ~ 1. since they are heavily extincted, we predict their irluminosities to be relatively large, around lir = 10^11 lsun, i.e. near orslightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by iso in the sameredshift range. taking into account the integrated ir luminosity of the lcggalaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic sfrdensity in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1.

astro-ph;0311113	star formation rates of distant luminous infrared galaxies derived from  halpha and ir luminosities	we present a study of the star formation rate (sfr) for a sample of 16distant galaxies detected by isocam at 15um in the cfrs0300+00 and cfrs1400+52fields. their high quality and intermediate resolution vlt/fors spectra haveallowed a proper correction of the balmer emission lines from the underlyingabsorption. extinction estimates using the hbeta/hgamma and the halpha/hbetabalmer decrement are in excellent agreement, providing a robust measurement ofthe instantaneous sfr based on the extinction-corrected halpha luminosity. starformation has also been estimated exploiting the correlations between irluminosity and those at mir and radio wavelengths. our study shows that therelationship between the two sfr estimates follow two distinct regimes: (1) forgalaxies with sfrir below ~ 100msolar/yr, the sfr deduced from halphameasurements is a good approximation of the global sfr and (2) for galaxiesnear of ulirgs regime, corrected halpha sfr understimated the sfr by a factorof 1.5 to 2. our analyses suggest that heavily extincted regions completelyhidden in optical bands (such as those found in arp 220) contribute to lessthan 20% of the global budget of star formation history up to z=1.

(1995). our sample can provide a good representation of lirgsin the distant universe. most (&gt;77%) iso 15mu selected sample galaxies aredominated by star formation. oxygen abundances (12+log(o/h), derived from r23and o32) in ism in the distant lirgs range from 8.36 to 8.93 with a medianvalue of 8.67. distant lirgs present a metal content less than half of that ofthe local bright disks (i.e. l*). the pegase2 models predict that total masses(gas + stars) of the distant lirgs are from 10^{11} msun to &lt;=10^{12} msun. asignificant fraction of distant large disks are indeed lirgs. such massivedisks could have formed ~50% of their metals and stellar masses since z~1.

astro-ph;0410518	did most present-day spirals form during the last 8 gyrs? a formation  history with violent episodes revealed by panchromatic observations	(abridged) studies of distant galaxies have shown that ellipticals and largespirals were already in place 8 gyr ago, leading to a very modest recent starformation in intermediate mass galaxies. this is challenged by a recentanalysis (heavens et al. 2004) of the fossil record of the stellar populationsof ~10^5 nearby galaxies, which show that intermediate mass galaxies haveformed or assembled the bulk of their stars 4 to 8 gyr ago. here we presentdirect observational evidence supporting the heavens et al's findings from along term, multi-wavelength study of 195 z&gt;0.4 intermediate mass galaxies,mostly selected from the cfrs survey. we show that a recent and efficient starformation is revealed at ir wavelengths since ~15% of intermediate massgalaxies at z&gt;0.4 are indeed luminous ir galaxies (lirgs), a phenomenon farmore common than in the local universe. the star formation in lirgs issufficient in itself to produce 38% of the total stellar mass of intermediatemass galaxies and then to account for most of the reported stellar massformation since z=1. the high occurrence of lirgs is easily understood only ifthey correspond to episodic peaks of star formation, during which galaxies arereddened through short ires (infrared episodes). we examine how galaxy ires canbe related to the emergence at high redshift, of the abundant population ofgalaxies with small size, blue core and many irregularities. we show thatrecent merging and gas infall naturally explain both morphological changes andepisodic star formation history in a hierarchical galaxy formation frame. wepropose a simple scenario in which 75+-25% of intermediate mass spirals haveexperienced recently their last major merger event, leading to a drasticreshaping of their bulges and disks during the last 8 gyrs.

(1999), no dramatic change of the bar frequencyis detected up to redshift ~0.8. the bar frequency of the distant spirals issimilar to (and may be higher than) the present-day spirals in the rest-frame$b$ band. we conclude that bar-driven secular evolution is not a majormechanism to drive morphological evolution of field galaxies, especially theirbulge formation, which is more likely related to multiple intense starformation episodes during which the galaxies appear as lirgs (hammer et al.2005).

astro-ph;0612152	531 new spectroscopic redshifts from the cdfs and a test on the  cosmological relevance of the goods-south field	(abbrev.) this paper prepares a series of papers analysing the intermediatemass galaxy evolution sequence (images) up to z=1. intermediate mass galaxies(mj &lt;=-20.3) are selected from the chandra deep field south (cdfs) for which weidentify a serious lack of spectroscopically determined redshifts..... we havespectroscopically identified 691 objects including 580 gal., 7 qsos, and 104stars. this study provides 531 new redshifts in the cdfs. it confirms thepresence of several large scale structures in the cdfs. to test the impact ofthese structures in the goods-south field, we ... compare the evolution ofrest-frame u, b, v and k galaxy luminosity densities to that derived from thecfrs. the cdfs field shows a significant excess of luminosity densities in thez=0.5-0.75 range, which increases with the wavelength, reaching up to 0.5 dexat 2.1 um. stellar mass and specific star formation evolutions might besignificantly affected by the presence of the peculiar large scale structuresat z= 0.668 and at z= 0.735, that contain a significant excess of evolved,massive galaxies when compared to other fields. this leads to a clear warningto results based on the cdfs/goods south fields, especially those related tothe evolution of red luminosity densities, i.e. stellar mass density andspecific star formation rate. photometric redshift techniques, when applied tothat field, are producing quantities which are apparently less affected bycosmic variance (0.25 dex at 2.1 um), however at the cost of the difficulty indisentangling between evolutionary and cosmic variance effects.

(1992) local luminosity function is seen at low redshifts z &lt; 0.2 aroundm(b) ~ -18$ and these galaxies may possibly represent the descendants of theevolving blue population seen at higher redshifts. the changes seen in theluminosity function are also apparent in color-magnitude diagrams constructedat different epochs and in the v/v_max statistic computed as a function ofspectral type. finally, it is argued that the picture of galaxy evolutionpresented here is consistent with the very much smaller samples of fieldgalaxies that have been selected in other wavebands, and with the results ofstudies of galaxies selected on the basis of mg ii 2799 absorption.

astro-ph;9806184	follow up of the cfrs with hst, iso and vla: the cosmic star formation  rate as derived from the fir luminosity density	properties of cfrs field galaxies up to z=1 are discussed. estimations of thecosmic star formation rate (sfr) lead to serious problems if they not accountfor agn emissions and for light reemitted at ir wavelengths. deep isocam andvla photometries on one cfrs field have been performed. multi-wavelengthanalyses from uv to mid-ir and hence to radio allow us to classify sources fromtheir spectral energy distributions. this provides an estimation of the firluminosity density related to star formation. the deduced sfr density is freeof extinction effects and not contaminated by agn emissions. about 55+/-20% ofthe star formation at z&lt;=1 is related to fir emission. if a non truncatedsalpeter imf is adopted, the derived stellar mass formed from z=0 to z=1 seemstoo high when compared to the present day stellar mass.  an important fraction (30%) of the star formation at z=0.5-1 seems to berelated to the rapidly evolving population of compact/irr galaxies. largersystems found at z=1, show a slower evolution of their star formationproperties.

astro-ph;9811201	deep galaxy survey at 6.75 micron with the iso satellite	deep 6.75um mid-ir isocam observations were obtained of the canada-franceredshift survey (cfrs) 1415+52 field with the infrared space observatory. theidentification of the sources with optical counterparts is described in detail,and a classification scheme is devised which depends on the s/n of thedetection and the inverse probability of chance coincidence. 83% of the 54isocam sources are identified with iab&lt;23.5 counterparts. the (i-k)ab colors,radio properties, spectrophotometric properties and frequency of nuclearactivity of these counterparts differ on average from those of typical cfrsgalaxies. cfrs spectra are available for 21 of the sources which have iab &lt;=22.5 (including 7 stars). most of the strongest sources are stars or agn. amongthe non--stellar counterparts with spectra, 40% are agns, and 53% are galaxiesthat display star formation activity and/or significant contributions of astars. the isocam sources also display an ir excess, even when compared withheavily-reddened local starburst galaxies. an upper limit of 30% ofextragalactic iso sources could be at z&gt;1 of the 44 s6.75um &gt; 150ujy sourceswhich are non-stellar (7 "spectroscopic" and 3 "photometric" stars excluded)

astro-ph;9811202	15um iso observations of a cfrs field: the cosmic sfr as derived from  uv, optical, mid-ir and radio photometry	the cfrs 1452+52 field has been deeply imaged with the infrared spaceobservatory (iso) using isocam through the lw3 filter (12-18um). careful dataanalysis and comparison to deep optical and radio data have allowed us togenerate a catalog of 78 15um sources with both radio and opticalidentifications. they are redder and lie at higher redshift than i-bandselected galaxies, with most of them being star-forming galaxies. we haveconsidered the galaxies detected at radio and 15$\mu$m wavelengths whichpotentially include all strong and heavily extincted starbursts, up to z=1.spectral energy distributions (sed) for each of the sources have been derivedusing deep radio, mid-ir, near-ir, optical and uv photometry. the sources werethen spectrally classified by comparing to seds of well known nearby galaxies.by deriving their fir luminosities by interpolation, we can estimate their starformation rate (sfr) in a way which does not depend sensitively on theextinction. 75% (-40%, +10%) of the star formation at $z \le 1$ is related toir emission and the global extinction is in the range av=0.5 -- 0.85. whileheavily extincted starbursts, with sfr in excess of 100 mo/yr constitute lessthan a percent of all galaxies, they contribute about 18% of the sfr densityout to z=1. their morphologies range from s0 to sab, and more than a third areinteracting systems. the sfr derived by fir fluxes is likely to be ~2.9 timeshigher than those previously estimated from uv fluxes. the derived stellar massformed since the redshift of 1 could be too high when compared to the presentday stellar mass density. this might be due to an imf in distant star-forminggalaxies different from the solar neighborhood one, or to an underestimate ofthe local stellar mass density.

astro-ph;9812355	a search for gravitational lensing in 38 x-ray selected clusters of  galaxies	we present the results of a ccd imaging survey for gravitational lensing in asample of 38 x-ray-selected clusters of galaxies. our sample consists of themost x-ray luminous (lx&gt;= 2x10^{44} erg s^{-1}) clusters selected from theeinstein observatory extended medium sensitivity survey (emss) that areobservable from mauna kea (dec &gt; -40deg). the sample spans a redshift range of0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.823 and includes 5 clusters with z &gt; 0.5. ccd images of theclusters were obtained in excellent seeing. there is evidence of stronggravitational lensing in the form of giant arcs (length l &gt; 8'', axis ratio l/w&gt; 10) in 8 of the 38 clusters. two additional clusters contain shorter arclets,and 6 more clusters contain candidate arcs that require follow-up observationsto confirm their lensing origin. since the survey does not have a uniformsurface brightness limit we do not draw any conclusion based on the statisticsof the arcs found. we note, however, that 60% (3 of 5) of the clusters with lx&gt; 10^{45} erg s^{-1}, and none of the 15 clusters with lx &lt; 4x10^{44} ergs^{-1} contain giant arcs, thereby confirming that high x-ray luminosity doesidentify the most massive systems, and thus x-ray selection is the preferredmethod for finding true, rich clusters at intermediate and high redshifts. theobserved geometry of the arcs, most of which are thin, have large axis ratios(l/w &gt; 10), and are aligned orthogonal to the optical major axes of theclusters, indicate the cluster core mass density profiles must be compact(steeper than isothermal). in several cases, however, there is also someevidence, in the form of possible radial arcs, for density profiles with finitecore radii.

astro-ph;9909211	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift surveys -  iv. influence of mergers in the evolution of faint field galaxies from z~1	hst images of a sample of 285 galaxies with measured z from the cfrs andautofib-ldss redshift surveys are analysed to derive the evolution of themerger fraction out to z~1. we have performed visual and machine-based mergeridentifications, as well as counts of bright pairs of galaxies with magnitudedifferences less than 1.5 mag. we find that the pair fraction increases with z,with up to ~20% of the galaxies being in physical pairs at z~0.75-1. we derivea merger fraction varying with z as (1+z)^{3.2 +/- 0.6}, after correction forline-of-sight contamination, in excellent agreement with the merger fractionderived from the visual classification of mergers for which m = 3.4 +/- 0.6.after correcting for seeing effects on the ground-based selection of surveygalaxies, we conclude that the pair fraction evolves as (1+z)^{2.7 +/- 0.6}.this implies that an average l* galaxy will have undergone 0.8 to 1.8 mergerevents from z=1 to 0, with 0.5 to 1.2 merger events occuring in a 2 gyr timespan at z~0.9. this result is consistent with predictions from semi-analyticalmodels of galaxy formation. from the simple co-addition of the observedluminosities of the galaxies in pairs, physical mergers are computed to lead toa brightening of 0.5 mag for each pair on average, and a boost in starformation rate of a factor of 2, as derived from the average [o ii] equivalentwidths. mergers of galaxies are therefore contributing significantly to theevolution of both the luminosity function and luminosity density of theuniverse out to z~1.

astro-ph;9912196	statistical properties of local and intermediate z galaxies	galaxy evolution during the last 9 gyr is discussed. it can be traced backfrom well known present-day galaxies or directly observed for galaxies atdifferent look back times. this requires clear and consistently matchedselection criteria for galaxy samples. there is a net decrease of rest-frame,uv luminosity density, at least since z = 1. it is interpreted as an importantdecline of the star formation since the last ~9 gyr. a similar trend is foundfor the evolution of the ir luminosity density which accounts for heavilyextincted starbursts. interestingly the global star formation density, afterincluding ir selected galaxies, is twice the value of estimates based on the uvluminosity density, and this holds from z=0 to z=1.  large disks are not contributing much to the observed decrease, which ismainly related to significant changes with the epoch in the distribution ofgalaxy morphologies. a significant fraction of the global star formation occursin luminous galaxies which are apparently small or in interacting galaxiesdetected in the deepest ir or radio surveys.

0810.0272	images iv: strong evolution of the oxygen abundance in gaseous phases of  intermediate mass galaxies since z=0.8	intermediate mass galaxies (logm(msun)&gt;10) at z~0.6 are the likeliestprogenitors of the present-day numerous population of spirals. there is growingevidence that they have evolved rapidly since the last 6 to 8 gyr ago, andlikely have formed a significant fraction of their stellar mass, often showingperturbed morphologies and kinematics. we have gathered a representative sampleof 88 such galaxies and have provided robust estimates of their gas phasemetallicity. for doing so, we have used moderate spectral resolutionspectroscopy at vlt/fors2 with unprecedented high s/n allowing to remove biasescoming from interstellar absorption lines and extinction to establish robustvalues of r23=([oii]3727 + [oiii]4959,5007)/hbeta. we definitively confirm thatthe predominant population of z~0.6 starbursts and luminous ir galaxies (lirgs)are on average, two times less metal rich than the local galaxies at a givenstellar mass. we do find that the metal abundance of the gaseous phase ofgalaxies is evolving linearly with time, from z=1 to z=0 and after comparingwith other studies, from z=3 to z=0. combining our results with the reportedevolution of the tully fisher relation, we do find that such an evolutionrequires that ~30% of the stellar mass of local galaxies have been formedthrough an external supply of gas, thus excluding the close box model. distantstarbursts &amp; lirgs have properties (metal abundance, star formation efficiency&amp; morphologies) similar to those of local lirgs. their underlying physics islikely dominated by gas infall probably through merging or interactions. ourstudy further supports the rapid evolution of z~0.4-1 galaxies. gas exchangesbetween galaxies is likely the main cause of this evolution.

0811.3893	a forming disk at z~0.6: collapse of a gaseous disk or major merger  remnant?	[abridged] we present and analyze observations of j033241.88-274853.9 atz=0.6679, using multi-wavelength photometry and imaging with flames/giraffe 3dspectroscopy. j033241.88-274853.9 is found to be a blue, young (~320myr)stellar disk embedded in a very gas-rich (fgas=73-82% withlog(mstellar/mo)=9.45) and turbulent phase that is found to be rotating onlarge spatial scales. we identified two unusual properties ofj033241.88-274853.9. (1) the spatial distributions of the ionized gaseous andyoung stars show a strong decoupling; while almost no stars can be detected inthe southern part down to the very deep detection limit of acs/udf images,significant emission from the [oii] ionized gas is detected. (2) we detect anexcess of velocity dispersion in the southern part of j033241.88-274853.9 incomparison to expectations from a rotating disk model. we considered two diskformation scenarios, depending on the gaseous phase geometry. in the first one,we examined whether j033241.88-274853.9 could be a young rotating disk that hasbeen recently collapsed from a pre-existing, very gas-rich rotating disk. thisscenario requires two (unknown) additional assumptions to explain thedecoupling between the distribution of stars and gas and the excess of velocitydispersion in the same region. in a second scenario, we examine whetherj033241.88-274853.9 could be a merger remnant of two gas-rich disks. in thiscase, the asymmetry observed between the gas and star distributions, as well asthe excess of velocity dispersion, find a common explanation. shocks producedduring the merger in this region can be ionized easily and heat the gas whilepreventing star formation. this makes this scenario more satisfactory than thecollapse of a pre-existing, gas-rich rotating disk.

0811.4694	stellar population analysis on local infrared-selected galaxies	to study the stellar population of local infrared galaxies, which containstar-forming galaxies, composite galaxies, liners, and seyfert 2s. we also wantto find whether infrared luminosity and spectral class have any effects ontheir stellar populations. the sample galaxies are selected from the maingalaxy sample of sdss-dr4 and then cross-correlated with the iras-pscz catalog.we fit our spectra (stellar absorption lines and continua) using the spectralsynthesis code starlight on the base of the templates of simple stellarpopulation and the spectra of star clusters.among the 4 spectral classes,liners present the oldest stellar populations, and the other 3 sub-samples allpresent substantial young and intermediate age populations and very few oldpopulations. the importance of young populations decreases from star-forming,composite, seyfert 2 to liner. as to different infrared luminosity bins, uligs&amp; ligs (log($l_{ir}/l_{\odot})\geq$11) present younger populations thanstarbursts and normal galaxies. however, the dominant contributors to mass areold populations in all sample galaxies. the fittings by using the spectra ofstar clusters with different ages and metallicities as templates also giveconsistent results. the dominated populations in star-forming and compositegalaxies are those with metallicity $z=0.2z_\odot$, while liners and seyfert 2sare more metal-rich. the normal galaxies are more metal-rich than the uligs &amp;ligs and starbursts for the star-forming galaxies within different infraredluminosity bins. additionally, we also compare some synthesis results withother parameters obtained from the mpa/jhu catalog.
