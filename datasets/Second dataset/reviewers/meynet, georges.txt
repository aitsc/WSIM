0901.4489	evolution of massive stars along the cosmic history	massive stars are "cosmic engines" (cf the title of the iau symposium 250).they drive the photometric and chemical evolution of galaxies, inject energyand momentum through stellar winds and supernova explosions, they modify inthis way the physical state of the interstellar gas and have an impact on starformation. the evolution of massive stars depends sensitively on themetallicity which has an impact on the intensity of the line driven stellarwinds and on rotational mixing. we can distinguish four metallicity regimes:1.- the pop iii regime $0 \le z &lt; \sim 10^{-10}$; 2.- the low metallicityregime $10^{-10} \le z &lt; 0.001$; 3.- the near solar metallicity regime $0.001\le z &lt; 0.020$; 4.- the high metallicity regime $0.020 \le z$. in each of thesemetallicity ranges, some specific physical processes occur. in this review weshall discuss these physical processes and their consequences fornucleosynthesis and the massive star populations in galaxies. we shall mainlyfocus on the effects of axial rotation and mass loss by line driven winds,although of course other processes like binarity, magnetic fields, transportprocesses by internal waves may also play important roles.

0907.5471	yellow supergiants in the andromeda galaxy (m31)	the yellow supergiant content of nearby galaxies can provide a critical testof stellar evolution theory, bridging the gap between the hot, massive starsand the cool red supergiants. but, this region of the color-magnitude diagramis dominated by foreground contamination, requiring membership to somehow bedetermined. fortunately, the large negative systemic velocity of m31, coupledto its high rotation rate, provides the means for separating the contaminatingforeground dwarfs from the bona fide yellow supergiants within m31. using themmt, we obtained spectra of about 2900 stars, selected using the color andmagnitude range to be yellow supergiants. comparing the velocities to that ofm31's rotation curve, we identified 54 certain, and 66 probable yellowsupergiants from among the sea of foreground dwarfs. we find excellentagreement between the location of yellow supergiants in the h-r diagram andthat predicted by the latest geneva evolutionary tracks which include rotation.however, the relative number of yellow supergiants seen as a function of massvaries from that predicted by the models by a factor of more than 10, in thesense that more high mass yellow supergiants are predicted than are actuallyobserved. comparing the total number of yellow supergiants with masses above20mo with the estimated number of unevolved o stars indicates that the durationof the yellow supergiant phase is about 3000 years. this is consistent withwhat the 12mo and 15mo evolutionary tracks predict, but disagrees with the20,000-80,000 year time scales predicted by the models for higher masses.

0910.3856	nucleosynthesis in rotating massive stars and abundances in the early  galaxy	we discuss three effects of axial rotation at low metallicity. the first oneis the mixing of the chemical species which is predicted to be more efficientin low metallicity environments. a consequence is the production of importantquantities of primary $^{14}$n, $^{13}$c, $^{22}$ne and a strong impact on thenucleosynthesis of the {\it s}-process elements. the second effect is aconsequence of the first. strong mixing makes possible the apparition at thesurface of important quantities of cno elements. this increases the opacity ofthe outer layers and may trigger important mass loss by line driven winds. thethird effect is the fact that, during the main-sequence phase, stars, at verylow metallicity, reach more easily than their more metal rich counterparts, thecritical velocity\footnote{the critical velocity is the surface equatorialvelocity such that the centrifugal acceleration compensates for the localgravity.}. we discuss the respective importance of these three effects as afunction of the metallicity. we show the consequences for the early chemicalevolution of the galactic halo and for explaining the cemp stars. we concludethat rotation is probably a key feature which contributes in an important wayto shape the evolution of the first stellar generations in the universe.

0911.2420	effects of the variation of fundamental constants on pop iii stellar  evolution	a variation of the fundamental constants is expected to affect thethermonuclear rates important for stellar nucleosynthesis. in particular,because of the very small resonant energies of be8 and c12, the triple $\alpha$process is extremely sensitive to any such variations. using a microscopicmodel for these nuclei, we derive the sensitivity of the hoyle state to thenucleon-nucleon potential allowing for a change in the magnitude of the nuclearinteraction. we follow the evolution of 15 and 60 solar mass, zero metallicitystellar models, up to the end of core helium burning. these stars are assumedto be representative of the first, population iii stars. we derive limits onthe variation of the magnitude of the nuclear interaction and model dependentlimits on the variation of the fine structure constant based on the calculatedoxygen and carbon abundances resulting from helium burning. the requirementthat some c12 and o16 be present are the end of the helium burning phase allowsfor permille limits on the change of the nuclear interaction and limits oforder 10^{-5} on the fine structure constant relevant at a cosmologicalredshift of z ~ 15-20.

1001.1521	new estimates of the gamma-ray line emission of the cygnus region from  integral/spi observations	the cygnus region harbours a huge complex of massive stars at a distance of1.0-2.0kpc from us. about 170 o stars are distributed over several obassociations, among which the cyg ob2 cluster is by far the largest with about100-120 o stars. as a consequence of their successive nuclear-burning episodes,these massive stars inject large quantities of radioactive nuclei into theinterstellar medium such as 26al and 60fe. the gamma-ray line signal from thelatter is a solid tracer of ongoing nucleosynthesis. we want to compare thedecay emission from the cygnus region with predictions of recently improvedstellar models. as a first step, we establish observational constraints uponthe gamma-ray line emission from 26al and 60fe, with particular emphasis placedon separating the emission due to the cygnus complex from the foreground andbackground mean galactic contributions. we used the high-resolution gamma-rayspectrometer integral/spi to analyse the 26al and 60fe decay signal from thecygnus region. the weak gamma-ray line emissions at 1809 and 1173/1332kev havebeen characterised in terms of photometry, spectrometry, and source morphology.the 1809kev emission from cygnus is centred on the position of the cyg ob2cluster and has a typical size of 9 degrees or more. the total 1809kev fluxfrom the cygnus region is (6.0 +/- 1.0) x10e-5 ph/cm2/s, but the flux reallyattributable to the cygnus complex reduces to (3.9 +/- 1.1) x10e-5 ph/cm2/s.the 1809kev line centroid is agrees with expectations considering the directionand distance of the cygnus complex, and the line width is consistent withtypical motions of the interstellar medium. no decay emission from 60fe hasbeen observed from the cygnus region and an upper limit of 1.6 x10e-5 ph/cm2/swas derived.

1004.5024	are c-rich ultra iron poor stars also he-rich?	(abridged) the three most iron poor stars presently known ([fe/h] equal to-5.96, -5.4 and -4.75) are carbon-rich, they are called c-rich ultra-metal poorstars (crumps). the origin of their peculiar surface abundances is notunderstood. we propose a synthetic view of the different models so far proposedto explain the peculiar abundances observed at the surface of the crump stars.we deduce some expected trends based on nucleosynthetic arguments and look forsignatures allowing to discriminate among models. we discuss the conditions forhaving crump stars which are he-rich, i.e. with a mass fraction of heliumgreater than 0.30 and up to 0.60. we discuss the chemical composition of starsmade of interstellar medium mixed with wind material of very metal poor massivestars, with wind plus supernova ejecta and with material extracted from theenvelope of early agb stars. rotating and non-rotating models are considered.crump stars formed from wind material of massive stars mixed with small amountsof pristine interstellar medium are he-rich (helium mass fraction between 0.30and 0.60), li-depleted and present low $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratios (inferior to 10in number). such he-rich stars, if discovered, would confirm that the mostmetal poor crumps formed from essentially pure wind/envelope material. theywould provide the most direct way to probe the nucleosynthetic outputs of thefirst generations of stars. we show that rotation is a key ingredient toexplain the abundance patterns of crumps stars.

1005.5711	effect of low mass dark matter particles on the sun	we study the effect of dark matter (dm) particles in the sun, focusing inparticular on the possible reduction of the solar neutrinos flux due to theenergy carried away by dm particles from the innermost regions of the sun, andto the consequent reduction of the temperature of the solar core. we find thatin the very low-mass range between 4 and 10 gev, recently advocated to explainthe findings of the dama and cogent experiments, the effects on neutrino fluxesare detectable only for dm models with very small, or vanishing,self-annihilation cross section, such as the so-called asymmetric dm models,and we study the combination of dm masses and spin dependent cross sectionswhich can be excluded with current solar neutrino data. finally, we revisit therecent claim that dm models with large self-interacting cross sections can leadto a modification of the position of the convective zone, alleviating orsolving the solar composition problem. we show that when the `geometric' upperlimit on the capture rate is correctly taken into account, the effects of dmare reduced by orders of magnitude, and the position of the convective zoneremains unchanged.

1006.5742	yellow supergiants in the small magellanic cloud (smc): putting current  evolutionary theory to the test	the yellow supergiant content of nearby galaxies provides a critical test ofmassive star evolutionary theory. while these stars are the brightest in agalaxy, they are difficult to identify because a large number of foregroundmilky way stars have similar colors and magnitudes. we previously conducted acensus of yellow supergiants within m31 and found that the evolutionary trackspredict a yellow supergiant duration an order of magnitude longer than weobserved. here we turn our attention to the smc, where the metallicity is 10xlower than that of m31, which is important as metallicity strongly affectsmassive star evolution. the smc's large radial velocity (~160 km/s) allows usto separate members from foreground stars. observations of ~500 candidatesyielded 176 near-certain smc supergiants, 16 possible smc supergiants, alongwith 306 foreground stars and provide good relative numbers of yellowsupergiants down to 12mo. of the 176 near-certain smc supergiants, thekinematics predicted by the besancon model of the milky way suggest aforeground contamination of &gt;4%. after placing the smc supergiants on the h-rdiagram and comparing our results to the geneva evolutionary tracks, we findresults similar to those of the m31 study: while the locations of the stars onthe h-r diagram match the locations of evolutionary tracks well, the modelsover-predict the yellow supergiant lifetime by a factor of ten. uncertaintiesabout the mass-loss rates on the main-sequence thus cannot be the primaryproblem with the models.

0708.3185	nucleosynthesis from massive stars 50 years after b2fh	we review some important observed properties of massive stars. then wediscuss how mass loss and rotation affect their evolution and help in givingbetter fits to observational constraints. consequences for nucleosynthesis atdifferent metallicities are discussed. mass loss appear to be the key featureat high metallicity, while rotation is likely dominant at low and very lowmetallicities. we discuss various indications supporting the view that verymetal poor stars had their evolution strongly affected by rotational mixing.many features, like the origin of primary nitrogen at low metallicity, that ofthe c-rich extremely metal poor halo stars, of he-rich stars in massiveglobular clusters, of the o-na anticorrelation in globular clusters may berelated to the existence of a population of very fast rotating metal poor starsthat we tentatively call the {\it spinstars}. a fraction of these {\itspinstars} may also be the progenitors of grb in very metal poor regions. theymay avoid pair instability explosion due to the heavy mass loss undergoneduring their early evolutionary phases and be, dependent on their frequency,important sources of ionising photons in the early universe.

1011.5795	massive star models with magnetic braking	magnetic fields at the surface of a few early-type stars have been directlydetected. these fields have magnitudes between a few hundred g up to a few kg.in one case, evidence of magnetic braking has been found. we investigate theeffects of magnetic braking on the evolution of rotating ($\upsilon_{\rmini}$=200 km s$^{-1}$) 10 m$_\odot$ stellar models at solar metallicity duringthe main-sequence (ms) phase. the magnetic braking process is included in ourstellar models according to the formalism deduced from 2d mhd simulations ofmagnetic wind confinement by ud-doula and co-workers. various assumptions aremade regarding both the magnitude of the magnetic field and of the efficiencyof the angular momentum transport mechanisms in the stellar interior. whenmagnetic braking occurs in models with differential rotation, a strong andrapid mixing is obtained at the surface accompanied by a rapid decrease in thesurface velocity. such a process might account for some ms stars showing strongmixing and low surface velocities. when solid-body rotation is imposed in theinterior, the star is slowed down so rapidly that surface enrichments aresmaller than in similar models with no magnetic braking. in both kinds ofmodels (differentially or uniformly rotating), magnetic braking due to a fieldof a few 100 g significantly reduces the angular momentum of the core duringthe ms phase. this reduction is much greater in solid-body rotating models.

1011.6581	effects of anisotropic winds on massive stars evolution	whenever stars are rotating very fast (omega/omega_crit &gt; 0.7, withomega_crit the keplerian angular velocity of the star accounting for itsdeformation) radiative stellar winds are enhanced in polar regions. thistheoretical prediction is now confirmed by interferometric observations of fastrotating stars.} polar winds remove less angular momentum than spherical windsand thus allow the star to keep more angular momentum. we quantitatively assessthe importance of this effect.  first we use a semi-analytical approach to estimate the variation of theangular momentum loss when the rotation parameter increases. then we computecomplete 9 msun stellar models at very high angular velocities (starting on thezams with omega/omega_crit = 0.8 and reaching the critical velocity during themain sequence) with and without radiative wind anisotropies.  when wind anisotropies are accounted for, the angular momentum loss rate isreduced by less than 4% for omega/omega_crit &lt; 0.9 with respect to the case ofspherical winds. the reduction amounts to at most 30% when the star is rotatingnear the critical velocity. these values result from two counteracting effects:on the one hand polar winds reduce the loss of angular momentum, on the otherhand, surface deformations imply that the mass which is lost at highco-latitude is lost at a larger distance from the rotational axis and thusremoves more angular momentum.  in contrast with previous studies, which neglected surface deformations, weshow that the radiative wind anisotropies have a relatively modest effect onthe evolution of the angular momentum content of fast rotating stars.

0709.1886	mass loss and very low-metallicity stars	mass loss plays a dominant role in the evolution of massive stars at solarmetallicity. after discussing different mass loss mechanisms and theirmetallicity dependence, we present the possibility of strong mass loss at verylow metallicity. our models at z=1e-8 show that stars more massive than about60 solar masses may lose a significant fraction of their initial mass in thered supergiant phase. this mass loss is due to the surface enrichment in cnoelements via rotational and convective mixing. our 85 solar mass model ends itslife as a fast rotating wo type wolf-rayet star. therefore the models predictthe existence of type ic sne and long and soft grbs at very low metallicities.such strong mass loss in the red supergiant phase or the omega-gamma limitcould prevent the most massive stars from ending as pair-creation supernovae.  the very low metallicity models calculated are also very interesting from thenucleosynthesis point of view. indeed, the wind of the massive star models canreproduce the cno abundances of the most metal-poor carbon-rich star known todate, he1327-2326. finally, using chemical evolution models, we are able toreproduce the evolution of cno elements as observed in the normal extremelymetal poor stars.

1103.3777	magnetic fields in massive stars, their winds, and their nebulae	massive stars are crucial building blocks of galaxies and the universe, asproduction sites of heavy elements and as stirring agents and energy providersthrough stellar winds and supernovae. the field of magnetic massive stars hasseen tremendous progress in recent years. different perspectives -- rangingfrom direct field measurements over dynamo theory and stellar evolution tocolliding winds and the stellar environment -- fruitfully combine into a mostinteresting and still evolving overall picture, which we attempt to reviewhere. zeeman signatures leave no doubt that at least some o- and early b-typestars have a surface magnetic field. indirect evidence, especially non-thermalradio emission from colliding winds, suggests many more. the emerging picturefor massive stars shows similarities with results from intermediate mass stars,for which much more data are available. observations are often compatible witha dipole or low order multi-pole field of about 1 kg (o-stars) or 300 g to 30kg (ap / bp stars). weak and unordered fields have been detected in the o-starzeta-ori a and in vega, the first normal a-type star with a magnetic field.theory offers essentially two explanations for the origin of the observedsurface fields: fossil fields, particularly for strong and ordered fields, ordifferent dynamo mechanisms, preferentially for less ordered fields. numericalsimulations yield the first concrete stable (fossil) field configuration, butgive contradictory results as to whether dynamo action in the radiativeenvelope of massive main sequence stars is possible. internal magnetic fields,which may not even show up at the stellar surface, affect stellar evolution asthey lead to a more uniform rotation, with more slowly rotating cores andfaster surface rotation. surface metallicities may become enhanced, thusaffecting the mass-loss rates.

1109.6171	rotating massive stars through the ages, with applications to wr stars,  pop iii stars and gamma ray bursts	this article first reviews the basic physics of rotating stars and theirevolution. we examine in particular the changes of the mechanical and thermalequilibrium of rotating stars. an important (predicted and observed) effect isthat rotating stars are hotter at the poles and cooler at the equator. webriefly discuss the mass loss by stellar winds, which are influenced by theanisotropic temperature distribution. these anisotropies in the interior arealso driving circulation currents, which transports the chemical elements andthe angular momentum in stars. internal differential rotation, if present,creates instabilities and mixing, in particular the shear mixing, thehorizontal turbulence and their interactions. a major check of the modelpredictions concerns the changes of the surface abundances, which are modifiedby mass loss in the very massive stars and by rotational mixing in o- andb-type stars. we show that the observations confirm the existence of rotationalmixing, with much larger effects at lower metallicities. we discuss thepredictions of stellar models concerning the evolution of the surfacevelocities, the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram and lifetimes, thepopulations of blue, red supergiants and wolf-rayet stars, and the progenitorsof type ibc supernovae. we show, that in many aspects, rotating models providea much better fit than non-rotating ones. using the same physical ingredientsas those which fit the best the observations of stars at near solarmetallicities, we explore the consequences of rotating models for the status ofbe stars, the progenitors of gamma ray bursts, the evolution of pop iii starsand of very metal poor stars, the early chemical evolution of galaxies, theorigin of the c-enhanced metal poor stars (cemp) and of the chemical anomaliesin globular clusters.

1209.4518	superbubble dynamics in globular cluster infancy i. how do globular  clusters first lose their cold gas?	the picture of the early evolution of globular clusters has beensignificantly revised in recent years. current scenarios require at least twogenerations of stars of which the first generation (1g), and therefore also theprotocluster cloud, has been much more massive than the currently predominatingsecond generation (2g). fast gas expulsion is thought to unbind the majority ofthe 1g stars. gas expulsion is also mandatory to remove metal-enrichedsupernova ejecta, which are not found in the 2g stars. it has long been thoughtthat the supernovae themselves are the agent of the gas expulsion, based oncrude energetics arguments. here, we assume that gas expulsion happens via theformation of a superbubble, and describe the kinematics by a thin-shell model.we find that supernova- driven shells are destroyed by the rayleigh-taylorinstability before they reach escape speed for all but perhaps the leastmassive and most extended clusters. more power is required to expel the gas,which might plausibly be provided by a coherent onset of accretion onto thestellar remnants. the resulting kpc-sized bubbles might be observable infaraday rotation maps with the planned square kilometre array radio telescopeagainst polarised background radio lobes if a globular cluster would happen toform in front of such a radio lobe.

1301.2487	models of rotating massive stars: impacts of various prescriptions	the rotation of stars has many interesting and important consequences for thephotometric and chemical evolution of galaxies. many of the predictions ofmodels of stellar rotation are now compared with observations of surfaceabundances and velocities, with interferometric studies of fast rotating stars,with internal rotation profiles as they can be deduced by asteroseismology, tocite just a few observational constraints. in this paper, we investigate howthe outputs of models depend on the prescriptions used for the diffusioncoefficients included in the shellular rotating models. after recalling thevarious prescriptions found in the literature, we discuss their impacts on theevolutionary tracks and lifetimes of the main-sequence (ms) phase, the changesof the surface composition and velocities during the ms phase, the distributionof the core helium lifetime in the blue and the red part of the hr diagram, theextensions of the blue loops, the evolution of the angular momentum of thecore, and the synthesis of primary nitrogen in fast-rotating metal-poor massivestars. while some of these outputs depend only slightly on the prescriptionsused (for instance, the evolution of the surface velocities), most of them showa significant dependence. the models which best fit the changes of the surfaceabundances are those computed with the vertical shear diffusion coefficient ofmaeder (1997) and the horizontal shear diffusion coefficient by zahn (1992).

1302.2494	superbubble dynamics in globular cluster infancy ii. consequences for  secondary star formation in the context of self-enrichment via fast rotating  massive stars	the self-enrichment scenario for globular clusters (gc) requires largeamounts of residual gas after the initial formation of the first stellargeneration. recently, krause et al. (2012) found that supernovae may not beable to expel that gas, as required to explain their present day gas-freestate, and suggested that a sudden accretion on to the dark remnants, at astage when type ii supernovae have ceased, may plausibly lead to fast gasexpulsion. here, we explore the consequences of these results for theself-enrichment scenario via fast rotating massive stars (frms). we analyse theinteraction of frms with the intra-cluster medium (icm), in particular where,when and how the second generation of stars may form. from the results, wedevelop a timeline of the first approximately 40 myr of gc evolution. theresults of paper i imply three phases during which the icm is in afundamentally different state, namely the wind bubble phase (lasting 3.5 to 8.8myr), the supernova phase (lasting 26.2 to 31.5 myr), and the dark remnantaccretion phase (lasting 0.1 to 4 myr): (i) quickly after the first generationmassive stars have formed, stellar wind bubbles compress the icm into thinfilaments. no stars may form in the normal way during this phase, due to thehigh lyman-werner flux density. if the first generation massive stars havehowever equatorial ejections, as we proposed in the frms scenario, accretionmay resume in the shadow of the equatorial ejecta. the second generation starsmay then form due to gravitational instability in these discs that are fed byboth the frms ejecta and pristine gas.

1305.2474	evolution of blue supergiants and \alpha cygni variables; puzzling cno  surface abundances	a massive star can enter the blue supergiant region either evolving directlyfrom the main-sequence, or evolving from a previous red supergiant stage. thefractions of the blue supergiants having different histories depend on theinternal mixing and mass-loss during the red supergiant stage. we study thepossibility to use diagnostics based on stellar pulsation to discriminate bluesupergiants having different evolution histories. for this purpose we havestudied the pulsation property of massive star models calculated with thegeneva stellar evolution code for initial masses ranging from 8 to 50 m$_\odot$with a solar metallicity of $z=0.014$. we have found that radial pulsations areexcited in the blue-supergiant region only in the models that had beenred-supergiants before. this would provide us with a useful mean to diagnosethe history of evolution of each blue-supergiant. at a given effectivetemperature, much more nonradial pulsations are excited in the model after thered-supergiant stage than in the model evolving towards the red-supergiant. theproperties of radial and nonradial pulsations in blue supergiants arediscussed. predicted periods are compared with period ranges observed in some\alpha-cygni variables in the galaxy and ngc 300. we have found that bluesupergiant models after the red-supergiant stage roughly agree with observedperiod ranges in most cases. however, we are left with the puzzle that thepredicted surface n/c and n/o ratios seem to be too high compared with those ofdeneb and rigel.

1305.4728	strange mode instability for micro-variations in luminous blue variables	if a massive star has lost significant mass during its red-supergiant stage,it would return to blue region in the hr diagram and spend a part of thecore-he burning stage as a blue supergiant having a luminosity to mass ratio(l/m) considerably larger than about 10^4 (in solar units); the durationdepends on the degree of internal mixing and on the metallicity. then, variousstellar pulsations are excited by enhanced \kappa-mechanism and strange modeinstability. assuming these pulsations to be responsible for (at least some of)the quasi-periodic light and radial-velocity variations in \alpha cygnivariables including luminous blue variables (lbvs; or s dor variables), we canpredict masses and surface compositions for these variables, and compare themwith observed ones to constrain the evolutionary models. we discuss radialpulsations excited in evolutionary models of an initial mass of 40 m_\odot withsolar metallicity of z=0.014, and compare them to micro-variations in the twogalactic lbvs, hr car and hd 160529. we have found that these stars should haslost more than half of the initial mass and their surface cno abundances shouldbe significantly modified from the original ones showing partial h-burningproducts.

1311.4744	the puzzle of the cno abundances of {\alpha} cygni variables resolved by  the ledoux criterion?	recent stellar evolution computations show that the blue supergiant (bsg)stars could come from two distinct populations: a first group arising frommassive stars that just left the main sequence (ms) and are crossing thehertzsprung-russell diagram (hrd) towards the red supergiant (rsg) branch, anda second group coming from stars that have lost considerable amount of massduring the rsg stage and are crossing the hrd for a second time towards theblue region. due to very different luminosity-to- mass ratio, only stars fromthe second group are expected to have excited pulsations observable at thesurface. in a previous work, we have shown that our models were able toreproduce the pulsational properties of bsgs. however, these models failed toreproduce the surface chemical composition of stars evolving back from a rsgphase. in this paper, we show how the use of the ledoux criterion instead ofthe schwarzschild one for convection allows to significantly improve theagreement with the observed chemical composition, while keeping the agreementwith the pulsation periods. this gives some support to the ledoux criterion.

1403.5444	the effects of stellar rotation. ii. a comprehensive set of starburst99  models	we present a new set of synthesis models for stellar populations obtainedwith starburst99, which are based on new stellar evolutionary tracks withrotation. we discuss models with zero rotation velocity and with velocities of40% of the break-up velocity on the zero-age main-sequence. these values areexpected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellarpopulations. the new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous andhotter due to a larger convective core and enhanced surface abundances. thisresults in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral energy distribution ofa population containing massive stars. the changes are most significant at theshortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to afactor of 5 is predicted. we also show that high equivalent widths ofrecombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very young age but can beachieved at ages as late as 10 myr. comparison of these two boundary cases (0and 40% of the break-up velocity) will allow users to evaluate the effects ofrotation and provide guidance for calibrating the stellar evolution models. wealso introduce a new theoretical ultraviolet spectral library built from thepotsdam wolf-rayet (powr) atmospheres. its purpose is to help identifysignatures of wolf-rayet stars in the ultraviolet whose strength is sensitiveto the particulars of the evolution models. the new models are available forsolar and 1/7th solar metallicities. a complete suite of models can begenerated on the starburst99 website (www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/). theupdated starburst99 package can be retrieved from this website as well.

1404.1020	evolution of surface cno abundances in massive stars	the nitrogen to carbon (n/c) and nitrogen to oxygen (n/o) ratios are the mostsensitive quantities to mixing in stellar interiors of intermediate and massivestars. we further investigate the theoretical properties of these ratios aswell as put in context recent observational results obtained by the vlt-flamessurvey of massive stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds. we consideranalytical relations and numerical models of stellar evolution as well as ourown stellar atmosphere models, and we critically re-investigate observedspectra. on the theoretical side, the n/c vs n/o plot shows little dependenceon the initial stellar masses, rotation velocities, and nature of the mixingprocesses up to relative enrichment of n/o by a factor of about four, thus thisplot constitutes an ideal quality test for observational results. thecomparison between the flames survey and theoretical values shows overallagreement, despite the observational scatter of the published results. theexistence of some mixing of cno products is clearly confirmed, however theaccuracy of the data is not sufficient for allowing a test of the significantdifferences between different models of rotating stars and the geneva models.we discuss reasons (for the most part due to observational bias) why part ofthe observational data points should not be considered for this comparison.when these observational data points are not considered, the scatter isreduced. finally, the n/c vs n/o plot potentially offers a powerful way fordiscriminating blue supergiants before the red supergiant stage from thoseafter it. also, red supergiants of similar low velocities may exhibit differentn enrichments, depending on their initial rotation during the main-sequencephase.

1404.6952	populations of rotating stars iii. syclist, the new geneva population  synthesis code	(abridged) we present a new tool for building synthetic colour-magnitudediagrams of coeval stellar populations. we study, from a theoretical point ofview, the impact of axial rotation of stars on various observed properties ofsingle-aged stellar populations: magnitude at the turnoff, photometricproperties of evolved stars, surface velocities, surface abundances, and theimpact of rotation on the age determination of clusters by an isochronefitting. stellar models for different initial masses, metallicities, andzero-age main sequence (zams) rotational velocities are used for buildinginterpolated stellar tracks, isochrones, and synthetic clusters for variousages and metallicities. the synthetic populations account for the effects ofthe initial distribution of the rotational velocities on the zams, the impactof the inclination angle and the effects of gravity and limb darkening,unresolved binaries and photometric errors. interpolated tracks, isochrones,and synthetic clusters can be computed through a public web interface. forclusters with a metallicity in the range [0.002, 0.014] and an age between 30myr and 1 gyr, the fraction of fast rotators on the main sequence (ms) band isthe largest just below the turnoff. this is a natural consequence of theincrease in the ms lifetime due to rotation. the fraction of fast rotators onemagnitude below the turnoff also increases with the age of the cluster between30 myr and 1 gyr. there is an increase in the fraction of enriched stars whenthe metallicity decreases. we show that the use of isochrones computed fromrotating stellar models with an initial rotation that is representative of theaverage initial rotation of the stars in clusters provides a reasonableestimate of the age, even though stars in a real cluster did not start theirevolution with an identical initial rotation.

1408.1192	magnetic braking of stellar cores in red giants and supergiants	magnetic configurations, stable on the long term, appear to exist in variousevolutionary phases, from main-sequence stars to white dwarfs and neutronstars. the large scale ordered nature of these fields, often approximatelydipolar, and their scaling according to the flux conservation scenario favorthe model of a fossil field (duez et al. 2010). we make some first estimates ofthe magnetic coupling between the stellar cores and the outer layers in redgiants and supergiants. analytical expressions of the truncation radius of thefield coupling are established for a convective envelope and for a rotatingradiative zone with horizontal turbulence. the timescales of the internalexchanges of angular momentum are considered.  numerical estimates are made on the basis of recent model grids. the directmagnetic coupling of the core to the extended convective envelope of red giantsand supergiants appears unlikely. however, we find that the intermediateradiative zone is fully coupled to the core during the he-burning and laterphases. this coupling is able to produce a strong spin down of the core of redgiants and supergiants, also leading to relatively slowly rotating stellarremnants, like white dwarfs and pulsars. some angular momentum is alsotransferred to the outer convective envelope of red giants and supergiantsduring the he-burning phase and later.

1505.00603	the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship of blue supergiant  stars as a constraint for stellar evolution	(abridged) the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship (fglr) of bluesupergiant stars (bsg) links their absolute magnitude to the spectroscopicallydetermined flux-weighted gravity log g = teff^4. bsg are the brightest stars inthe universe at visual light and the application of the fglr has become apowerful tool to determine extragalactic distances. observationally, the fglris a tight relationship with only small scatter. it is, therefore, ideal to beused as a constraint for stellar evolution models. the goal of this work is toinvestigate whether stellar evolution can reproduce the observed fglr and todevelop an improved foundation of the fglr as an extragalactic distanceindicator. we use different grids of stellar models for initial masses between9 and 40 msun, for metallicities between z = 0.002 and 0.014, with and withoutrotation, computed with various mass loss rates during the red supergiantphase. for each of these models we discuss the details of post-main sequenceevolution and construct theoretical fglrs by means of population synthesismodels which we then compare with the observed fglr. in general, the stellarevolution model fglrs agree reasonably well with the observed one. there are,however, differences between the models, in particular with regard to the shapeand width (scatter) in the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity plane. the bestagreement is obtained with models which include the effects of rotation andassume that the large majority, if not all the observed bsg evolve towards thered supergiant phase and only a few are evolving back from this stage. theeffects of metallicity on the shape and scatter of the fglr are small.

1511.07640	massive star formation by accretion i. disc accretion	massive stars likely form by accretion and the evolutionary track of anaccreting forming star corresponds to what is called the birthline in the hrdiagram. the shape of this birthline is quite sensitive to the evolution of theentropy in the accreting star. we first study the reasons why some birthlinespublished in past years present different behaviours for a given accretionrate. we then revisit the question of the accretion rate, which allows us tounderstand the distribution of the observed pre-main-sequence (pre-ms) stars inthe hertzsprung-russell (hr) diagram. finally, we identify the conditionsneeded to obtain a large inflation of the star along its pre-ms evolution thatmay push the birthline towards the hayashi line in the upper part of the hrdiagram. we present new pre-ms models including accretion at various rates andfor different initial structures of the accreting core. from the observed upperenvelope of pre-ms stars in the hr diagram, we deduce the accretion law thatbest matches the accretion history of most of the intermediate-mass stars. inthe case of cold disc accretion, the existence of a significant swelling duringthe accretion phase, which leads to radii $\gtrsim100\,r_\odot$ and brings thestar back to the red part of the hr diagram, depends sensitively on the initialconditions. for an accretion rate of $10^{-3}\,m_\odot\rm\,yr^{-1}$, onlymodels starting from a core with a significant radiative region evolve back tothe red part of the hr diagram. we also obtain that, in order to reproduce theobserved upper envelope of pre-ms stars in the hr diagram with an accretion lawdeduced from the observed mass outflows in ultra-compact hii regions, the masseffectively accreted onto the star with respect to the total in falling matterdecreases when the mass of the star increases.

0807.5061	wind anisotropy and stellar evolution	mass loss is a determinant factor which strongly affects the evolution andthe fate of massive stars. at low metallicity, stars are supposed to rotatefaster than at the solar one. this favors the existence of stars near thecritical velocity. in this rotation regime, the deformation of the stellarsurface becomes important, and wind anisotropy develops. polar winds areexpected to be dominant for fast rotating hot stars.  these polar winds allow the star to lose large quantities of mass and stillretain a high angular momentum, and they modifie the evolution of the surfacevelocity and the final angular momentum kept in the star's core. we show herehow these winds affect the final stages of massive stars, according to ourknowledge about gamma ray bursts. computation of theoretical gamma ray burstsrate indicates that our models have too fast rotating cores, and that we needto include an additional effect to spin them down. magnetic fields in stars actin this direction, and we show how they modify the evolution of massive star upto the final stages.

astro-ph;0004204	the evolution of rotating stars	first, we review the main physical effects to be considered in the buildingof evolutionary models of rotating stars on the upper main-sequence (ms). theinternal rotation law evolves as a result of contraction and expansion,meridional circulation, diffusion processes and mass loss. in turn,differential rotation and mixing exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion,so that a consistent treatment is necessary.  we review recent results on the evolution of internal rotation and thesurface rotational velocities for stars on the upper ms, for red giants,supergiants and w-r stars. a fast rotation is enhancing the mass loss bystellar winds and reciprocally high mass loss is removing a lot of angularmomentum. the problem of the ``break-up'' or $\omega$-limit is criticallyexamined in connection with the origin of be and lbv stars. the effects ofrotation on the tracks in the hr diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, theblue to red supergiant ratios, the formation of w-r stars, the chemicalabundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and agb stars, arereviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the galaxy andmagellanic clouds. the effects of rotation on the final stages and on thechemical yields are examined, as well as the constraints placed by the periodsof pulsars. on the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is notonly a function of mass m and metallicity z, but of angular velocity $\omega$as well.

astro-ph;0006404	stellar evolution with rotation v: changes in all the outputs of massive  star models	grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120m$_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity. the following effects of rotation areincluded: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservativecase, surface distorsions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridionalcirculation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability andcoupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentumtreated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemicalelements.  globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have animportance comparable to those of mass loss. for an average rotation, thetracks in the hr diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. ingeneral, an average rotation may increase the ms lifetime up to about 30 %; forthe helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10 %.  rotation also brings significant surface he- and n-enhancements, they arehigher for higher masses and rotation.

astro-ph;0006405	stellar evolution with rotation vi: the eddington and omega-limits, the  rotational mass loss for ob and lbv stars	several properties of massive stars with large effects of rotation andradiation are studied. we show that there are 2 roots for the equation givingthe rotational velocities at break-up: 1) the usual solution, which is shown toapply when the eddington ratio $\gamma$ of the star is smaller than formally0.639. 2) above this value of $\gamma$, there is a second root, inferior to thefirst one, for the break-up velocity. this second solution tends to zero, when$\gamma$ tends towards 1. this second root results from the interplay ofradiation and rotation, and in particular from the reduction by rotation of theeffective mass in the local eddington factor. the analysis made here shouldhopefully clarify a recent debate between langer (\cite{la97,la98}) and glatzel(\cite{gla98}).  the expression for the global mass loss-rates is a function of both $\omega$and $\gamma$, and this may give raise to extreme mass loss-rates ($\omega\gamma $-limit). in particular, for o-type stars, lbv stars, supergiants andwolf-rayet stars, even slow rotation may dramatically enhance the mass lossrates. numerical examples in the range of 9 to 120 m$_{\odot}$ at various$t_\mathrm{eff}$ are given.

astro-ph;0205370	stellar evolution with rotation viii: models at z = 10^{-5} and cno  yields for early galactic evolution	we calculate a grid of star models with and without the effects of axialrotation for stars in the mass range between 2 and 60 m$_{\odot}$ for themetallicity $z = 10^{-5}$. star models with initial masses superior or equal to9 m$_\odot$ were computed up to the end of the carbon--burning phase. starmodels with masses between 2 and 7 m$_\odot$ were evolved beyond the end of thehe--burning phase through a few thermal pulses during the agb phase. comparedto models at $z=0.02$, the low $z$ models show faster rotating cores andstronger internal $\omega$--gradients, which favour an important mixing of thechemical elements. in very low $z$ models, primary nitrogen is produced duringthe he--burning phase by rotational diffusion of $^{12}$c into the h--burningshell. the intermediate mass stars of very low $z$ are the main producers ofprimary $^{14}$n, but massive stars also contribute to this production; nosignificant primary nitrogen is made in models at metallicity $z$=0.004 orabove. we calculate the chemical yields in he, c, n, o and heavy elements anddiscuss the chemical evolution of the cno elements at very low z. remarkably,the c/o vs o/h diagram is mainly sensitive to the interval of stellar masses,while the n/o vs o/h diagram is mainly sensitive to the average rotation of thestars contributing to the element synthesis. the presently availableobservations in these diagrams seem to favour contributions either from starsdown to about 2 m$_{\odot}$ with normal rotation velocities or from stars above8 m$_{\odot}$ but with very fast rotation.

astro-ph;0301287	the effects of rotation on wolf--rayet stars and on the production of  primary nitrogen by intermediate mass stars	we use the rotating stellar models described in the paper by a. maeder &amp; g.meynet in this volume to consider the effects of rotation on the evolution ofthe most massive stars into and during the wolf--rayet phase, and on thepost-main sequence evolution of intermediate mass stars. the two main resultsof this discussion are the following. first, we show that rotating models areable to account for the observed properties of the wolf--rayet stellarpopulations at solar metallicity. second, at low metallicities, the inclusionof stellar rotation in the calculation of chemical yields can lead to a longertime delay between the release of oxygen and nitrogen into the interstellarmedium following an episode of star formation, since stars of lower masses(compared to non-rotating models) can synthesize primary n. qualitatively, suchan effect may be required to explain the relative abundances of n and o inextragalactic metal--poor environments, particularly at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0308067	stellar yields with rotation and their effect on chemical evolution  models	we compute the evolution of different abundance ratios in the milky way (mw)for two different sets of stellar yields. in one of them stellar rotation istaken into account and we investigate its effects on the chemical evolutionmodel predictions. moreover, we show that some abundance ratios offer animportant tool to investigate the halo-disk discontinuity. for the first timeit is shown that the effect of a halt in the star formation between thehalo/thick disk and thin disk phases, already suggested from studies based bothon fe/o vs. o/h and fe/mg vs. mg/h, should also be seen in a c/o versus o/hplot if c is produced mainly by low- and intermediate-mass stars (lims). theidea that c originates mainly from lims is suggested by the flat behavior ofthe [c/fe] ratio as a function of metallicity, from [fe/h]=-2.2 to solar, andby the fact that very recent c/o measurements for stars in the mw halo and diskseem to show a discontinuity around log(o/h)+12=8.4. finally, a more gentleincrease of n abundance with metallicity (or time), relative to models adoptingthe yields of van den hoek and groenewegen (1997), is predicted by using thestellar yields of meynet and maeder (2002 - which include stellar rotation butnot hot-bottom burning) for intermediate mass stars. this fact has someimplications for the timescales of n enrichment and thus for the interpretationof the nature of damped lyman alpha systems.

astro-ph;0309672	stellar evolution with rotation and magnetic fields:i. the relative  importance of rotational and magnetic effects	we compare the current effects of rotation in stellar evolution to those ofthe magnetic field created by the tayler instability. in stellar regions, wheremagnetic field can be generated by the dynamo due to differential rotation(spruit 2002), we find that the growth rate of the magnetic instability is muchfaster than for the thermal instability. thus, meridional circulation isnegligible with respect to the magnetic fields, both for the transport ofangular momentum and of chemical elements. also, the horizontal coupling by themagnetic field, which reaches values of a few $10^5$ g, is much more importantthan the effects of the horizontal turbulence. the field, however, is notsufficient to distort the shape of the equipotentials. we impose the conditionthat the energy of the magnetic field created by the tayler--spruit dynamocannot be larger than the energy excess present in the differential rotation.this leads to a criterion for the existence of the magnetic field in stellarinteriors. numerical tests are made in a rotating star model of 15 m$_{\odot}$rotating with an initial velocity of 300 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$.

astro-ph;0404417	stellar evolution with rotation and magnetic fields ii: general  equations for the transport by tayler--spruit dynamo	we further develop the tayler--spruit dynamo theory, based on the mostefficient instability for generating magnetic fields in radiative layers ofdifferentially rotating stars. we avoid the simplifying assumptions that eitherthe $\mu$-- or the $t$--gradient dominates, but we treat the general case andwe also account for the nonadiabatic effects, which favour the growth of themagnetic field. stars with a magnetic field rotate almost as a solid body.several of their properties (size of the core, ms lifetimes, tracks,abundances) are closer to those of models without rotation than with rotationonly. in particular, the observed n/c or n/h excesses in ob stars are betterexplained by our previous models with rotation only than by the present modelswith magnetic fields that predict no nitrogen excesses. we show that there is acomplex feedback loop between the magnetic instability and the thermalinstability driving meridional circulation. this opens the possibility forfurther magnetic models, but at this stage we do not know the relativeimportance of the magnetic fields due to the tayler instability in stellarinteriors.

astro-ph;0510560	the early star generations: the dominant effect of rotation on the cno  yields	we examine the role of rotation on the evolution and chemical yields of verymetal--poor stars. the models include the same physics, which was appliedsuccessfully at the solar $z$ and for the smc, in particular, shear diffusion,meridional circulation, horizontal turbulence, and rotationally enhanced massloss. models of very low $z$ experience a much stronger internal mixing in allphases than at solar $z$. also, rotating models at very low $z$, contrary tothe usual considerations, show a large mass loss, which mainly results from theefficient mixing of the products of the 3$\alpha$ reaction into the h--burningshell. this mixing allows convective dredge--up to enrich the stellar surfacein heavy elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours alarge loss of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases theduration of this phase. on the whole, the low $z$ stars may lose about half oftheir mass. massive stars initially rotating at half of their critical velocityare likely to avoid the pair--instability supernova. the chemical compositionof the rotationally enhanced winds of very low $z$ stars show large cnoenhancements by factors of $10^3$ to $10^7$, together with large excesses of$^{13}$c and $^{17}$o and moderate amounts of na and al. the excesses ofprimary n are particularly striking. when these ejecta from the rotationallyenhanced winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from the corresponding cocores, we find [c/fe], [n/fe],[o/fe] abundance ratios that are very similar tothose observed in the c--rich, extremely metal--poor stars (cemp). we show thatrotating agb stars and rotating massive stars have about the same effects onthe cno enhancements.

astro-ph;0511074	evolution of the first stars: cno yields and the c-rich extremely metal  poor stars	rotating massive stars at $z=10^{-8}$ and $10^{-5}$ lose a great part oftheir initial mass through stellar winds. the chemical composition of therotationally enhanced winds of very low $z$ stars is very peculiar. the windsshow large cno enhancements by factors of $10^3$ to $10^7$, together with largeexcesses of $^{13}$c and $^{17}$o and moderate amounts of na and al. theexcesses of primary n are particularly striking. when these ejecta from therotationally enhanced winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from thecorresponding co cores, we find [c/fe], [n/fe],[o/fe] abundance ratios verysimilar to those observed in the c--rich extremely metal poor stars (cemp). weshow that rotating agb stars and rotating massive stars have about the sameeffects on the cno enhancements. abundances of s-process elements and the$^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio could help us to distinguish between contributions fromagb and massive stars. on the whole, we emphasize the dominant effects ofrotation for the chemical yields of extremely metal poor stars.

astro-ph;0601425	on the origin of the high helium sequence in $\omega$ centauri	the blue main sequence (bms) of $\omega$ cen implies a ratio of helium tometal enrichment $\delta y/\delta z \approx 70$, which is a major enigma.  we show that rotating models of low metallicity stars, which account for theanomalous abundance ratios of extremely metal poor stars, are also useful forunderstanding the very high $\delta y/\delta z$ ratio in $\omega$ cen. modelsof massive stars with moderate initial rotation velocities produce stellarwinds with large he-- and n--excesses, but without the large c-- (and o--)excesses made by very fast rotation, in agreement with the observed chemicalabundance ratios in $\omega$ cen. it is still uncertain whether the abundancepeculiarities of $\omega$ cen result from the fact that the high velocitycontributions of supernovae escaped the globular cluster, usually considered asa tidally stripped core of a dwarf galaxy. another possibility is a generaldominance of wind ejecta at very low $z$, due to the formation of black holes.some abundance and isotopic ratios like $mg/al$, $na/mg$, $ne/n$,$^{12}c/^{13}c$, $^{16}o/^{18}o$ and $^{17}o/^{18}o$ may allow us to furtherdiscriminate between these scenarios and between the agb and massive starcontributions.

astro-ph;0609484	mass loss of rotating stars at very low metallicity	some indirect observations, as the high fraction of be stars at lowmetallicity, or the necessity for massive stars to be important sources ofprimary nitrogen, seem to indicate that very metal poor stars were fastrotators. as a consequence of this fast rotation, these stars, contrarily tocurrent wisdom, might lose large amounts of mass during their lifetime. in thispaper, we review various mechanisms triggered by rotation which may inducestrong mass loss at very low metallicity. the most efficient process comes fromsurface enrichments in cno elements which then drive mass loss by stellarwinds. due to this process, a fast rotating 60 m$_\odot$ with metallicities inthe range of $z=10^{-8}$ and $10^{-5}$, can lose between 30 and 55% of itsinitial mass. this rotationally wind ejected material participates to thechemical evolution of the interstellar medium, enriching it exclusively in h-and he-burning products. in particular, metal poor fast rotating stars may playa key role for explaining the origin of the peculiar abundance pattern observedat the surface of the extremely metal-poor c-rich stars, for explaining thechemical inhomogeneities observed in globular clusters, and the presence ofstars in $\omega$ cen with a very high helium content .

astro-ph;0611261	massive star evolution at high metallicity	after a review of the many effects of metallicity on the evolution ofrotating and non-rotating stars, we discuss the consequences of a highmetallicity on massive star populations and on stellar nucleosynthesis. themost striking effect of high metallicity is to enhance the amount of mass lostby stellar winds. typically at a metallicity $z=0.001$ only 9% of the totalmass returned by non-rotating massive stars is ejected by winds (91% bysupernovae explosion), while at solar metallicity this fraction may amount tomore than 40%. high metallicity favors the formation of wolf-rayet stars and oftype ib supernovae. it however disfavors the occurrence of type ic supernovae.we estimate empirical yields of carbon based on the observed population of wcstars in the solar neighborhood, and obtain that wc stars eject between 0.2 and0.4% of the mass initially locked into stars under the form of new synthesizedcarbon. models give values well in agreement with these empirical yields.chemical evolution models indicate that such carbon yields may have importantimpacts on the abundance of carbon at high metallicity.

astro-ph;0703699	models for massive stellar populations with rotation	we present and discuss evolutionary synthesis models for massive stellarpopulations generated with the starburst99 code in combination with a new setof stellar evolution models accounting for rotation. the new stellar evolutionmodels were compiled from several data releases of the geneva group and coverheavy-element abundances ranging from twice solar to one fifth solar. theevolution models were computed for rotation velocities on the zero-agemain-sequence of 0 and 300 km/s and with the latest revision of stellarmass-loss rates. since the mass coverage is incomplete, in particular atnon-solar chemical composition, our parameter study is still preliminary andmust be viewed as exploratory. stellar population properties computed withstarburst99 and the new evolution models show some marked differences incomparison with models obtained using earlier tracks. since individual starsnow tend to be more luminous and bluer when on the blue side of thehertzsprung-russell diagram, the populations mirror this trend. for instance,increases by factors of two or more are found for the light-to-mass ratios atultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, as well as for the output of hydrogenionizing photons. if these results are confirmed once the evolution models havematured, recalibrations of certain star-formation and initial mass functionindicators will be required.

astro-ph;9611131	rotational mixing in early-type stars: the main-sequence evolution of a  9 mo star	we describe the main-sequence evolution of a rotating 9 $m_\odot$ star. itsinterior rotation profile is determined by the redistribution of angularmomentum through the meridian circulation and through the shear turbulencegenerated by the differential rotation; the possible effect of internal wavesis neglected. we examine the mixing of chemicals produced by the same internalmotions. our modelization is based on the set of equations established by zahn(1992) and completed in matias, talon &amp; zahn (1996). our calculations show thatthe amount of mixing associated with a typical rotation velocity of $\sim 100km/s$ yields stellar models whose global parameters are very similar to thoseobtained with the moderate overshooting ($d/h_p \simeq 0.2$) which has beeninvoked until now to fit the observations. fast rotation ($\sim 300 km/s$)leads to significant changes of the c/n and o/n surface ratios, but theabundance of he is barely increased. the modifications of the internalcomposition profile due to such rotational mixing will certainly affect thepost--main-sequence evolution.

0810.0652	evolution and chemical and dynamical effects of high-mass stars	we review general characteristics of massive stars, present the mainobservable constraints that stellar models should reproduce. we discuss theimpact of massive star nucleosynthesis on the early phases of the chemicalevolution of the milky way (mw). we show that rotating models can account forthe important primary nitrogen production needed at low metallicity.interestingly such rotating models can also better account for other featuresas the variation with the metallicity of the c/o ratio. damped lyman alpha(dla) systems present similar characteristics as the halo of the mw for whatconcern the n/o and c/o ratios. although in dlas, the star formation historymight be quite different from that of the halo, in these systems also, rotatingstars (both massive and intermediate) probably play an important role forexplaining these features. the production of primary nitrogen is accompanied byan overproduction of other elements as $^{13}$c, $^{22}$ne and s-processelements. we show also how the observed variation with the metallicity of thenumber ratio of type ibc to type ii supernovae may be a consequence of themetallicity dependence of the line-driven stellar winds.

0812.2764	the basic role of magnetic field in stellar evolution	magnetic field is playing an important role at all stages of star evolutionfrom star formation to the endpoints. the main effects are briefly reviewed. wealso show that o-type stars have large convective envelopes, where convectivedynamo could work. there, fields in magnetostatic balance have intensities ofthe order of 100 g. a few ob stars with strong polar fields (henrichs et al.2003a) show large n-enhancements indicating a strong internal mixing. wesuggest that the meridional circulation enhanced by an internal rotation lawclose to uniform in these magnetic stars is responsible for the observedmixing. thus, it is not the magnetic field itself which makes the mixing, butthe strong thermal instability associated to solid body rotation. a criticalquestion for evolution is whether a dynamo is at work in radiative zones ofrotating stars. the tayler-spruit (ts) dynamo is the best candidate. we derivesome basic relations for dynamos in radiative layers. evolutionary models withts dynamo show important effects: internal rotation coupling and enhancedmixing, all model outputs being affected.
