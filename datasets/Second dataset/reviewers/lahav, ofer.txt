0908.2033	galaxy zoo: reproducing galaxy morphologies via machine learning	we present morphological classifications obtained using machine learning forobjects in sdss dr6 that have been classified by galaxy zoo into three classes,namely early types, spirals and point sources/artifacts. an artificial neuralnetwork is trained on a subset of objects classified by the human eye and wetest whether the machine learning algorithm can reproduce the humanclassifications for the rest of the sample. we find that the success of theneural network in matching the human classifications depends crucially on theset of input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. the coloursand parameters associated with profile-fitting are reasonable in separating theobjects into three classes. however, these results are considerably improvedwhen adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. theadaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguishbetween early type galaxies and the point sources/artifacts. using a set oftwelve parameters, the neural network is able to reproduce the humanclassifications to better than 90% for all three morphological classes. we findthat using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade ourresults given our particular choice of the input parameters to the network. weconclude that it is promising to use machine- learning algorithms to performmorphological classification for the next generation of wide-field imagingsurveys and that the galaxy zoo catalogue provides an invaluable training setfor such purposes.

0910.4714	forecasting neutrino masses from galaxy clustering in the dark energy  survey combined with the planck measurements	we study the prospects for detecting neutrino masses from the galaxy angularpower spectrum in photometric redshift shells of the dark energy survey (des)over a volume of 20 (gpc/h)^3 combined with the cosmic microwave background(cmb) angular fluctuations expected to be measured from the planck satellite.we find that for a lambda-cdm concordance model with 7 free parameters inaddition to a fiducial neutrino mass of m_nu = 0.24 ev, we recover from des&amp;planck the correct value with uncertainty of +- 0.12 ev (95 % cl), assumingperfect knowledge of the galaxy biasing. if the fiducial total mass is close tozero, then the upper limit is 0.11 ev (95 % cl). this upper limit from des&amp;planck is over 3 times tighter than using planck alone, as des breaks theparameter degeneracies in a cmb-only analysis. the analysis utlilizes sphericalharmonics up to 300, averaged in bin of 10 to mimic the des sky coverage. theresults are similar if we supplement des bands (grizy) with the vistahemisphere survey (vhs) near infrared band (jhk). the result is robust touncertainties in non-linear fluctuations and redshift distortions. however, theresult is sensitive to the assumed galaxy biasing schemes and it requiresaccurate prior knowledge of the biasing. to summarize, if the total neutrinomass in nature greater than 0.1ev, we should be able to detect it with des&amp;planck, a result with great importance to fundamental physics.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

0910.5372	exploring the luminosity evolution and stellar mass assembly of 2slaq  luminous red galaxies between redshift 0.4 and 0.8	we present an analysis of the evolution of 8625 luminous red galaxies betweenz = 0.4 and z = 0.8 in the 2df and sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. the lrgsare split into redshift bins and the evolution of both the luminosity andstellar mass function with redshift is considered and compared to theassumptions of a passive evolution scenario. we draw attention to severalsources of systematic error that could bias the evolutionary predictions madein this paper. while the inferred evolution is found to be relativelyunaffected by the exact choice of spectral evolution model used to compute k+ecorrections, we conclude that photometric errors could be a source ofsignificant bias in colour-selected samples such as this, in particular whenusing parametric maximum likelihood based estimators. we find that theevolution of the most massive lrgs is consistent with the assumptions ofpassive evolution and that the stellar mass assembly of the lrgs is largelycomplete by z ~ 0.8. our findings suggest that massive galaxies with stellarmasses above 10^11 solar masses must have undergone merging and star formationprocesses at a very early stage (z &gt; 1). this supports the emerging picture ofdownsizing in both the star formation as well as the mass assembly of earlytype galaxies. given that our spectroscopic sample covers an unprecedentedlylarge volume and probes the most massive end of the galaxy mass function, wefind that these observational results present a significant challenge for manycurrent models of galaxy formation

1002.0835	the role of environment on the formation of early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a detailed study of the stellar populations of avolume-limited sample of early-type galaxies from sdss, across a range ofenvironments -- defined as the mass of the host dark matter halo. the stellarpopulations are explored through the sdss spectra, via projection onto a set oftwo spectral vectors determined from principal component analysis. we find thevelocity dispersion of the galaxy to be the main driver behind the differentstar formation histories of early-type galaxies. however, environmental effectsare seen to play a role (although minor). galaxies populating the lowest masshalos have stellar populations on average ~1gyr younger than the rest of thesample. the fraction of galaxies with small amounts of recent star formation isalso seen to be truncated when occupying halos more massive than 3e13msun. thesample is split into satellite and central galaxies for a further analysis ofenvironment. satellites are younger than central galaxies of the same stellarmass. the younger satellite galaxies in 6e12msun halos have stellar populationsconsistent with the central galaxies found in the lowest mass halos of oursample (i.e. 1e12msun). this result is indicative of galaxies in lower masshalos being accreted into larger halos.

1006.2825	neutrino masses from clustering of red and blue galaxies: a test of  astrophysical uncertainties	combining measurements of the galaxy power spectrum and the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) is a powerful means of constraining the summed mass ofneutrino species sum(m_nu), but is subject to systematic uncertainties due tonon-linear structure formation, redshift-space distortions and galaxy bias. weempirically test the robustness of neutrino mass results to these effects byseparately analyzing power spectra of red and blue galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss-ii) data release 7 (dr7), combined with the cmbfive-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap5) data. we considerfitting for a range of maximum wavenumber k using twelve different galaxy biasmodels. for example, using a new model based on perturbation theory andincluding redshift space distortions (saito et al. 2009), the all-galaxy powerspectrum combined with wmap5 for a wavenumber range of k&lt;0.2 mpc/h yields 95%cl sum(m_nu)&lt;0.46 ev. the red and blue galaxy power spectra give 0.41 and 0.63ev respectively for this model. using mock catalogues, we find the expecteddifference in these limits assuming a true neutrino mass of zero is 0.10 + or -0.14 ev. thus the difference of 0.22 ev between upper limits on neutrino massfor red and blue galaxies is approximately 1 sigma from the expected value. wefind similar results for the other models and k ranges tested. this indicatesgood agreement for current data but hints at possible issues fornext-generation surveys. being able to perform such systematic tests isadvantageous, and future surveys would benefit by including broad galaxypopulations and luminosities that enable such a decomposition.

0709.0300	decoding the spectra of sdss early-type galaxies: new indicators of age  and recent star formation	(abridged) we apply principal component analysis (pca) to a sample ofearly-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) in order to inferdifferences in their star formation histories. out of the first few principalcomponents (pc), we study four which give information about stellar populationsand velocity dispersion. we construct two parameters (eta and zeta) as linearcombinations of pc1 and pc2. we find zeta to be most sensitive to recentepisodes of star formation, and eta to be strongly dependent on the average ageof the stellar populations. the distribution of the eta component of thecomposites appear to be indistinguishable between high and low density regions,whereas the distribution of zeta parameters have a significant skew towardslower values for galaxies in low density regions. this result suggests thatgalaxies in lower density environments are less likely to present weak episodesof recent star formation. in contrast, a significant number of galaxies fromour high density subsample -- which includes clusters (both outer regions andcentres) and groups -- underwent small but detectable recent star formation athigh metallicity, in agreement with recent estimates targeting ellipticalgalaxies in hickson compact groups and in the field (ferreras et al.).

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1203.2616	on combining galaxy clustering and weak lensing to unveil galaxy biasing  via the halo model	we formulate the concept of non-linear and stochastic galaxy biasing in theframework of halo occupation statistics. using two-point statistics inprojection, we define the galaxy bias function, b_g(r_p), and the galaxy-darkmatter cross-correlation function, r_{gm}(r_p), where r_p is the projecteddistance. we use the analytical halo model to predict how the scale dependenceof b_g and r_{gm}, over the range 0.1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 30 mpc/h, depends on thenon-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models. in particular wequantify the effect due to the presence of central galaxies, the assumption forthe radial distribution of satellite galaxies, the richness of the halo, andthe poisson character of the probability to have a certain number of satellitegalaxies in a halo of a certain mass. overall, brighter galaxies reveal astronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. in real-space, we findthat galaxy bias becomes scale independent, with r_{gm} = 1, for radii r &gt; 1 -5 mpc/h, depending on luminosity. however, galaxy bias is scale-dependent outto much larger radii when one uses the projected quantities defined in thispaper. these projected bias functions have the advantage that they are moreeasily accessible observationally and that their scale dependence carries awealth of information regarding the properties of galaxy biasing. toobservationally constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics andto unveil the origin of galaxy biasing we propose the use of the bias functiongamma_{gm}(r_p)=b_g(r_p)/r_{gm}(r_p). this function is obtained via acombination of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, and it can bemeasured using existing and forthcoming imaging and spectroscopic galaxysurveys.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

0711.1059	photometric redshifts for the dark energy survey and vista and  implications for large scale structure	we conduct a detailed analysis of the photometric redshift requirements forthe proposed dark energy survey (des) using two sets of mock galaxy simulationsand an artificial neural network code - annz. in particular, we examine howoptical photometry in the des grizy bands can be complemented with nearinfra-red photometry from the planned vista hemisphere survey (vhs) in thejhk_s bands. we find that the rms scatter on the photometric redshift estimateover 1&lt;z&lt;2 is sigma_z=0.2 from des alone and sigma_z=0.15 from des+vista, i.e.an improvement of more than 30%. we draw attention to the effects of galaxyformation scenarios such as reddening on the photo-z estimate and using ourneural network code, calculate the extinction, a_v for these reddened galaxies.we also look at the impact of using different training sets when calculatingphotometric redshifts. in particular, we find that using the ongoing deep2 andvvds-deep spectroscopic surveys to calibrate photometric redshifts for des,will prove effective. however we need to be aware of uncertainties in thephotometric redshift bias that arise when using different training sets asthese will translate into errors in the dark energy equation of stateparameter, w. furthermore, we show that the neural network error estimate onthe photometric redshift may be used to remove outliers from our samples beforeany kind of cosmological analysis, in particular for large-scale structureexperiments. by removing all galaxies with a neural network photo-z errorestimate of greater than 0.1 from our des+vhs sample, we can constrain thegalaxy power spectrum out to a redshift of 2 and reduce the fractional error onthis power spectrum by ~15-20% compared to using the entire catalogue.

1206.5320	the impact of camera optical alignments on weak lensing measures for the  dark energy survey	telescope point spread function (psf) quality is critical for realising thepotential of cosmic weak lensing observations to constrain dark energy and testgeneral relativity. in this paper we use quantitative weak gravitationallensing measures to inform the precision of lens optical alignment, withspecific reference to the dark energy survey (des). we compute optics spotdiagrams and calculate the shear and flexion of the psf as a function ofposition on the focal plane. for perfect optical alignment we verify the highquality of the des optical design, finding a maximum psf contribution to theweak lensing shear of 0.04 near the edge of the focal plane. however this canbe increased by a factor of approximately three if the lenses are only justaligned within their maximum specified tolerances. we calculate the e andb-mode shear and flexion variance as a function of de-centre or tilt of eachlens in turn. we find tilt accuracy to be a few times more important thande-centre, depending on the lens considered. finally we consider the compoundeffect of de-centre and tilt of multiple lenses simultaneously, by samplingfrom a plausible range of values of each parameter. we find that the compoundeffect can be around twice as detrimental as when considering any one lensalone. furthermore, this combined effect changes the conclusions about whichlens is most important to align accurately. for des, the tilt of the first twolenses is the most important.

1207.4043	a search for correlation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays with iras-pscz  and 2mass-6df galaxies	we study the arrival directions of 69 ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs)observed at the pierre auger observatory (pao) with energies exceeding 55 eev.we investigate whether the uhecrs exhibit the anisotropy signal expected if theprimary particles are protons that originate in galaxies in the local universe,or in sources correlated with these galaxies. we cross-correlate the uhecrarrival directions with the positions of iras-pscz and 2mass-6df galaxiestaking into account particle energy losses during propagation. this is thefirst time that the 6df survey is used in a search for the sources of uhecrsand the first time that the pscz survey is used with the full 69 pao events.the observed cross-correlation signal is larger for the pao uhecrs than for 94%(98%) of realisations from an isotropic distribution when cross-correlated withthe pscz (6df). on the other hand the observed cross-correlation signal islower than that expected from 85% of realisations, had the uhecrs originated ingalaxies in either survey. the observed cross-correlation signal does exceedthat expected by 50% of the realisations if the uhecrs are randomly deflectedby intervening magnetic fields by 5 degrees or more. we propose a new method ofanalysing the expected anisotropy signal, by dividing the predicted uhecrsource distribution into equal predicted flux radial shells, which can helplocalise and constrain the properties of uhecr sources. we find that the 69 paoevents are consistent with isotropy in the nearest of three shells we define,whereas there is weak evidence for correlation with the predicted sourcedistribution in the two more distant shells in which the galaxy distribution isless anisotropic.

1306.5240	galaxy halo truncation and giant arc surface brightness reconstruction  in the cluster macsj1206.2-0847	in this work we analyze the mass distribution of macsj1206.2-0847, especiallyfocusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. the cluster appearsrelaxed in its x-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intraclusterlight which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scaleinteractions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. the clusterlenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$into a giant arc and its counterimage. the multiple image positions and thesurface brightness distribution (sfb) of the arc which is bent around severalcluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. we modelthe cluster mass distribution with a nfw profile and the galaxy halos with twoparameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assumingscalings with their observed nir--light. we match the multiple image positionsat an r.m.s. level of $0.85\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the sfb distribution ofthe arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this clustermodel. the length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrainedis about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamicaland field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weaklensing results on the other hand. the velocity dispersion and halo size of agalaxy with $m_{\rm 160w,ab}=19.2$ or $m_{\rm b,vega}=-20.7$ are $\sigma=150\rm kms^{-1}$ and $r\approx 26\pm 6 \rm kpc$, indicating that the halos of thecluster galaxies are tidally stripped. we also reconstruct the unlensed source(which is smaller by a factor of $\sim5.8$ in area), demonstrating the increaseof morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy haslikely star--forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.

1307.8062	optimising spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys: same-sky  benefits for dark energy and modified gravity	the combination of multiple cosmological probes can produce measurements ofcosmological parameters much more stringent than those possible with anyindividual probe. we examine the combination of two highly correlated probes oflate-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey withphotometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortionsfrom a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. we choose generic survey designs sothat our results are applicable to a range of current and future photometricredshift (e.g. kids, des, hsc, euclid) and spectroscopic redshift (e.g. desi,4most, sumire) surveys. combining the surveys greatly improves their power tomeasure both dark energy and modified gravity. an independent, non-overlappingcombination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than 4 times larger thanthat produced by either survey alone. the powerful synergies between thesurveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints areorthogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly 2 ordersof magnitude larger than either alone. our projected angular power spectrumformalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when thesurveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariancematrix. we calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of thesecross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. we find nearly afactor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity.the exact forecast figures of merit and same-sky benefits can be radicallyaffected by a range of forecasts assumption, which we explore methodically in asensitivity analysis. we show that that our fiducial assumptions produce robustresults which give a good average picture of the science return from combiningphotometric and spectroscopic surveys.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1312.0943	three gravitationally lensed supernovae behind clash galaxy clusters	we report observations of three gravitationally lensed supernovae (sne) inthe cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) multi-cycletreasury program. these objects, sn clo12car (z = 1.28), sn cln12did (z =0.85), and sn cla11tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters,macsj1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), rxj1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and abell 383 (z =0.187), respectively. each sn was detected in hubble space telescope (hst)optical and infrared images. based on photometric classification, we find thatsne clo12car and cln12did are likely to be type ia supernovae (sne ia), whilethe classification of sn cla11tib is inconclusive. using multi-colorlight-curve fits to determine a standardized sn ia luminosity distance, weinfer that sn clo12car was approximately 1.0 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than fieldsne ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lensmagnification. similarly, sn cln12did is approximately 0.2 +/- 0.2 mag brighterthan field sne ia. we derive independent estimates of the predictedmagnification from clash strong+weak lensing maps of the clusters: 0.83 +/-0.16 mag for sn clo12car, 0.28 +/- 0.08 mag for sn cln12did, and 0.43 +/- 0.11mag for sn cla11tib. the two sne ia provide a new test of the cluster lensmodel predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the sn iabrightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. our resultsherald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed sne ia(from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution inclusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolutemagnifications.

1312.2101	pkann - ii. a non-linear matter power spectrum interpolator developed  using artificial neural networks	in this paper we introduce pkann, a freely available software package forinterpolating the non-linear matter power spectrum, constructed usingartificial neural networks (anns). previously, using halofit to calculatematter power spectrum, we demonstrated that anns can make extremely quick andaccurate predictions of the power spectrum. now, using a suite of 6380 n-bodysimulations spanning 580 cosmologies, we train anns to predict the powerspectrum over the cosmological parameter space spanning $3\sigma$ confidencelevel (cl) around the concordance cosmology. when presented with a set ofcosmological parameters ($\omega_{\rm m} h^2, \omega_{\rm b} h^2, n_s, w,\sigma_8, \sum m_\nu$ and redshift $z$), the trained ann interpolates the powerspectrum for $z\leq2$ at sub-per cent accuracy for modes up to$k\leq0.9\,h\textrm{mpc}^{-1}$. pkann is faster than computationally expensiven-body simulations, yet provides a worst-case error $&lt;1$ per cent fit to thenon-linear matter power spectrum deduced through n-body simulations. theoverall precision of pkann is set by the accuracy of our n-body simulations, at5 per cent level for cosmological models with $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.5$ ev for allredshifts $z\leq2$. for models with $\sum m_\nu&gt;0.5$ ev, predictions areexpected to be at 5 (10) per cent level for redshifts $z&gt;1$ ($z\leq1$). thepkann interpolator may be freely downloaded fromhttp://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/~fba/pkann

0805.3160	the three faces of omega_m: testing gravity with low and high redshift  sn ia surveys	peculiar velocities of galaxies hosting type ia supernovae generate asignificant systematic effect in deriving the dark energy equation of state w,at level of a few percent. here we illustrate how the peculiar velocity effectin sn ia data can be turned from a 'systematic' into a probe of cosmologicalparameters. we assume a flat lambda-cold dark matter model (w=-1) and use lowand high redshift sn ia data to derive simultaneously three distinct estimatesof the matter density omega_m which appear in the problem: from the geometry,from the dynamics and from the shape of the matter power spectrum. we find thateach of the three omega_m's agree with the canonical value omega_m=0.25 towithin 1 sigma, for reasonably assumed fluctuation amplitude and hubbleparameter. this is consistent with the standard cosmological scenario for boththe geometry and the growth of structure. for fixed omega_m = 0.25 for allthree omega_m's, we constrain gamma = 0.72 +/- 0.21 in the growth factoromega_m(z)^gamma, so we cannot currently distinguish between standard einsteingravity and predictions from some modified gravity models. future surveys ofthousands of sn ia, or inclusion of peculiar velocity data, could significantlyimprove the above tests.

astro-ph;0109167	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: a targeted study of catalogued clusters  of galaxies	we have carried out a study of known clusters within the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) observed areas and have identified 431 abell, 173 apm and 343edcc clusters. precise redshifts, velocity dispersions and new centroids havebeen measured for the majority of these objects, and this information has beenused to study the completeness of these catalogues, the level of contaminationfrom foreground and background structures along the cluster's line of sight,the space density of the clusters as a function of redshift, and their velocitydispersion distributions. we find that the abell and edcc catalogues arecontaminated at the level of about 10%, whereas the apm catalogue suffers only5% contamination. if we use the original catalog centroids, the level ofcontamination rises to approximately 15% for the abell and edcc catalogues,showing that the presence of foreground and background groups may alter therichness of clusters in these catalogues. there is a deficiency of clusters at$z \sim 0.05$ that may correspond to a large underdensity in the southernhemisphere. from the cumulative distribution of velocity dispersions for theseclusters, we derive an upper limit to the space density of $\sigma &gt; 1000 \kms$clusters of $3.6 \times 10^{-6} \hdens$. this result is used to constrainmodels for structure formation; our data favour low-density cosmologies,subject to the usual assumptions concerning the shape and normalization of thepower spectrum.

astro-ph;0112162	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the amplitudes of fluctuations in the  2dfgrs and the cmb, and implications for galaxy biasing	we compare the amplitudes of fluctuations probed by the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey and by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies. by combining the 2dfgrs and cmb data we find the linear-theoryrms mass fluctuations in 8 mpc/h spheres to be sigma_8 = 0.73 +-0.05 (aftermarginalization over the matter density parameter omega_m and three other freeparameters). this normalization is lower than the cobe normalization andprevious estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with somerevised cluster abundance determinations. we also estimate thescale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch l_s = 1.9l_* apm-selectedgalaxies to be b(l_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.15h/mpc. if luminosity segregation operates on these scales, l_* galaxies wouldbe almost un-biased, b(l_*,z=0) = 0.96. these results are derived by assuming aflat lambda-cdm universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters andfixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.we also study the best fit pair (omega_m,b), and the robustness of the resultsto varying n and tau. various modelling corrections can each change theresulting b by 5-15 per cent. the results are compared with other independentmeasurements from the 2dfgrs itself, and from the sdss, cluster abundance andcosmic shear.

astro-ph;0202357	`hyper parameters' approach to joint estimation: applications to  cepheid-calibrated distances and x-ray clusters	we use a generalised procedure for the combined likelihood analysis ofdifferent cosmological probes, the `hyper-parameters' method, that allowsfreedom in the relative weights of the raw measurements. we perform a jointanalysis of the cepheid-calibrated data from the hubble space telescope keyproject and the baryon mass fraction in clusters to constrain the total matterdensity of the universe, omega_m, and the hubble parameter, h. we compare theresults obtained using hyper-parameters method with the estimates from standardchi^2 analysis. we assume that the universe is spatially flat, with acosmological constant. we adopt the big-bang nucleosynthesis constraint for thebaryon density, assuming the uncertainty is gaussian distributed. using thisand the cluster baryon fraction data, we find that the matter density and thehubble constant are correlated, omega_m h^0.5~0.25, with preference for a veryhigh h. to break the degeneracy, we add in the cepheid-calibrated data and findthe best fit values (omega_m, h) = (0.26 (+0.06,-0.06),0.72 (+0.04,-0.02)) (68per cent confindence limits) using the hyper-parameters approach. we use thederived hyper-parameters to `grade' the 6 different data sets we analyse.although our analysis is free of assumptions about the power spectrum offluctuations, our results are in agreement with the lambda-cold dark matter`concordance' parameters derived from the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies combined with supernovae ia, redshift surveys and other probes.

astro-ph;0203307	spectroscopic detection of quasars in the 2df galaxy redshift survey	the 100,000 spectra from the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs)in the 100k public data release represent the largest single compilation ofgalaxy spectra available. by virtue of its sheer size and the properties of thephotometric catalogue that defines the sample, the 2dfgrs is expected tocontain a number of potentially interesting objects other than galaxies. asearch of the spectra in the 100k data release results in a census of 55candidate high-redshift (z &gt; 0.3) quasars. one additional 2dfgrs spectrum of alow-redshift galaxy shows an apparent anomalous broad emission feature perhapsindicating the presence of a gravitationally lensed quasar. these objects havebeen identified primarily using two automated routines that we have developedspecifically for this task, one of which uses a matched filter and the other awavelet transform. a number of the quasar images possess complicatedmorphologies, suggesting the presence of either diffuse foreground objectsalong the line-of-sight or very nearby point sources. the quasar catalogue willform a target list for future absorption and lensing studies, as well asproviding an assessment of the loss of quasars with non-stellar images from thecompanion 2df qso redshift survey.

astro-ph;0203336	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the environmental dependence of galaxy  star formation rates near clusters	we have measured the equivalent width of the h-alpha emission line for 11006galaxies brighter than m_b=-19 (lcdm) at 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 in the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2df), in the fields of seventeen known galaxy clusters. the limitedredshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, andto residuals from night sky emission lines. we use these measurements to tracemustar, the star formation rate normalized to lstar, as a function of distancefrom the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. we find that thedistribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasingdistance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution atdistances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. a correlation between starformation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independentof cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1galaxy (brighter than m_b=-19) per mpc^2. this characteristic scale correspondsapproximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. the samecorrelation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the clustercentre. we conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are notrestricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the densityexceeds this critical value. the present day abundance of such systems, and thestrong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth ofstructure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average starformation rate. finally, the low star formation rates well beyond thevirialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressurestripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations ingalaxy properties with environment.

astro-ph;0206256	parameter constraints for flat cosmologies from cmb and 2dfgrs power  spectra	we constrain flat cosmological models with a joint likelihood analysis of anew compilation of data from the cosmic microwave background (cmb) and from the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). fitting the cmb alone yields a knowndegeneracy between the hubble constant h and the matter density omega_m, whicharises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular powerspectrum. this `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail andshown to follow a simple relation omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. adding the 2dfgrspower spectrum constrains omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. if tensoranisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the hubbleconstant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and thephysical cdm and baryon densities omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.002 (standard rms errors). including a possible tensor componentcauses very little change to these figures; we set a upper limit to thetensor-to-scalar ratio of r&lt;0.7 at 95% confidence. we then show how these datacan be used to constrain the equation of state of the vacuum, and find w&lt;-0.52at 95% confidence. the preferred cosmological model is thus very wellspecified, and we discuss the precision with which future cmb data can bepredicted, given the model assumptions. the 2dfgrs power-spectrum data andcovariance matrix, and the cmb data compilation used here, are available fromhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/

astro-ph;0210471	galaxy spectral parameterisation in the 2df galaxy redshift survey as a  diagnostic of star formation history	we investigate the physical significance of a new spectral parameter, eta.this parameter was defined using a principal component analysis of the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey, to retain astrophysical information while minimisingthe effect of measurement uncertainties. we find that while eta is correlatedwith morphological type, there is a large scatter in this relationship. atighter empirical relationship is found between eta and the equivalent width ofthe halpha line, suggesting a connection with the relative star formation rate.we pursue this connection using spectral synthesis models. using models inwhich the star formation history is parameterised in terms of an exponentiallydecreasing function of time, we find that there is a tight correlation betweeneta and the ratio of the present to the past-averaged rate of star-formation,often known as the ``birthrate'' parameter b. this correlation also holds inmodels with much more complicated star formation histories, generated by asemi- analytic model of galaxy formation based upon the hierarchical formationscenario. there are two possible causes for the tight correlations we findbetween eta and b in those galaxies with the most complex star formationhistories; firstly, the spectra themselves may be degenerate to the actuallong-term star formation history of each galaxy in the optical wavelength rangeprobed by the 2dfgrs. secondly, the birthrate parameter b may represent aphysically fundamental quality of galaxy halos -- their over-density relativeto the background density. we conclude that the tight connection with b makeseta a physically meaningful, as well as convenient and robust, statistic forgalaxy parameterisation and classification.

astro-ph;0303089	upper limits on neutrino masses from the 2dfgrs and wmap: the role of  priors	solar, atmospheric, and reactor neutrino experiments have confirmed neutrinooscillations, implying that neutrinos have non-zero mass, but without pinningdown their absolute masses. while it is established that the effect ofneutrinos on the evolution of cosmic structure is small, the upper limitsderived from large-scale structure data could help significantly to constrainthe absolute scale of the neutrino masses. in a recent paper the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) team provided an upper limit m_nu,tot &lt; 2.2 ev, i.e.approximately 0.7 ev for each of the three neutrino flavours, or phrased interms of their contributioin to the matter density, omega_nu/omega_m &lt; 0.16.here we discuss this analysis in greater detail, considering issues of assumed'priors' like the matter density omega_m and the bias of the galaxydistribution with respect the dark matter distribution. as the suppression ofthe power spectrum depends on the ratio omega_nu/omega_m, we find that theout-of- fashion mixed dark matter model, with omega_nu=0.2, omega_m=1 and nocosmological constant, fits the 2dfgrs power spectrum and the cmb datareasonably well, but only for a hubble constant h_0&lt;50 km/s/mpc. as aconsequence, excluding low values of the hubble constant, e.g. with the hst keyproject is important in order to get a strong constraint on the neutrinomasses. we also comment on the improved limit by the wmap team, and point outthat the main neutrino signature comes from the 2dfgrs and the lyman alphaforest.

astro-ph;0311379	galaxy ecology: groups and low-density environments in the sdss and  2dfgrs	we analyse the observed correlation between galaxy environment and h-alphaemission line strength, using volume-limited samples and group catalogues of24968 galaxies drawn from the 2df galaxy redshift survey (mb&lt;-19.5) and thesloan digital sky survey (mr&lt;-20.6). we characterise the environment by 1)sigma_5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projecteddistance to the 5th nearest neighbour; and 2) rho1.1 and rho5.5,three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxydistribution with gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 mpc and 5.5 mpc,respectively. we find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form twodistinct populations, as characterised by their h-alpha equivalent width,ew(ha). the relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies variesstrongly and continuously with local density. however, the distribution ofew(ha) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. thefraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density onlarge scales, rho5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with localdensity, rho1.1. we use two differently-selected group catalogues todemonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximatelyindependent of group velocity dispersion, for sigma=200-1000 km/s. even in thelowest density environments, no more than ~70 per cent of galaxies showsignificant h-alpha emission. based on these results, we conclude that thepresent-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a resultof short-timescale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift,such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.

(2002). the two-point correlation functionfor the local radio population is found to be entirely consistent withestimates obtained for the whole sample of 2dfgrs galaxies. we estimate theparameters of the real-space correlation function xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma},r_0=6.7^{+0.9}_{-1.1} mpc and \gamma=1.6\pm 0.1, where h=0.7 is assumed.different results are instead obtained if we only consider sources that presentsignatures of agn activity in their spectra. these objects are shown to be verystrongly correlated, with r_0=10.9^{+1.0}_{-1.2} mpc and \gamma=2\pm 0.1, asteeper slope than has been claimed in other recent works. no difference isfound in the clustering properties of radio-agns of different radio luminosity.these results show that agn-fuelled sources reside in dark matter halos moremassive than \sim 10^{13.4} m_{\sun}},higher the corresponding figure forradio-quiet qsos. this value can be converted into a minimum black hole massassociated with radio-loud, agn-fuelled objects of m_{bh}^{min}\sim 10^9m_{\sun}. the above results then suggest -at least for relatively faint radioobjects -the existence of a threshold black hole mass associated with the onsetof significant radio activity such as that of radio-loud agns; however, oncethe activity is triggered, there appears to be no evidence for a connectionbetween black hole mass and level of radio output.

astro-ph;0404275	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: stochastic relative biasing between  galaxy populations	it is well known that the clustering of galaxies depends on galaxy type.suchrelative bias complicates the inference of cosmological parameters from galaxyredshift surveys, and is a challenge to theories of galaxy formation andevolution. in this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis ongalaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey, classified by both colour andspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. we fit three differentmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cellcounts, assuming poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. we investigatethe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells ofside 10mpc \leq l \leq 45mpc (h=0.7). exact linear bias is ruled out with highsignificance on all scales. power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihoodratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxyformation other than those from the local density field. using this model, wemeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_ln) of 0.958 forcells of length l=10mpc, increasing to 0.970 by l=45mpc. this corresponds to astochasticity sigma_b/bhat of 0.44\pm0.02 and 0.27\pm0.05 respectively. forsmaller cells, the poisson sampled lognormal distribution presents anincreasingly poor fit to the data, especially with regard to the fraction ofcompletely empty cells. we compare these trends with the predictions ofsemianalytic galaxy formation models: these match the data well in terms ofoverall level of stochasticity, variation with scale, and fraction of emptycells.

astro-ph;0405021	substructure analysis of selected low richness 2dfgrs clusters of  galaxies	complementary one-, two-, and three-dimensional tests for detecting thepresence of substructure in clusters of galaxies are applied to recentlyobtained data from the 2df galaxy redshift survey. the sample of 25 clustersused in this study includes 16 clusters not previously investigated forsubstructure. substructure is detected at or greater than the 99% cl level inat least one test for 21 of the 25 clusters studied here. from the results, itappears that low richness clusters commonly contain subclusters participatingin mergers. about half of the clusters have two or more components within 0.5h^{-1} mpc of the cluster centroid, and at least three clusters (abell 1139,abell 1663, and abell s333) exhibit velocity-position characteristicsconsistent with the presence of possible cluster rotation, shear, or infalldynamics. the geometry of certain features is consistent with influence by thehost supercluster environments. in general, our results support the hypothesisthat low richness clusters relax to structureless equilibrium states on verylong dynamical time scales (if at all).

astro-ph;0408536	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the local e+a galaxy population	we select a sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) e+a galaxies from the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the spectra of these objects are defined by stronghydrogen balmer absorption lines (h-delta, h-gamma, h-beta) combined with alack of [oii] 3727a emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst ofstar formation. the e+a spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the processof evolution. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity function of the e+a galaxies. we find that the environments areconsistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies: low-redshift e+a systems arelocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poorgroups. however, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using threebalmer absorption lines h-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (e/s0)systems. in a small but significant number we find evidence for recent majormergers, such as tidal tails. we infer that major mergers are one importantformation mechanism for e+a galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. at lowredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thusthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usualmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. regarding the selection of e+agalaxies: we find that basing the balmer-line criterion solely on h-deltaabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems withdetectable h-alpha emission. in these objects the [oii] emission is presumablyeither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the(h-gamma, h-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

astro-ph;0610005	reconstructed density and velocity fields from the 2mass redshift survey	we present the reconstructed real-space density and the predicted velocityfields from the two mass redshift survey (2mrs). the 2mrs is the densestall-sky redshift survey to date and includes about 23,200 galaxies withextinction corrected magnitudes brighter than k = 11.25. our method is based onthe expansion of these fields in fourier-bessel functions. within thisframework, the linear redshift distortions only affect the density field in theradial direction and can easily be deconvolved using a distortion matrix.moreover, in this coordinate system, the velocity field is related to thedensity field by a simple linear transformation. the shot noise errors in thereconstructions are suppressed by means of a wiener filter which yields aminimum variance estimate of the density and velocity fields. using thereconstructed real-space density fields, we identify all major superclustersand voids. at 50 mpc/h, our reconstructed velocity field indicates a back-sideinfall to the great attractor region of vi = (491 +/- 200)(beta/0.5) km/sec inthe local group frame and v = (64 +/- 205)(beta/0.5) km/sec in the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) frame and beta is the redshift distortion parameter.the direction of the reconstructed dipole agrees well with the dipole derivedby erdogdu et al. (2006). the misalignment between the reconstructed 2mrs andthe cmb dipoles drops to 13 degrees at around 5000 km/sec but then increases atlarger distances. a version of this paper with high resolution figures can beobtained from http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppzzpe

astro-ph;0610911	cross-correlation of 2mass and wmap3: implications for the integrated  sachs-wolfe effect	we perform a cross-correlation of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) usingthe third year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) data with the 2micron all sky survey (2mass) galaxy map (about 828 000 galaxies with medianredshift z ~ 0.07). one motivation is to detect the integrated sachs-wolfe(isw) effect, expected if the cosmic gravitational potential is time dependent;for example, as it is in a flat universe with a dark energy component. themeasured spherical harmonic cross-correlation signal favours the isw signalexpected in the concordance lambdacdm model over that of zero correlation,although both are consistent with the data within 2sigma. within a flatlambdacdm model we find a best fit value of omega_lambda=0.85 and omega_lambda&lt; 0.89 (95% cl). the above limits assume a galaxy bias b_g(sigma_8/0.75) ~ 1.40+/- 0.03, which we derived directly from the 2mass auto-correlation. anothergoal is to test if previously reported anomalies in the wmap data are relatedto the galaxy distribution (the so-called ``axis of evil'' - aoe). no suchanomaly is observed in the 2mass data nor are there any observed aoecorrelations between the 2mass and wmap3 data.

astro-ph;9406009	wiener reconstruction of density, velocity, and potential fields from  all-sky galaxy redshift surveys	we present a new method for recovering the cosmological density, velocity,and potential fields from all-sky redshift catalogues. the method is based onan expansion of the fields in orthogonal radial (bessel) and angular (sphericalharmonic) functions. in this coordinate system, peculiar velocities introduce acoupling of the radial harmonics describing the density field in redshift spacebut leave the angular modes unaffected. in the harmonic transform space, thisradial coupling is described by a distortion matrix which can be computedanalytically within the context of linear theory; the redshift space harmonicscan then be converted to their real space values by inversion of this matrix.statistical noise is mitigated by regularizing the matrix inversion with awiener filter. the method yields a minimum variance estimate of the densityfield in real space. in this coordinate system, the minimum variance harmonicsof the peculiar velocity and potential fields are related to those of thedensity field by simple linear transformations. tests of the method withsimulations of a cdm universe and comparison with previously proposed methodsdemonstrate it to be a very promising new reconstruction method for the localdensity and velocity field. a first application to the 1.2 jy iras redshiftsurvey is presented.

astro-ph;9406010	introduction: why and how to probe the zone of avoidance ?	the motivation and major ways for probing the zone of avoidance (zoa) arereviewed. galaxies hidden behind the zoa may have important implications forthe internal dynamics of the local group, for the origin of its motion relativeto the microwave background, and for the connectivity of the large scalestructure. current direct (`observational') methods for exploring the zoainclude eye-balling of plates, source identification in the iras data base andpointed and blind-search observations in 21 cm. interesting regions identifiedso far include the two crossing points of the supergalactic plane by thegalactic plane (at galactic longitude $l \sim 135^o$, near perseus-pisces, and$l \sim 315^o$, near the great attractor), the puppis cluster (at $l \sim240^o, cz \sim 1500$ km/sec) and the ophiuchus cluster (at $l \sim 0^o, cz \sim8400$ km/sec). new promising wavelengths are the $2 \mu$ and the x-ray band.indirect (`theoretical') approaches include `wiener reconstruction' fromincomplete and noisy data, and using the peculiar velocity field as a probe ofthe mass distribution hidden behind the zoa. the problem of source confusion atlow galactic latitude can be addressed by novel statistical methods, e.g.artificial neural networks.

astro-ph;9406011	wiener reconstruction of all-sky spherical harmonic maps of the large  scale structure	a statistical method for reconstructing large scale structure behind the zoneof avoidance is presented. it also corrects for shot-noise and for redshiftdistortion in galaxy surveys. the galaxy distribution is expanded in anorthogonal set of spherical harmonics. we show that in the framework ofbayesian statistics and gaussian random fields the $4 \pi$ harmonics can berecovered and the shot-noise can be suppressed, giving the optimal picture ofthe underlying density field. the correction factor from observed toreconstructed harmonics turns out to be the well-known wiener filter (the ratioof signal to signal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimumvariance. we apply the method to the 1.2 jy iras survey. a reconstruction ofthe projected galaxy distribution confirms the connectivity of thesupergalactic plane across the galactic plane (at galactic longitude $l \sim135^o$ and $l \sim 315^o$) and the puppis cluster behind the galactic plane ($l \sim 240^o$). the method is extended to 3-d, and is used to recover from the1.2 jy redshift survey the density, velocity and potential fields in the localuniverse.

astro-ph;9511005	the optical redshift survey ii: derivation of the luminosity and  diameter functions and of the density field	we quantify the effects of galactic extinction on the derived luminosity anddiameter functions and on the density field of a redshift sample. galaxymagnitudes are more affected by extinction than are diameters, although theeffect on the latter is more variable from galaxy to galaxy, making it moredifficult to quantify. we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to correct theluminosity function, the diameter function and the density field for extinctioneffects. the effects of random and systematic photometric errors are alsoinvestigated. the derived density field is robust to both random and systematicmagnitude errors as long as these are uncorrelated with position on the sky,since biases in the derived selection function and number counts tend to cancelone another. extinction-corrected luminosity and diameter functions are derivedfor several subsamples of the {\it optical redshift survey} (ors). extinctioncorrections for the diameter-limited subsamples are found to be unreliable,possibly due to the superposition of random and systematic errors. the orssubsamples are combined using overall density scaling factors from a full-skyredshift survey of \iras\ galaxies, allowing the reconstruction of the opticalgalaxy density field over most of the sky to 8000 \kms.

astro-ph;9601054	present and future galaxy redshift surveys: ors, dogs and 2df	three galaxy redshifts surveys and their analyses are discussed. (i) therecently completed optical redshift survey (ors) includes galaxies larger than1.9 arcmin and/or brighter than $14.5^m$. it provides redshifts for $\sim 8300$ galaxies at galactic latitude $|b|&gt;20^o$. a new analysis of the surveyexplores the existence and extent of the supergalactic plane (sgp). itsorientation is found to be in good agreement with the standard sgp coordinates,and suggests that the sgp is at least as large as the survey (16000 km/sec indiameter). (ii) the dwingeloo obscured galaxy survey is aimed at findinggalaxies hidden behind the milky-way using a blind search in 21 cm. thediscovery of dwingeloo1 illustrates that the survey will allow us tosystematically survey the region $30^o &lt; l &lt; 200^o$ out to 4000 km/sec. (iii)the anglo-australian 2-degree-field (2df) survey will yield 250,000 redshiftsfor apm-selected galaxies brighter than $19.5^m$ to map the large scalestructure on scales larger than $\sim 30 \mpc$. to study morphologicalsegregation and biasing the spectra will be classified using artificial neuralnetworks.

astro-ph;9608001	the two-point correlation function and morphological segregation in the  optical redshift survey	we study the clustering of galaxies in real and redshift space using theoptical redshift survey (ors). we estimate the two point correlation functionin redshift space, $\xi(s)$, for several subsamples of ors, spanning nearly afactor of 30 in volume and detect significant variations in $\xi(s)$ among thesubsamples covering small volumes. for volumes \gtsima $(75 h^{-1} {\rmmpc})^{3}$ the ors subsamples present very similar clustering patterns.powerlaw fits to $\xi(s)$ give best-fit values in the range $1.5 \leq\gamma_{s} \leq 1.7 $ and $6.5 \leq s_{0} \leq 8.8 h^{-1}$ mpc for severalsamples extending to redshifts of 8000 km s$^{-1}$. we find that $\xi(s)$ islarger for the magnitude-limited sample than for diameter-limited one within aradius of 4000 km s$^{-1}$. we interpret this as an indirect result ofmorphological segregation coupled with differences in morphological mix. wesplit ors into morphological subsamples and confirm the existence ofmorphological segregation of galaxies out to scales of $s \sim 10 h^{-1}$ mpc.our results indicate that the relative bias factor between early type galaxiesand late-types may be weakly dependent on scale. if real, this would suggestnon-linear biasing. we also compute correlations as a function of radial andprojected separations, $\xi(r_p, \pi)$ and derive the real space correlationfunction, $\xi(r)$. the results obtained in real space confirm those foundusing $\xi(s)$.

astro-ph;9608021	wiener reconstruction of the iras 1.2jy galaxy redshift survey:  cosmographical implications	we utilise the method of wiener reconstruction with spherical harmonics andbessel functions to recover the density and velocity fields from the iras 1.2jyredshift survey. the results are robust to changes in prior parameters and thenumber of expansion coefficients. maps of these fields are presented in avariety of projections. many known structures are observed, including clearconfirmations of the clusters n1600 and a3627. the perseus-pisces superclusterappears to extend out to roughly 9000km/s, and the reconstruction shows`backside infall' to the centaurus/great attractor region. a qualitativecomparison of the reconstructed iras gravity field with that from tully-fisherpeculiar velocity measurements (mark iii) shows reasonable agreement. thewiener reconstruction of the density field is also the optimal reconstruction(in the minimum variance sense) of any quantity which is linear in the densitycontrast. we show reconstructions of three such quantities. the misalignmentangle between the iras and cmb local group dipoles is only 13 degrees out to5000km/s, but increases to 25 degrees out to 20,000km/s. the reconstructed irasbulk flow out to 5000km/s is roughly 300km/s, which agrees in amplitude withthat derived from the mark iii peculiar velocities (370km/s). however, the twobulk flow vectors deviate by 70 degrees. finally, moment of inertia analysisshows that the wiener reconstructed supergalactic plane is aligned within 30degrees of that defined by de vaucouleurs.

astro-ph;9610037	the x-ray background as a probe of density fluctuations at high redshift	the x-ray background (xrb) probes structure on scales intermediate betweenthose explored by local galaxy redshift surveys and by the cobe microwavebackground measurements. we predict the large scale angular fluctuations in thexrb, expressed in terms of spherical harmonics for a range of assumedpower-spectra and evolution scenarios. the dipole is due to large scalestructure as well as to the observer's motion (the compton-getting effect). fora typical observer the two effects turn out to be comparable in amplitude. thecoupling of the two effects makes it difficult to use the xrb for independentconfirmation of the cmb dipole being due to the observer's motion. the largescale structure dipole (rms per component) relative to the monopole is in therange $a_{1m}/a_{00} \sim (0.5-9.0) \times 10^{-3} $. the spread is mainly dueto the assumed redshift evolution scenarios of the x-ray volume emissivity$\rho_x(z)$. the dipole's prediction is consistent with a measured dipole inthe heao1 xrb map. typically, the harmonic spectrum drops with $l$ like $a_{lm}\sim l^{-0.4}$. this behaviour allows us to discriminate a true clusteringsignal against the flux shot noise, which is constant with $l$, and maydominate the signal unless bright resolved sources are removed from the xrbmap. we also show that sachs-wolfe and doppler (due to the motion of thesources) effects in the xrb are negligible. although our analysis focuses onthe xrb, the formalism is general and can be easily applied to othercosmological backgrounds.

astro-ph;9611093	probing density fluctuations at low and high redshift	we discuss cosmological inference from galaxy surveys at low and highredshifts. studies of optical and iras redshift surveys with median redshift${\bar z} \sim 0.02$ yield measurements of the density parameter $\omega$ andthe power-spectrum of density fluctuations, but both cannot easily be relatedto the properties of the underlying mass distribution due to the uncertainty inthe way galaxies are biased relative to the mass distribution. moreover,currently little is known about fluctuations on scales intermediate betweenlocal galaxy surveys ($\sim 100 h^{-1}$ mpc) and the scales probed by cobe($\sim 1000 h^{-1}$ mpc). we focus here on several issues, as examples ofclustering on different scales: the extent of the supergalactic plane, anoptimal reconstruction method of the density and velocity fields, the effect ofbiasing on determination of $\omega$ from redshift distortion, the future bigsurveys sdss and 2df (with median redshift ${\bar z} \sim 0.1$) and radiosources and the x-ray background as useful probes of the density fluctuationsat higher redshift (${\bar z} \sim 1$).

astro-ph;9709205	searching for large scale structure in deep radio surveys	(abridged abstract) we calculate the expected amplitude of the dipole andhigher spherical harmonics in the angular distribution of radio galaxies. themedian redshift of radio sources in existing catalogues is z=1, which allows usto study large scale structure on scales between those accessible to presentoptical and infrared surveys, and that of the cosmic microwave background(cmb). the dipole is due to 2 effects which turn out to be of comparablemagnitude: (i) our motion with respect to the cmb, and (ii) large scalestructure, parameterised here by a family of cold dark matter power-spectra. wemake specific predictions for the green bank (87gb) and parkes-mit-nrao (pmn)catalogues. for these relatively sparse catalogues both the motion and largescale structure dipole effects are expected to be smaller than the poissonshot-noise. however, we detect dipole and higher harmonics in the combined87gb-pmn catalogue which are far larger than expected. we attribute this to a 2% flux mismatch between the two catalogues. we also investigate the existenceand extent of the supergalactic plane in the above catalogues. in a strip of +-10 deg of the standard supergalactic equator, we find a 3-sigma detection inpmn, but only 1-sigma in 87gb.

astro-ph;9801293	large scale fluctuations in the x-ray background	we present an attempt to measure the large angular scale fluctuations in thex-ray background (xrb) from the heao1-a2 data, expressed in terms of sphericalharmonics. we model the harmonic coefficients assuming a power spectrum and anepoch-dependent bias parameter, and using a phenomenological scenariodescribing the evolution of the x-ray sources. from the few low-ordermultipoles detected above shot noise, we estimate the power-spectrumnormalization on scales intermediate between those explored by local galaxyredshift surveys (~ 100 mpc) and by the cobe microwave background measurements(~ 1000 mpc). we find that the heao1 harmonics are consistent with presentepoch rms fluctuations of the x-ray sources bx(0)sigma8 ~ 1-2 in 8 mpc spheres.therefore the observed fluctuations in the xrb are roughly as expected frominterpolating between the local galaxy surveys and the cobe cmb experiment. wepredict that an x-ray all-sky surface brightness survey resolving sources afactor of 10 fainter than heao1, may reveal fluctuations to significantlylarger angular scales and therefore more strongly constrain the large scalestructure of the universe on scales of hundreds of mpcs.

astro-ph;9802109	joint estimation of cosmological parameters from cmb and iras data	observations of large scale structure (lss) and the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) each place separate constraints on the values of cosmologicalparameters. we calculate a joint likelihood based on various cmb experimentsand the iras 1.2jy galaxy redshift survey and use this to find an overalloptimum with respect to the free parameters. our formulation self-consistentlytakes account of the underlying mass distribution, which affects both the cmbpotential fluctuations and the iras redshift distortion. this not only allowsmore accurate parameter estimation, but also removes the parameter degeneracywhich handicaps calculations based on either approach alone. the family of colddark matter (cdm) models analysed corresponds to a spatially-flat universe withan initially scale-invariant spectrum and a cosmological constant. freeparameters in the joint model are the mass density due to all matter (omega_m),hubble's parameter (h = h_0 / 100km/s mpc^-1), the quadrupole normalisation ofthe cmb power spectrum (q) in uk, and the iras light-to-mass bias (b_i).throughout the analysis, the baryonic density (omega_b) is required is tosatisfy the nucleosynthesis constraint omega_b h^2 = 0.024. results from thetwo data sets show good agreement, and the joint optimum lies at omega_m=0.39,h=0.53, q=16.96uk, and b_i=1.21. the 68 per cent confidence intervals are:0.29&lt;omega_m&lt;0.53, 0.39&lt;h&lt;0.58, 15.34&lt;q&lt;17.60, and 0.98&lt;b_i&lt;1.56. for the aboveparameters the normalisation and shape of the mass power-spectrum aresigma_8=0.67 and gamma=0.15, and the age of the universe is 16.5gyr.

astro-ph;9802173	the velocity field predicted by the optical redshift survey	we have used the optical redshift survey (ors; santiago et al. 1995) toconstruct the gravity field due to fluctuations in the galaxy density field outto distances of 8000 km/s. at large scales where linear theory applies, thecomparison of this gravity field with the observed peculiar velocity fieldoffers a powerful cosmological probe, because the predicted flow field isproportional to the parameter omega^{0.6}/b, where omega is the matter densityand b is the bias of the galaxy distribution. the more densely sampled orsgravity field, to excellent approximation, matches that of the earlier iras1.2-jy redshift survey (fisher et al. 1995), provided beta is reduced by afactor b(opt)/b(iras)=1.4. apart from this scaling, the most significantdifference between the ors and iras fields is induced by differing estimates ofthe over-density of the virgo cluster. neither of these gravity fields isconsistent with the peculiar velocity field constructed from the full mark iii(willick et al. 1997) sample. we find that a simple but plausible non-linearbias algorithm for the galaxy distribution relative to the mass has anegligible effect on the derived fields. we conclude that the substitution ofoptical for iras catalogues cannot alone resolve the discrepancies between theiras gravity field and the mark iii peculiar velocity field.

astro-ph;9806193	stochastic nonlinear galaxy biasing	we propose a general formalism for galaxy biasing and apply it to methods formeasuring cosmological parameters, such as regression of light versus mass, theanalysis of redshift distortions, measures involving skewness and the cosmicvirial theorem. the common linear and deterministic relation g=b*d between thedensity fluctuation fields of galaxies g and mass d is replaced by theconditional distribution p(g|d) of these random fields, smoothed at a givenscale at a given time. the nonlinearity is characterized by the conditionalmean &lt;g|d&gt;=b(d)*d, while the local scatter is represented by the conditionalvariance s_b^2(d) and higher moments. the scatter arises from hidden factorsaffecting galaxy formation and from shot noise unless it has been properlyremoved. for applications involving second-order local moments, the biasing isdefined by three natural parameters: the slope b_h of the regression of g on d,a nonlinearity b_t, and a scatter s_b. the ratio of variances b_v^2 and thecorrelation coefficient r mix these parameters. the nonlinearity and thescatter lead to underestimates of order b_t^2/b_h^2 and s_b^2/b_h^2 in thedifferent estimators of beta (=omega^0.6/b_h). the nonlinear effects aretypically smaller. local stochasticity affects the redshift-distortion analysisonly by limiting the useful range of scales, especially for power spectra. inthis range, for linear stochastic biasing, the analysis reduces to kaiser'sformula for b_h (not b_v), independent of the scatter. the distortion analysisis affected by nonlinear properties of biasing but in a weak way. estimates ofthe nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on simulations andtoy models, and strategies for measuring them are discussed. they may partlyexplain the range of estimates for beta.

astro-ph;9810169	joint cosmological inference from galaxy surveys, the cosmic microwave  background and the x-ray background	we discuss cosmological inference from galaxy surveys, the x-ray background(xrb) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb). we assume a family of colddark matter (cdm) models in a spatially flat universe with an initiallyscale-invariant spectrum and a cosmological constant. joint analysis of the cmband iras resdhift surveys yields as optimal parameters (for fixed omega_b h^2 =0.024): omega_m = 1- \omega_lambda = 0.4, h = 0.53, q = 17muk, and b_iras= 1.2.for the above parameters the normalisation and shape of the mass power-spectrumare sigma_8=0.7 and gamma=0.15, and the age of the universe is 16.5 gyr.assuming a standard cdm model, the joint iras and xrb analysis gives biasparameters of b_iras = 1.1 and b_x(z=0) = 2.6. when combining cmb and iras withxrb data we show that standard cdm cannot fit all three data sets. we also usethese data sets to verify the cosmological principle and to constrain thefractal dimension of the universe on large scales.

0705.4477	the future of the local large scale structure: the roles of dark matter  and dark energy	we study the distinct effects of dark matter and dark energy on the futureevolution of nearby large scale structures using constrained n-bodysimulations. we contrast a model of cold dark matter and a cosmologicalconstant (lcdm) with an open cdm (ocdm) model with the same matter densityomega_m =0.3 and the same hubble constant h=0.7. already by the time the scalefactor increased by a factor of 6 (29 gyr from now in lcdm; 78 gyr from now inocdm) the comoving position of the local group is frozen. well before thatepoch the two most massive members of the local group, the milky way andandromeda, will merge. however, as the expansion rates of the scale factor inthe two models are different, the local group will be receding in physicalcoordinates from virgo exponentially in a lcdm model and at a roughly constantvelocity in an ocdm model. more generally, in comoving coordinates the futurelarge scale structure will look like a sharpened image of the presentstructure: the skeleton of the cosmic web will remain the same, but clusterswill be more `isolated' and the filaments will become thinner. this impliesthat the long-term fate of large scale structure as seen in comovingcoordinates is determined primarily by the matter density. we conclude thatalthough the lcdm model is accelerating at present due to its dark energycomponent while the ocdm model is non accelerating, their large scale structurein the future will look very similar in comoving coordinates.

astro-ph;9911102	massive lossless data compression and multiple parameter estimation from  galaxy spectra	we present a method for radical linear compression of datasets where the dataare dependent on some number $m$ of parameters. we show that, if the noise inthe data is independent of the parameters, we can form $m$ linear combinationsof the data which contain as much information about all the parameters as theentire dataset, in the sense that the fisher information matrices areidentical; i.e. the method is lossless. we explore how these compressed numbersfare when the noise is dependent on the parameters, and show that the method,although not precisely lossless, increases errors by a very modest factor. themethod is general, but we illustrate it with a problem for which it iswell-suited: galaxy spectra, whose data typically consist of $\sim 10^3$fluxes, and whose properties are set by a handful of parameters such as age,brightness and a parametrised star formation history. the spectra are reducedto a small number of data, which are connected to the physical processesentering the problem. this data compression offers the possibility of a largeincrease in the speed of determining physical parameters. this is an importantconsideration as datasets of galaxy spectra reach $10^6$ in size, and thecomplexity of model spectra increases. in addition to this practical advantage,the compressed data may offer a classification scheme for galaxy spectra whichis based rather directly on physical processes.

0810.1229	the cluster-galaxy cross-spectrum: an additional probe of cosmological  and halo parameters	there are several wide field galaxy and cluster surveys planned for thenearest future, e.g. boss, wfmos, adept, hetdex, spt, erosita. in the simplestapproach one would analyze these independently, thus neglecting the extrainformation provided by the cluster-galaxy cross-pairs. in this paper we havefocused on the possible synergy between these surveys by investigating theamount of information encoded in the cross-pairs. we present a model for thecluster-galaxy cross-spectrum within the halo model framework. to assess thegain in performance due to inclusion of the cluster-galaxy cross-pairs we carryout a fisher matrix analysis for a boss-like galaxy redshift survey targetingluminous red galaxies and a hypothetical mass-limited cluster redshift surveywith a lower mass threshold of 1.7x10^14 m_sun/h over the same volume. on smallscales cluster-galaxy cross-spectrum probes directly density profile of thehalos, instead of the density profile convolved with itself, as is the case forthe galaxy power spectrum. due to this different behavior, adding informationfrom the cross-pairs helps to tighten constraints on the halo occupationdistribution. by inclusion of the cross-pairs a factor of ~2 strongerconstraints are obtained for sigma_8, while the improvement for the dark energyfigure-of-merit is somewhat weaker: an increase by a factor of 1.4.

hep-ph;0412075	neutrino masses from cosmological probes	there is a renewed interest in constraining the sum of the masses of thethree neutrino flavours by using cosmological measurements. solar, atmospheric,and reactor neutrino experiments have confirmed neutrino oscillations, implyingthat neutrinos have non-zero mass, but without pinning down their absolutemasses. while it is established that the effect of light neutrinos on theevolution of cosmic structure is small, the upper limits derived fromlarge-scale structure could help significantly to constrain the absolute scaleof the neutrino masses. it is also important to know the sum of neutrino massesas it is degenerate with the values of other cosmological parameters, e.g. theamplitude of fluctuations and the primordial spectral index. a summary ofcosmological neutrino mass limits is given. current results from cosmology setan upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses of ~1 ev, somewhat dependingon the data sets used in the analyses and assumed priors on cosmologicalparameters. it is important to emphasize that the total neutrino mass (`hotdark matter') is derived assuming that the other components in the universe arebaryons, cold dark matter and dark energy. we assess the impact of neutrinomasses on the matter power spectrum, the cosmic microwave background, peculiarvelocities and gravitational lensing. we also discuss future methods to improvethe mass upper limits by an order of magnitude.

0812.3831	a comparison of six photometric redshift methods applied to 1.5 million  luminous red galaxies	we present an updated version of megaz-lrg (collister et al.,(2007)) withphotometric redshifts derived with the neural network method, annz as well asfive other publicly available photo-z codes (hyperz, sdss, le phare, bpz andzebra) for ~1.5 million luminous red galaxies (lrgs) in sdss dr6. this allowsus to identify how reliable codes are relative to each other if used asdescribed in their public release. we compare and contrast the relative meritsof each code using ~13000 spectroscopic redshifts from the 2slaq sample. wefind that the performance of each code depends on the figure of merit used toassess it. as expected, the availability of a complete training set means thatthe training method performs best in the intermediate redshift bins where thereare plenty of training objects. codes such as le phare, which use new observedtemplates perform best in the lower redshift bins. all codes produce reasonablephotometric redshifts, the 1-sigma scatters ranging from 0.057 to 0.097 ifaveraged over the entire redshift range. we also perform tests to check whethera training set from a small region of the sky such as 2slaq produces biases ifused to train over a larger area of the sky. we conclude that this is notlikely to be a problem for future wide-field surveys. the complete photometricredshift catalogue including redshift estimates and errors on these from allsix methods can be found at www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~mbanerji/megazlrgdr6/megaz.html
