0902.3982	x-ray polarization from accreting black holes: ii. the thermal state	we present new calculations of x-ray polarization from black hole (bh)accretion disks in the thermally-dominated state, using a monte-carloray-tracing code in full general relativity. in contrast to many previouslypublished studies, our approach allows us to include returning radiation thatis deflected by the strong-field gravity of the bh and scatters off of the diskbefore reaching a distant observer. although carrying a relatively smallfraction of the total observed flux, the scattered radiation tends to be highlypolarized and in a direction perpendicular to the direct radiation. formoderately large spin parameters (a/m &gt;~ 0.9), this scattered returningradiation dominates the polarization signal at energies above the thermal peak,giving a net rotation in the polarization angle of 90 deg. we show how thesenew features of the polarization spectra from bhs in the thermal state may bedeveloped into a powerful tool for measuring bh spin and probing the gas flowin the innermost disk. in addition to determining the emission profile,polarization observations can be used to constrain other properties of thesystem such as bh mass, inclination, and distance. new instruments currentlyunder development should be able to exploit this tool in the near future.

0906.2784	transport of large scale poloidal flux in black hole accretion	we report on a global, three-dimensional grmhd simulation of an accretiontorus embedded in a large scale vertical magnetic field orbiting aschwarzschild black hole. this simulation investigates how a large scalevertical field evolves within a turbulent accretion disk and whether globalmagnetic field configurations suitable for launching jets and winds candevelop. we find that a "coronal mechanism" of magnetic flux motion, whichoperates largely outside the disk body, dominates global flux evolution. inthis mechanism, magnetic stresses driven by orbital shear create large-scalehalf-loops of magnetic field that stretch radially inward and then reconnect,leading to discontinuous jumps in the location of magnetic flux. in contrast,little or no flux is brought in directly by accretion within the disk itself.the coronal mechanism establishes a dipole magnetic field in the evacuatedfunnel around the orbital axis with a field intensity regulated by acombination of the magnetic and gas pressures in the inner disk. these resultsprompt a reevaluation of previous descriptions of magnetic flux motionassociated with accretion. local pictures are undercut by the intrinsicallyglobal character of magnetic flux. formulations in terms of an "effectiveviscosity" competing with an "effective resistivity" are undermined by thenonlinearity of of the magnetic dynamics and the fact that the same turbulencedriving mass motion (traditionally identified as "viscosity") can altermagnetic topology.

0907.1655	grmhd prediction of coronal variability in accreting black holes	on the basis of data from an energy-conserving 3d general relativistic mhdsimulation, we predict the statistical character of variability in the coronalluminosity from accreting black holes. when the inner boundary of the corona isdefined to be the electron scattering photosphere, its location depends only onthe mass accretion rate in eddington units (\dot{m}). nearly independent ofviewing angle and \dot{m}, the power spectrum over the range of frequenciesfrom approximately the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit(isco) to ~100 times lower is well approximated by a power-law with index -2,crudely consistent with the observed power spectra of hard x-ray fluctuationsin agn and the hard states of galactic binary black holes. the underlyingphysical driver for variability in the light curve is variations in theaccretion rate caused by the chaotic character of mhd turbulence, but the powerspectrum of the coronal light output is significantly steeper. part of thiscontrast is due to the fact that the mass accretion rate can be significantlymodulated by radial epicyclic motions that do not result in dissipation, andtherefore do not drive luminosity fluctuations. the other part of this contrastis due to the inward decrease of the characteristic inflow time, which leads todecreasing radial coherence length with increasing fluctuation frequency.

0908.1117	turbulent stresses in local simulations of radiation-dominated accretion  disks, and the possibility of the lightman-eardley instability	we present the results of a series of radiation-mhd simulations of a localpatch of an accretion disk, with fixed vertical gravity profile but withdifferent surface mass densities and a broad range of radiation to gas pressureratios. each simulation achieves a thermal equilibrium that lasts for manycooling times. after averaging over times long compared to a cooling time, wefind that the vertically integrated stress is approximately proportional to thevertically-averaged total thermal (gas plus radiation) pressure. we mapout--for the first time on the basis of explicit physics--the thermalequilibrium relation between stress and surface density: the stress decreases(increases) with increasing surface mass density when the simulation isradiation (gas) pressure dominated. the dependence of stress on surface massdensity in the radiation pressure dominated regime suggests the possibility ofa lightman-eardley inflow instability, but global simulations or shearing boxsimulations with much wider radial boxes will be necessary to confirm this anddetermine its nonlinear behavior.

0909.2003	what is the numerically converged amplitude of mhd turbulence in  stratified shearing boxes?	we study the properties of the turbulence driven by the magnetorotationalinstability (mri) in a stratified shearing box with outflow boundary conditionsand an equation of state determined by self-consistent dissipation andradiation losses. a series of simulations with increasing resolution areperformed within a fixed computational box. we achieve numerical convergencewith respect to radial and azimuthal resolution. as vertical resolution isimproved, the ratio of stress to pressure increases only slowly, but theabsolute levels of both the stress and the pressure increase noticeably. thevertical correlation length of the magnetic field within the core of the diskis highly time-dependent, but averaged over time, it is $\simeq 3$ times largerthan found in previous unstratifed simulations. this correlation lengthdecreases slowly as vertical resolution increases. we suggest that this greaterdegree of correlation in stratified than unstratified disks, even near themidplane, is due to field buoyancy. we further show that the undulatory parkerinstability drives the magnetic field upwelling at several scaleheights fromthe midplane that is characteristic of stratified mhd-turbulent disks.

0911.5711	estimating the prompt electromagnetic luminosity of a black hole merger	although recent work in numerical relativity has made tremendous strides inquantifying the gravitational wave luminosity of black hole mergers, verylittle is known about the electromagnetic luminosity that might occur inimmediate conjunction with these events. we show that whenever the heatdeposited in the gas near a pair of merging black holes is proportional to itstotal mass, and the surface density of the gas in the immediate vicinity isgreater than the (quite small) amount necessary to make it optically thick, thecharacteristic scale of the luminosity emitted in direct association with themerger is the eddington luminosity independent of the gas mass. the duration ofthe photon signal is proportional to the gas mass, and is generally ratherlonger than the merger event. at somewhat larger distances, dissipationassociated with realigning the gas orbits to the new spin orientation of theblack hole can supplement dissipation of the energy gained from orbitaladjustment to the mass lost in gravitational radiation; these two heat sourcescan combine to augment the electromagnetic radiation over longer timescales.

0912.0907	x-ray polarization from accreting black holes: coronal emission	we present new calculations of x-ray polarization from accreting black holes(bhs), using a monte-carlo ray-tracing code in full general relativity. in ourmodel, an optically thick disk in the bh equatorial plane produces thermal seedphotons with polarization oriented parallel to the disk surface. these seedphotons are then inverse-compton scattered through a hot (but thermal) corona,producing a hard x-ray power-law spectrum. we consider three different modelsfor the corona geometry: a wedge ``sandwich'' with aspect ratio h/r andvertically-integrated optical depth tau_0 constant throughout the disk; aninhomogeneous ``clumpy'' corona with a finite number of hot clouds distributedrandomly above the disk within a wedge geometry; and a spherical corona ofuniform density, centered on the bh and surrounded by a truncated thermal diskwith inner radius r_edge. in all cases we find a characteristic transition fromhorizontal polarization at low energies to vertical polarization above thethermal peak; the vertical direction is defined as the projection of the bhspin axis on the plane of the sky. we show how the details of thespectropolarization signal can be used to distinguish between these models andinfer various properties of the corona and bh. although the bulk of this paperfocuses on stellar-mass bhs, we also consider the effects of coronal scatteringon the x-ray polarization signal from supermassive bhs in active galacticnuclei.

1001.4809	dependence of inner accretion disk stress on parameters: the  schwarzschild case	we explore the parameter dependence of inner disk stress in black holeaccretion by contrasting the results of a number of simulations, all employing3-d general relativistic mhd in a schwarzschild spacetime. five of thesesimulations were performed with the intrinsically conservative code harm3d,which allows careful regulation of the disk aspect ratio, h/r; our simulationsspan a range in h/r from 0.06 to 0.17. we contrast these simulations with twopreviously reported simulations in a schwarzschild spacetime in order toinvestigate possible dependence of the inner disk stress on magnetic topology.in all cases, much care was devoted to technical issues: ensuring adequateresolution and azimuthal extent, and averaging only over those time-periodswhen the accretion flow is in approximate inflow equilibrium. we find that thetime-averaged radial-dependence of fluid-frame electromagnetic stress is almostcompletely independent of both disk thickness and poloidal magnetic topology.it rises smoothly inward at all radii (exhibiting no feature associated withthe isco) until just outside the event horizon, where the stress plummets tozero. reynolds stress can also be significant near the isco and in the plungingregion; the magnitude of this stress, however, depends on both disk thicknessand magnetic topology. the two stresses combine to make the net angularmomentum accreted per unit rest-mass 7-15% less than the angular momentum ofthe isco.

1103.5052	dissipation and vertical energy transport in radiation-dominated  accretion disks	standard models of radiation supported accretion disks generally assume thatdiffusive radiation flux is solely responsible for vertical heat transport.this requires that heat must be generated at a critical rate per unit volume ifthe disk is to be in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. this raises thequestion of how heat is generated and how energy is transported in mhdturbulence. by analysis of a number of radiation/mhd stratified shearing-boxsimulations, we show that the divergence of the diffusive radiation flux isindeed capped at the critical rate, but deep inside the disk, substantialvertical energy flux is also carried by advection of radiation. work done byradiation pressure is a significant part of the energy budget, and much of thiswork is dissipated later through damping by radiative diffusion. we show howthis damping can be measured in the simulations, and identify its physicalorigins. radiative damping accounts for as much as tens of percent of the totaldissipation, and is the only realistic physical mechanism for dissipation ofturbulence that can actually be resolved in numerical simulations of accretiondisks. buoyancy associated with dynamo-driven, highly magnetized,nearly-isobaric nonlinear slow magnetosonic fluctuations is responsible for theradiation advection flux, and also explains the persistent periodic magneticupwelling seen at all values of the radiation to gas pressure ratio. theintimate connection between radiation advection and magnetic buoyancy is thefirst example we know of in astrophysics in which a dynamo has direct impact onthe global energetics of a system.

1103.5987	assessing quantitative results in accretion simulations: from local to  global	discretized numerical simulations are a powerful tool for investigation ofnonlinear mhd turbulence in accretion disks. however, confidence in theirquantitative predictions requires a demonstration that further refinement ofthe spatial gridscale would not result in any significant change. this has yetto be accomplished, particularly for global disk simulations. in this paper, wecombine data from previously published stratified shearing box simulations andnew global disk simulations to calibrate several quantitative diagnostics bywhich one can estimate progress toward numerical convergence. using thesediagnostics, we find that the established criterion for an adequate numericaldescription of linear growth of the magneto-rotational instability (the numberof cells across a wavelength of the fastest-growing vertical wavenumber mode)can be extended to a criterion for adequate description of nonlinear mhd diskturbulence, but the standard required is more stringent. we also find thatazimuthal resolution, which has not often been extensively examined in previousstudies, can significantly affect the evolution of the poloidal magnetic field.we further analyze the comparative resolution requirements of a small sample ofinitial magnetic field geometries; not surprisingly, more complicated initialfield geometries require higher spatial resolution. otherwise, they tend toevolve to qualitatively similar states if evolved for sufficient time. applyingour quantitative resolution criteria to a sample of previously published globalsimulations, we find that, with perhaps a single exception, they aresignificantly under-resolved, and therefore underestimate the magneticturbulence and resulting stress levels throughout the accretion flow.

1105.2825	radiative efficiency and thermal spectrum of accretion onto  schwarzschild black holes	recent general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) simulations ofaccretion onto black holes have shown that, contrary to the basic assumptionsof the novikov-thorne model, there can be substantial magnetic stressthroughout the plunging region. additional dissipation and radiation cantherefore be expected. we use data from a particularly well-resolved simulationof accretion onto a non-spinning black hole to compute both the radiativeefficiency of such a flow and its spectrum if all emitted light is radiatedwith a thermal spectrum whose temperature matches the local effectivetemperature. this disk is geometrically thin enough (h/r ~= 0.06) that littleheat is retained in the flow. in terms of light reaching infinity (i.e., afterallowance for all relativistic effects and for photon capture by the blackhole), we find that the radiative efficiency is at least ~=6-10% greater thanpredicted by the novikov-thorne model (complete radiation of all heat mightyield another ~6%). we also find that the spectrum more closely resembles thenovikov-thorne prediction for a/m ~= 0.2--0.3 than for the correct value,a/m=0. as a result, if the spin of a non-spinning black hole is inferred bymodel-fitting to a novikov-thorne model with known black hole mass, distance,and inclination, the inferred a/m is too large by ~= 0.2--0.3.

1110.4866	three dimensional mhd simulation of circumbinary accretion disks: disk  structures and angular momentum transport	we present the first three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulationsof a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal mass binary. the binary maintains afixed circular orbit of separation $a$. as in previous hydrodynamicalsimulations, strong torques by the binary can maintain a gap of radius $\simeq2a$. streams curve inward from $r \simeq 2a$ toward the binary; some of theirmass passes through the inner boundary, while the remainder swings back out tothe disk. however, we also find that near its inner edge the disk develops botha strong $m=1$ asymmetry and growing orbital eccentricity. because the mhdstresses introduce more matter into the gap, the total torque per unit diskmass is $\simeq 14$ times larger than found previously. the inner boundaryaccretion rate per unit disk mass is $\simeq 40$ times greater than found fromprevious hydrodynamical calculations. the implied binary shrinkage rate isdetermined by a balance between the rate at which the binary gains angularmomentum by accretion and loses it by gravitational torque. the large accretionrate brings these two rates nearly into balance, but in net, we find that $\dota/a &lt; 0$, and its magnitude is about 2.7 times larger than predicted by theearlier hydrodynamic simulations. if the binary comprises two massive blackholes, the accretion rate may be great enough for one or both to be agn, withconsequences for the physical state of the gas both in the disk body and in itsinner gap.

1111.2802	jets from tidal disruptions of stars by black holes	tidal disruption of main sequence stars by black holes has generally beenthought to lead to a signal dominated by uv emission. if, however, the blackhole spins rapidly and the poloidal magnetic field intensity on the black holehorizon is comparable to the inner accretion disk pressure, a powerful jet mayform whose luminosity can easily exceed the thermal uv luminosity. when the jetbeam points at earth, its non-thermal luminosity can dominate the emittedspectrum. the thermal and non-thermal components decay differently with time.in particular, the thermal emission should remain roughly constant for asignificant time after the period of maximum accretion, beginning to diminishonly after a delay, whereas after the peak accretion rate, the non-thermal jetemission decays, but then reaches a plateau. both transitions are tied to acharacteristic timescale $t_{\rm edd}$ at which the accretion rate falls beloweddington. making use of this timescale in a new parameter-inference formalismfor tidal disruption events with significant emission from a jet, we analyzethe recent flare source swift j2058. it is consistent with an event in which amain sequence solar-type staris disrupted by a black hole of mass $\sim 4\times 10^7 m_{\odot}$. the beginning of the flat phase in the non-thermalemission from this source can possibly be seen in the late-time lightcurve.optical photometry over the first $\simeq 40$ d of this flare is alsoconsistent with this picture, but is only weakly constraining because thebolometric correction is very uncertain. we suggest that future searches formain sequence tidal disruptions use methods sensitive to jet radiation as wellas to thermal uv radiation.

1204.1073	circumbinary mhd accretion into inspiraling binary black holes	as 2 black holes bound to each other in a close binary approach merger theirinspiral time becomes shorter than the characteristic inflow time ofsurrounding orbiting matter. using an innovative technique in which werepresent the changing spacetime in the region occupied by the orbiting matterwith a 2.5pn approximation and the binary orbital evolution with 3.5pn, we havesimulated the mhd evolution of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal-massnon-spinning binary. prior to the beginning of the inspiral, the structure ofthe circumbinary disk is predicted well by extrapolation from newtonianresults. the binary opens a low-density gap whose radius is roughly two binaryseparations, and matter piles up at the outer edge of this gap as inflow isretarded by torques exerted by the binary; nonetheless, the accretion rate isdiminished relative to its value at larger radius by only about a factor of 2.during inspiral, the inner edge of the disk at first moves inward incoordination with the shrinking binary, but as the orbital evolutionaccelerates, the rate at which the inner edge moves toward smaller radii fallsbehind the rate of binary compression. in this stage, the rate of angularmomentum transfer from the binary to the disk slows substantially, but the netaccretion rate decreases by only 10-20%. when the binary separation is tens ofgravitational radii, the rest-mass efficiency of disk radiation is a fewpercent, suggesting that supermassive binary black holes in galactic nucleicould be very luminous at this stage of their evolution. if the luminosity wereoptically thin, it would be modulated at a frequency that is a beat between theorbital frequency of the disk's surface density maximum and the binary orbitalfrequency. however, a disk with sufficient surface density to be luminousshould also be optically thick; as a result, the periodic modulation may besuppressed.

1207.2693	x-ray spectra from mhd simulations of accreting black holes	we present the results of a new global radiation transport code coupled to ageneral relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of an accreting,non-rotating black hole. for the first time, we are able to explain from firstprinciples in a self-consistent way all the components seen in the x-rayspectra of stellar-mass black holes, including a thermal peak and all thefeatures associated with strong hard x-ray emission: a power-law extending tohigh energies, a compton reflection hump, and a broad iron line. varying onlythe mass accretion rate, we are able to reproduce a wide range of x-ray statesseen in most galactic black hole sources. the temperature in the corona is t_e~ 10 kev in a boundary layer near the disk and rises smoothly to t_e &gt;~ 100 kevin low-density regions far above the disk. even as the disk's reflection edgevaries from the horizon out to ~ 6m as the accretion rate decreases, we findthat the shape of the fe k\alpha line is remarkably constant. this is becausephotons emitted from the plunging region are strongly beamed into the horizonand never reach the observer. we have also carried out a basic timing analysisof the spectra and find that the fractional variability increases with photonenergy and viewer inclination angle, consistent with the coronal hot spot modelfor x-ray fluctuations.

1303.5465	relaxation of warped disks: the case of pure hydrodynamics	orbiting disks may exhibit bends due to a misalignment between the angularmomentum of the inner and outer regions of the disk. we begin a systematicsimulational inquiry into the physics of warped disks with the simplest case:the relaxation of an unforced warp under pure fluid dynamics, i.e. with nointernal stresses other than reynolds stress. we focus on the nonlinear regimein which the bend rate is large compared to the disk aspect ratio. when warpsare nonlinear, strong radial pressure gradients drive transonic radial motionsalong the disk's top and bottom surfaces that efficiently mix angular momentum.the resulting nonlinear decay rate of the warp increases with the warp rate andthe warp width, but, at least in the parameter regime studied here, isindependent of the sound speed. the characteristic magnitude of the associatedangular momentum fluxes likewise increases with both the local warp rate andthe radial range over which the warp extends; it also increases with increasingsound speed, but more slowly than linearly. the angular momentum fluxes respondto the warp rate after a delay that scales with the square-root of the time forsound waves to cross the radial extent of the warp. these behaviors are atvariance with a number of the assumptions commonly used in analytic models todescribe linear warp dynamics.

0705.0305	thermodynamics of an accretion disk annulus with comparable radiation  and gas pressure	we explore the thermodynamic and global structural properties of a localpatch of an accretion disk whose parameters were chosen so that radiationpressure and gas pressure would be comparable in magnitude. heating, radiativetransport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure bysolving the equations of radiation mhd in the shearing-box approximation. usinga fully 3-d and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energybalance of this disk segment over a span of more than forty cooling times. asis also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere ismagnetically-supported. however, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady-stateis reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy contentfluctuates by factors of 3--4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, withno secular trend. because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gaspressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over theapproximate range 0.5--2. the volume-integrated dissipation rate generallyincreases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slowerthan linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of twolarger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. locally, thedissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to thecurrent density; the time-average dissipation rate per unit mass isproportional to m^{-1/2}, where m is the horizontally-averaged mass columndensity to the nearer of the top or bottom surface. as in our earlier study ofa gas-dominated shearing-box, we find that energy transport is completelydominated by radiative diffusion, with poynting flux carrying less than 1% ofthe energy lost from the box.

1307.6569	alignment of supermassive black hole binary orbits and spins	recent studies of accretion onto supermassive black hole binaries suggestthat much, perhaps most, of the matter eventually accretes onto one hole or theother. if so, then for binaries whose inspiral from ~1 pc to 0.001 - 0.01 pc isdriven by interaction with external gas, both the binary orbital axis and theindividual black hole spins can be reoriented by angular momentum exchange withthis gas. here we show that, unless the binary mass ratio is far from unity,the spins of the individual holes align with the binary orbital axis in a timefew-100 times shorter than the binary orbital axis aligns with the angularmomentum direction of the incoming circumbinary gas; the spin of the secondaryaligns more rapidly than that of the primary by a factor ~(m_1/m_2)^{1/2}&gt;1.thus the binary acts as a stabilizing agent, so that for gas-driven systems,the black hole spins are highly likely to be aligned (or counteraligned ifretrograde accretion is common) with each other and with the binary orbitalaxis. this alignment can significantly reduce the recoil speed resulting fromsubsequent black hole merger.

1309.0290	mhd simulation of a disk subjected to lense-thirring precession	when matter orbits around a central mass obliquely with respect to the mass'sspin axis, the lense-thirring effect causes it to precess at a rate decliningsharply with radius. ever since the work of bardeen &amp; petterson (1975), it hasbeen expected that when a fluid fills an orbiting disk, the orbital angularmomentum at small radii should then align with the mass's spin. nearly allprevious work has studied this alignment under the assumption that aphenomenological "viscosity" isotropically degrades fluid shears in accretiondisks, even though it is now understood that internal stress in flat disks isdue to anisotropic mhd turbulence. in this paper we report a pair of matchedsimulations, one in mhd and one in pure (non-viscous) hd in order to clarifythe specific mechanisms of alignment. as in the previous work, we find thatdisk warps induce radial flows that mix angular momentum of differentorientation; however, we also show that the speeds of these flows aregenerically transonic and are only very weakly influenced by internal stressesother than pressure. in particular, mhd turbulence does not act in a mannerconsistent with an isotropic viscosity. when mhd effects are present, the diskaligns, first at small radii and then at large; alignment is only partial inthe hd case. we identify the specific angular momentum transport mechanismscausing alignment and show how mhd effects permit them to operate moreefficiently. lastly, we relate the speed at which an alignment front propagatesoutward (in the mhd case) to the rate at which lense-thirring torques deliverangular momentum at smaller radii.

0801.3849	measuring the fraction of obscured quasars by the infrared luminosity of  unobscured quasars	recent work has suggested that the fraction of obscured agn declines withincreasing luminosity, but it has been difficult to quantify this trend. here,we attempt to measure this fraction as a function of luminosity by studying theratio of mid-infrared to intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity in unobscuredagn. because the mid-infrared is created by dust reprocessing of shorterwavelength nuclear light, this ratio is a diagnostic of f_obsc, the fraction ofsolid angle around the nucleus covered by obscuring matter. in order toeliminate possible redshift-dependences while also achieving a large dynamicrange in luminosity, we have collected archival 24 micron mips photometry fromobjects with z~1 in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), the greatobservatories origins deep survey (goods) and the cosmic evolution survey(cosmos). to measure the bolometric luminosity for each object, we usedarchival optical data supplemented by galex data. we find that the mean ratioof 24 microns to bolometric luminosity decreases by a factor of ~3 in thel_bol=10^44-3x10^47 ergs s^-1 range, but there is also a large scatter atconstant l_bol. using radiation transfer solutions for model geometries, weshow how the ir/bolometric ratio relates to f_obsc and compare these valueswith those obtained obtained from samples of x-ray selected agn. although wefind approximate agreement, our method indicates somewhat higher values off_obsc, particularly in the middle range of luminosities, suggesting that theremay be a significant number of heavily obscured agn missed by x-ray surveys.

0802.1891	radiation pressure supported agn tori with hard x-ray and stellar  heating	the dynamics and structure of toroidal obscuration around agn remainuncertain and controversial. in this paper we extend earlier work on thedynamical role of infrared radiation pressure by adding the effects of twokinds of distributed heating: compton-heating due to hard x-rays from thenucleus and local starlight heating. we find numerical solutions to theaxisymmetric hydrostatic equilibrium, energy balance, and photon diffusionequations including these effects. within the regime of typical parameters, thetwo different sources of additional heating have very similar effects: thedensity profile within the torus becomes shallower both radially andvertically, but for plausible heating rates, there is only minor change(relative to the source-free case) in the distribution of column density withsolid angle. the most interesting consequence of distributed heating is that itselects out a relatively narrow range of parameters permitting an equilibrium,particularly $(l/l_e)/\tau_t$. we discuss the implications of both thenarrowness of the permitted range and its approximate coincidence with therange inferred from observations.

1402.7098	observational signatures of binary supermassive black holes	observations indicate that most massive galaxies contain a supermassive blackhole, and theoretical studies suggest that when such galaxies have a majormerger, the central black holes will form a binary and eventually coalesce.here we discuss two spectral signatures of such binaries that may helpdistinguish them from ordinary agn. these signatures are expected when the massratio between the holes is not extreme and the system is fed by a circumbinarydisk. one such signature is a notch in the thermal continuum that has beenpredicted by other authors; we point out that it should be accompanied by aspectral revival at shorter wavelengths and also discuss its dependence onbinary properties such as mass, mass ratio, and separation. in particular, wenote that the wavelength $\lambda_n$ at which the notch occurs depends on thesethree parameters in such a way as to make the number of systems displayingthese notches $\propto \lambda_n^{16/3}$; longer wavelength searches aretherefore strongly favored. a second signature, first discussed here, is hardx-ray emission with a wien-like spectrum at a characteristic temperature $\sim100$ kev produced by compton cooling of the shock generated when streams fromthe circumbinary disk hit the accretion disks around the individual blackholes. we investigate the observability of both signatures. the hard x-raysignal may be particularly valuable as it can provide an indicator of blackhole merger a few decades in advance of the event.

1403.3096	convection causes enhanced magnetic turbulence in accretion disks in  outburst	we present the results of local, vertically stratified, radiation mhdshearing box simulations of mri turbulence appropriate for the hydrogenionizing regime of dwarf nova and soft x-ray transient outbursts. weincorporate the frequency-integrated opacities and equation of state for thisregime, but neglect non-ideal mhd effects and surface irradiation, and do notimpose net vertical magnetic flux. we find two stable thermal equilibriumtracks in the effective temperature versus surface mass density plane, inqualitative agreement with the s-curve picture of the standard disk instabilitymodel. we find that the large opacity at temperatures near $10^4$k, a corollaryof the hydrogen ionization transition, triggers strong, intermittent thermalconvection on the upper stable branch. this convection strengthens the magneticturbulent dynamo and greatly enhances the time-averaged value of the stress tothermal pressure ratio $\alpha$, possibly by generating vertical magnetic fieldthat may seed the axisymmetric magnetorotational instability, and by increasingcooling so that the pressure does not rise in proportion to the turbulentdissipation. these enhanced stress to pressure ratios may alleviate the orderof magnitude discrepancy between the $\alpha$-values observationally inferredin the outburst state and those that have been measured from previous localnumerical simulations of magnetorotational turbulence that lack net verticalmagnetic flux.

0803.3607	detailed atmosphere model fits to disk-dominated ulx spectra	we have chosen 6 ultra-luminous x-ray sources from the {\it xmm-newton}archive whose spectra have high signal-to-noise and can be fitted solely with adisk model without requiring any power-law component. to estimate systematicerrors in the inferred parameters, we fit every spectrum to two different diskmodels, one based on local blackbody emission (kerrbb) and one based ondetailed atmosphere modelling (bhspec). both incorporate full generalrelativistic treatment of the disk surface brightness profile, photon dopplershifts, and photon trajectories. we found in every case that they give almostidentical fits and similar acceptable parameters. the best-fit value of themost interesting parameter, the mass of the central object, is between 23 and73 m$_\sun$ in 5 of the 6 examples. in every case, the best-fit inclinationangle and mass are correlated, in the sense that large mass corresponds to highinclination. even after allowing for this degeneracy, we find that, with$\gtrsim 99.9%$ formal statistical confidence, 3 of the 6 objects have mass$\gtrsim 25 m_\sun$; for the other 3, these data are consistent with a widerange of masses. a mass greater than several hundred $m_\sun$ is unlikely forthe 3 best-constrained objects. these fits also suggest comparatively rapidblack hole spin in the 3 objects whose masses are relatively well-determined,but our estimate of the spin is subject to significant systematic error havingto do with uncertainty in the underlying surface brightness profile.

1501.04365	general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of accretion flow from a  stellar tidal disruption	we study how the matter dispersed when a supermassive black hole tidallydisrupts a star joins an accretion flow. combining a relativistic hydrodynamicsimulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamicssimulation of the tidal debris motion, we track such a system until ~80% of thestellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. shocksnear the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the mosttightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make thecharacteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-boundmaterial, not the tidal radius as previously thought. the outer shocks arecaused by post-newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during itsdisruption and on the tidal forces. accumulation of mass into the accretionflow is non-monotonic and slow, requiring ~3--10x the orbital period of themost tightly-bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the massmay be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. deflection byshocks does, however, remove enough angular momentum and energy from some massfor it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into theaccretion flow. although the accretion rate rises sharply and then decaysroughly as a power-law, its maximum is ~0.1x the previous expectation, and theduration of the peak is ~5x longer than previously predicted. the geometricmean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured eventtimescale is therefore ~0.2x the value given by classical theory.

1504.00311	evolution of a binary black hole with a retrograde circumbinary  accretion disk	we consider the evolution of a supermassive black hole binary (smbhb)surrounded by a retrograde accretion disk. assuming the disk is exactly in thebinary plane and transfers energy and angular momentum to the binary via directgas accretion, we calculate the time evolution of the binary's semi-major axis$a$ and eccentricity $e$. because the gas is predominantly transferred when thebinary is at apocenter, we find the eccentricity grows rapidly whilemaintaining constant $a(1+e)$. after accreting only a fraction of thesecondary's mass, the eccentricity grows to nearly unity; from then on,gravitational wave emission dominates the evolution, preserving constant$a(1-e)$. the high-eccentricity waveforms redistribute the peak gravitationalwave power from the nhz to $\mu$hz bands, substantially affecting the signalthat might be detected with pulsar timing arrays. we also estimate the torquecoupling binaries of arbitrary eccentricity with obliquely aligned circumbinarydisks. if the outer edge of the disk is not an extremely large multiple of thebinary separation, retrograde accretion can drive the binary into thegravitational wave-dominated state before these torques align the binary withthe angular momentum of the mass supply.

1505.01050	a steady-state alignment front in an accretion disk subjected to  lense-thirring torques	using only physical mechanisms, i.e., 3d mhd with no phenomenologicalviscosity, we have simulated the dynamics of a moderately thin accretion disksubject to torques whose radial scaling mimics those produced by lowest-orderpost-newtonian gravitomagnetism. in this simulation, we have shown how, in thepresence of mhd turbulence, a time-steady transition can be achieved between aninner disk region aligned with the equatorial plane of the central mass's spinand an outer region orbiting in a different plane. the position of theequilibrium orientation transition is determined by a balance betweengravitomagnetic torque and warp-induced inward mixing of misaligned angularmomentum from the outer disk. if the mixing is interpreted in terms ofdiffusive transport, the implied diffusion coefficient is~(0.6--0.8)c_s^2/omega for sound speed c_s and orbital frequency omega. thiscalibration permits estimation of the orientation transition's equilibriumlocation given the central mass, its spin parameter, and the disk's surfacedensity and scaleheight profiles. however, the alignment front overshootsbefore settling into an equilibrium, signaling that a diffusive model does notfully represent the time-dependent properties of alignment fronts under theseconditions. because the precessional torque on the disk at the alignment frontis always comparable to the rate at which misaligned angular momentum isbrought inward to the front by warp-driven radial motions, no break formsbetween the inner and outer portions of the disk in our simulation. our resultsalso raise questions about the applicability to mhd warped disks of thetraditional distinction between "bending wave" and "diffusive" regimes.

1511.00013	star formation in quasar hosts and the origin of radio emission in  radio-quiet quasars	radio emission from radio-quiet quasars may be due to star formation in thequasar host galaxy, to a jet launched by the supermassive black hole, or torelativistic particles accelerated in a wide-angle radiatively-driven outflow.in this paper we examine whether radio emission from radio-quiet quasars is abyproduct of star formation in their hosts. to this end we use infraredspectroscopy and photometry from spitzer and herschel to estimate or placeupper limits on star formation rates in hosts of ~300 obscured and unobscuredquasars at z&lt;1. we find that low-ionization forbidden emission lines such as[neii] and [neiii] are likely dominated by quasar ionization and do not providereliable star formation diagnostics in quasar hosts, while pah emissionfeatures may be suppressed due to the destruction of pah molecules by thequasar radiation field. while the bolometric luminosities of our sources aredominated by the quasars, the 160 micron fluxes are likely dominated by starformation, but they too should be used with caution. we estimate median starformation rates to be 6-29 msun/year, with obscured quasars at the high end ofthis range. this star formation rate is insufficient to explain the observedradio emission from quasars by an order of magnitude, with log(l_radio,observed/l_radio, sf)=0.6-1.3 depending on quasar type and star formationestimator. although radio-quiet quasars in our sample lie close to the 8-1000micron infrared / radio correlation characteristic of the star-forminggalaxies, both their infrared emission and their radio emission are dominatedby the quasar activity, not by the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0006456	global mhd simulation of the inner accretion disk in a pseudo-newtonian  potential	we present a detailed three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulationdescribing the inner region of a disk accreting onto a black hole. to avoid thetechnical complications of general relativity, the dynamics are treated innewtonian fashion using the pseudo-newtonian pacz\'ynski-wiita potential. thedisk evolves due to angular momentum transport which is produced naturally frommhd turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability. we find that theresulting stress is continuous across the marginally stable orbit, incontradiction with the widely-held assumption that the stress should go to zerothere. as a consequence, the specific angular momentum of the matter accretedinto the hole is smaller than the specific angular momentum at the marginallystable orbit. the disk exhibits large fluctuations in almost every quantity,both spatially and temporally. in particular, the ratio of stress to pressure(the local analog of the shakura-sunyaev $\alpha$ parameter) exhibits bothsystematic gradients and large fluctuations; from $\sim 10^{-2}$ in the diskmidplane at large radius, it rises to $\sim 10$ both at a few gas densityscaleheights above the plane at large radius, and near the midplane well insidethe plunging region. driven in part by large-amplitude waves excited near themarginally stable orbit, both the mass accretion rate and the integrated stressexhibit large fluctuations whose fourier power spectra are smooth "red"power-laws stretching over several orders of magnitude in timescale.

astro-ph;0012134	systematic errors in the estimation of black hole masses by  reverberation mapping	the mass of the central black hole in many active galactic nuclei has beenestimated on the basis of the assumption that the dynamics of the broademission line gas are dominated by the gravity of the black hole. the mostcommonly-employed method is to estimate a characteristic size-scale $r_*$ fromreverberation mapping experiments and combine it with a characteristic velocity$v_*$ taken from the line profiles; the inferred mass is then estimated by $r_*v_*^2/g$. we critically discuss the evidence supporting the assumption ofgravitational dynamics and find that the arguments are still inconclusive. wethen explore the range of possible systematic error if the assumption ofgravitational dynamics is granted. inclination relative to a flattened systemmay cause a systematic underestimate of the central mass by a factor $\sim(h/r)^2$, where $h/r$ is the aspect ratio of the flattening. the coupledeffects of a broad radial emissivity distribution, an unknown angular radiationpattern of line emission, and sub-optimal sampling in the reverberationexperiment can cause additional systematic errors as large as a factor of 3 ormore in either direction.

astro-ph;0105507	non-lte models and theoretical spectra of accretion disks in active  galactic nuclei. iv. effects of compton scattering and metal opacities	we extend our models of the vertical structure and emergent radiation fieldof accretion disks around supermassive black holes described in previous papersof this series. our models now include both a self-consistent treatment ofcompton scattering and the effects of continuum opacities of the most importantmetal species (c, n, o, ne, mg, si, s, ar, ca, fe, ni). with these new effectsincorporated, we compute the predicted spectrum from black holes accreting atnearly the eddington luminosity (l/l_edd = 0.3) and central masses of 10^6,10^7, and 10^8 m_sun. we also consider two values of the shakura-sunyaev alphaparameter, 0.1 and 0.01. although it has little effect when m &gt; 10^8 m_sun,comptonization grows in importance as the central mass decreases and thecentral temperature rises. it generally produces an increase in temperaturewith height in the uppermost layers of hot atmospheres. compared to models withcoherent electron scattering, comptonized models have enhanced euv/soft x-rayemission, but they also have a more sharply declining spectrum at very highfrequencies. comptonization also smears the hydrogen and the he ii lyman edges.the effects of metals on the overall spectral energy distribution are smallerthan the effects of comptonization for these parameters. compared to purehydrogen-helium models, models with metal continuum opacities have reduced fluxin the high frequency tail, except at the highest frequencies, where the fluxis very low. metal photoionization edges are not present in the overalldisk-integrated model spectra. in addition to our new grid of models, we alsopresent a simple analytic prescription for the vertical temperature structureof the disk in the presence of comptonization, and show under what conditions ahot outer layer (a corona) is formed.

astro-ph;0106343	x-ray destruction of dust along the line of sight to gamma-ray bursts	we show that if all gamma-ray bursts emit x-rays in a way similar to thoseobserved by bepposax, much of the extinction along the line of sight in thehost galaxy of the burst can be destroyed. two mechanisms are principallyresponsible for dust destruction: grain heating and grain charging. the latter,which can lead to electrostatic stresses greater than the tensile strength ofthe grains, is often the more important. grains may regularly be destroyed atdistances as large as 100 parsecs. this dust destruction can permit us to seethe uv/optical afterglow even when the burst is embedded deep within ahighly-obscured region. because the destruction rate depends on graincomposition and size, it may be possible to observe the amount andwavelength-dependence of extinction change during the course of the burst andfirst few minutes of the afterglow. it may also be possible to detectinterstellar absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum that would not existbut for the return of heavy elements to the gas phase.

astro-ph;0110118	high resolution simulations of the plunging region in a pseudo-newtonian  potential: dependence on numerical resolution and field topology	new three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion diskdynamics in a pseudo-newtonian paczynski-wiita potential are presented. thesehave finer resolution in the inner disk than any previously reported. finerresolution leads to increased magnetic field strength, greater accretion rate,and greater fluctuations in the accretion rate. one simulation begins with apurely poloidal magnetic field, the other with a purely toroidal field.compared to the poloidal initial field simulation, a purely toroidal initialfield takes longer to reach saturation of the magnetorotational instability andproduces less turbulence and weaker magnetic field energies. for both initialfield configurations, magnetic stresses continue across the marginally stableorbit; measured in units corresponding to the shakura-sunyaev alpha parameter,the stress grows from ~0.1 in the disk body to as much as ~10 deep in theplunging region. matter passing the inner boundary of the simulation has ~10%greater binding energy and ~10% smaller angular momentum than it did at themarginally stable orbit. both the mass accretion rate and the integrated stressfluctuate widely on a broad range of timescales.

0808.1893	mid-infrared spectra of optically selected type 2 quasars	type 2 quasars are luminous active galactic nuclei whose central engines areseen through large amounts of gas and dust. we present spitzer spectra oftwelve type 2 quasars selected on the basis of their optical emission lineproperties. within this sample, we find a surprising diversity of spectra, fromthose that are featureless to those showing strong pah emission, deep silicateabsorption at 10 micron, hydrocarbon absorption, high-ionization emission linesand h_2 rotational emission lines. about half of the objects in the sample arelikely compton-thick, including the two with the deepest si absorption. themedian star-formation luminosity of the objects in our sample measured from thestrength of the pah features is 5x10^11 l_sun, much higher than for fieldgalaxies or for any other agn sample, but similar to other samples of type 2quasars. this suggests an evolutionary link between obscured quasars and peakstar formation activity in the host galaxy. despite the high level of starformation, the bolometric output is dominated by the quasar in all cases. for agiven strength of 10 micron si absorption, ulirgs are significantly colder thanare type 2 quasars (their f_nu[14.5 micron]/f_nu[27.5 micron] ratio is 0.5 dexlower), perhaps reflecting different obscuration geometries in these sources.we find that the appearance of the 10 micron feature (i.e., whether it shows inemission or in absorption) is well-correlated with the optical classificationin type 1 and type 2 quasars, contrary to some models of clumpy obscuration.furthermore, this correlation is significantly stronger in quasars (l_bol&gt;10^45erg/s) than it is in seyfert galaxies (l_bol&lt;&lt;10^45 erg/s).

astro-ph;0203289	where is the inner edge of an accretion disk around a black hole?	what is meant by the "inner edge" of an accretion disk around a black holedepends on the property that defines the edge. we discuss four such definitionsusing data from recent high-resolution numerical simulations. these are: the"turbulence edge", where flux-freezing becomes more important than turbulencein determining the magnetic field structure; the "stress edge", where plungingmatter loses dynamical contact with the outer accretion flow; the "reflectionedge", the smallest radius capable of producing significant x-ray reflectionfeatures; and the "radiation edge", the innermost place from which significantluminosity emerges. all these edges are dependent on the accretion rate and arenon-axisymmetric and time-variable. although all are generally located in thevicinity of the marginally stable orbit, significant displacements can occur,and data interpretations placing the disk edge precisely at this point can bemisleading. if observations are to be used successfully as diagnostics ofaccretion in strong gravity, the models used to interpret them must takecareful account of these distinctions.

0808.3140	direct calculation of the radiative efficiency of an accretion disk  around a black hole	numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence makes itpossible to study accretion dynamics in detail. however, special effort isrequired to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentumtransport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photondiffusion). to this end we extend the flux-conservative, general relativisticmhd code harm from axisymmetry to full 3d. the use of an energy conservingalgorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretionto be captured as heat. the inclusion of a simple optically thin coolingfunction permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thicknessas well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of theradiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. fully relativisticray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers.for a disk with aspect ratio h/r ~ 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spinparameter a/m = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond thatpredicted by the classical novikov-thorne model. however, much of it occursdeep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting canstrongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. in addition, withthese parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magneticenergy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. in our model,the net luminosi ty reaching infinity is 6% greater than the novikov-thorneprediction. if the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the totalluminosity of the accretion flow would be ~20% greater than the novikov-thornevalue.

astro-ph;0501042	active galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey: ii.  emission-line luminosity function	the emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (agn) ismeasured from about 3000 agn included in the main galaxy sample of the sloandigital sky survey within a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.15$. the $\ha$ and[oiii]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for seyferts cover luminosity rangeof $10^{5-9}$$l_\odot$ in h$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken powerlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. assuming a universalconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred bband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the agn luminosityfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity functionderived from the 2df redshift survey. the inferred agn number density isapproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the totallight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. the numbersof seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at highluminosity, seyfert 1s outnumber seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. in making theluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity isindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it aposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. given the relationshipbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack ofcorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variablethat determines the agn luminosity is the eddington ratio, not the black holemass. this appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likelyto be shining near the eddington limit.

astro-ph;0510741	vertical structure of gas pressure-dominated accretion disks with local  dissipation of turbulence and radiative transport	(shortened) we calculate the vertical structure of a local patch of anaccretion disk in which heating by dissipation of mri-driven mhd turbulence isbalanced by radiative cooling. heating, radiative transport, and cooling arecomputed self-consistently with the structure by solving the equations ofradiation mhd in the shearing-box approximation. using a fully 3-d andenergy-conserving code, we compute the structure of this disk segment over aspan of more than five cooling times. after a brief relaxation period, astatistically steady-state develops. measuring height above the midplane inunits of the scale-height h predicted by a shakura-sunyaev model, we find thatthe disk atmosphere stretches upward, with the photosphere rising to about 7h,in contrast to the approximately 3h predicted by conventional analytic models.this more extended structure, as well as fluctuations in the height of thephotosphere, may lead to departures from planckian form in the emergentspectra. dissipation is distributed across the region within roughly 3h of themidplane, but is very weak at greater altitudes. because fluctuations in thedissipation are particularly strong away from the midplane, the emergentradiation flux can track dissipation fluctuations with a lag that is only0.1--0.2 times the mean cooling time of the disk. long timescale asymmetries inthe dissipation distribution can also cause significant asymmetry in the fluxemerging from the top and bottom surfaces of the disk. radiative diffusiondominates poynting flux in the vertical energy flow throughout the disk.

astro-ph;0512227	magnetically driven jets in the kerr metric	we compute a series of three-dimensional general relativisticmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in the kerr metric toinvestigate the properties of the unbound outflows that result. the overallstrength of these outflows increases sharply with increasing black holerotation rate, but a number of generic features are found in all cases. themass in the outflow is concentrated in a hollow cone whose opening angle islargely determined by the effective potential for matter orbiting with angularmomentum comparable to that of the innermost stable circular orbit. thedominant force accelerating the matter outward comes from the pressure of theaccretion disk's corona. the principal element that shapes the outflow istherefore the centrifugal barrier preventing accreting matter from coming closeto the rotation axis. inside the centrifugal barrier, the cone contains verylittle matter and is dominated by electromagnetic fields that rotate at a ratetied closely to the rotation of the black hole. these fields carry anoutward-going poynting flux whose immediate energy source is the rotatingspacetime of the kerr black hole. when the spin parameter a/m of the black holeexceeds ~0.9, the energy carried to infinity by these outflows can becomparable to the nominal radiative efficiency predicted in the novikov-thornemodel. similarly, the expelled angular momentum can be comparable to thataccreted by the black hole. both the inner electromagnetic part and the outermatter part can contribute in significant fashion to the energy and angularmomentum of the outflow.

astro-ph;0601630	hosts of type ii quasars: an hst study	type ii quasars are luminous active galactic nuclei whose centers areobscured by large amounts of gas and dust. in this contribution we present3-band hst images of nine type ii quasars with redshifts 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.4 selectedfrom the sloan digital sky survey based on their emission line properties. theintrinsic luminosities of these quasars are thought to be in the range-24&gt;m_b&gt;-26, but optical obscuration implies that host galaxies can be studiedunencumbered by bright nuclei. each object has been imaged in three filters(`red', `green' and `blue') placed between the strong emission lines. thespectacular, high quality images reveal a wealth of details about the structureof the host galaxies and their environments. most galaxies in the sample areellipticals, but strong deviations from de vaucouleurs profiles are found,especially in the blue band. we argue that most of these deviations are due tothe light from the nucleus scattered off interstellar material in the hostgalaxy. this scattered component can make a significant contribution to thebroad-band flux and complicates the analysis of the colors of the stellarpopulations in the host galaxy. this extended component can be difficult tonotice in unobscured luminous quasars and may bias the results of host galaxystudies.

astro-ph;0602317	the weak field limit of the magnetorotational instability	we investigate the behavior of the magneto-rotational instability in thelimit of extremely weak magnetic field, i.e., as the ratio of ion cyclotronfrequency to orbital frequency (x) becomes small. considered only in terms ofcold two-fluid theory, instability persists to arbitrarily small values of x,and the maximum growth rate is of order the orbital frequency except for therange m_e/m_i &lt; |x| &lt; 1, where it can be rather smaller. in this range, fieldaligned with rotation (x &gt; 0) produces slower growth than anti-aligned field (x&lt; 0). the maximum growth rate is generally achieved at smaller and smallerwavelengths as |x| diminishes. when |x| &lt; m_e/m_i, new unstable"electromagnetic-rotational" modes appear that do not depend on the equilibriummagnetic field. because the most rapidly-growing modes have extremely shortwavelengths when |x| is small, they are often subject to viscous or resistivedamping, which can result in suppressing all but the longest wavelengths, forwhich growth is much slower. we find that this sort of damping is likely tocurtail severely the frequently-invoked mechanism for cosmological magneticfield growth in which a magnetic field seeded by the biermann battery is thenamplified by the magneto-rotational instability. on the other hand, the small|x| case may introduce interesting effects in weakly-ionized disks in whichdust grains carry most of the electric charge.

astro-ph;0603625	type ii quasars from the sloan digital sky survey: v. imaging host  galaxies with the hubble space telescope	type ii quasars are luminous active galactic nuclei whose centers areobscured by large amounts of gas and dust. in this paper we present 3-band hstimages of nine type ii quasars with redshifts 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.4 selected from thesloan digital sky survey based on their emission line properties. the intrinsicluminosities of these agn are estimated to be -24 &gt; m_b &gt; -26, but opticalobscuration allows their host galaxies to be studied unencumbered by brightnuclei. each object has been imaged in three continuum filters (`uv', `blue'and `yellow') placed between the strong emission lines. the spectacular, highquality images reveal a wealth of details about the structure of the hostgalaxies and their environments. six of the nine galaxies in the sample areellipticals with de vaucouleurs light profiles, one object has a well-defineddisk component and the remaining two have marginal disks. stellar populationsof type ii quasar hosts are more luminous (by a median of 0.3-0.7 mag,depending on the wavelength) and bluer (by about 0.4 mag) than are m* galaxiesat the same redshift. when smooth fits to stellar light are subtracted from theimages, we find both positive and negative residuals that become more prominenttoward shorter wavelengths. we argue that the negative residuals are due tokpc-scale dust obscuration, while most positive residuals are due to the lightfrom the nucleus scattered off interstellar material in the host galaxy.scattered light makes a significant contribution to the broad band continuumemission and can be the dominant component of the extended emission in the uvin extreme cases.

astro-ph;0605295	estimating the radiative efficiency of magnetized accretion disks around  black holes	simulations of black hole accretion have shown that magnetic stresses arepresent near and inside the innermost stable circular orbit (isco). thisfinding suggests that such flows may be more luminous than predicted by thestandard accretion disk model. here we apply a prescription for heatdissipation within the simulated accretion flows to estimate their impliedradiative efficiency. we assume that dissipation is proportional to the currentdensity squared, and find that the resulting azimuthally-averaged andshell-integrated radial profile is well-matched to the radial heat dissipationprofile of the standard disk model for the region outside the isco,particularly when it is adjusted to account for additional stress at the isco.in contrast to the standard model, however, the dissipation profile derivedfrom the current density continues past the isco and through the plungingregion. the total predicted dissipation rate is between $\simeq 30%$ and$\simeq 100%$ greater than that predicted by the standard model, depending onthe black hole spin. most of the additional dissipation takes place justoutside the isco. to predict luminosities, we assume instantaneous radiationand zero optical depth, but allow for photon capture. the net radiativeefficiency seen by a distant observer is increased relative to the standardmodel by $\simeq 25%$--80%, with the largest fractional increase forintermediate black hole spins because the increase in dissipation from enhancedstress that occurs for rapid spin is partially offset by the increasedlikelihood that the additional photons will be captured by the hole.

astro-ph;0606615	light curves from an mhd simulation of a black hole accretion disk	we use a relativistic ray-tracing code to calculate the light curves observedfrom a global general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of anaccretion flow onto a schwarzschild black hole. we apply three basic emissionmodels to sample different properties of the time-dependent accretion disk.with one of these models, which assumes thermal blackbody emission andfree-free absorption, we can predict qualitative features of the high-frequencypower spectrum from stellar-mass black holes in the "thermal dominant" state.the simulated power spectrum is characterized by a power law of index gamma ~ 3and total rms fractional variance of &lt;~ 2% above 10 hz. for each emissionmodel, we find that the variability amplitude should increase with increasinginclination angle. on the basis of a newly-developed formalism for quantifyingthe significance of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in simulation data, wefind that these simulations are able to identify any such features with(rms/mean) amplitudes &gt;~ 1 % near the orbital frequency at the inner-moststable orbit. initial results indicate the existence of transient qpo peakswith frequency ratios of nearly 2:3 at a 99.9% confidence limit, but they arenot generic features because at any given time they are seen only from certainobserver directions. additionally, we present detailed analysis of theazimuthal structure of the accretion disk and the evolution of densityperturbations in the inner disk. these "hot spot" structures appear to beroughly self-similar over a range of disk radii, with a single characteristicsize \delta\phi=25 deg and \delta r/r=0.3, and typical lifetimes t_l ~ 0.3t_orb.

0809.1708	radiation-dominated disks are thermally stable	when the accretion rate is more than a small fraction of eddington, the innerregions of accretion disks around black holes are expected to beradiation-dominated. however, in the alpha-model, these regions are alsoexpected to be thermally unstable. in this paper, we report two 3-d radiationmhd simulations of a vertically-stratified shearing box in which the ratio ofradiation to gas pressure is ~ 10, and yet no thermal runaway occurs over atimespan ~ 40 cooling times. where the time-averaged dissipation rate isgreater than the critical dissipation rate that creates hydrostatic equilibriumby diffusive radiation flux, the time-averaged radiation flux is held to thecritical value, with the excess dissipated energy transported by radiativeadvection. although the stress and total pressure are well-correlated aspredicted by the alpha-model, we show that stress fluctuations precede pressurefluctuations, contrary to the usual supposition that the pressure controls thesaturation level of the magnetic energy. this fact explains the thermalstability. using a simple toy-model, we show that independently-generatedmagnetic fluctuations can drive radiation pressure fluctuations, creating acorrelation between the two while maintaining thermal stability.

astro-ph;9501089	observable properties of x-ray heated winds in agn: warm reflectors and  warm absorbers	when an agn is obscured, the warm reflecting gas nearby can be seen by acombination of bremsstrahlung, intrinsic line emission, and reflection of thenuclear continuum, both by electron scattering and by resonance linescattering. resonance lines, due both to intrinsic emission and scattering, areparticularly prominent in the soft x-ray band.  when our line of sight to the nucleus is not obscured, the dominant effect isabsorption. in the soft x-ray band, ionization edges of highly ionized speciesand resonance lines contribute comparably to the opacity; in the ultraviolet,the gas is almost transparent except for a small number of resonance lines. weidentify the "warm absorbers" seen in many agn x-ray spectra with this gas, butargue that most of the uv absorption lines seen must be due to a small amountof more weakly ionized gas which is embedded in the main body of the warm,reflecting gas. because the ionization equilibration timescales of some ionsmay be as long as the variability timescales in agn, the ionic abundancesindicated by the transmission spectra may not be well-described by ionizationequilibrium.

astro-ph;9501093	the inverse compton thermostat in hot plasmas near accreting black holes	the hard x-ray spectra of accreting black holes systems are generallywell-fit by thermal comptonization models with temperatures $\sim 100$ kev. wedemonstrate why, over many orders of magnitude in heating rate and seed photonsupply, hot plasmas radiate primarily by inverse compton scattering, and findequilibrium temperatures within a factor of a few of 100 kev. we also determinequantitatively the (wide) bounds on heating rate and seed photon supply forwhich this statement is true.  plasmas in thermal balance in this regime obey two simple scaling laws, onerelating the product of temperature and optical depth to the ratio of seedphoton luminosity to plasma heating rate $l_s/l_h$, the other relating thespectral index of the output power-law to $l_s/l_h$. because $\alpha$ is almostindependent of everything but $l_s/l_h$, the observed power law index may beused to estimate $l_s/l_h$. in both agn and stellar black holes, the mean valueestimated this way is $l_s/l_h \sim 0.1$. as a corollary, $\theta \tau_t$ mustbe $\simeq 0.1$ -- 0.2, depending on plasma geometry.

astro-ph;9709215	the vertical structure and ultraviolet spectrum of accretion disks  heated by internal dissipation in active galactic nuclei	we present an improved calculation of the vertical structure and ultravioletspectrum of a dissipative accretion disk in an agn. we calculate model spectrain which the viscous stress is proportional to the total pressure, the gaspressure only and the geometric mean of the radiation and gas pressures (cf.laor &amp; netzer 1989: ln89). as a result of a more complete treatment ofabsorptive opacity, we find greater overall spectral curvature than did ln89,as well as larger amplitudes in both the lyman and heii photoionization edges.the local black body approximation is not a good description of the near uvspectrum. with relativistic corrections (appropriate to non-rotating blackholes) included, we find that the near uv spectrum hardens with increasingm-dot / m_8 (m-dot is the accretion rate in eddington units, m_8 the black holemass in units of 10^8 m_sun). the near uv spectrum is consistent withobservations if m-dot/ m_8 \sim 10^{-3}, but disks this cold would have large,and unobserved, absorption features at the lyman edge. the edge amplitude isreduced when m-dot/m_8 is larger, but then the near-uv slope is too hard tomatch observations. we conclude that models in which conventional disks orbitnon-rotating black holes do not adequately explain uv continuum production inagn.
