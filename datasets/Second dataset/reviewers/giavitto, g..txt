1007.3359	magic upper limits for two milagro-detected, bright fermi sources in the  region of snr g65.1+0.6	we report on the observation of the region around supernova remnant g65.1+0.6with the stand-alone magic-i telescope. this region hosts the two bright gevgamma-ray sources 1fgl j1954.3+2836 and 1fgl j1958.6+2845. they are identifiedas gev pulsars and both have a possible counterpart detected at about 35 tev bythe milagro observatory. magic collected 25.5 hours of good quality data, andfound no significant emission in the range around 1 tev. we therefore reportdifferential flux upper limits, assuming the emission to be point-like (&lt;0.1deg) or within a radius of 0.3 deg. in the point-like scenario, the flux limitsaround 1 tev are at the level of 3 % and 2 % of the crab nebula flux, for thetwo sources respectively. this implies that the milagro emission is eitherextended over a much larger area than our point spread function, or it must bepeaked at energies beyond 1 tev, resulting in a photon index harder than 2.2 inthe tev band.

1009.2155	detection of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the perseus  cluster head-tail galaxy ic 310 by the magic telescopes	we report on the detection with the magic telescopes of very high energygamma-rays from ic 310, a head-tail radio galaxy in the perseus galaxy cluster,observed during the interval november 2008 to february 2010. the fermisatellite has also detected this galaxy. the source is detected by magic at ahigh statistical significance of 7.6sigma in 20.6 hr of stereo data. theobserved spectral energy distribution is flat with a differential spectralindex of -2.00 \pm 0.14. the mean flux above 300 gev, between october 2009 andfebruary 2010, (3.1 \pm 0.5)x10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponds to (2.5 \pm0.4)% of crab nebula units. only an upper limit, of 1.9% of crab nebula unitsabove 300 gev, was obtained with the 2008 data. this, together with stronghints (&gt;3sigma) of flares in the middle of october and november 2009, impliesthat the emission is variable. the magic results favour a scenario with thevery high energy emission originating from the inner jet close to the centralengine. more complicated models than a simple one-zone ssc scenario, e.g.multi-zone ssc, external compton or hadronic, may be required to explain thevery flat spectrum and its extension over more than three orders of magnitudein energy.

1012.2200	spectral energy distribution of markarian 501: quiescent state vs.  extreme outburst	the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) blazar markarian 501 has awell-studied history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellentlaboratory for studying the physical processes within the jets of activegalactic nuclei. however, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies ofmarkarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity. ashort-term multiwavelength study of markarian 501 was coordinated in march2009, focusing around a multi-day observation with the suzaku x-ray satelliteand including {\gamma}-ray data from veritas, magic, and the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with the goal of providing a well-sampled multiwavelengthbaseline measurement of markarian 501 in the quiescent state. the results ofthese quiescent-state observations are compared to the historically extremeoutburst of april 16, 1997, with the goal of examining variability of thespectral energy distribution between the two states. the derived broadbandspectral energy distribution shows the characteristic double-peaked profile. wefind that the x-ray peak shifts by over two orders of magnitude in photonenergy between the two flux states while the vhe peak varies little. thelimited shift in the vhe peak can be explained by the transition to theklein-nishina regime. synchrotron self-compton models are matched to the dataand the implied klein-nishina effects are explored.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1310.6956	hess j1818-154, a new composite supernova remnant discovered in tev  gamma rays and x-rays	composite supernova remnants (snrs) constitute a small subclass of theremnants of massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observedfrom both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula(pwn) located inside of the snr. these systems represent a unique evolutionaryphase of snrs where observations in the radio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray regimesallow the study of the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. in thisarticle, we report results from observations of the shell-type snr g15.4+0.1performed with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) and xmm-newton. acompact tev $\gamma$-ray source, hessj1818-154, located in the center andcontained within the shell of g15.4+0.1 is detected by h.e.s.s. and featurs aspectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of $-2.3\pm 0.3_{stat} \pm 0.2_{sys}$ and an integral flux off$(&gt;$0.42$\,\mathrm{tev}$)=($0.9 \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm0.2_{\mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. furthermore, a recentobservation with xmm-newton reveals extended x-ray emission strongly peaked inthe center of g15.4+0.1. the x-ray source shows indications of anenergy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 kevand more extended emission that fills the entire region within the snr at lowerenergies. together, the x-ray and vhe $\gamma$-ray emission provide strongevidence of a pwn located inside the shell of g15.4+0.1, and this snr cantherefore be classified as a \emph{composite} based on these observations. theradio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn is compatible with aone-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside theemission region. an unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which isthought to power the pwn, has been detected neither in radio nor in x-rayobservations of g15.4+0.1.

1409.0253	long-term monitoring of pks 2155$-$304 with atom and h.e.s.s.:  investigation of optical/$\gamma$-ray correlations in different spectral  states	in this paper we report on the analysis of all the available optical and veryhigh-energy $\gamma$-ray ($&gt;$200 gev) data for the bl lac object pks2155$-$304, collected simultaneously with the atom and h.e.s.s. telescopes from2007 until 2009. this study also includes x-ray (rxte, swift) and high-energy$\gamma$-ray (fermi-lat) data. during the period analysed, the source wastransitioning from its flaring to quiescent optical states,and wascharacterized by only moderate flux changes at different wavelengths on thetimescales of days and months. a flattening of the optical continuum with anincreasing optical flux can be noted in the collected dataset, but onlyoccasionally and only at higher flux levels. we did not find any universalrelation between the very high-energy $\gamma$-ray and optical flux changes onthe timescales from days and weeks up to several years. on the other hand, wenoted that at higher flux levels the source can follow two distinct tracks inthe optical flux-colour diagrams, which seem to be related to distinct$\gamma$-ray states of the blazar. the obtained results therefore indicate acomplex scaling between the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission of pks2155$-$304, with different correlation patterns holding at different epochs,and a $\gamma$-ray flux depending on the combination of an optical flux andcolour rather than a flux alone.

1409.6073	the major upgrade of the magic telescopes, part i: the hardware  improvements and the commissioning of the system	the magic telescopes are two imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts)located on the canary island of la palma. the telescopes are designed tomeasure cherenkov light from air showers initiated by gamma rays in the energyregime from around 50 gev to more than 50 tev. the two telescopes were built in2004 and 2009, respectively, with different cameras, triggers and readoutsystems. in the years 2011-2012 the magic collaboration undertook a majorupgrade to make the stereoscopic system uniform, improving its overallperformance and easing its maintenance. in particular, the camera, thereceivers and the trigger of the first telescope were replaced and the readoutof the two telescopes was upgraded. this paper (part i) describes the detailsof the upgrade as well as the basic performance parameters of magic such as rawdata treatment, dead time of the system, linearity in the electronic chain andsources of noise. in part ii, we describe the physics performance of theupgraded system.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1411.0572	discovery of the vhe gamma-ray source hess j1832-093 in the vicinity of  snr g22.7-0.2	the region around the supernova remnant (snr) w41 contains several tevsources and has prompted the h.e.s.s. collaboration to perform deepobservations of this field of view. this resulted in the discovery of the newvery high energy (vhe) source hess j1832-093, at the position $\rm ra=18^h 32^m50^s \pm 3^s_{stat} \pm 2^s_{syst}, \rm dec=-9^\circ 22' 36'' \pm 32''_{stat}\pm 20''_{syst} (j2000)$, spatially coincident with a part of the radio shellof the neighboring remnant g22.7-0.2. the photon spectrum is well described bya power-law of index $\gamma = 2.6 \pm 0.3_{\rm stat} \pm 0.1_{\rm syst}$ and anormalization at 1 tev of $\phi_0=(4.8 \pm 0.8_{\rm stat}\pm 1.0_{\rmsyst})\,\times\,10^{-13}\,\rm{cm} ^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,tev^{-1}$. the location of thegamma-ray emission on the edge of the snr rim first suggested a signature ofescaping cosmic-rays illuminating a nearby molecular cloud. then a dedicatedxmm-newton observation led to the discovery of a new x-ray point sourcespatially coincident with the tev excess. two other scenarios were henceproposed to identify the nature of hess j1832-093. gamma-rays from inversecompton radiation in the framework of a pulsar wind nebula scenario or thepossibility of gamma-ray production within a binary system are therefore alsoconsidered. deeper multi-wavelength observations will help to shed new light onthis intriguing vhe source.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

1412.2251	h.e.s.s. detection of tev emission from the interaction region between  the supernova remnant g349.7+0.2 and a molecular cloud	g349.7+0.2 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr) located at thedistance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrumfrom radio to high energy (he) gamma-rays. radio and infrared observationsindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. in this paper,the detection of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission coincident with thissnr with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is reported. anintegral flux f(e&gt;400gev)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/scorresponding to 0.7% of that of the crab nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index gamma_vhe = 2.8+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. the analysis of more than 5 yr of fermi-latdata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photonindex gamma_he = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. the combined gamma-ray spectrumof g349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (bpl) or apower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (plc). in the formercase, the photon break energy is found at e_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 gev, slightlyhigher than what is usually observed in the he/vhe gamma-ray emittingmiddle-aged snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. in the lattercase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measuredat e_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) tev. a pion-decayprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nucleiwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explainthe gamma-ray emission. the bpl with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the plcprovide equally good fits to the data. the product of the average gas densityand the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nh wp~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

1412.6997	h.e.s.s. reveals a lack of tev emission from the supernova remnant  puppis a	puppis a is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant (snr) that showsstrong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud.it has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (he,0.1-100 gev) gamma-rays. an analysis of the fermi-lat data has shown anextended he gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 gev spectrum exhibiting nosignificant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the gev-emitting snrsknown to be interacting with molecular clouds. this makes it a promising targetfor imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) to probe the gamma-rayemission above 100 gev. very-high-energy (vhe, e &gt;= 0.1 tev) gamma-ray emissionfrom puppis a is for the first time searched for with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the analysis of the h.e.s.s. data does notreveal any significant emission towards puppis a. the derived upper limits onthe differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum mustexhibit a spectral break or cutoff. by combining fermi-lat and h.e.s.s.measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are foundto be 450 and 280 gev, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and asub-exponential cutoff, respectively. it is concluded that none of the standardlimitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle accelerationmechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of vhesignal. the scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago isconsidered as an alternative explanation. the he/vhe spectrum of puppis a couldthen exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several otherinteracting snrs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interactionwith dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.

1501.05087	the 2012 flare of pg 1553+113 seen with h.e.s.s. and fermi-lat	very high energy (vhe, $e&gt;$100 gev) $\gamma$-ray flaring activity of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object \pg\ has been detected by the \hess\telescopes. the flux of the source increased by a factor of 3 during the nightsof 2012 april 26 and 27 with respect to the archival measurements with hint ofintra-night variability. no counterpart of this event has been detected in the\fla\ data. this pattern is consistent with vhe $\gamma$ ray flaring beingcaused by the injection of ultrarelativistic particles, emitting $\gamma$ raysat the highest energies. the dataset offers a unique opportunity to constrainthe redshift of this source at \bestz\ using a novel method based on bayesianstatistics. the indication of intra-night variability is used to introduce anovel method to probe for a possible lorentz invariance violation (liv), and toset limits on the energy scale at which quantum gravity (qg) effects causingliv may arise. for the subluminal case, the derived limits are $\textrm{e}_{\rmqg,1}&gt;4.10\times 10^{17}$ gev and $\textrm{e}_{\rm qg,2}&gt;2.10\times 10^{10}$gev for linear and quadratic liv effects, respectively.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1509.01232	a major electronics upgrade for the h.e.s.s. cherenkov telescopes 1-4	the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is an array of imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) located in the khomas highland innamibia. it consists of four 12-m telescopes (ct1-4), which started operationsin 2003, and a 28-m diameter one (ct5), which was brought online in 2012. it isthe only iact system featuring telescopes of different sizes, which providessensitivity for gamma rays across a very wide energy range, from ~30 gev up to~100 tev. since the camera electronics of ct1-4 are much older than the one ofct5, an upgrade is being carried out; first deployment was in 2015, fulloperation is planned for 2016. the goals of this upgrade are threefold:reducing the dead time of the cameras, improving the overall performance of thearray and reducing the system failure rate related to aging. upon completion,the upgrade will assure the continuous operation of h.e.s.s. at its fullsensitivity until and possibly beyond the advent of cta. in the design of thenew components, several cta concepts and technologies were used and are thusbeing evaluated in the field: the upgraded read-out electronics is based on thenectar readout chips; the new camera front- and back-end control subsystems arebased on an fpga and an embedded arm computer; the communication betweensubsystems is based on standard ethernet technologies. these hardware solutionsoffer good performance, robustness and flexibility. the design of the newcameras is reported here.
