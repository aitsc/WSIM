0706.2919	the statistics of lcdm halo concentrations	we use the millennium simulation (ms) to study the statistics of lcdm haloconcentrations at z = 0. our results confirm that the average haloconcentration declines monotonically with mass; a power-law fits well theconcentration-mass relation for over 3 decades in mass, up to the most massiveobjects to form in a lcdm universe (~ 10^15 h^-1 msol). this is in cleardisagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by bullock et al. forthese rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of navarro,frenk, &amp; white. the large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedentednumerical resolution of the ms, allow us to estimate with confidence thedistribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems withunusual properties. about one in a hundred cluster haloes (m200 &gt;~ 3x10^14 h^-1msol) have concentrations exceeding c200 = 7.5, a result that may be used tointerpret the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, suchas abell 1689, in the lcdm cosmogony. a similar fraction (1 in 100) ofgalaxy-sized haloes (m200 ~ 10^12 h^-1 msol) have c200 &lt; 4.5, an importantconstraint on models that attempt to reconcile the rotation curves of lowsurface-brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly lowconcentration. we find that halo concentrations are independent of spin oncehaloes manifestly out of equilibrium are removed from the sample. compared totheir relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend tobe lower and to have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher...(continue)

0905.1696	how common is the milky way - satellite system alignment?	the highly flattened distribution of satellite galaxies in the milky waypresents a number of puzzles. firstly, its polar alignment stands out from theplanar alignments commonly found in other galaxies. secondly, recent propermotion measurements reveal that the orbital angular momentum of at least 3, andpossibly as many as 8, of the milky ways satellites point (within 30 degrees)along the axis of their flattened configuration, suggesting some form ofcoherent motion. in this paper we use a high resolution cosmological simulationto investigate whether this pattern conflicts with the expectations of the colddark matter model of structure formation. we find that this seemingly unlikelyset up occurs often: approximately 35% of the time we find systems in which theangular momentum of 3 individual satellites point along, or close to, the shortaxis of the satellite distribution. in addition, in 30% of the systems we findthat the net angular momentum of the 6 best aligned satellites lies within 35degrees of the short axis of the satellite distribution, as observed for themilky way.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

1003.0974	full-sky map of the isw and rees-sciama effect from gpc simulations	we present a new method for constructing maps of the secondary temperaturefluctuations imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation byphotons propagating through the evolving cosmic gravitational potential. largecosmological n-body simulations are used to calculate the complete non-linearevolution of the peculiar gravitational potential. tracing light rays backthrough the past lightcone of a chosen observer accurately captures thetemperature perturbations generated by linear (the integrated sachs-wolfe orisw effect) and non-linear (the rees-sciama or rs effect) evolution. theseeffects give rise to three kinds of non-linear features in the temperaturemaps. (a) in overdense regions, converging flows of matter induce cold spots oforder 100 mpc in extent which can dominate over the isw effect at highredshift, and are surrounded by hot rings. (b) in underdense regions, the rseffect enhances isw cold spots which can be surrounded by weak hot rings. (c)transverse motions of large lumps of matter produce characteristic dipolefeatures, consisting of adjacent hot and cold spots separated by a few tens ofmegaparsecs. these non-linear features are not easily detectable; they modulatethe isw sky maps at about the 10 percent level. the rs effect causes theangular power spectrum to deviate from linear theory at l~50 and generatesnon-gaussianity, skewing the one-point distribution function to negativevalues. cold spots of similar angular size, but much smaller amplitude than thecmb cold spot reported by cruz et al. are produced. joint analysis of our mapsand the corresponding galaxy distribution may enable techniques to be developedto detect these non-linear, non-gaussian features. our maps are available athttp://astro.dur.ac.uk/~cai/isw

0708.1517	the galaxy power spectrum: precision cosmology from large scale  structure?	published galaxy power spectra from the 2dfgrs and sdss are not in goodagreement. we revisit this issue by analyzing both the 2dfgrs and sdss dr5catalogues using essentially identical techniques. we confirm that the 2dfgrsexhibits relatively more large scale power than the sdss, or, equivalently,sdss has more small scale power. we demonstrate that this difference is due tothe r-band selected sdss catalogue being dominated by more strongly clusteredred galaxies, which have a stronger scale dependent bias. the power spectra ofgalaxies of the same rest frame colours from the two surveys match well. if notaccounted for, the difference between the sdss and 2dfgrs power spectra causesa bias in the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters which is largerthan the uncertainty with which they are determined. we also found that thecorrection developed by cole et al.(2005) to model the distortion in the shapeof the power spectrum due to non-linear evolution and scale dependent bias isnot able to reconcile the constraints obtained from the 2dfgrs and sdss powerspectra. intriguingly, the model is able to describe the differences betweenthe 2dfgrs and the much more strongly clustered lrg sample, which exhibitsgreater nonlinearities. this shows that more work is needed to understand therelation between the galaxy power spectrum and the linear perturbation theoryprediction for the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. it is thereforeimportant to accurately model these effects to get precise estimates ofcosmological parameters from these power spectra and from future galaxy surveyslike pan-starrs, or the dark energy survey, which will use selection criteriasimilar to the one of sdss.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1103.2767	fast generation of ensembles of cosmological n-body simulations via  mode-resampling	we present an algorithm for quickly generating multiple realizations ofn-body simulations to be used, for example, for cosmological parameterestimation from surveys of large-scale structure. our algorithm uses a newmethod to resample the large-scale (gaussian-distributed) fourier modes in aperiodic n-body simulation box in a manner that properly accounts for thenonlinear mode-coupling between large and small scales. we find that our methodfor adding new large-scale mode realizations recovers the nonlinear powerspectrum to sub-percent accuracy on scales larger than about half the nyquistfrequency of the simulation box. using 20 n-body simulations, we obtain a powerspectrum covariance matrix estimate that matches the estimator in takahashi etal. (2009) (from 5000 simulations) with &lt; 20% errors in all matrix elements.comparing the rates of convergence, we determine that our algorithm requires ~8 times fewer simulations to achieve a given error tolerance in estimates ofthe power spectrum covariance matrix. the degree of success of our algorithmindicates that we understand the main physical processes that give rise to thecorrelations in the matter power spectrum. namely, the large-scale fouriermodes modulate both the degree of structure growth through the variation in theeffective local matter density and also the spatial frequency of small-scaleperturbations through large-scale displacements. we expect our algorithm to beuseful for noise modeling when constraining cosmological parameters from weaklensing (cosmic shear) and galaxy surveys, rescaling summary statistics ofn-body simulations for new cosmological parameter values, and any applicationswhere the influence of fourier modes larger than the simulation size must beaccounted for.

1104.0009	maximum likelihood random galaxy catalogues and luminosity function  estimation	we present a new algorithm to generate a random (unclustered) version of anmagnitude limited observational galaxy redshift catalogue. it takes intoaccount both galaxy evolution and the perturbing effects of large scalestructure. the key to the algorithm is a maximum likelihood (ml) method forjointly estimating both the luminosity function (lf) and the overdensity as afunction of redshift. the random catalogue algorithm then works by cloning eachgalaxy in the original catalogue, with the number of clones determined by theml solution. each of these cloned galaxies is then assigned a random redshiftuniformly distributed over the accessible survey volume, taking account of thesurvey magnitude limit(s) and, optionally, both luminosity and number densityevolution. the resulting random catalogues, which can be employed intraditional estimates of galaxy clustering, make fuller use of the informationavailable in the original catalogue and hence are superior to simply fitting afunctional form to the observed redshift distribution. they are particularlywell suited to studies of the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxyproperties as each galaxy in the random catalogue has the same list ofattributes as measured for the galaxies in the genuine catalogue. thederivation of the joint overdensity and lf estimator reveals the limit in whichthe ml estimate reduces to the standard 1/vmax lf estimate, namely when onemakes the prior assumption that the are no fluctuations in the radialoverdensity. the new ml estimator can be viewed as a generalization of the1/vmax estimate in which vmax is replaced by a density corrected vdc,max.

0709.3470	constraints on sigma_8 from galaxy clustering in n-body simulations and  semi-analytic models	we generate mock galaxy catalogues for a grid of different cosmologies, usingrescaled n-body simulations in tandem with a semi-analytic model run usingconsistent parameters. because we predict the galaxy bias, rather than fittingit as a nuisance parameter, we obtain an almost pure constraint on sigma_8 bycomparing the projected two-point correlation function we obtain to that fromthe sdss. a systematic error arises because different semi-analytic modellingassumptions allow us to fit the r-band luminosity function equally well.combining our estimate of the error from this source with the statisticalerror, we find sigma_8=0.97 +/- 0.06. we obtain consistent results if we usegalaxy samples with a different magnitude threshold, or if we select galaxiesby b_j-band rather than r-band luminosity and compare to data from the 2dfgrs.our estimate for sigma_8 is higher than that obtained for other analyses ofgalaxy data alone, and we attempt to find the source of this difference. wenote that in any case, galaxy clustering data provide a very stringentconstraint on galaxy formation models.

1111.5616	the shapes and alignments of dark matter halos	we present measurements of the triaxial dark matter halo shapes and alignmentcorrelation functions in the millennium and millennium-2 dark matter n-bodysimulations. these two simulations allow us to measure the distributions ofhalo shapes down to 10% of the virial radius over a halo mass range of 6e9 -2e14 m_sun/h. we largely confirm previous results on the distributions of haloaxis ratios as a function of halo mass, but we find that the median anglebetween halo major axes at different halo radii can vary by a factor of 2between the millennium-1 and 2 simulations because of the different massresolution. thus, error in the shape determinations from limited resolution ispotentially degenerate with the misalignment of halo inner and outer shapesused to constrain brightest cluster galaxy alignments in previous works. wealso present simplifying parameterizations for the 3-d halo-mass alignmentcorrelation functions that are necessary ingredients for triaxial halo modelsof large-scale structure and models of galaxy intrinsic alignments ascontaminants for cosmic shear surveys. we measure strong alignments betweenhalos of all masses and the surrounding dark matter overdensities out toseveral tens of mpc/h, in agreement with observed shear-galaxy and clustershape correlations. we use these measurements to forecast the contribution tothe weak lensing signal around galaxy clusters from correlated mass along theline-of-sight. for prolate clusters with major axes aligned with theline-of-sight the fraction of the weak lensing signal from mass external to thecluster can be twice that predicted if the excess halo alignment correlation isassumed to be zero.

1201.1296	satellite galaxy number density profiles in the sloan digital sky survey	we study the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies around isolatedprimaries using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic andphotometric galaxy catalogues. we select isolated primaries from thespectroscopic sample and search for potential satellites in the much deeperphotometric sample. for specific luminosity primaries we obtain robuststatistical results by stacking as many as ~50, 000 galaxy systems. we find noevidence for any anistropy in the satellite galaxy distribution relative to themajor axes of the primaries. we derive accurate projected number densityprofiles of satellites down to 4 magnitudes fainter than their primaries. wefind the normalized satellite profiles generally have a universal form and canbe well fitted by projected nfw profiles. the nfw concentration parameterincreases with decreasing satellite luminosity while being independent of theluminosity of the primary except for very bright primaries. the profiles of thefaintest satellites show deviations from the nfw form with an excess at smallgalactocentric projected distances. in addition, we quantify how the radialdistribution of satellites depends on the colour of the satellites and on thecolour and concentration of their primaries.

0711.0746	the redshift dependence of the structure of massive lcdm halos	(abridged) we use two very large cosmological simulations to study how thedensity profiles of relaxed lcdm dark halos depend on redshift and on halomass. we confirm that these profiles deviate slightly but systematically fromthe nfw form and are better approximated by the empirical formula, $d\log\rho/d\log r \propto r^{\alpha}$, first used by einasto to fit star counts inthe milky way. the best-fit value of the additional shape parameter, $\alpha$,increases gradually with mass, from alpha ~ 0.16 for present-day galaxy halosto alpha~ 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. halo concentrationsdepend only weakly on mass at z=0, and this dependence weakens further atearlier times. at z ~3 the average concentration of relaxed halos does not varyappreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations (m &gt;=3e11msun).furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the mostmassive}, relaxed halos is constant at c200 ~3.5 to 4 for 0&lt;=z&lt;= 3. theseresults have important implications for currently planned surveys of distantclusters.

1209.3018	dark matter halo merger histories beyond cold dark matter: i - methods  and application to warm dark matter	we describe a methodology to accurately compute halo mass functions,progenitor mass functions, merger rates and merger trees in non-cold darkmatter universes using a self-consistent treatment of the generalized extendedpress-schechter formalism. our approach permits rapid exploration of thesubhalo population of galactic halos in dark matter models with a variety ofdifferent particle properties or universes with rolling, truncated, or morecomplicated power spectra. we make detailed comparisons of analytically derivedmass functions and merger histories with recent warm dark matter cosmologicaln-body simulations, and find excellent agreement. we show that, once theaccretion of smoothly distributed matter is accounted for, coarse-grainedstatistics such as the mass accretion history of halos can be almostindistinguishable between cold and warm dark matter cases. however, the halomass function and progenitor mass functions differ significantly, with the warmdark matter cases being strongly suppressed below the free-streaming scale ofthe dark matter. we demonstrate the importance of using the correct solutionfor the excursion set barrier first-crossing distribution in warm dark matter -if the solution for a flat barrier is used instead the truncation of the halomass function is much slower, leading to an overestimate of the number of lowmass halos.

1310.6366	pan-starrs1: galaxy clustering in the small area survey 2	the pan-starrs1 survey is currently obtaining imaging in 5 bands (grizy) forthe $3\pi$ steradian survey, one of the largest optical surveys ever conducted.the finished survey will have spatially varying depth, due to the surveystrategy. this paper presents a method to correct galaxy number counts andgalaxy clustering for this potential systematic based on a simplified signal tonoise measurement. a star and galaxy separation method calibrated usingrealistic synthetic images is also presented, along with an approach to maskbright stars. by using our techniques on a ~69 sq. degree region of scienceverification data this paper shows ps1 measurements of the two point angularcorrelation function as a function of apparent magnitude agree withmeasurements from deeper, smaller surveys. clustering measurements appearreliable down to a magnitude limit of rps&lt;22.5. additionally, stellarcontamination and false detection issues are discussed and quantified. thiswork is the second of two papers which pave the way for the exploitation of thefull $3\pi$ survey for studies of large scale structure.

1310.6986	the integrated sachs-wolfe effect in $f(r)$ gravity	we study the late-time integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect in $f(r)$ gravityusing n-body simulations. in the $f(r)$ model under study, the linear growthrate is larger than that in general relativity (gr). this slows down the decayof the cosmic potential and induces a smaller isw effect on large scales.therefore, the $\dot\phi$ (time derivative of the potential) power spectrum at$k&lt;0.1h$/mpc is suppressed relative to that in gr. in the non-linear regime,relatively rapid structure formation in $f(r)$ gravity boosts the non-linearisw effect relative to gr, and the $\dot\phi$ power spectrum at $k&gt;0.1h$/mpc isincreased (100$\%$ greater on small scales at $z=0$). we explore thedetectability of the isw signal via stacking supercluster and supervoids. thedifferences in the corresponding isw cold or hot spots are $\sim 20\%$ forstructures of $\sim 100$mpc/$h$. such differences are greater for smallerstructures, but the amplitude of the signal is lower. the high amplitude of iswsignal detected by granett et al. can not explained in the $f(r)$ model. wefind relatively big differences between $f(r)$ and gr in the transverse bulkmotion of matter, and discuss its detectability via the relative frequencyshifts of photons from multiple lensed images.

1310.7739	constraining the wdm particle mass with milky way satellites	well-motivated particle physics theories predict the existence of particles(such as sterile neutrinos) which acquire non-negligible thermal velocities inthe early universe. these particles could behave as warm dark matter (wdm) andgenerate a small-scale cutoff in the linear density power spectrum which scalesapproximately inversely with the particle mass. if this mass is of order a kev,the cutoff occurs on the scale of dwarf galaxies. thus, in wdm models theabundance of small galaxies, such as the satellites that orbit in the halo ofthe milky way, depends on the mass of the warm particle. the abundance alsoscales with the mass of the host galactic halo. we use the \galformsemi-analytic model of galaxy formation to calculate the properties of galaxiesin universes in which the dark matter is warm. using this method, we cancompare the predicted satellite luminosity functions to the observed data forthe milky way dwarf spheroidals, and determine a lower bound on the thermallyproduced wdm particle mass. this depends strongly on the value of the milky wayhalo mass and, to some extent, on the baryonic physics assumed; we examine bothof these dependencies. for our fiducial model we find that for a particle massof 3.3 kev (the 2$\sigma$ lower limit found by viel et al. from a recentanalysis of the lyman-$\alpha$ forest) the milky way halo mass is required tobe $&gt; 1.4 \times 10^{12}$ \msun. for this same fiducial model, we also findthat all wdm particle masses are ruled out (at 95% confidence) if the halo ofthe milky way has a mass smaller than $1.1 \times 10^{12}$ \msun, while if themass of the galactic halo is greater than 1.8 $\times 10^{12}$ \msun, only wdmparticle masses larger than 2 kev are allowed.

1311.6649	n-body dark matter haloes with simple hierarchical histories	we present a new algorithm which groups the subhaloes found in cosmologicaln- body simulations by structure finders such as subfind into dark matterhaloes whose formation histories are strictly hierarchical. one advantage ofthese `dhaloes' over the commonly used friends-of-friends (fof) haloes is thatthey retain their individual identity in cases when fof haloes are artificiallymerged by tenuous bridges of particles or by an overlap of their outer diffusehaloes. dhaloes are thus well-suited for modelling galaxy formation and theirmerger trees form the basis of the durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model,galform. applying the dhalo construction to the lambdacdm millennium-2simulation we find that approximately 90% of dhaloes have a one-to-one,bijective match with a corresponding fof halo. the remaining 10% are typicallysecondary components of large fof haloes. although the mass functions of bothtypes of haloes are similar, the mass of dhaloes correlates much more tightlywith the virial mass, m200, than fof haloes. approximately 80% of fof andbijective and non-bijective dhaloes are relaxed according to standard criteria.for these relaxed haloes all three types have similar concentration-m200relations and, at fixed mass, the concentration distributions are describedaccurately by log-normal distributions.

1312.4736	the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey: the role of galaxy group environment  in the star formation rate versus stellar mass relation and quiescent  fraction out to $z \sim 0.8$	using a large sample of field and group galaxies drawn from the pan-starrs1medium-deep survey, we present the specific star formation rate (ssfr) -stellar mass (m*) relation, as well as the quiescent fraction versus m*relation in different environments. we confirm that the fraction of quiescentgalaxies is strongly dependent on environment at a fixed stellar mass, but thatthe amplitude and the slope of the star-forming sequence is similar between thefield and groups: in other words, the ssfr-density relation at a fixed stellarmass is primarily driven by the change in the star-forming and quiescentfractions between different environments rather than a global suppression inthe star formation rate for the star-forming population. however, when werestrict our sample to the cluster-scale environments ($m&gt;10^{14}m_{solar}$),we find a global reduction in the ssfr of the star forming sequence of $17\%$at 4$\sigma$ confidence as opposed to its field counterpart. after removing thestellar mass dependence of the quiescent fraction seen in field galaxies, theexcess in the quiescent fraction due to the environment quenching in groups andclusters is found to increase with stellar mass. we argue that these resultsare in favor of galaxy mergers to be the primary environment quenchingmechanism operating in galaxy groups whereas strangulation is able to reproducethe observed trend in the environment quenching efficiency and stellar massrelation seen in clusters. our results also suggest that the relativeimportance between mass quenching and environment quenching depends on stellarmass -- the mass quenching plays a dominant role in producing quiescentgalaxies for more massive galaxies, while less massive galaxies are quenchedmostly through the environmental effect, with the transition mass around$1-2\times10^{10}m_{solar}$ in the group/cluster environment.

1401.0986	herschel-atlas/gama:how does the far-ir luminosity function depend on  galaxy group properties?	we use the herschel atlas (h-atlas) phase i data to study the conditionalluminosity function of far-ir (250 um) selected galaxies in optically-selectedgalaxy groups from the gama spectroscopic survey, as well as environmentaleffects on the far-ir-to-optical colour. we applied two methods, which gaveconsistent results for the far-ir conditional luminosity functions. the directmatching method matches h-atlas sources to gama/sdss galaxies, then links theoptical counterparts to gama groups. the stacking method counts the number offar-ir sources within the projected radii of gama groups, subtracting the localbackground. we investigated the dependence of the far-ir (250 um) luminosityfunction on group mass in the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt; 10d14msun/h and on redshiftin the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, using a sample of 3000 groups containing h-atlassources with gama redshifts over an area of 126 sq. deg. we find that thecharacteristic 250 um luminosity, l^*(250), increases with group mass up to m_h~ 10d13msun/h, but is roughly constant above this, while it increases withredshift at high group masses, but less so at low masses. we also find that thegroup far-ir luminosity-to-mass ratio l(250)/m_h increases with redshift and ishigher in low-mass groups. we estimate that around 70% of the 250 um luminositydensity in the local universe is contributed by groups with m_h &gt; 10d12msun/h.we also find that the far-ir-to-optical colours of h-atlas galaxies areindependent of group mass over the range 10d12 &lt; m_h &lt;10d14msun/h in the localuniverse. we also compare our observational results with recent semi-analyticalmodels, and find that none of these galaxy formation model can reproduce theconditional far-ir luminosity functions of galaxy groups.

1403.1585	the evolution of the star forming sequence in hierarchical galaxy  formation models	it has been argued that the specific star formation rates of star forminggalaxies inferred from observational data decline more rapidly below z = 2 thanis predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models. we present a detailedanalysis of this problem by comparing predictions from the galformsemi-analytic model with an extensive compilation of data on the average starformation rates of star-forming galaxies. we also use this data to infer theform of the stellar mass assembly histories of star forming galaxies. ouranalysis reveals that the currently available data favour a scenario where thestellar mass assembly histories of star forming galaxies rise at early timesand then fall towards the present day. in contrast, our model predicts stellarmass assembly histories that are almost flat below z = 2 for star forminggalaxies, such that the predicted star formation rates can be offset withrespect to the observational data by factors of up to 2-3. this disagreementcan be explained by the level of coevolution between stellar and halo massassembly that exists in contemporary galaxy formation models. in turn, thisarises because the standard implementations of star formation and supernovafeedback used in the models result in the efficiencies of these processremaining approximately constant over the lifetime of a given star forminggalaxy. we demonstrate how a modification to the timescale for gas ejected byfeedback to be reincorporated into galaxy haloes can help to reconcile themodel predictions with the data.

1405.1566	detection of a supervoid aligned with the cold spot of the cosmic  microwave background	we use the wise-2mass infrared galaxy catalog matched with pan-starrs1 (ps1)galaxies to search for a supervoid in the direction of the cosmic microwavebackground cold spot. our imaging catalog has median redshift $z\simeq 0.14$,and we obtain photometric redshifts from ps1 optical colours to create atomographic map of the galaxy distribution. the radial profile centred on thecold spot shows a large low density region, extending over 10's of degrees.motivated by previous cosmic microwave background results, we test forunderdensities within two angular radii, $5^\circ$, and $15^\circ$. the countsin photometric redshift bins show significantly low densities at high detectionsignificance, $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ and $\gtrsim 6 \sigma$, respectively, for thetwo fiducial radii. the line-of-sight position of the deepest region of thevoid is $z\simeq 0.15-0.25$. our data, combined with an earlier measurement bygranett et al. 2010, are consistent with a large $r_{\rm void}=(220 \pm 50)h^{-1}mpc $ supervoid with $\delta_{m} \simeq -0.14 \pm 0.04$ centered at$z=0.22\pm0.03$. such a supervoid, constituting at least a $\simeq 3.3\sigma$fluctuation in a gaussian distribution of the $\lambda cdm$ model, is aplausible cause for the cold spot.

1406.0855	simulated observations of sub-millimetre galaxies: the impact of  single-dish resolution and field variance	recent observational evidence suggests that the coarse angular resolution($\sim20"$ fwhm) of single-dish telescopes at sub-mm wavelengths has biased theobserved galaxy number counts by blending together the sub-mm emission frommultiple sub-mm galaxies (smgs). we use lightcones computed from an updatedimplementation of the \galform semi-analytic model to generate $50$ mock sub-mmsurveys of $0.5$ deg$^2$ at $850$ $\mu$m, taking into account the effects ofthe finite single-dish beam in a more accurate way than has been donepreviously. we find that blending of smgs does lead to an enhancement of sourceextracted number counts at bright fluxes($s_{\mathrm{850}\mu\mathrm{m}}\gtrsim1$ mjy). typically, $\sim3{-}6$ galaxiescontribute $90\%$ of the flux of an $s_{850\mu\mathrm{m}}=5$ mjy source andthese blended galaxies are physically unassociated. we find that field-to-fieldvariations are comparable to poisson fluctuations for our$s_{850\mu\mathrm{m}}&gt;5$ mjy smg population, which has a median redshift$z_{50}=2.0$, but are greater than poisson for the $s_{850\mu\mathrm{m}}&gt;1$ mjypopulation ($z_{50}=2.8$). in a detailed comparison to a recent interferometricsurvey targeted at single-dish detected sources, we reproduce the differencebetween single-dish and interferometer number counts and find a median redshift($z_{50}=2.5$) in excellent agreement with the observed value ($z_{50}=2.5\pm0.2$). we also present predictions for single-dish survey number counts at$450$ and $1100$ $\mu$m, which show good agreement with observational data.

1406.2320	creating mock catalogues of stellar haloes from cosmological simulations	we present a new technique for creating mock catalogues of the individualstars that make up the accreted component of stellar haloes in cosmologicalsimulations and show how the catalogues can be used to test and interpretobservational data. the catalogues are constructed from a combination ofmethods. a semi-analytic galaxy formation model is used to calculate the starformation history in haloes in an n-body simulation and dark matter particlesare tagged with this stellar mass. the tags are converted into individual starsusing a stellar population synthesis model to obtain the number density andevolutionary stage of the stars, together with a phase-space sampling methodthat distributes the stars while ensuring that the phase-space structure of theoriginal n-body simulation is maintained. a set of catalogues based on the$\lambda$cdm aquarius simulations of milky way mass haloes have been createdand made publicly available on a website. two example applications arediscussed that demonstrate the power and flexibility of the mock catalogues. weshow how the rich stellar substructure that survives in the stellar haloprecludes a simple measurement of its density profile and demonstrateexplicitly how pencil-beam surveys can return almost any value for the slope ofthe profile. we also show that localized variations in the abundance ofparticular types of stars, a signature of differences in the composition ofstellar populations, allow streams to be easily identified.

1406.3622	the cold spot in the cosmic microwave background: the shadow of a  supervoid	standard inflationary hot big bang cosmology predicts small fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) with isotropic gaussian statistics. allmeasurements support the standard theory, except for a few anomalies discoveredin the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe maps and confirmed recently by theplanck satellite. the cold spot is one of the most significant of suchanomalies, and the leading explanation of it posits a large void that imprintsthis extremely cold area via the linear integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect dueto the decay of gravitational potentials over cosmic time, or via therees-sciama (rs) effect due to late-time non-linear evolution. despite severalobservational campaigns targeting the cold spot region, to date no suitablylarge void was found at higher redshifts $z &gt; 0.3$. here we report thedetection of an $r =(192 \pm 15) h^{-1}mpc$ size supervoid of depth $\delta =-0.13 \pm 0.03$, and centred at redshift $z = 0.22$. this supervoid, possiblythe largest ever found, is large enough to significantly affect the cmb via thenon-linear rs effect, as shown in our lemaitre-tolman-bondi framework. thisdiscovery presents the first plausible explanation for any of the physical cmbanomalies, and raises the possibility that local large-scale structure could beresponsible for other anomalies as well.

1409.1179	orbital parameters of infalling satellite haloes in the hierarchical  $\lambda$cdm model	we present distributions of orbital parameters of infalling satellites of$\lambda$cdm haloes in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{14}$m$_\odot$, whichrepresent the initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of substructureswithin the host halo. we use merger trees constructed in a high resolutioncosmological n-body simulation to trace satellite haloes, and identify the timeof infall. we find signficant trends in the distribution of orbital parameterswith both the host halo mass and the ratio of satellite-to-host halo masses.for all host halo masses, satellites whose infall mass is a larger fraction ofthe host halo mass have more eccentric, radially biased orbits. at fixedsatellite-to-host halo mass ratio, high mass haloes are biased towardsaccreting satellites on slightly more radial orbits. to charactise the orbitaldistributions fully requires fitting the correlated bivariate distribution oftwo chosen orbital parameters (e.g. radial and tangential velocity or energyand angular momentum). we provide simple fits to one choice of the bivariatedistributions, which when transformed faithfully, captures the behaviour of anyof the projected one-dimensional distributions.

1501.04630	formation of in situ stellar haloes in milky way-mass galaxies	we study the formation of stellar haloes in three milky way-mass galaxiesusing cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on thesubset of halo stars that form in situ, as opposed to those accreted fromsatellites. in situ stars in our simulations dominate the stellar halo out to20 kpc and account for 30-40 per cent of its total mass. we separate in situhalo stars into three straightforward, physically distinct categories accordingto their origin: stars scattered from the disc of the main galaxy ('heateddisc'), stars formed from gas smoothly accreted on to the halo ('smooth' gas)and stars formed in streams of gas stripped from infalling satellites('stripped' gas). we find that most belong to the stripped gas category. thoseoriginating in smooth gas outside the disc tend to form at the same time andplace as the stripped-gas population, suggesting that their formation isassociated with the same gas-rich accretion events. the scattered disc starcontribution is negligible overall but significant in the solar neighbourhood,where ~90 per cent of stars on eccentric orbits once belonged to the disc.however, the distinction between halo and thick disc in this region is highlyambiguous. the chemical and kinematic properties of the different componentsare very similar at the present day, but the global properties of the in situhalo differ substantially between the three galaxies in our study. in oursimulations, the hierarchical buildup of structure is the driving force behindnot only the accreted stellar halo, but also those halo stars formed in situ.

1502.03477	estimating the dark matter halo mass of our milky way using dynamical  tracers	the mass of the dark matter halo of the milky way can be estimated by fittinganalytical models to the phase-space distribution of dynamical tracers. we testthis approach using realistic mock stellar halos constructed from the aquariusn-body simulations of dark matter halos in the $\lambda$cdm cosmology. weextend the standard treatment to include a navarro-frenk-white (nfw) potentialand use a maximum likelihood method to recover the parameters describing thesimulated halos from the positions and velocities of their mock halo stars. wefind that the estimate of halo mass is highly correlated with the estimate ofhalo concentration. the best-fit halo masses within the virial radius,$r_{200}$, are biased, ranging from a 40\% underestimate to a 5\% overestimatein the best case (when the tangential velocities of the tracers are included).there are several sources of bias. deviations from dynamical equilibrium canpotentially cause significant bias; deviations from spherical symmetry arerelatively less important. fits to stars at different galactocentric radii cangive different mass estimates. by contrast, the model gives good constraints onthe mass within the half-mass radius of tracers even when restricted to tracerswithin 60kpc. the recovered velocity anisotropies of tracers, $\beta$, arebiased systematically, but this does not affect other parameters if tangentialvelocity data are used as constraints.

1507.00769	the orbital pdf: general inference of the gravitational potential from  steady-state tracers	we develop two general methods to infer the gravitational potential of asystem using steady-state tracers, i.e., tracers with a time-independentphase-space distribution. combined with the phase-space continuity equation,the time independence implies a universal orbital probability density function(opdf) $\mathrm{d} p(\lambda|{\rm orbit})\propto \mathrm{d} t$, where $\lambda$is the coordinate of the particle along the orbit. the opdf is equivalent tojeans theorem, and is the key physical ingredient behind most dynamicalmodelling of steady-state tracers. in the case of a spherical potential, wedevelop a likelihood estimator that fits analytical potentials to the system,and a non-parametric method ("phase-mark") that reconstructs the potentialprofile, both assuming only the opdf. the methods involve no extra assumptionsabout the tracer distribution function and can be applied to tracers with anyarbitrary distribution of orbits, with possible extension to non-sphericalpotentials. the methods are tested on monte carlo samples of steady-statetracers in dark matter haloes to show that they are unbiased as well asefficient. a fully documented \textsc{c/python} code implementing our method isfreely available at a github repository linked from\url{http://icc.dur.ac.uk/data/#opdf}.

1507.00771	the orbital pdf: the dynamical state of milky way sized haloes and the  intrinsic uncertainty in the determination of their masses	using realistic cosmological simulations of milky way sized haloes, we studytheir dynamical state and the accuracy of inferring their mass profiles withsteady-state models of dynamical tracers. we use a new method that describesthe phase-space distribution of a steady-state tracer population in a sphericalpotential without any assumption regarding the distribution of their orbits.applying the method to five haloes from the aquarius $\lambda$cdm n-bodysimulation, we find that dark matter particles are an accurate tracer thatenables the halo mass and concentration parameters to be recovered with anaccuracy of $5\%$. assuming a potential profile of the nfw form does notsignificantly affect the fits in most cases, except for halo a whose densityprofile differs significantly from the nfw form, leading to a $30\%$ bias inthe dynamically fitted parameters. the existence of substructures in the darkmatter tracers only affects the fits by $\sim 1\%$. applying the method to mockstellar haloes generated by a particle-tagging technique, we find the stars arefarther from equilibrium than dark matter particles, yielding a systematic biasof $\sim 20\%$ in the inferred mass and concentration parameter. the level ofsystematic biases obtained from a conventional distribution function fit tostars is comparable to ours, while similar fits to dm tracers are significantlybiased in contrast to our fits. in line with previous studies, the mass bias ismuch reduced near the tracer half-mass radius.

(2014), and find that the models reproduce thetrend of stronger clustering for more massive galaxies. however, the modelsunder predict the clustering of blue galaxies, can incorrectly predict thecorrelation function on small scales and under predict the clustering in oursample of galaxies with ~3$l_r$ . we suggest possible avenues to explore toimprove these cluster- ing predictions. the measurements presented in thispaper can be used to test other galaxy formation models, and we make themeasurements available online to facilitate this.

1509.02175	a unified model for the spatial and mass distribution of subhaloes	n-body simulations suggest that the substructures that survive inside darkmatter haloes follow universal distributions in mass and radial number density.we demonstrate that a simple analytical model can explain these subhalodistributions as resulting from tidal stripping which increasingly reduces themass of subhaloes with decreasing halo-centric distance. as a starting point,the spatial distribution of subhaloes of any given infall mass is shown to belargely indistinguishable from the overall mass distribution of the host halo.using a physically motivated statistical description of the amount of massstripped from individual subhaloes, the model fully describes the jointdistribution of subhaloes in final mass, infall mass and radius. as a result,it can be used to predict several derived distributions involving combinationsof these quantities including, but not limited to, the universal subhalo massfunction, the subhalo spatial distribution, the gravitational lensing profile,the dark matter annihilation radiation profile and boost factor. this modelclarifies a common confusion when comparing the spatial distributions ofgalaxies and subhaloes, the so called "anti-bias", as a simple selectioneffect. we provide a python code subgen for populating haloes with subhaloes athttp://icc.dur.ac.uk/data/

1510.08463	the evolution of the stellar mass versus halo mass relationship	we present an analysis of the predictions made by the galform semi-analyticgalaxy formation model for the evolution of the relationship between stellarmass and halo mass. we show that for the standard implementations of supernovafeedback and gas reincorporation used in semi-analytic models, thisrelationship is predicted to evolve weakly over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;4.modest evolution in the median stellar mass versus halo mass (shm) relationshipimplicitly requires that, at fixed halo mass, the efficiency of stellar massassembly must be almost constant with cosmic time. we show that in our model,this behaviour can be understood in simple terms as a result of a constantefficiency of gas reincorporation, and an efficiency of sne feedback that is,on average, constant at fixed halo mass. we present a simple explanation of howfeedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) acts in our model to introduce abreak in the shm relation whose location is predicted to evolve only modestly.finally, we show that if modifications are introduced into the model such that,for example, the gas reincorporation efficiency is no longer constant, themedian shm relation is predicted to evolve significantly over 0&lt;z&lt;4.specifically, we consider modifications that allow the model to betterreproduce either the evolution of the stellar mass function or the evolution ofaverage star formation rates inferred from observations.

1511.02034	recovering dark-matter clustering from galaxies with gaussianization	the gaussianization transform has been proposed as a method to remove theissues of scale-dependent galaxy bias and nonlinearity from galaxy clusteringstatistics, but these benefits have yet to be thoroughly tested for realisticgalaxy samples. in this paper, we test the effectiveness of the gaussianizationtransform for different galaxy types by applying it to realistic simulated blueand red galaxy samples. we show that in real space, the shapes of thegaussianized power spectra of both red and blue galaxies agree with that of theunderlying dark matter, with the initial power spectrum, and with each other tosmaller scales than do the statistics of the usual (untransformed) densityfield. however, we find that the agreement in the gaussianized statisticsbreaks down in redshift space. we attribute this to the fact that red and bluegalaxies exhibit very different fingers of god in redshift space. afterapplying a finger-of-god compression, the agreement on small scales between thegaussianized power spectra is restored. we also compare the gaussianizationtransform to the clipped galaxy density field and find that while both methodsare effective in real space, they have more complicated behaviour in redshiftspace. overall, we find that gaussianization can be useful in recovering theshape of the underlying dark matter power spectrum to k ~ 0.5 h/mpc and of theinitial power spectrum to k ~ 0.4 h/mpc in certain cases at z = 0.

1511.04078	satellite galaxies in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation with  sterile neutrino dark matter	the sterile neutrino is a viable dark matter candidate that can be producedin the early universe via non-equilibrium processes, and would thereforepossess a highly non-thermal spectrum of primordial velocities. in this paperwe analyse the process of structure formation with this class of dark matterparticles. to this end we construct primordial dark matter power spectra as afunction of the lepton asymmetry, $l_6$, that is present in the primordialplasma and leads to resonant sterile neutrino production. we compare thesepower spectra with those of thermally produced dark matter particles and showthat resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are much colder than their thermalrelic counterparts. we also demonstrate that the shape of these power spectraare not determined by the free-streaming scale alone. we then use the powerspectra as an input for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order topredict the number of luminous satellite galaxies in a milky way-like halo. byassuming that the mass of the milky way halo must be no more than$2\times10^{12}m_{\odot}$ (the adopted upper bound based on currentastronomical observations) we are able to constrain the value of $l_6$ for$m_{s}\le 5$kev. we also show that the range of $l_6$ that is in best agreementwith the 3.5kev line (if produced by decays of 7kev sterile neutrino) requiresthat the milky way halo has a mass no smaller than $1.2\times10^{12}m_{\odot}$.finally, we compare the power spectra obtained by direct integration of theboltzmann equations for a non-resonantly produced sterile neutrino with thefitting formula of viel et al. and find that the latter significantlyunderestimates the power amplitude on scales relevant to satellite galaxies.

0807.0001	the colours of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters	current models of galaxy formation predict satellite galaxies in groups andclusters that are redder than observed. we investigate the effect on thecolours of satellite galaxies produced by the ram pressure stripping of theirhot gaseous atmospheres as the satellites orbit within their parent halo. weincorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamicsimulations within the durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. thesimulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressivethan previously assumed. the main uncertainty in the model is the treatment ofgas expelled by supernovae. with reasonable assumptions for the stripping ofthis material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significantfraction of their hot gas for several gigayears, thereby replenishing theirreservoirs of cold, star forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively longperiod of time. a bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to thatobserved in sdss data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxiesare in good agreement with the data. in addition, our model naturally accountsfor the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from smallgroups to high mass clusters.

0705.3323	measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation scale using the sdss and  2dfgrs	we introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using baryonacoustic oscillation (bao) distance measurements from galaxy samples coveringdifferent redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn fromthe sdss and 2dfgrs. bao are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dfgrsand sdss main galaxy samples, and measure the distance--redshift relation atz=0.2. bao in the clustering of the sdss luminous red galaxies measure thedistance--redshift relation at z=0.35. the observed scale of the bao calculatedfrom these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed usingestimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distancemeasure d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3). here d_a is the angular diameterdistance, and h(z) is the hubble parameter. this givesr_s/d_v(0.2)=0.1980+/-0.0058 and r_s/d_v(0.35)=0.1094+/-0.0033 (1sigma errors),with correlation coefficient of 0.39, where r_s is the comoving sound horizonscale at recombination. matching the bao to have the same measured scale at allredshifts then gives d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.812+/-0.060. the recovered ratio isroughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift snls supernovaedata for lambda cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmologicalacceleration at low redshift. if we force the cosmological model to be flatwith constant w, then we find om_m=0.249+/-0.018 and w=-1.004+/-0.089 aftercombining with the snls data, and including the wmap measurement of theapparent acoustic horizon angle in the cmb.

astro-ph;0012429	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: near infrared galaxy luminosity  functions	we combine the 2mass extended source catalogue and the 2dfgrs to produce anir selected galaxy catalogue with 17,173 measured redshifts. we use thisextensive dataset to estimate the j and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. thelfs are fairly well fit by schechter functions with j: m*-5log h=-22.36+/-0.02, alpha= -0.93+/-0.04, phi=0.0104+/-0.0016 h^3/mpc^3 and k:m*-5log h= -23.44+/-0.03, alpha=-0.96+/-0.05, phi=0.0108+/-0.0016 h^3/mpc^3(2mass kron magnitudes). these parameters assume a cosmological model withomega=0.3 and lambda=0.7. with datasets of this size, systematic rather thanrandom errors are the dominant source of uncertainty in the determination ofthe lf. we carry out a careful investigation of possible systematic effects inour data. the surface brightness distribution of the sample shows no evidencethat significant numbers of low surface brightness or compact galaxies aremissed by the survey. we estimate the present-day distributions of b-k and j-kcolours as a function of absolute magnitude and use models of the galaxystellar populations, constrained by the observed optical and infrared colours,to infer the galaxy stellar mass function. integrated over all galaxy masses,this yields a total mass fraction in stars (in units of the critical massdensity) of omega_*.h= (1.6+/-0.24)/10^3 for a kennicutt imf and omega_*.h=(2.9+/-0.43)/10^3 for a salpeter imf. these values agree with those inferredfrom observational estimates of the star formation history of the universeprovided that dust extinction corrections are modest.

astro-ph;0109152	evidence for a non-zero lambda and a low matter density from a combined  analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey and cosmic microwave background  anisotropies	we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the power spectra of the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropiesunder the assumptions that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic, gaussianand well described by power laws with scalar and tensor indices of n_s and n_t.on its own, the 2dfgrs sets tight limits on the parameter combination omega_mh, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density inbaryons omega_b/omega_m. the cmb anisotropy data alone set poor constraints onthe cosmological constant and hubble constant because of a `geometricaldegeneracy' among parameters. furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the cmbdata allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons andcold dark matter. combining the cmb and 2dfgrs data sets helps to break boththe geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. the values of the parametersderived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models ofinflation, with the baryon density derived from primordial nucleosynthesis andwith direct measurements of the hubble parameter. in particular, we find strongevidence for a positive cosmological constant with a pm 2sigma range of 0.65 &lt;omega_lambda &lt; 0.85, completely independently of constraints on omega_\lambdaderived from type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0109167	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: a targeted study of catalogued clusters  of galaxies	we have carried out a study of known clusters within the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) observed areas and have identified 431 abell, 173 apm and 343edcc clusters. precise redshifts, velocity dispersions and new centroids havebeen measured for the majority of these objects, and this information has beenused to study the completeness of these catalogues, the level of contaminationfrom foreground and background structures along the cluster's line of sight,the space density of the clusters as a function of redshift, and their velocitydispersion distributions. we find that the abell and edcc catalogues arecontaminated at the level of about 10%, whereas the apm catalogue suffers only5% contamination. if we use the original catalog centroids, the level ofcontamination rises to approximately 15% for the abell and edcc catalogues,showing that the presence of foreground and background groups may alter therichness of clusters in these catalogues. there is a deficiency of clusters at$z \sim 0.05$ that may correspond to a large underdensity in the southernhemisphere. from the cumulative distribution of velocity dispersions for theseclusters, we derive an upper limit to the space density of $\sigma &gt; 1000 \kms$clusters of $3.6 \times 10^{-6} \hdens$. this result is used to constrainmodels for structure formation; our data favour low-density cosmologies,subject to the usual assumptions concerning the shape and normalization of thepower spectrum.

astro-ph;0112162	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the amplitudes of fluctuations in the  2dfgrs and the cmb, and implications for galaxy biasing	we compare the amplitudes of fluctuations probed by the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey and by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies. by combining the 2dfgrs and cmb data we find the linear-theoryrms mass fluctuations in 8 mpc/h spheres to be sigma_8 = 0.73 +-0.05 (aftermarginalization over the matter density parameter omega_m and three other freeparameters). this normalization is lower than the cobe normalization andprevious estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with somerevised cluster abundance determinations. we also estimate thescale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch l_s = 1.9l_* apm-selectedgalaxies to be b(l_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.15h/mpc. if luminosity segregation operates on these scales, l_* galaxies wouldbe almost un-biased, b(l_*,z=0) = 0.96. these results are derived by assuming aflat lambda-cdm universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters andfixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.we also study the best fit pair (omega_m,b), and the robustness of the resultsto varying n and tau. various modelling corrections can each change theresulting b by 5-15 per cent. the results are compared with other independentmeasurements from the 2dfgrs itself, and from the sdss, cluster abundance andcosmic shear.

astro-ph;0202485	a comparison of gas dynamics in sph and semi-analytic models of galaxy  formation	we compare the results of two techniques used to calculate the evolution ofcooling gas during galaxy formation: smooth particle hydrodynamics (sph)simulations and semi-analytic modelling. we improve upon the earlierstatistical comparison of benson et al. by taking halo merger histories fromthe dark matter component of the sph simulation, which allows us to compare theevolution of galaxies on an object-by-object basis in the two treatments. weuse a ``stripped-down'' version of the semi-analytic model described by hellyet al. which includes only shock heating and radiative cooling of gas and whichis adjusted to mimic the resolution and other parameters of a comparison sphsimulation as closely as possible. we compare the total mass of gas that coolsin halos of different mass as a function of redshift as well as the masses andspatial distribution of individual ``galaxies.'' at redshift z=0, the cooledgas mass in well-resolved halos agrees remarkably well (to better than ~20%) inthe sph simulation and stripped-down semi-analytic model. at high redshift,resolution effects in the simulation become increasingly important and, as aresult, more gas tends to cool in low mass halos in the sph simulation than inthe semi-analytic model. the cold gas mass function of individual galaxies inthe two treatments at z=0 also agrees very well and, when the effects ofmergers are accounted for, the masses of individual galaxies and their 2-pointcorrelation functions are also in excellent agreement in the two treatments.thus, our comparison confirms and extends the earlier conclusion of benson etal. that sph simulations and semi-analytic models give consistent results forthe evolution of cooling galactic gas.

astro-ph;0203336	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the environmental dependence of galaxy  star formation rates near clusters	we have measured the equivalent width of the h-alpha emission line for 11006galaxies brighter than m_b=-19 (lcdm) at 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 in the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2df), in the fields of seventeen known galaxy clusters. the limitedredshift range ensures that our results are insensitive to aperture bias, andto residuals from night sky emission lines. we use these measurements to tracemustar, the star formation rate normalized to lstar, as a function of distancefrom the cluster centre, and local projected galaxy density. we find that thedistribution of mustar steadily skews toward larger values with increasingdistance from the cluster centre, converging to the field distribution atdistances greater than ~3 times the virial radius. a correlation between starformation rate and local projected density is also found, which is independentof cluster velocity dispersion and disappears at projected densities below ~1galaxy (brighter than m_b=-19) per mpc^2. this characteristic scale correspondsapproximately to the mean density at the cluster virial radius. the samecorrelation holds for galaxies more than two virial radii from the clustercentre. we conclude that environmental influences on galaxy properties are notrestricted to cluster cores, but are effective in all groups where the densityexceeds this critical value. the present day abundance of such systems, and thestrong evolution of this abundance, makes it likely that hierarchical growth ofstructure plays a significant role in decreasing the global average starformation rate. finally, the low star formation rates well beyond thevirialised cluster rule out severe physical processes, such as ram pressurestripping of disk gas, as being completely responsible for the variations ingalaxy properties with environment.

astro-ph;0206256	parameter constraints for flat cosmologies from cmb and 2dfgrs power  spectra	we constrain flat cosmological models with a joint likelihood analysis of anew compilation of data from the cosmic microwave background (cmb) and from the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). fitting the cmb alone yields a knowndegeneracy between the hubble constant h and the matter density omega_m, whicharises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular powerspectrum. this `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail andshown to follow a simple relation omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. adding the 2dfgrspower spectrum constrains omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. if tensoranisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the hubbleconstant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and thephysical cdm and baryon densities omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.002 (standard rms errors). including a possible tensor componentcauses very little change to these figures; we set a upper limit to thetensor-to-scalar ratio of r&lt;0.7 at 95% confidence. we then show how these datacan be used to constrain the equation of state of the vacuum, and find w&lt;-0.52at 95% confidence. the preferred cosmological model is thus very wellspecified, and we discuss the precision with which future cmb data can bepredicted, given the model assumptions. the 2dfgrs power-spectrum data andcovariance matrix, and the cmb data compilation used here, are available fromhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/

astro-ph;0210141	galaxy formation using halo merger histories taken from n-body  simulations	we develop a hybrid galaxy formation model which uses outputs from an n-bodysimulation to follow the merger histories (or ``merger trees'') of dark matterhalos and treats baryonic processes, such as the cooling of gas within halosand subsequent star formation, using the semi-analytic model of cole et al. wecompare this hybrid model to an otherwise identical model which utilises mergertree realisations generated by a monte-carlo algorithm and find that, apartfrom the limited mass resolution imposed by the n-body particle mass, the onlysignificant differences between the models are due to the known discrepancybetween the distribution of halo progenitor masses predicted by extended pressschechter theory and that found in n-body simulations. we investigate theeffect of limited mass resolution on the hybrid model by comparing to a purelysemi-analytic model with greatly improved mass resolution. we find that themass resolution of the simulation we use, which has a particle mass of1.4x10^10 msolar/h, is insufficient to produce a reasonable luminosity functionfor galaxies with magnitudes in the b_j band fainter than -17.

astro-ph;0212357	the halo occupation distribution and the physics of galaxy formation	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the bias between galaxiesand dark matter by specifying (a) the probability p(n|m) that a halo of virialmass m contains n galaxies of a particular class and (b) the relativedistributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. we calculate predictedhods for a lambda-cdm cosmological model using an sph hydrodynamic simulationand a semi-analytic (sa) galaxy formation model. although the two methodspredict different galaxy mass functions, their hod predictions agree remarkablywell. for mass-selected samples, the mean occupation &lt;n(m)&gt; exhibits a sharpcutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau for &lt;n&gt;~1-2, and a moresteeply rising high occupancy regime. at low &lt;n&gt;, the mean pair and triplecounts are well below poisson expectations, with important consequences forsmall scale behavior of 2- and 3-point correlation functions. the hod dependsstrongly on galaxy age, with high mass halos populated mainly by old galaxiesand low mass halos by young galaxies. the sph simulation supports severalsimplifying assumptions about hod bias: the most massive galaxy in a halousually lies close to the center and moves near the halo's mean velocity;satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as thedark matter; and the mean occupation at fixed halo mass is independent of thehalo's larger scale environment. by applying the sph and sa hods to a largevolume n-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight, observabledepartures from a power-law galaxy correlation function. the predicted hods areclosely tied to the underlying galaxy formation physics, they offer usefulguidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be testedempirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys.

astro-ph;0303531	the properties of spiral galaxies: confronting hierarchical galaxy  formation models with observations	we compare the properties of local spiral galaxies with the predictions ofthe cole et al. semi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation, in orderto gain insight into the baryonic processes that were responsible for shapingthese galaxies. on the whole, the models reproduce the properties ofpresent-day spirals (such as sfrs, sfhs, scale sizes, metallicities, and gasfractions) rather well. in particular, we find that once the effects of dustand variations in stellar populations have been taken into account, publishedspiral galaxy scale-size distributions derived from optical data (withlogarithmic widths ~0.3) can be reconciled with the width of the stellar massscale-size distribution predicted by the semi-analytic model (~0.5). there aresome illuminating discrepancies between the observations and the modelpredictions. the model colours of luminous spiral galaxies are somewhat tooblue and those of faint galaxies somewhat too red, most likely indicatingshortcomings in the way that gas is accreted by spiral galaxies. furthermore,the model produces too few luminous spiral galaxies. these difficulties couldbe resolved by altering the way in which gas cooling is treated or, perhaps, byadopting a higher baryon fraction and invoking galactic `superwinds.' secondly,stellar m/ls are found to be as high as observations permit. yet, typically 60%of the mass in the inner half-light radius of the model galaxies is dark. thisresults in an offset between the model and observed spiral galaxyluminosity-linewidth relation. this could be resolved by substantially reducingthe mass of baryons which make it into a galaxy disc (with an attendantdecrease in stellar m/l), or by modifying the assumed dark matter profile toinclude less dark matter in the inner parts.

astro-ph;0311379	galaxy ecology: groups and low-density environments in the sdss and  2dfgrs	we analyse the observed correlation between galaxy environment and h-alphaemission line strength, using volume-limited samples and group catalogues of24968 galaxies drawn from the 2df galaxy redshift survey (mb&lt;-19.5) and thesloan digital sky survey (mr&lt;-20.6). we characterise the environment by 1)sigma_5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projecteddistance to the 5th nearest neighbour; and 2) rho1.1 and rho5.5,three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxydistribution with gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 mpc and 5.5 mpc,respectively. we find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form twodistinct populations, as characterised by their h-alpha equivalent width,ew(ha). the relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies variesstrongly and continuously with local density. however, the distribution ofew(ha) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. thefraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density onlarge scales, rho5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with localdensity, rho1.1. we use two differently-selected group catalogues todemonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximatelyindependent of group velocity dispersion, for sigma=200-1000 km/s. even in thelowest density environments, no more than ~70 per cent of galaxies showsignificant h-alpha emission. based on these results, we conclude that thepresent-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a resultof short-timescale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift,such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.

astro-ph;0408536	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the local e+a galaxy population	we select a sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) e+a galaxies from the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the spectra of these objects are defined by stronghydrogen balmer absorption lines (h-delta, h-gamma, h-beta) combined with alack of [oii] 3727a emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst ofstar formation. the e+a spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the processof evolution. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity function of the e+a galaxies. we find that the environments areconsistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies: low-redshift e+a systems arelocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poorgroups. however, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using threebalmer absorption lines h-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (e/s0)systems. in a small but significant number we find evidence for recent majormergers, such as tidal tails. we infer that major mergers are one importantformation mechanism for e+a galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. at lowredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thusthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usualmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. regarding the selection of e+agalaxies: we find that basing the balmer-line criterion solely on h-deltaabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems withdetectable h-alpha emission. in these objects the [oii] emission is presumablyeither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the(h-gamma, h-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

astro-ph;0408564	theoretical models of the halo occupation distribution: separating  central and satellite galaxies	the halo occupation distribution (hod) describes the relation betweengalaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. theproperties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those ofsatellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. using asmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulation and a semi-analytic (sa)galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central andsatellite galaxies to the hod, more specifically to the probability p(n|m) thata halo of virial mass m contains n galaxies of a particular class. in agreementwith earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupationfunction &lt;n&gt; for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximatedby a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, andthat the distribution of satellite numbers is close to poisson at fixed halomass. for galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, thereis a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass mmin required to hosta central galaxy and the mass m1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite,with m1 ~ 14 mmin (sph) or m1 ~ 18 mmin (sa). the mean occupation number ofyoung galaxies exhibits a local minimum at m ~ 10 mmin where halos are toomassive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to hostsatellites. we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halomass cannot be described by a schechter function because central galaxiesproduce a "bump" at high masses. we suggest parameterizations for the hod andthe conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxyclustering. many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent resultsinferred from clustering in the sloan digital sky survey.

astro-ph;0607237	satellite systems around galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies formed in n-body/sphsimulations of galaxy formation in the $\lambda$cdm cosmology. the simulationsinclude the main physical effects thought to be important in galaxy formationand, in several cases, produce realistic spiral discs. in total, a sample of 9galaxies of luminosity comparable to the milky way was obtained. at magnitudesbrighter than the resolution limit, $m_v=-12$, the luminosity function of thesatellite galaxies in the simulations is in excellent agreement with data forthe local group. the radial number density profile of the model satellites, aswell as their gas fractions also match observations very well. in agreementwith previous n-body studies, we find that the satellites tend to bedistributed in highly flattened configurations whose major axis is aligned withthe major axis of the (generally triaxial) dark halo. in 2 out of 3 systemswith sufficiently large satellite populations, the satellite system is nearlyperpendicular to the plane of the galactic disc, a configuration analogous tothat observed in the milk way. the discs themselves are perpendicular to theminor axis of their host halos in the inner parts, and the correlation betweenthe orientation of the galaxy and the shape of the halo persists even out tothe virial radius. however, in one case the disc's minor axis ends up, at thevirial radius, perpendicular to the minor axis of the halo. the angular momentaof the galaxies and their host halo tend to be well aligned.

astro-ph;9308003	fourier analysis of redshift space distortions and the determination of  omega	the peculiar velocities of galaxies distort the pattern of galaxy clusteringin redshift space, making the redshift space power spectrum anisotropic. in thelinear regime, the strength of this distortion depends only on the ratio $\beta\equiv f(\omega)/b \approx \omega^{0.6}/b$, where $\omega$ is the cosmologicaldensity parameter and $b$ is the bias parameter. we derive a linear theoryestimator for $\beta$ based on the harmonic moments of the redshift space powerspectrum. using n-body simulations, we examine the impact of non-lineargravitational clustering on the power spectrum anisotropy and on our$\beta$-estimator. non-linear effects can be important out to wavelengths$\lambda \sim 50$mpc/h or larger; in most cases, they lower the quadrupolemoment of the power spectrum and thereby depress the estimate of $\beta$ belowthe true value. with a sufficiently large redshift survey, the scaling ofnon-linear effects may allow separate determinations of $\omega$ and $b$.  we describe a practical technique for measuring the anisotropy of the powerspectrum from galaxy redshift surveys, and we test the technique on mockcatalogues drawn from the n-body simulations. preliminary application of ourmethods to the 1.2 jy iras galaxy survey yields $\beta_{est} \sim 0.3-0.4 $ atwavelengths $\lambda \sim 30-40$mpc/h . non-linear effects remain important atthese scales, so this estimate of $\beta$ is probably lower than the truevalue.

astro-ph;9402069	merger rates in hierarchical models of galaxy formation. ii: comparison  with n-body simulations	we have made a detailed comparison of the results of large n-body simulationswith the analytical description of the merging histories of dark matter halospresented in lacey &amp; cole 1993, which is based on an extension of the press-schechter method (bond etal 1991,bower 1991). we find the analyticalpredictions for the halo mass function, merger rates and formation times to beremarkably accurate. the analytical model is however expected to apply forarbitrary omega and general power spectra. dark matter halos were identified inthe simulations using two different methods. for halos selected at meanoverdensities 100-200, the analytical mass function was found to provide a goodfit to the simulations with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by thespherical collapse model, with a typical error of &lt;30% over a range of 1000 inmass, which is the full dynamic range of our n-body simulations. this wasinsensitive to the type of filtering used. over a range of 100 - 1000 in mass,there was also good agreement with the analytical predictions for merger rates,including their dependence on the masses of the two halos involved and the timeinterval being considered, and for formation times, including the dependence onhalo mass and formation epoch. the analytical press-schechter mass function andits extension to halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very usefuldescription of the growth of dark matter halos through hierarchical clustering,and should providea valuable tool in studies of the formation and evolution ofgalaxies and galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;9408065	galaxy formation in a variety of hierarchical models	we predict the observable properties of the galaxy population in popularhierarchical models of galaxy formation. we employ a detailed semianalyticprocedure which incorporates the formation and merging of dark matter halos,the shock heating and radiative cooling of gas, self-regulated star formation,the merging of galaxies within dark matter halos, and the spectral evolution ofthe stellar populations. we contrast the standard cdm cosmogony with variantsof the cdm model having either a low value of h_0, or a low value of omega withor without a cosmological constant. in addition, we compare galaxy formation inthese cdm universes with a chdm model. we find that although the models havesome success in remedying the shortcomings of the standard cdm cosmogony, noneof these new models produce broad agreement with the whole range ofobservations. although the low-omega and omega+lambda=1 cdm models reduce thediscrepancy between the predicted and observed tully-fisher relations (the mainweakness of galaxy formation in standard cdm), these models predict an invertedcolour-magnitude relation and do not produce an exponential cut-off at thebright end of the galaxy luminosity function. all of our models predict recentstar formation and exhibit galaxy colours bluer than observed, but this problemis far more severe in the chdm model which produces colours about twomagnitudes too blue in b-k. unlike in the variants of the cdm model in the chdmcase this result is not dependent on our model of stellar feedback, but isinstead directly caused by the late epoch of structure formation in this model.

astro-ph;9510147	the structure of dark matter haloes in hierarchical clustering models	we use a set of large cosmological n-body simulations to study the internalstructure of dark matter haloes which form in scale-free models. we find thatthe radius r_178 corresponding to a mean interior overdensity of 178 accuratelydelineates the quasi-static halo interior from the surrounding infallingmaterial, in agreement with the simple spherical collapse model. the interiorvelocity dispersion correlates with mass, again in good agreement with thespherical collapse model. interior to the virial radius r_178, the sphericalaveraged density, circular velocity and velocity dispersion profiles are wellfit by a simple 2-parameter analytic model proposed by navarro etal (1995).this model has density going as 1/r at small radii, steepening to 1/r^3 atlarge radii, and fits our haloes to the resolution limit of the simulations.the two model parameters, scalelength and mass, are tightly correlated. lowermass haloes are more centrally concentrated, and so have scalelengths which area smaller fraction of their virial radius than those of their higher masscounterparts. this reflects the earlier formation times of low mass haloes. thehaloes are moderately aspherical, with typical axial ratios 1:0.8:0.65 at theirvirial radii. these shapes are maintained by an anisotropic velocity dispersiontensor. the median value of the spin parameter is lambda=0.04, with a weaktrend for lower lambda at higher halo mass. we also investigate how the haloproperties depend on the algorithm used to identify them, using bothfriends-of-friends and spherical overdensity methods. we find that for groupsselected at mean overdensities 100-400 by either method the properties areinsensitive to how the haloes are selected, if the halo centre is taken as theposition of the most bound particle

astro-ph;9601088	using the evolution of clusters to constrain omega	the population of rich galaxy clusters evolves much more rapidly in auniverse with critical density than one with low density, thus offering thepossibility of determining the cosmological density parameter, omega_0. wequantify this evolution using the press-schechter formalism which we extend toflat models with a cosmological constant. using new large n-body simulations,we verify that this formalism accurately predicts the abundance of richclusters as a function of redshift in various cosmologies. we normalise themodels by comparing them to the local abundance of clusters as a function oftheir x-ray temperature which we rederive from data compiled by henry &amp; arnaud.this gives values of the rms density fluctuation in spheres of radius 8 mpc/hof sigma_8 = (0.50+/- 0.04) omega_0^{-0.47+0.10 omega_0} if lambda_0=0 andsigma_8 = (0.50 +/- 0.04) omega_0^{-0.53+0.13 omega_0} if lambda_0=1-omega_0.these values depend very weakly on the shape of the power spectrum. we thenexamine how the distributions of mass, x-ray temperature and sunyaev-zel'dovichdecrement evolve as a function of omega_0. we present the expecteddistributions at z=0.33 and z=0.5 and the predicted number counts of thelargest clusters. we find that even at z=0.33, these distributions depend verystrongly on omega_0 and only weakly on lambda_0. for example, at this redshift,we expect 20 times as many clusters per comoving volume with m&gt;3.5 10^{14}msol/h and 5 times as many clusters with kt&gt;5 kev if omega_0=0.3 than ifomega_0=1. the splitting in the integrated counts is enhanced by the largervolume element in low omega_0 models. there is therefore a real prospect ofestimating omega_0 from forthcoming surveys of intermediate redshift clustersthat will determine their masses, x-ray temperatures or sz decrements.

astro-ph;9601102	cluster mass reconstruction from weak gravitational lensing	kaiser &amp; squires have proposed a technique for mapping the dark matter ingalaxy clusters using the coherent weak distortion of background galaxy imagescaused by gravitational lensing. we investigate the effectiveness of thistechnique under controlled conditions by creating simulated ccd framescontaining galaxies lensed by a model cluster, measuring the resulting galaxyshapes, and comparing the reconstructed mass distribution with the original.typically, the reconstructed surface density is diminished in magnitude whencompared to the original. the main cause of this reduced signal is the blurringof galaxy images by atmospheric seeing, but the overall factor by which thereconstructed surface density is reduced depends also on the signal-to-noiseratio in the ccd frame and on both the sizes of galaxy images and the magnitudelimit of the sample that is analysed. we propose a method for estimating amultiplicative compensation factor. we test our technique using a lensingcluster drawn from a cosmological n-body simulation with a variety of realisticbackground galaxy populations and observing conditions. we find that typicallythe compensation factor is appreciable, 1.4&lt;f&lt;2.2, and varies considerablydepending on the observing conditions and sample selection. our method yields acompensation factor which when used to correct the surface density estimatesproduces values that are in good agreement with those of the original cluster.thus weak lensing observations when calibrated using this method yield not onlyaccurate maps of the cluster morphology but also quantitative estimates of thecluster mass distribution.

astro-ph;9602091	cluster correlation functions in n-body simulations	the correlation function of galaxy clusters has often been used as a test ofcosmological models. a number of assumptions are implicit in the comparison oftheoretical expectations to data. here we use an ensemble of ten large n-bodysimulations of the standard cold dark matter cosmology to investigate howcluster selection criteria and other uncertain factors influence the clustercorrelation function. we consider the effects of varying the definition of acluster, the mean number density (or equivalently the richness) in a catalogue,and the assumed normalisation of the model; we also examine the importance ofredshift space distortions. we implement five different group-findingalgorithms and construct cluster catalogues defined by mass, velocitydispersion or a measure of x-ray luminosity. we find that different clustercatalogues yield correlation functions which can differ by substantially morethan the statistical errors in any one determination. for a given clusterselection criteria, the correlation length typically varies by $\sim 20\%$ incatalogues spanning the range of intercluster separations covered by the apmand abell (richness class $\gsim 1$) catalogues. distortions produced bypeculiar velocities in redshift space enhance the correlation function at largeseparations and lead to a larger clustering length in redshift space than inreal space. the sensitivity of the cluster correlation function to variousuncertain model assumptions substantially weakens previous conclusions based onthe comparison of model predictions with real data. detailed modelling ofcluster selection procedures including the effects of selecting from projectedgalaxy catalogues is required before the cluster correlation function can beregarded as a high precision constraint on cosmological models.

astro-ph;9604046	adding long-wavelength power to n-body simulations	tormen and bertschinger have presented an algorithm which allows the dynamicrange of n-body simulations to be extended by adding long-wavelength power toan evolved n-body simulation. this procedure is of considerable interest as itwill enable mock galaxy catalogues to be constructed with volumes as large asthose of the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys. their algorithm,however, neglects the coupling between long-wavelength linear modes andshort-wavelength non-linear modes. the growth of structure on small scales iscoupled to the amplitude of long-wavelength density perturbations via theireffect on the local value of the density parameter omega_0.the effect ofneglecting this coupling is quantified using a set of specially tailored n-bodysimulations. it is shown that the large-scale clustering of objects defined inthe evolved density field such as galaxy clusters is strongly underestimated bytheir algorithm. an adaptation to their algorithm is proposed that, at theexpense of additional complexity, remedies the shortcomings of the originalone. methods of constructing biased mock galaxy catalogues which utilise thebasic algorithm of tormen and bertschinger, but avoid the pitfalls arediscussed.

astro-ph;9702082	large-scale structure in cobe-normalized cold dark matter cosmogonies	we study the clustering of the mass distribution in cobe-normalized open andflat cdm models using large n-body simulations. with an age of the universe of14 gyr (12 gyr) for the flat (open) models and a baryon density fixed bynucleosynthesis constraints, the observed abundance of rich galaxy clustersleads to tight constraints on the density parameter; 0.25&lt;omega_0&lt;0.4(0.4&lt;omega_0&lt;0.5) for flat (open) models. the upper limits on omega_0 can berelaxed if one lowers the h_0 and increases the age of the universe, but h&lt;0.25is required to allow omega_0=1. the constraints also change if one allowstilted primordial power spectra. an acceptable omega_0=1 model with h=0.5 canbe constructed, with a tilt of n=0.8. we compare the evolved mass correlationfunctions of the most promising models with those of apm galaxies. the flatmodels have steep correlation functions at small scales and require galaxies tobe antibiased on scales r&lt;8 mpc/h. the open models require little or noantibias on small scales and a positive bias on large scales. the lack of apositive bias on small scales is difficult to reconcile with the virialanalysis of galaxy clusters which, if omega_0&gt;0.2, implies that galaxies areoverabundant in clusters relative to the field. the tilted omega_0=1 model, onthe other hand, does require that galaxies be positively biased on all scales.we also compute the topology of isodensity contours in these models, obtainingtheoretical predictions that are less sensitive to galaxy bias.

0809.4488	towards accurate modelling of the isw effect, the non-linear  contribution	in a universe with a cosmological constant, the large-scale gravitationalpotential varies in time and this is, in principle, observable. using an n-bodysimulation of a $\lambda$cdm universe, we show that linear theory is notsufficiently accurate to predict the power spectrum of the time derivative,$\dot{\phi}$, needed to compute the imprint of large-scale structure on thecosmic microwave background (cmb). the linear part of the $\dot{\phi}$ powerspectrum (the integrated sachs-wolfe effect or isw) drops quickly as therelative importance of $\omega_{\lambda}$ diminishes at high redshift, whilethe non-linear part (the rees-sciama effect or rs) evolves more slowly withredshift. therefore, the deviation of the total power spectrum from lineartheory occurs at larger scales at higher redshifts. the deviation occurs at$k\sim 0.1 $ $h$ mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$. the cross-correlation power spectrum ofthe density $\delta$ with $\dot{\phi}$ behaves differently to the powerspectrum of $\dot{\phi}$. firstly, the deviation from linear theory occurs atsmaller scales ($k\sim 1 $ $h$ mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0$). secondly, the correlationbecomes negative when the non-linear effect dominates. for thecross-correlation power spectrum of galaxy samples with the cmb, the non-lineareffect becomes significant at $l\sim 500$ and rapidly makes the cross powerspectrum negative. for high redshift samples, the cross-correlation is expectedto be suppressed by $5-10%$ on arcminute scales. the rs effect makes anegligible contribution to the large-scale isw cross-correlation measurement.however, on arc-minute scales it will contaminate the expectedcross-correlation signal induced by the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect.

0810.2300	mock galaxy redshift catalogues from simulations: implications for  pan-starrs1	we describe a method for constructing mock galaxy catalogues which are wellsuited for use in conjunction with large photometric surveys. we use thesemi-analytic galaxy formation model of bower et al. implemented in themillennium simulation. we apply our method to the specific case of the surveyssoon to commence with ps1, the first of 4 telescopes planned for the pan-starrssystem. ps1 has 5 photometric bands (grizy), and will carry out an all-sky 3pisurvey and a medium deep survey (mds) over 84 sq.deg. we calculate the expectedmagnitude limits for extended sources in the two surveys. we find that, after 3years, the 3pi survey will have detected over 10^8 galaxies in all 5 bands, 10million of which will lie at redshift z&gt;0.9, while the mds will have detectedover 10^7 galaxies with 0.5 million lying at z&gt;2. these numbers at least doubleif detection in the shallowest band, y is not required. we then evaluate theaccuracy of photometric redshifts estimated using an off-the-shelf photo-zcode. with the grizy bands alone it is possible to achieve an accuracy in the3pi survey of delta z/(1+z)~0.06 for 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.8, which could be reduced byabout 15% using near infrared photometry from the ukidds survey, but wouldincrease by about 25% for the deeper sample without the y band photometry. forthe mds an accuracy of delta z/(1+z)~0.05 is achievable for 0.02&lt;z&lt;1.5 usinggrizy. a dramatic improvement in accuracy is possible by selecting only redgalaxies. in this case, delta z/(1+z)~0.02-0.04 is achievable for ~100 milliongalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.1 in the 3pi survey and for 30 million galaxies in the mdsat 0.4&lt;z&lt;2. we investigate the effect of using photo-z in the estimate of thebaryonic acoustic oscillation scale. we find that ps1 will achieve a similaraccuracy in this estimate as a spectroscopic survey of 20 million galaxies.
