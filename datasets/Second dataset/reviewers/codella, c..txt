0706.2567	the hyperyoung hii region in g24.78+0.08 a1	context. g24.78+0.08 a1 is a 20 msun star surrounded by a hypercompact (hc)hii region, driving a co bipolar outflow, and located at the center of amassive rotating toroid undergoing infall towards the hc region. recent watermaser observations suggest that the hc region is expanding and accretion ontothe star is halted. aims. this study aims to confirm the expansion scenarioproposed for the hc region on the basis of recent h2o maser observations.methods. we carried out continuum vla observations at 1.3cm and 7mm with the aarray plus pie town configuration to map the hc region towards g24 a1. results.the emission of the hc region has been resolved and shows a ring shapestructure. the profiles of the emission obtained by taking slices at differentangles passing through the barycenter of the hc region confirm the shellstructure of the emission. the ratio between the inner and the outer radius ofthe shell, ri/ro, derived fitting the normalized brightness temperature profilepassing through the peak of the 7mm emission, is 0.9, which indicates that theshell is thin. the deconvolved outer radius estimated from the fit is 590 au.these results imply that the hc region in g24 a1 cannot be described in termsof a classical, homogeneous hii region but is instead an ionized shell. thisgives support to the model of an expanding wind-driven, ionized shell suggestedby the kinematics and distribution of the h2o masers associated with the hcregion. according to this model, the hc region is expanding on very short timesscales, 21-66 yr.

0903.2770	the extremely collimated bipolar h_2o jet from the ngc 1333-iras 4b  protostar	we have performed observations of water maser emission towards a sample oflow-mass protostars, in order to investigate the properties of jets associatedwith the earliest stages of star formation and their interaction with thesurrounding medium. the main aim is to measure the absolute positions andproper motions of the h_2o spots in order to investigate the kinematics of theregion from where the jet is launched. we imaged the protostars in the nearbyregion ngc 1333-iras 4 in the water maser line at 22.2 ghz by using the vlba inphase-reference mode at the milliarcsecond scale over four epochs, spaced byone month to measure proper motions. two protostars (a2 and b) were detected ina highly variable h_2o maser emission, with an active phase shorter than fourweeks. the h_2o maps allow us to trace the fast jet driven by the b protostar:we observed both the red- and blue-shifted lobes very close to the protostar,=&lt; 35 au, moving away with projected velocities of ~10-50 km/s. the comparisonwith the molecular outflow observed at larger scale suggests a jet precessionwith a 18'/yr rate. by measuring the positional spread of the h_2o spots weestimate a jet width of ~2 au at a distance of ~12 au from the drivingprotostar.

0905.0548	molecular outflows towards o-type young stellar objects	we have searched for massive molecular outflows in a sample of high-mass starforming regions, and we have characterised both the outflow properties andthose of their associated molecular clumps. with a sample composed largely ofmore luminous objects than previous ones, this work complements analogoussurveys performed by other authors by adding the missing highest luminositysources. the sample under study has been selected so as to favour the earliestevolutionary phases of star formation, and is composed of very luminous objects(l_bol &gt; 2x10^4 l_sun and up to ~10^6 l_sun), possibly containing o-type stars.each source has been mapped in 13co(2-1) and c18o(2-1) with the iram-30mtelescope on pico veleta (spain). the whole sample shows high-velocity wings inthe 13co(2-1) spectra, indicative of outflowing motions. in addition, we haveobtained outflow maps in 9 of our 11 sources, which display well-defined blueand/or red lobes. for these sources, the outflow parameters have been derivedfrom the line wing 13co(2-1) emission. an estimate of the clump masses from thec18o(2-1) emission is also provided and found to be comparable to the virialmasses. from a comparison between our results and those found by other authorsat lower masses, it is clear that the outflow mechanical force increases withthe bolometric luminosity of the clump and with the ionising photon rate of theassociated hii regions, indicating that high-mass stars drive more powerfuloutflows. a tight correlation between outflow mass and clump mass is alsofound. molecular outflows are found to be as common in massive star formingregions as in low-mass star forming regions. this, added to the detection of afew tentative large-scale rotating structures suggests that high-mass stars maygenerally form via accretion, as low-mass stars.

0909.2267	dissecting an intermediate-mass (im) protostar: chemical differentiation  in ic1396n	we have carried out high-angular resolution (1.4") observations in thecontinuum at 3.1mm and in the n2h+ 1-0, ch3cn 5_k-4_k and 13cs 2-1 lines usingthe plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) towards the intermediate mass (im)protostar iras21391+5802 (ic1396n). in addition, we have merged the pdbi imageswith previous bima (continuum data at 1.2mm and 3.1mm) and single-dish (n2h+1-0) data to have a comprehensive description of the region. the combination ofour data with bima and 30m data show that the bipolar outflow associated hascompletely eroded the initial molecular globule. the 1.2mm and 3.1mm continuumemissions are extended along the outflow axis tracing the warm walls of thebiconical cavity. most of the molecular gas, however, is located in anelongated feature in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. a strongchemical differentiation is detected across the molecular toroid, with the n2h+1-0 emission absent in the inner region.this chemical differentiation can beunderstood in terms of the different gas kinetic temperature. the[ch3cn]/[n2h+] ratio increases by 5 orders of magnitude with gas temperature,for temperatures between 20k and 100k. the ch3cn abundance towards iram 2a, themost massive protostellar core, is similar to that found in hot corinos andlower than that expected towards im and high mass hot cores. this couldindicate that iram 2a is a low mass or at most herbig ae star (iram 2a) insteadof the precursor of a massive be star. alternatively, the low ch3cn abundancecould also be the consequence of iram 2a being a class 0/i transition objectwhich has already formed a small photodissociation region (pdr).

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

(2010). here we report on the identification oflines from nh3, h2co, ch3oh, cs, hcn, and hco+. the comparison between theprofiles produced by molecules released from dust mantles (nh3, h2co, ch3oh)and that of h2o is consistent with a scenario in which water is also formed inthe gas-phase in high-temperature regions where sputtering or grain-graincollisions are not efficient. the high excitation range of the observed tracersallows us to infer, for the first time for these species, the existence of awarm (&gt; 200 k) gas component coexisting in the b1 bow structure with the coldand hot gas detected from ground.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1007.4691	first detection of nd in the solar-mass protostar iras16293-2422	in the past decade, much progress has been made in characterising theprocesses leading to the enhanced deuterium fractionation observed in the ismand in particular in the cold, dense parts of star forming regions such asprotostellar envelopes. very high molecular d/h ratios have been found forsaturated molecules and ions. however, little is known about the deuteriumfractionation in radicals, even though simple radicals often represent anintermediate stage in the formation of more complex, saturated molecules. theimidogen radical nh is such an intermediate species for the ammonia synthesisin the gas phase. herschel/hifi represents a unique opportunity to study thedeuteration and formation mechanisms of such species, which are not observablefrom the ground. we searched here for the deuterated radical nd in order todetermine the deuterium fractionation of imidogen and constrain the deuterationmechanism of this species. we observed the solar-mass class 0 protostariras16293-2422 with the heterodyne instrument hifi as part of the herschel keyprogramme chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions). thedeuterated form of the imidogen radical nd was detected and securely identifiedwith 2 hyperfine component groups of its fundamental transition in absorptionagainst the continuum background emitted from the nascent protostar. the 3groups of hyperfine components of its hydrogenated counterpart nh were alsodetected in absorption. we derive a very high deuterium fractionation with an[nd]/[nh] ratio of between 30 and 100%. the deuterium fractionation of imidogenis of the same order of magnitude as that in other molecules, which suggeststhat an efficient deuterium fractionation mechanism is at play. we discuss twopossible formation pathways for nd, by means of either the reaction of n+ withhd, or deuteron/proton exchange with nh.

1008.0365	wide field co j = 3-&gt;2 mapping of the serpens cloud core	context. outflows provide indirect means to get an insight on diverse starformation associated phenomena. on scales of individual protostellar cores,outflows combined with intrinsic core properties can be used to study the massaccretion/ejection process of heavily embedded protostellar sources. methods.an area comprising 460"x230" of the serpens cloud core has been mapped in 12 coj = 3\to 2 with the harp-b heterodyne array at the james clerk maxwelltelescope; j = 3\to 2 observations are more sensitive tracers of hot outflowgas than lower j co transitions; combined with the high sensitivity of theharp-b receptors outflows are sharply outlined, enabling their association withindividual protostellar cores. results. most of ~20 observed outflows are foundto be associated with known protostellar sources in bipolar or unipolarconfigurations. all but two outflow/core pairs in our sample tend to have aprojected orientation spanning roughly nw-se. the overall momentum driven byoutflows in serpens lies between 3.2 and 5.1 x 10^(-1) m\odot km s^(-1), thekinetic energy from 4.3 to 6.7 x 10^(43) erg and momentum flux is between 2.8and 4.4 x 10^(-4) m\odot km s^(-1) yr^(-1). bolometric luminosities ofprotostellar cores based on spitzer photometry are found up to an order ofmagnitude lower than previous estimations derived with iras/iso data.conclusions. we confirm the validity of the existing correlations between themomentum flux and bolometric luminosity of class i sources for the homogenoussample of serpens, though we suggest that they should be revised by a shift tolower luminosities. all protostars classified as class 0 sources stand wellabove the known class i correlations, indicating a decline in momentum fluxbetween the two classes.

1011.5419	sio outflows in high-mass star forming regions: a potential chemical  clock?	some theoretical models propose that o-b stars form via accretion, in asimilar fashion to low-mass stars. jet-driven molecular outflows play animportant role in this scenario, and their study can help to understand theprocess of high-mass star formation and the different evolutionary phasesinvolved. observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour anevolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with class 0 objectswhile more evolved class i/ii objects show less evidence of powerful jets. thepresent study aims at checking whether an analogous picture can be found in thehigh-mass case. the iram 30-m telescope (spain) has been used to performsingle-pointing sio(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57high-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. continuum data atdifferent wavelengths, from mid-ir to 1.2 mm, have been gathered to build thespectral energy distributions of all the clumps and estimate their bolometricluminosities. sio emission at high velocities, characteristic of molecularjets, is detected in 88% of our sources, a very high detection rate indicatingthat there is ongoing star formation activity in most of the sources of oursample. the sio(2-1) luminosity drops with l/m, which suggests that jetactivity declines as time evolves. this represents the first clear evidence ofa decrease of sio outflow luminosity with time in a homogeneous sample ofhigh-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. the sio(3-2) tosio(2-1) integrated intensity ratio shows only minor changes with evolutionarystate.

1210.7178	mapping water in protostellar outflows with herschel: pacs and hifi  observations of l1448-c	we investigate on the spatial and velocity distribution of h2o along thel1448 outflow, its relationship with other tracers, and its abundancevariations, using maps of the o-h2o 1_{10}-1_{01} and 2_{12}-1_{01} transitionstaken with the herschel-hifi and pacs instruments, respectively. water emissionappears clumpy, with individual peaks corresponding to shock spots along theoutflow. the bulk of the 557 ghz line is confined to radial velocities in therange \pm 10-50 km/s but extended emission associated with the l1448-c extremehigh velocity (ehv) jet is also detected. the h2o 1_{10}-1_{01}/co(3-2) ratioshows strong variations as a function of velocity that likely reflect differentand changing physical conditions in the gas responsible for the emissions fromthe two species. in the ehv jet, a low h2o/sio abundance ratio is inferred,that could indicate molecular formation from dust free gas directly ejectedfrom the proto-stellar wind. we derive averaged tkin and n(h2) values of about300-500 k and 5 10^6 cm-3 respectively, while a water abundance with respect toh2 of the order of 0.5-1 10^{-6} along the outflow is estimated. the fairlyconstant conditions found all along the outflow implies that evolutionaryeffects on the timescales of outflow propagation do not play a major role inthe h2o chemistry. the results of our analysis show that the bulk of theobserved h2o lines comes from post-shocked regions where the gas, after beingheated to high temperatures, has been already cooled down to a few hundred k.the relatively low derived abundances, however, call for some mechanism todiminish the h2o gas in the post-shock region. among the possible scenarios, wefavor h2o photodissociation, which requires the superposition of a low velocitynon-dissociative shock with a fast dissociative shock able to produce a fuvfield of sufficient strength.

1302.1410	water vapor in the protoplanetary disk of dg tau	water is key in the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation ofcomets and icy/water planets. while high excitation water lines originating inthe hot inner disk have been detected in several t tauri stars (ttss), watervapor from the outer disk, where most of water ice reservoir is stored, wasonly reported in the closeby tts tw hya. we present spectrally resolvedherschel/hifi observations of the young tts dg tau in the ortho- and para-water ground-state transitions at 557, 1113 ghz. the lines show a narrowdouble-peaked profile, consistent with an origin in the outer disk, and are~19-26 times brighter than in tw hya. in contrast, co and [c ii] lines aredominated by emission from the envelope/outflow, which makes h2o lines a uniquetracer of the disk of dg tau. disk modeling with the thermo-chemical codeprodimo indicates that the strong uv field, due to the young age and strongaccretion of dg tau, irradiates a disk upper layer at 10-90 au from the star,heating it up to temperatures of 600 k and producing the observed bright waterlines. the models suggest a disk mass of 0.015-0.1 msun, consistent with theestimated minimum mass of the solar nebula before planet formation, and a waterreservoir of ~1e2-1e3 earth oceans in vapour, and ~100 times larger in the formof ice. hence, this detection supports the scenario of ocean delivery onterrestrial planets by impact of icy bodies forming in the outer disk.

1305.3471	evolution and excitation conditions of outflows in high-mass  star-forming regions	theoretical models suggest that massive stars form via disk-mediatedaccretion, with bipolar outflows playing a fundamental role. a recent studytoward massive molecular outflows has revealed a decrease of the sio lineintensity as the object evolves. the present study aims at characterizing thevariation of the molecular outflow properties with time, and at studying thesio excitation conditions in outflows associated with massive ysos. we used theiram30m telescope to map 14 massive star-forming regions in the sio(2-1),sio(5-4) and hco+(1-0) outflow lines, and in several dense gas and hot coretracers. hi-gal data was used to improve the spectral energy distributions andthe l/m ratio, which is believed to be a good indicator of the evolutionarystage of the yso. we detect sio and hco+ outflow emission in all the sources,and bipolar structures in six of them. the outflow parameters are similar tothose found toward other massive ysos. we find an increase of the hco+ outflowenergetics as the object evolve, and a decrease of the sio abundance with time,from 10^(-8) to 10^(-9). the sio(5-4) to (2-1) line ratio is found to be low atthe ambient gas velocity, and increases as we move to high velocities,indicating that the excitation conditions of the sio change with the velocityof the gas (with larger densities and/or temperatures for the high-velocity gascomponent). the properties of the sio and hco+ outflow emission suggest ascenario in which sio is largely enhanced in the first evolutionary stages,probably due to strong shocks produced by the protostellar jet. as the objectevolves, the power of the jet would decrease and so does the sio abundance.during this process, however, the material surrounding the protostar would havebeen been swept up by the jet, and the outflow activity, traced by entrainedmolecular material (hco+), would increase with time.

1308.6478	broad n2h+ emission towards the protostellar shock l1157-b1	we present the first detection of n2h+ towards a low-mass protostellaroutflow, namely the l1157-b1 shock, at about 0.1 pc from the protostellarcocoon. the detection was obtained with the iram 30-m antenna. we observedemission at 93 ghz due to the j = 1-0 hyperfine lines. the analysis of theemission coupled with the hifi chess multiline co observations leads to theconclusion that the observed n2h+(1-0) line originates from the dense (&gt; 10^5cm-3) gas associated with the large (20-25 arcsec) cavities opened by theprotostellar wind. we find a n2h+ column density of few 10^12 cm-2corresponding to an abundance of (2-8) 10^-9. the n2h+ abundance can be matchedby a model of quiescent gas evolved for more than 10^4 yr, i.e. for more thanthe shock kinematical age (about 2000 yr). modelling of c-shocks confirms thatthe abundance of n2h+ is not increased by the passage of the shock. in summary,n2h+ is a fossil record of the pre-shock gas, formed when the density of thegas was around 10^4 cm-3, and then further compressed and accelerated by theshock.

1310.7365	deuterated water in the solar-type protostars ngc 1333 iras 4a and iras  4b	aims. the aim of this paper is to study deuterated water in the solar-typeprotostars ngc1333 iras4a and iras4b, to compare their hdo abundancedistribution with other star-forming regions, and to constrain their hdo/h2oratios. methods. using the herschel/hifi instrument as well as ground-basedtelescopes, we observed several hdo lines covering a large excitation range(eup/k=22-168 k) towards these protostars and an outflow position. non-lteradiative transfer codes were then used to determine the hdo abundance profilesin these sources. results. the hdo fundamental line profiles show a very broadcomponent, tracing the molecular outflows, in addition to a narrower emissioncomponent and a narrow absorbing component. in the protostellar envelope ofngc1333 iras4a, the hdo inner (t&gt;100 k) and outer (t&lt;100 k) abundances withrespect to h2 are estimated at 7.5x10^{-9} and 1.2x10^{-11}, respectively,whereas, in ngc1333 iras4b, they are 1.0x10^{-8} and 1.2x10^{-10},respectively. similarly to the low-mass protostar iras16293-2422, an absorbingouter layer with an enhanced abundance of deuterated water is required toreproduce the absorbing components seen in the fundamental lines at 465 and 894ghz in both sources. this water-rich layer is probably extended enough toencompass the two sources as well as parts of the outflows. in the outflowsemanating from ngc1333 iras4a, the hdo column density is estimated at about(2-4)x10^{13} cm^{-2}, leading to an abundance of about (0.7-1.9)x10^{-9}. anhdo/h2o ratio between 7x10^{-4} and 9x10^{-2} is derived in the outflows. inthe warm inner regions of these two sources, we estimate the hdo/h2o ratios atabout 1x10^{-4}-4x10^{-3}. this ratio seems higher (a few %) in the coldenvelope of iras4a, whose possible origin is discussed in relation to formationprocesses of hdo and h2o.

1401.6672	first results from the calypso iram-pdbi survey - iii. monopolar jets  driven by a proto-binary system in ngc1333-iras2a	context: the earliest evolutionary stages of low-mass protostars arecharacterised by hot and fast jets which remove angular momentum from thecircumstellar disk, thus allowing mass accretion onto the central object.however, the launch mechanism is still being debated. aims: we would like toexploit high-angular (~ 0.8") resolution and high-sensitivity images toinvestigate the origin of protostellar jets using typical molecular tracers ofshocked regions, such as sio and so. methods: we mapped the inner 22" of thengc1333-iras2a protostar in sio(5-4), so(65-54), and the continuum emission at1.4 mm using the iram plateau de bure interferometer in the framework of thecalypso iram large program. results: for the first time, we disentangle thengc1333-iras2a class 0 object into a proto-binary system revealing twoprotostars (mm1, mm2) separated by ~ 560 au, each of them driving their ownjet, while past work considered a single protostar with a quadrupolar outflow.we reveal (i) a clumpy, fast (up to |v-vlsr| &gt; 50 km/s), and blueshifted jetemerging from the brightest mm1 source, and (ii) a slower redshifted jet,driven by mm2. silicon monoxide emission is a powerful tracer ofhigh-excitation (tkin &gt; 100 k; n(h2) &gt; 10^5 cm-3) jets close to the launchingregion. at the highest velocities, so appears to mimic sio tracing the jets,whereas at velocities close to the systemic one, so is dominated by extendedemission, tracing the cavity opened by the jet. conclusions: both jets areintrinsically monopolar, and intermittent in time. the dynamical time of thesio clumps is &lt; 30-90 yr, indicating that one-sided ejections from protostarscan take place on these timescales.

1409.4181	sio excitation from dense shocks in the earliest stages of massive star  formation	molecular outflows are a direct consequence of accretion, and therefore theyrepresent one of the best tracers of accretion processes in the still poorlyunderstood early phases of high-mass star formation. previous studies suggestedthat the sio abundance decreases with the evolution of a massive young stellarobject probably because of a decay of jet activity, as witnessed in low-massstar-forming regions. we investigate the sio excitation conditions and itsabundance in outflows from a sample of massive young stellar objects throughobservations of the sio(8-7) and co(4-3) lines with the apex telescope. througha non-lte analysis, we find that the excitation conditions of sio increase withthe velocity of the emitting gas. we also compute the sio abundance through thesio and co integrated intensities at high velocities. for the sources in oursample we find no significant variation of the sio abundance with evolution fora bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio of between 4 and 50 $l_\odot/m_\odot$. wealso find a weak increase of the sio(8-7) luminosity with the bolometricluminosity-to-mass ratio. we speculate that this might be explained with anincrease of density in the gas traced by sio. we find that the densitiesconstrained by the sio observations require the use of shock models thatinclude grain-grain processing. for the first time, such models are comparedand found to be compatible with sio observations. a pre-shock density of$10^5\, $cm$^{-3}$ is globally inferred from these comparisons. shocks with avelocity higher than 25 km s$^{-1}$ are invoked for the objects in our samplewhere the sio is observed with a corresponding velocity dispersion. ourcomparison of shock models with observations suggests that sputtering ofsilicon-bearing material (corresponding to less than 10% of the total siliconabundance) from the grain mantles is occurring.

1410.8453	the density structure of the l1157 molecular outflow	we present a multiline cs survey towards the brightest bow-shock b1 in theprototypical chemically active protostellar outflow l1157. we made use of(sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the chemical herschel surveys ofstar forming regions (chess) and astrochemical surveys at iram (asai) keyscience programs. we detected $^{12}$c$^{32}$s, $^{12}$c$^{34}$s,$^{13}$c$^{32}$s, and $^{12}$c$^{33}$s emissions, for a total of 18transitions, with $e_{\rm u}$ up to $\sim$ 180 k. the unprecedented sensitivityof the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealinghigh-velocity emission, up to 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic. theprofiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that areremarkably similar to what previously found using co. these components havebeen related to the cavity walls produced by the $\sim$ 2000 yr b1 shock andthe older ($\sim$ 4000 yr) b2 shock, respectively. the combination of low- andhigh-excitation cs emission was used to properly sample the different physicalcomponents expected in a shocked region. our cs observations show that thismolecule is highlighting the dense, $n_{\rm h_2}$ = 1--5 $\times$ 10$^{5}$cm$^{-3}$, cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in l1157. in addition,the highest excitation (e$_u$ $\geq$ 130 k) cs lines provide us with thesignature of denser (1--5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, associated with amolecular reformation zone of a dissociative j-type shock, which is expected toarise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities. the csfractional abundance increases up to $\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ in all the kinematicalcomponents. this value is consistent with what previously found forprototypical protostars and it is in agreement with the prediction of theabundances obtained via the chemical code astrochem.

1412.8318	astrochemistry at work in the l1157-b1 shock: acetaldehyde formation	the formation of complex organic molecules (coms) in protostellarenvironments is a hotly debated topic. in particular, the relative importanceof the gas phase processes as compared to a direct formation of coms on thedust grain surfaces is so far unknown. we report here the first high-resolutionimages of acetaldehyde (ch$_3$cho) emission towards the chemically richprotostellar shock l1157-b1, obtained at 2 mm with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer. six blueshifted ch$_3$cho lines with $e_{\rm u}$ = 26-35 k havebeen detected. the acetaldehyde spatial distribution follows the young ($\sim$2000 yr) outflow cavity produced by the impact of the jet with the ambientmedium, indicating that this com is closely associated with the region enrichedby iced species evaporated from dust mantles and released into the gas phase. ahigh ch$_3$cho relative abundance, 2-3 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$, is inferred,similarly to what found in hot-corinos. astrochemical modelling indicates thatgas phase reactions can produce the observed quantity of acetaldehyde only if alarge fraction of carbon, of the order of 0.1%, is locked into icedhydrocarbons.

1412.8611	complex organic molecules in protostellar environments in the ska era	molecular complexity builds up at each step of the sun-like star formationprocess, starting from simple molecules and ending up in large polyatomicspecies. complex organic molecules (coms; such as methyl formate, hcooch$_3$,dymethyl ether, ch$_3$och$_3$, formamide, nh$_2$cho, or glycoaldehyde,hcoch$_2$oh) are formed in all the components of the star formation recipe(e.g. pre-stellar cores, hot-corinos, circumstellar disks, shocks induced byfast jets), due to ice grain mantle sublimation or sputtering as well asgas-phase reactions. understanding in great detail the involved processes islikely the only way to predict the ultimate molecular complexity reached in theism, as the detection of large molecules is increasingly more difficult withthe increase of the number of atoms constituting them.  thanks to the recent spectacular progress of astronomical observations, dueto the herschel (sub-mm and ir), iram and sma (mm and sub-mm), and nrao (cm)telescopes, an enormous activity is being developed in the field ofastrochemistry, extending from astronomical observatories to chemicallaboratories. we are involved in several observational projects providingunbiased spectral surveys (in the 80-300 and 500-2000 ghz ranges) withunprecedented sensitivity of templates of dense cores and protostars. forestsof com lines have been detected. in this chapter we will focus on the chemistryof both cold prestellar cores and hot shocked regions, (i) reviewing resultsand open questions provided by mm-fir observations, and (ii) showing the needof carrying on the observations of coms at lower frequencies, where ska willoperate. we will also emphasize the importance of analysing the spectra by thelight of the experimental studies performed by our team, who is investigatingthe chemical effects induced by ionising radiation bombarding astrophysicallyrelevant ices.

1501.03681	[oi]63micron jets in class 0 sources detected by herschel	we present herschel pacs mapping observations of the [oi]63 micron linetowards protostellar outflows in the l1448, ngc1333-iras4, hh46, bhr71 andvla1623 star forming regions. we detect emission spatially resolved along theoutflow direction, which can be associated with a low excitation atomic jet. inthe l1448-c, hh46 irs and bhr71 irs1 outflows this emission is kinematicallyresolved into blue- and red-shifted jet lobes, having radial velocities up to200 km/s. in the l1448-c atomic jet the velocity increases with the distancefrom the protostar, similarly to what observed in the sio jet associated withthis source. this suggests that [oi] and molecular gas are kinematicallyconnected and that this latter could represent the colder cocoon of a jet athigher excitation. mass flux rates (\.m$_{jet}$(oi)) have been measured fromthe [oi]63micron luminosity adopting two independent methods. we find values inthe range 1-4 10$^{-7}$ mo/yr for all sources but hh46, for which an order ofmagnitude higher value is estimated. \.m$_{jet}$(oi) are compared with massaccretion rates (\.m$_{acc}$) onto the protostar and with \.m$_{jet}$ derivedfrom ground-based co observations. \.m$_{jet}$(oi)/\.m$_{acc}$ ratios are inthe range 0.05-0.5, similar to the values for more evolved sources.\.m$_{jet}$(oi) in hh46 irs and iras4a are comparable to \.m$_{jet}$(co), whilethose of the remaining sources are significantly lower than the corresponding\.m$_{jet}$(co). we speculate that for these three sources most of the massflux is carried out by a molecular jet, while the warm atomic gas does notsignificantly contribute to the dynamics of the system.

1502.05762	shedding light on the formation of the pre-biotic molecule formamide  with asai	formamide (nh2cho) has been proposed as a pre-biotic precursor with a keyrole in the emergence of life on earth. while this molecule has been observedin space, most of its detections correspond to high-mass star-forming regions.motivated by this lack of investigation in the low-mass regime, we searched forformamide, as well as isocyanic acid (hnco), in 10 low- and intermediate-masspre-stellar and protostellar objects. the present work is part of the iramlarge programme asai (astrochemical surveys at iram), which makes use ofunbiased broadband spectral surveys at millimetre wavelengths. we detected hncoin all the sources and nh2cho in five of them. we derived their abundances andanalysed them together with those reported in the literature for high-masssources. for those sources with formamide detection, we found a tight andalmost linear correlation between hnco and nh2cho abundances, with their ratiobeing roughly constant -between 3 and 10- across 6 orders of magnitude inluminosity. this suggests the two species are chemically related. the sourceswithout formamide detection, which are also the coldest and devoid of hotcorinos, fall well off the correlation, displaying a much larger amount of hncorelative to nh2cho. our results suggest that, while hnco can be formed in thegas phase during the cold stages of star formation, nh2cho forms mostefficiently on the mantles of dust grains at these temperatures, where itremains frozen until the temperature rises enough to sublimate the icy grainmantles. we propose hydrogenation of hnco as a likely formation route leadingto nh2cho.

1505.05919	the jet and the disk of the hh 212 low-mass protostar imaged by alma: so  and so2 emission	to investigate the disk formation and jet launch in protostars is crucial tocomprehend the earliest stages of star and planet formation. we aim toconstrain the properties of the molecular jet and the disk of the hh 212protostellar system at unprecedented angular scales through alma observationsof sulfur-bearing molecules, so 9(8)-8(7), so 10(11)-10(10), so2 8(2,6)-7(1,7).so 9(8)-8(7) and so2 8(2,6)-7(1,7) show broad velocity profiles. at systemicvelocity they probe the circumstellar gas and the cavity walls. going from lowto high blue-/red-shifted velocities the emission traces the wide-angle outflowand the fast (~100-200 km/s) and collimated (~90 au) molecular jet revealingthe inner knots with timescales &lt;50 years. the jet transports a mass loss rate&gt;0.2-2e-6 msun/yr, implying high ejection efficiency (&gt;0.03-0.3). the so andso2 abundances in the jet are ~1e-7-1e-6. so 10(11)-10(10) emission is compactand shows small-scale velocity gradients indicating that it originates partlyfrom the rotating disk previously seen in hco+ and c17o, and partly from thebase of the jet. the disk mass is &gt;0.002-0.013 msun, and the so abundance inthe disk is ~1e-8-1e-7. so and so2 are effective tracers of the molecular jetin the inner few hundreds au from the protostar. their abundances indicate that1% - 40% of sulfur is in so and so2 due to shocks in the jet/outflow and/or toambipolar diffusion at the wind base. the so abundance in the disk is 3-4orders of magnitude larger than in evolved protoplanetary disks. this may bedue to an so enhancement in the accretion shock at the envelope-disk interfaceor in spiral shocks if the disk is partly gravitationally unstable.

1511.01428	jet multiplicity in the proto-binary system ngc1333-iras4a. the detailed  calypso iram-pdbi view	owing to the paucity of sub-arcsecond (sub)mm observations required to probethe innermost regions of newly forming protostars, several fundamentalquestions are still being debated, such as the existence and coevality of closemultiple systems. we study the physical and chemical properties of the jets andprotostellar sources in the ngc1333-iras4a proto-binary system using continuumemission and molecular tracers of shocked gas. we observed ngc1333-iras4a inthe sio(6-5), so(6_5-5_4), and co(2-1) lines and the continuum emission at 1.3,1.4, and 3 mm using the iram plateau de bure interferometer in the framework ofthe calypso large program. we clearly disentangle for the first time theoutflow emission from the two sources a1 and a2. the two protostellar jets havevery different properties: the a1 jet is faster, has a short dynamicaltimescale (&lt;10^3 yr), and is associated with h2 shocked emission, whereas thea2 jet, which dominates the large-scale emission, is associated with diffuseemission, bends, and emits at slower velocities. the observed bending of the a2jet is consistent with the change of propagation direction observed at largescale and suggests jet precession on very short timescales (~200-600 yr). inaddition, a chemically rich spectrum with emission from several coms (e.g.hcooh, ch3ocho, ch3och3) is only detected towards a2. finally, veryhigh-velocity shocked emission (~50 km s^-1) is observed along the a1 jet. anlte analysis shows that sio, so, and h2co abundances in the gas phase areenhanced up to (3-4)x10^{-7}, (1.4-1.7)x10^{-6}, and (3-7.9)x10^{-7},respectively. the intrinsic different properties of the jets and drivingsources in ngc1333-iras4a suggest different evolutionary stages for the twoprotostars, with a1 being younger than a2, in a very early stage of starformation previous to the hot-corino phase.

astro-ph;0505168	chemical differentiation along the cepa-east outflows	we present the results of a multiline survey at mm-wavelengths of the cepheusa star forming region. four main flows have been identified: three pointing inthe sw, ne, and se directions and accelerating high density cs clumps. thefourth outflow, revealed by high-sensitivity hdo observations, is pointingtowards south and is associated with conditions particularly favourable to achemical enrichment. the analysis of the line profiles shows that the siomolecule dominates at the highest velocities and at the highest excitationconditions, confirming its close association with shocks. h2s, so2, and sopreferentially trace more quiescent regions than sio, and in particular a lackof bright h2s emission at the highest velocities is found. ocs and h2cs emit atquite high velocities, where the abundances of three shock tracers like sio,ch3oh, and hdo are higher. these results may indicate that h2s is not the onlymajor sulphur carrier in the grain mantles, and that ocs and h2cs may probablyplay an important role on the grains; or that alternatively they rapidly formonce the mantle is evaporated after the passage of a shock. finally, theoutflow peak emission has been compared with recent time-dependent sulphurchemistry models: the results indicate that, if associated with accuratemeasurements of the physical conditions, the ch3oh/h2cs column density ratiocan be used as an effective chemical clock to date the age of shocked gas.

astro-ph;0605158	first evidence for molecular interfaces between outflows and ambient  cloud in high-mass star forming regions?	we present new observations of the cepa-east region of massive star formationand describe an extended and dynamically distinct feature not previouslyrecognised. this feature is present in emission from h2cs, ocs, ch3oh, and hdoat -5.5 km/s, but is not traced by conventional tracers of star forming regionsh2s, so2, so, cs. the feature is extended up to at least 0.1 pc. we show thatthe feature is neither a hot core nor a shocked outflow. however, the chemistryof the feature is consistent with predictions of a model of an erodinginterface between a fast wind and a dense core; mixing between the two mediaoccurs in the interface on a timescale of 10-50 years. if these observationsare confirmed by detailed maps and by detections in species also predicted tobe abundant (e.g. hco+, h2co, and nh3) this feature would be the firstdetection of such an interface in regions of massive star formation. animportant implication of the model is that a significant reservoir of sulfur ingrain mantles is required to be in the form of ocs.

astro-ph;0610037	warm sio gas in molecular bullets associated with protostellar outflows	in this paper we present the first sio multiline analysis (from j=2-1 toj=11-10) of the molecular bullets along the outflows of the class 0 sourcesl1448-mm and l1157-mm, obtained through observations with iram and jcmt. wehave computed the main physical parameters in each bullet and compared themwith other tracers of warm and dense gas and with models for the sio excitationin shocks. we find that the bullets close to l1448--mm, associated with highvelocity gas, have higher excitation conditions (n(h2) ~ 10^{6} cm^{-3}, t &gt;500 k) with respect to the l1157 bullets (n(h2) ~1-5 10^{5} cm^{-3}, t ~100-300 k). in both the sources, there is a clear evidence of the presence ofvelocity components having different excitation conditions, with the denserand/or warmer gas associated with the gas at the higher speed. in l1448 thebulk of the emission is due to the high-excitation and high velocity gas, whilein l1157 most of the emission comes from the low excitation gas at ambientvelocity. the observed velocity-averaged line ratios are well reproduced byshocks with speeds v_s larger than ~ 30 km/s and densities ~ 10^{5} - 10^{6}cm^{-3}. plane-parallel shock models, however, fail to predict all the observedline profiles and in particular the very similar profiles shown by both low andhigh excitation lines. the overall observations support the idea that the l1157clumps are shock interaction events older than the l1448 bullets close to thedriving source. in the latter objects, the velocity structure and thevariations of physical parameters with the velocity resemble very closely thosefound in optical/ir jets near the protostar, suggesting that similar launchingand excitation mechanisms are also at the origin of collimated jets seen atmillimetre wavelengths.
