0903.5493	a chandra study of the rosette star-forming complex. ii. clusters in the  rosette molecular cloud	we explore here the young stellar populations in the rosette molecular cloud(rmc) region with high spatial resolution x-ray images from the chandra x-rayobservatory, which are effective in locating weak-lined t tauri stars as wellas disk-bearing young stars. a total of 395 x-ray point sources are detected,299 of which (76%) have an optical or near-infrared (nir) counterpartidentified from deep flamingos images. from x-ray and mass sensitivity limits,we infer a total population of about 1700 young stars in the survey region.based on smoothed stellar surface density maps, we investigate the spatialdistribution of the x-ray sources and define three distinctive structures andsubstructures within them. structures b and c are associated with previouslyknown embedded ir clusters, while structure a is a new x-ray-identifiedunobscured cluster. a high mass protostar rmcx #89 = iras 06306+0437 and itsassociated sparse cluster is studied. the different subregions are not coevalbut do not show a simple spatial-age pattern. disk fractions vary betweensubregions and are generally 20% of the total stellar population inferred fromthe x-ray survey. the data are consistent with speculations that triggered starformation around the hii region is present in the rmc, but do not support asimple sequential triggering process through the cloud interior. while asignificant fraction of young stars are located in a distributed populationthroughout the rmc region, it is not clear they originated in clusteredenvironments.

0904.4907	protoplanetary disk evolution around the triggered star forming region  cepheus b	the cepheus b (cepb) molecular cloud and a portion of the nearby cepob3b obassociation, one of the most active regions of star formation within 1 kpc,have been observed with the irac detector on board the spitzer space telescope.the goals are to study protoplanetary disk evolution and processes ofsequential triggered star formation in the region. out of ~400 pre-mainsequence (pms) stars selected with an earlier chandra x-ray observatoryobservation, 95% are identified with mid-infrared sources and most of these areclassified as diskless or disk-bearing stars. the discovery of the additional&gt;200 ir-excess low-mass members gives a combined chandra+spitzer pms samplecomplete down to 0.5 mo outside of the cloud, and somewhat above 1 mo in thecloud. analyses of the nearly disk-unbiased combined chandra+spitzer selectedstellar sample give several results. our major finding is a spatio-temporalgradient of young stars from the hot molecular core towards the primaryionizing o star hd 217086. this strongly supports the radiation drivenimplosion (rdi) model of triggered star formation in the region. the empiricalestimate for the shock velocity of 1 km/s is very similar to theoretical modelsof rdi in shocked molecular clouds...abridged... other results include: 1.agreement of the disk fractions, their mass dependency, and fractions oftransition disks with other clusters; 2. confirmation of the youthfulness ofthe embedded cepb cluster; 3. confirmation of the effect of suppression oftime-integrated x-ray emission in disk-bearing versus diskless systems.

0905.0716	stellar clusters in the ngc 6334 star forming complex	the full stellar population of ngc 6334, one of the most spectacular regionsof massive star formation in the nearby galaxy, have not been well-sampled inpast studies. we analyze here a mosaic of two chandra x-ray observatory imagesof the region using sensitive data analysis methods, giving a list of 1607faint x-ray sources with arcsecond positions and approximate line-of-sightabsorption. about 95 percent of these are expected to be cluster members, mostlower mass pre-main sequence stars. extrapolating to low x-ray levels, thetotal stellar population is estimated to be 20-30,000 pre-main sequence stars.the x-ray sources show a complicated spatial pattern with about 10 distinctstar clusters. the heavily-obscured clusters are mostly associated withpreviously known far-infrared sources and radio hii regions. thelightly-obscured clusters are mostly newly identified in the x-ray images.dozens of likely ob stars are found, both in clusters and dispersed throughoutthe region, suggesting that star formation in the complex has proceeded overmillions of years. a number of extraordinarily heavily absorbed x-ray sourcesare associated with the active regions of star formation.

0912.0202	methods for estimating fluxes and absorptions of faint x-ray sources	x-ray sources with very few counts can be identified with low-noise x-raydetectors such as acis onboard the chandra x-ray observatory. these sources areoften too faint for parametric spectral modeling using well-established methodssuch as fitting with xspec. we discuss the estimation of apparent and intrinsicbroad-band x-ray fluxes and soft x-ray absorption from gas along the line ofsight to these sources, using nonparametric methods. apparent flux is estimatedfrom the ratio of the source count rate to the instrumental effective areaaveraged over the chosen band. absorption, intrinsic flux, and errors on thesequantities are estimated from comparison of source photometric quantities withthose of high s/n spectra that were simulated using spectral modelscharacteristic of the class of astrophysical sources under study. the conceptof this method is similar to the long-standing use of color-magnitude diagramsin optical and infrared astronomy, with x-ray median energy replacing colorindex and x-ray source counts replacing magnitude. our nonparametric method istested against the apparent spectra of 2000 faint sources in the chandraobservation of the rich young stellar cluster in the m17 hii region. we showthat the intrinsic x-ray properties can be determined with little bias andreasonable accuracy using these observable photometric quantities withoutemploying often uncertain and time-consuming methods of non-linear parametricspectral modeling. our method is calibrated for thermal spectra characteristicof stars in young stellar clusters, but recalibration should be possible forsome other classes of faint x-ray sources such as extragalactic agn.

1003.2397	innovations in the analysis of chandra-acis observations	as members of the instrument team for the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer(acis) on nasa's chandra x-ray observatory and as chandra general observers, wehave developed a wide variety of data analysis methods that we believe areuseful to the chandra community, and have constructed a significant body ofpublicly-available software (the acis extract package) addressing importantacis data and science analysis tasks. this paper seeks to describe these dataanalysis methods for two purposes: to document the data analysis work performedin our own science projects, and to help other acis observers judge whetherthese methods may be useful in their own projects (regardless of what tools andprocedures they choose to implement those methods).  the acis data analysis recommendations we offer here address much of theworkflow in a typical acis project, including data preparation, point sourcedetection via both wavelet decomposition and image reconstruction, maskingpoint sources, identification of diffuse structures, event extraction for bothpoint and diffuse sources, merging extractions from multiple observations,nonparametric broad-band photometry, analysis of low-count spectra, andautomation of these tasks. many of the innovations presented here arise fromseveral, often interwoven, complications that are found in many chandraprojects: large numbers of point sources (hundreds to several thousand), faintpoint sources, misaligned multiple observations of an astronomical field, pointsource crowding, and scientifically relevant diffuse emission.

1004.4148	cross-disciplinary research in astronomy	in the distant past, astronomy was often intertwined with religion into aunified cosmos. as science became a distinct cultural enterprise, astronomy haswitnessed a variety of rich interactions with other fields. mathematicalstatistics was stimulated in the 19th century by astronomical problems, andtoday astrostatistics is a small but growing cross-disciplinary field advancingmethodology to address challenges in astronomical data analysis. throughout the20th century, astronomy became closely allied with physics such that astronomyand astrophysics are now profoundly intertwined. physical chemistry played amajor role in the identification of molecules in the milky way galaxy, andastrochemistry is now an active subfield giving insights into cosmic molecularprocesses. the importance of cross-disciplinary interactions with engineering(for instrumentation), earth sciences (for planetary studies), computer science(for astroinformatics) and life sciences (for astrobiology) is also growing.cross-disciplinary research has been essential both for crucial discoveries inastronomy and for improving the quality of astronomical research. it should befostered with increased flexibility in the training of young astronomers andwith sufficient funding to nurture these fields.

1010.5434	a chandra observation of the obscured star-forming complex w40	the young stellar cluster illuminating the w40 h ii region, one of thenearest massive star forming regions, has been observed with the acis detectoron board the chandra x-ray observatory. due to its high obscuration, this is apoorly-studied stellar cluster with only a handful of bright stars visible inthe optical band, including three ob stars identified as primary excitationsources. we detect 225 x-ray sources, of which 85% are confidently identifiedas young stellar members of the region. two potential distances of the cluster,260 pc and 600 pc, are used in the paper. supposing the x-ray luminosityfunction to be universal, it supports a 600 pc distance as a lower limit forw40 and a total population of at least 600 stars down to 0.1 mo under theassumption of a coeval population with a uniform obscuration. in fact, there isstrong spatial variation in ks-band-excess disk fraction and non-uniformobscuration due to a dust lane that is identified in absorption in optical,infrared and x-ray. the dust lane is likely part of a ring of material whichincludes the molecular core within w40. in contrast to the likely ongoing starformation in the dust lane, the molecular core is inactive. the star clusterhas a spherical morphology, an isothermal sphere density profile, and masssegregation down to 1.5 mo. however, other cluster properties, including a\leq{1} myr age estimate and ongoing star formation, indicate that the clusteris not dynamically relaxed. x-ray diffuse emission and a powerful flare from ayoung stellar object are also reported.

1102.4779	an introduction to the chandra carina complex project	the great nebula in carina provides an exceptional view into the violentmassive star formation and feedback that typifies giant hii regions andstarburst galaxies. we have mapped the carina star-forming complex in x-rays,using archival chandra data and a mosaic of 20 new 60ks pointings using thechandra x-ray observatory's advanced ccd imaging spectrometer, as a testbed forunderstanding recent and ongoing star formation and to probe carina's regionsof bright diffuse x-ray emission. this study has yielded a catalog ofproperties of &gt;14,000 x-ray point sources; &gt;9800 of them have multiwavelengthcounterparts. using chandra's unsurpassed x-ray spatial resolution, we haveseparated these point sources from the extensive, spatially-complex diffuseemission that pervades the region; x-ray properties of this diffuse emissionsuggest that it traces feedback from carina's massive stars. in thisintroductory paper, we motivate the survey design, describe the chandraobservations, and present some simple results, providing a foundation for the15 papers that follow in this special issue and that present detailed catalogs,methods, and science results.

1103.0785	a chandra acis study of the young star cluster trumpler 15 in carina and  correlation with near-infrared sources	using the highest-resolution x-ray observation of the trumpler 15 starcluster taken by the chandra x-ray observatory, we estimate the total size ofits stellar population by comparing the x-ray luminosity function of thedetected sources to a calibrator cluster, and identify for the first time asignificant fraction (~14%) of its individual members. the highest-resolutionnear-ir observation of trumpler 15 (taken by the hawk-i instrument on the vlt)was found to detect most of our x-ray selected sample of cluster members, witha k-excess disk frequency of 3.8+-0.7%. the near-ir data, x-ray luminosityfunction, and published spectral types of the brightest members support acluster age estimate (5-10 myr) that is older than those for the nearbytrumpler 14 and trumpler 16 clusters, and suggest that high-mass members mayhave already exploded as supernovae. the morphology of the inner ~0.7 pc coreof the cluster is found to be spherical. however, the outer regions (beyond 2pc) are elongated, forming an `envelope' of stars that, in projection, appearsto connect trumpler 15 to trumpler 14; this morphology supports the view thatthese clusters are physically associated. clear evidence of mass segregation isseen. this study appears in a special issue of the apjs devoted to the chandracarina complex project (cccp), a 1.42 square degree chandra x-ray survey of thegreat nebula in carina.

1103.0802	x-ray star clusters in the carina complex	the distribution of young stars found in the chandra carina complex project(cccp) is examined for clustering structure. x-ray surveys are advantageous foridentifying young stellar populations compared to optical and infrared surveysin suffering less contamination from nebular emission and galactic field stars.the analysis is based on smoothed maps of a spatially complete subsample ofabout 3000 brighter x-ray sources classified as carina members, and about10,000 stars from the full cccp sample. the principal known clusters arerecovered, and some additional smaller groups are identified. no rich embeddedclusters are present, although a number of sparse groups are found. the cccpreveals considerable complexity in clustering properties. the trumpler 14 and15 clusters have rich stellar populations in unimodal, centrally concentratedstructures several parsecs across. non-spherical internal structure is seen,and large-scale low surface density distributions surround these rich clusters.trumpler 16, in contrast, is comprised of several smaller clusters within acircular boundary. collinder 228 is a third type of cluster which extends overtens of parsecs with many sparse compact groups likely arising from triggeredstar formation processes. a widely dispersed, but highly populous, distributionof x-ray stars across the about 50 pc cccp mosaic supports a model of pastgenerations of star formation in the region. collinder 234, a group of massivestars without an associated cluster of pre-main sequence stars, may be part ofthis dispersed population.

0710.0090	the diverse stellar populations of the w3 star forming complex	an 800 sq-arcmin mosaic image of the w3 star forming complex obtained withthe chandra x-ray observatory gives a valuable new view of the spatialstructure of its young stellar populations. the chandra image reveals about1300 faint x-ray sources, most of which are pms stars in the cloud. some, butnot all, of the high-mass stars producing hypercompact and ultracompact h ii(uchii) regions are also seen, as reported in a previous study.  the chandra images reveal three dramatically different embedded stellarpopulations. the w3 main cluster extends over 7 pc with about 900 x-ray starsin a nearly-spherical distribution centered on the well-studied uchii regionsand high-mass protostars. the cluster surrounding the prototypical uchii regionw3(oh) shows a much smaller (&lt;0.6 pc), asymmetrical, and clumpy distribution ofabout 50 pms stars. the massive star ionizing the w3 north h ii region iscompletely isolated without any accompanying pms stars. in w3 main, theinferred ages of the widely distributed pms stars are significantly older thanthe inferred ages of the central ob stars illuminating the uchiis. we suggestthat different formation mechanisms are necessary to explain the diversity ofthe w3 stellar populations: cluster-wide gravitational collapse with delayed obstar formation in w3 main, collect-and-collapse triggering by shock fronts inw3(oh), and a runaway o star or isolated massive star formation in w3 north.

0711.2024	a chandra study of the rosette star-forming complex. i. the stellar  population and structure of the young open cluster ngc 2244	we present the first high spatial resolution chandra x-ray study of ngc 2244,the 2 myr old stellar cluster immersed in the rosette nebula. over 900 x-raysources are detected; 77% have optical or flamingos near-infrared (nir) stellarcounterparts and are mostly previously uncatalogued young stellar clustermembers. all known ob stars with spectral type earlier than b1 are detected andthe x-ray selected stellar population is estimated to be nearly completebetween 0.5 and 3 msun. the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) ranges from29.4&lt;loglx&lt;32 ergs/s in the hard (2-8kev) band. by comparing the ngc 2244 andorion nebula cluster xlfs, we estimate a total population of 2000 stars in ngc2244. a number of further results emerge from our analysis: the xlf and theassociated k-band luminosity function indicate a normal salpeter initial massfunction (imf) for ngc 2244. this is inconsistent with the top-heavy imfreported from earlier optical studies that lacked a good census of &lt;4msunstars. the spatial distribution of x-ray stars is strongly concentrated aroundthe central o5 star, hd 46150. the other early o star, hd 46223, has fewcompanions. the cluster's stellar radial density profile shows two distinctivestructures. this double structure, combined with the absence of masssegregation, indicates that this cluster is not in dynamical equilibrium. thespatial distribution of x-ray selected k-excess disk stars and embedded starsis asymmetric with an apparent deficit towards the north. the fraction ofx-ray-selected cluster members with k-band excesses caused by innerprotoplanetary disks is 6%, slightly lower than the 10% disk fraction estimatedfrom the flamingos study based on the nir-selected sample. this is due to thehigh efficiency of x-ray surveys in locating disk-free t tauri stars.[abridged]

1208.1471	the elephant trunk nebula and the trumpler 37 cluster: contribution of  triggered star formation to the total population of an hii region	rich young stellar clusters produce hii regions whose expansion into thenearby molecular cloud is thought to trigger the formation of new stars.however, the importance of this mode of star formation is uncertain. thisinvestigation seeks to quantify triggered star formation (tsf) in ic 1396a(a.k.a., the elephant trunk nebula), a bright rimmed cloud (brc) on theperiphery of the nearby giant hii region ic 1396 produced by the trumpler 37cluster. x-ray selection of young stars from chandra x-ray observatory data iscombined with existing optical and infrared surveys to give a more completecensus of the tsf population. over 250 young stars in and around ic 1396a areidentified; this doubles the previously known population. a spatio-temporalgradient of stars from the ic 1396a cloud toward the primary ionizing star hd206267 is found. we argue that the tsf mechanism in ic 1396a is theradiation-driven implosion process persisting over several million years.analysis of the x-ray luminosity and initial mass functions indicates that &gt;140stars down to 0.1 msun were formed by tsf. considering other brcs in the ic1396 hii region, we estimate the tsf contribution for the entire hii regionexceeds 14-25% today, and may be higher over the lifetime of the hii region.such triggering on the periphery of hii regions may be a significant mode ofstar formation in the galaxy.

1303.1226	the progression of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud	using spitzer space telescope and chandra x-ray observatory data, we identifyysos in the rosette molecular cloud (rmc). by being able to select clustermembers and classify them into yso types, we are able to track the progressionof star formation locally within the cluster environments and globally withinthe cloud. we employ nearest neighbor method (nnm) analysis to explore thedensity structure of the clusters and yso ratio mapping to study ageprogressions in the cloud. we find a relationship between the yso ratios andextinction which suggests star formation occurs preferentially in the densestparts of the cloud and that the column density of gas rapidly decreases as theregion evolves. this suggests rapid removal of gas may account for the low starformation efficiencies observed in molecular clouds. we find that the overallage spread across the rmc is small. our analysis suggests that star formationstarted throughout the complex around the same time. age gradients in the cloudappear to be localized and any effect the hii region has on the star formationhistory is secondary to that of the primordial collapse of the cloud.

1309.4490	a massive young star-forming complex study in infrared and x-ray:  mid-infrared observations and catalogs	spitzer irac observations and stellar photometric catalogs are presented forthe massive young star-forming complex study in the infrared and x-ray(mystix). mystix is a multiwavelength census of young stellar members of twentynearby (d &lt; 4 kpc), galactic, star-forming regions that contain at least one ostar. all regions have data available from the spitzer space telescope,consisting of glimpse or other published catalogs for eleven regions andresults of our own photometric analysis of archival data for the remaining nineregions. this paper seeks to construct deep and reliable catalogs of sourcesfrom the spitzer images. mid-infrared study of these regions faces challengesof crowding and high nebulosity. our new catalogs typically contain faintersources than existing spitzer studies, which improves the match rate to chandrax-ray sources that are likely to be young stars, but increases the possibilityof spurious point-source detections, especially peaks in the nebulosity. iraccolor-color diagrams help distinguish spurious detections of nebular pahemission from the infrared excess associated with dusty disks around youngstars. the distributions of sources on the mid-infrared color-magnitude andcolor-color diagrams reflect differences between mystix regions, includingastrophysical e?ects such as stellar ages and disk evolution.

1309.4491	bayesian matching for x-ray and infrared sources in the mystix project	identifying the infrared counterparts of x-ray sources in galactic planefields such as those of the mystix project presents particular difficulties dueto the high density of infrared sources. this high stellar density makes itinevitable that a large fraction of x-ray positions will have a faint fieldstar close to them, which standard matching techniques may incorrectly take tobe the counterpart. instead we use the infrared data to create a model of boththe field star and counterpart magnitude distributions, which we then combinewith a bayesian technique to yield a probability that any star is thecounterpart of an x-ray source. in our more crowded fields, between 10 and 20%of counterparts that would be identified on the grounds of being the closeststar to x-ray position within a 99% confidence error circle are insteadidentified by the bayesian technique as field stars. these stars arepreferentially concentrated at faint magnitudes. equally importantly thetechnique also gives a probability that the true counterpart to the x-raysource falls beneath the magnitude limit of the infrared catalog. in derivingour method, we place it in the context of other procedures for matchingastronomical catalogs.

1403.2741	age gradients in the stellar populations of massive star forming regions  based on a new stellar chronometer	a major impediment to understanding star formation in massive star formingregions (msfrs) is the absence of a reliable stellar chronometer to unraveltheir complex star formation histories. we present a new estimation of stellarages using a new method that employs near-infrared (nir) and x-ray photometry,agejx. stellar masses are derived from x-ray luminosities using the lx - massrelation from the taurus cloud. j-band luminosities are compared tomass-dependent pre-main-sequence evolutionary models to estimate ages. agejx issensitive to a wide range of evolutionary stages, from disk-bearing starsembedded in a cloud to widely dispersed older pre-main sequence stars. themystix (massive young star-forming complex study in infrared and x-ray) projectcharacterizes 20 ob-dominated msfrs using x-ray, mid-infrared, and nircatalogs. the agejx method has been applied to 5525 out of 31,784 mystixprobable complex members. we provide a homogeneous set of median ages for overa hundred subclusters in 15 msfrs; median subcluster ages range between 0.5 myrand 5 myr. the important science result is the discovery of age gradientsacross mystix regions. the wide msfr age distribution appears as spatiallysegregated structures with different ages. the agejx ages are youngest inobscured locations in molecular clouds, intermediate in revealed stellarclusters, and oldest in distributed populations. the nir color index j-h, asurrogate measure of extinction, can serve as an approximate age predictor foryoung embedded clusters.

1403.2742	core-halo age gradients and star formation in the orion nebula and  ngc~2024 young stellar clusters	we analyze age distributions of two nearby rich stellar clusters, the ngc2024 (flame nebula) and orion nebula cluster (onc) in the orion molecular cloudcomplex. our analysis is based on samples from the mystix survey and a newestimator of pre-main sequence (pms) stellar ages, agejx, derived from x-rayand near-infrared photometric data. to overcome the problem of uncertainindividual ages and large spreads of age distributions for entire clusters, wecompute median ages and their confidence intervals of stellar samples withinannular subregions of the clusters. we find core-halo age gradients in both thengc 2024 cluster and onc: pms stars in cluster cores appear younger and thuswere formed later than pms stars in cluster peripheries. these findings arefurther supported by the spatial gradients in the disk fraction and k-bandexcess frequency. our age analysis is based on agejx estimates for pms stars,and is independent of any consideration of ob stars. the result has importantimplications for the formation of young stellar clusters. one basic implicationis that clusters form slowly and the apparent age spreads in young stellarclusters, which are often controversial, are (at least in part) real. theresult further implies that simple models where clusters form inside-out areincorrect, and more complex models are needed. we provide several starformation scenarios that alone or in combination may lead to the observedcore-halo age gradients.

1403.4252	the spatial structure of young stellar clusters. i. subclusters	the clusters of young stars in massive star-forming regions show a wide rangeof sizes, morphologies, and numbers of stars. their highly subclusteredstructures are revealed by the mystix project's sample of 31,754 young stars innearby sites of star formation (regions at distances &lt;3.6 kpc that contain atleast one o-type star.) in 17 of the regions surveyed by mystix, we identifysubclusters of young stars using finite mixture models -- collections ofisothermal ellipsoids that model individual subclusters. maximum likelihoodestimation is used to estimate the model parameters, and the akaike informationcriterion is used to determine the number of subclusters. this procedure oftensuccessfully finds famous subclusters, such as the bn/kl complex behind theorion nebula cluster and the kw-object complex in m17. a catalog of 142subclusters is presented, with 1 to 20 subclusters per region. the subclustercore radius distribution for this sample is peaked at 0.17 pc with a standarddeviation of 0.43 dex, and subcluster core radius is negatively correlated withgas/dust absorption of the stars -- a possible age effect. based on themorphological arrangements of subclusters, we identify four classes of spatialstructure: long chains of subclusters, clumpy structures, isolated clusterswith a core-halo structure, and isolated clusters well fit by a singleisothermal ellipsoid.

1501.05300	the spatial structure of young stellar clusters. ii. total young stellar  populations	we investigate the intrinsic stellar populations (estimated total numbers ofob and pre-main-sequence stars down to 0.1 mo) that are present in 17 massivestar-forming regions (msfrs) surveyed by the mystix project. the study is basedon the catalog of &gt;31,000 mystix probable complex members with bothdisk-bearing and disk-free populations, compensating for extinction,nebulosity, and crowding effects. correction for observational sensitivities ismade using the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) and the near-infrared initialmass function (imf)--a correction that is often not made by infrared surveys ofyoung stars. the resulting maps of the projected structure of the young stellarpopulations, in units of intrinsic stellar surface density, allow directcomparison between different regions. several regions have multiple denseclumps, similar in size and density to the orion nebula cluster. the highestprojected density of ~34,000 stars/pc^2 is found in the core of the rcw38cluster. histograms of surface density show different ranges of values indifferent regions, supporting the conclusion of bressert et al.

1507.05653	the spatial structure of young stellar clusters. iii. physical  properties and evolutionary states	we analyze the physical properties of stellar clusters that are detected inmassive star-forming regions in the mystix project--a comparative,multiwavelength study of young stellar clusters within 3.6 kpc that contain atleast one o-type star. tabulated properties of subclusters in these regionsinclude physical sizes and shapes, intrinsic numbers of stars, absorptions bythe molecular clouds, and median subcluster ages. physical signs of dynamicalevolution are present in the relations of these properties, includingstatistically significant correlations between subcluster size, centraldensity, and age, which are likely the result of cluster expansion after gasremoval. we argue that many of the subclusters identified in paper i aregravitationally bound because their radii are significantly less than whatwould be expected from freely expanding clumps of stars with a typical initialstellar velocity dispersion of ~3 km/s for star-forming regions. we explore amodel for cluster formation in which structurally simpler clusters are built uphierarchically through the mergers of subclusters--subcluster mergers areindicated by an inverse relation between the numbers of stars in a subclusterand their central densities (also seen as a density vs. radius relation that isless steep than would be expected from pure expansion). we discuss implicationsof these effects for the dynamical relaxation of young stellar clusters.

1508.01338	no evidence for protoplanetary disk destruction by ob stars in the  mystix sample	hst images of proplyds in the orion nebula, as well as submillimeter/radiomeasurements, show that the dominant o7 star theta1 ori c photoevaporatesnearby disks around pre-main sequence stars. theory predicts that massive starsphotoevaporate disks within distances of order 0.1 pc. these findings suggestthat young, ob-dominated massive h ii regions are inhospitable to the survivalof protoplanetary disks, and subsequently to the formation and evolution ofplanets. in the current work, we test this hypothesis using large samples ofpre-main sequence stars in 20 massive star-forming regions selected with x-rayand infrared photometry in the mystix survey. complete disk destruction wouldlead to a deficit of cluster members with excess in jhks and spitzer/irac bandsin the vicinity of o stars. in four mystix regions containing o stars and asufficient surface density of disk-bearing sources to reliably test for spatialavoidance, we find no evidence for the depletion of inner disks around pre-mainsequence stars in the vicinity of o-type stars, even very luminous o2-o5 stars.these results suggest that massive star-forming regions are not very hostile tothe survival of protoplanetary disks and, presumably, to the formation ofplanets.

0807.3007	x-ray flares in orion young stars. ii. flares, magnetospheres, and  protoplanetary disks	we study the properties of powerful x-ray flares from 161 pre-main sequence(pms) stars observed with the chandra x-ray observatory in the orion nebularegion. relationships between flare properties, protoplanetary disks andaccretion are examined in detail to test models of star-disk interactions atthe inner edge of the accretion disks. previous studies had found nodifferences in flaring between diskfree and accreting systems other than asmall overall diminution of x-ray luminosity in accreting systems. the mostimportant finding is that x-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating diskfree starscan significantly exceed the keplerian corotation radius, whereas x-ray loopsizes in disky and accreting systems do not exceed the corotation radius. thisis consistent with models of star-disk magnetic interaction where the innerdisk truncates and confines the pms stellar magnetosphere. we also find twodifferences between flares in accreting and diskfree pms stars. first, asubclass of super-hot flares with peak plasma temperatures exceeding 100 mk arepreferentially present in accreting systems. second, we tentatively find thataccreting stars produce flares with shorter durations. both results may beconsequences of the distortion and destabilization of the stellar magnetosphereby the interacting disk. finally, we find no evidence that any flare types,even slow-rise flat-top flares are produced in star-disk magnetic loops. allare consistent with enhanced solar long-duration events with both footprintsanchored in the stellar surface.

astro-ph;0005391	x-rays and regions of star formation: a combined rosat-hri/near-to-mid  ir study of the rho oph dark cloud	we have obtained two deep exposures of the rho oph cloud core region with therosat hri. the improved position accuracy (1"-6") with respect to previousrecent x-ray observations (rosat pspc, and asca) allows us to remove positionalambiguities for the detected sources. we also cross-correlate the x-raypositions with ir sources found in the iso-isocam survey of the same region at6.7 and 14.3 \mum, in addition to sources known from ground-based observations,which are young stars. we find that there is no statistically significantdifference between the x-ray luminosity functions of hri-detected class ii andclass iii sources, i.e., t tauri stars with and without disks, confirming thatthe contribution of these disks to x-ray emission or absorption, must be small.most of the sources are variable, and their variability is consistent with asolar-like (hence magnetic) flare origin. we use the information given both bythe isocam survey and by our hri deep exposure to study the t tauri starpopulation of the rho oph dense cores. we confirm that essentially all class iiand class iii sources are x-ray emitters, and that a strong correlation existsbetween their x-ray luminosity, l_x, and their stellar luminosity, l_*, withl_x/l_* ~ 1e-4. most of the new isocam class ii sources are not detected,however, which we explain by the fact that their x-ray luminosities``predicted'' on the basis of this correlation are too faint to be detected bythe hri. we predict that ~40 unknown faint or embedded class iii sources remainto be discovered in x-rays in the hri/isocam overlapping area, down to a limitof l_x ~ 3 \times 1e28 erg/s. we show that the bulk of these unknown class iiisources should be made of low- to very low-mass stars. prospects for futuredetections with xmm-newton and chandra are discussed.

astro-ph;0102504	detection of nuclear x-ray sources in nearby galaxies with chandra	we report preliminary results from an arcsecond-resolution x-ray survey ofnearby galaxies using acis on board chandra. the total sample consists of 41low-luminosity agns, including seyferts, liners, and liner/h ii transitionobjects. in the initial subsample of 24 objects observed thus far, we detect in62% of the objects a compact, pointlike source astrometrically coincident witheither the optical or radio position of the nucleus. the high detection ratestrongly suggests that the majority of the objects do contain weakly active,agn-like cores, presumably powered by central massive black holes. the 2-10 kevluminosities of the nuclear sources range from 10^38 to 10^41 erg/s, with amedian value of 2x10^38 erg/s. our detection limit corresponds to 8x10^37 erg/sfor the typical sample distance of 12 mpc; this limit is two orders ofmagnitude fainter than the weakest sources of this kind previously studiedusing asca or bepposax. the new data extend toward lower luminosities the knownlinear correlation between hard x-ray and h-alpha luminosity for broad-lineagns. many narrow-line objects do contain x-ray cores, consistent with eitherweak agns or x-ray binary systems, but they have x-ray luminosities a factor of10 below the l_x-l(halpha) relation of the broad-line sources. theirdistributions of photon energies show no indication of exceptionally highabsorption. the optical line emission in these nuclei is likely powered, atleast in part, by stellar processes.

astro-ph;0209571	infrared study of the eta chamaeleontis cluster and the longevity of  circumstellar discs	we have analyzed jhkl observations of the stellar population of the ~9myr-old eta chamaeleontis cluster. using infrared (ir) colour-colour andcolour-excess diagrams, we find the fraction of stellar systems with near-irexcess emission is 0.60 pm 0.13 (2_sigma). this results implies considerablylonger disc lifetimes than found in some recent studies of other young stellarclusters. for the classical t tauri (ctt) and weak-lined t tauri (wtt) starpopulation, we also find a strong correlation between the ir excess and h_alphaemission. the ir excesses of these stars indicate a wide range of star-discactivity; from a ctt star showing high levels of accretion, to ctt - wtttransition objects with evidence for some on-going accretion, and wtt starswith weak or absent ir excesses. of the 15 known cluster members, 4 stars withir excesses delta(k-l) &gt; 0.4 mag are likely experiencing on-going accretionowing to strong or variable optical emission. the resulting accretion fraction(0.27 pm 0.13; 2_sigma) shows that the accretion phase, in addition to thediscs themselves, can endure for at least ~10 myr.

astro-ph;0211049	x-rays in the orion nebula cluster: constraints on the origins of  magnetic activity in pre-main sequence stars	a recent chandra/acis observation of the orion nebula cluster detected 1075sources (feigelson et al. 2002), providing a uniquely large and well-definedsample to study the dependence of magnetic activity on bulk properties forstars descending the hayashi tracks. the following results are obtained: (1)x-ray luminosities l_t in the 0.5-8 kev band are strongly correlated withbolometric luminosity with &lt;log l_t/l_bol&gt; = -3.8 for stars with masses 0.7&lt;m&lt;2mo, an order of magnitude below the main sequence saturation level; (2) thex-ray emission drops rapidly below this level in some or all stars with 2&lt;m&lt;3mo; (3) the presence or absence of infrared circumstellar disks has no apparentrelation to x-ray levels; and (4) x-ray luminosities exhibit a slight rise asrotational periods increase from 0.4 to 20 days. this last finding stands indramatic contrast to the strong anticorrelation between x-rays and period seenin main sequence stars.  the absence of a strong x-ray/rotation relationship in pms stars, andparticularly the high x-ray values seen in some very slowly rotating stars, isa clear indication that the mechanisms of magnetic field generation differ fromthose operating in main sequence stars. the most promising possibility is aturbulent dynamo distributed throughout the deep convection zone, but othermodels such as alpha-omega dynamo with `supersaturation' or relic core fieldsare not immediately excluded. the drop in magnetic activity inintermediate-mass stars may reflect the presence of a significant radiativecore. the evidence does not support x-ray production in large-scale star-diskmagnetic fields.

astro-ph;0506049	x-ray emission from young brown dwarfs in the orion nebula cluster	we use the sensitive x-ray data from the chandra orion ultradeep project(coup) to study the x-ray properties of 34 spectroscopically-identified browndwarfs with near-infrared spectral types between m6 and m9 in the core of theorion nebula cluster. nine of the 34 objects are clearly detected as x-raysources. the apparently low detection rate is in many cases related to thesubstantial extinction of these brown dwarfs; considering only the bds with$a_v \leq 5$ mag, nearly half of the objects (7 out of 16) are detected inx-rays. our 10-day long x-ray lightcurves of these objects exhibit strongvariability, including numerous flares. while one of the objects was onlydetected during a short flare, a statistical analysis of the lightcurvesprovides evidence for continuous (`quiescent') emission in addition to flaresfor all other objects. of these, the $\sim$ m9 brown dwarf coup 1255 = hc 212is one of the coolest known objects with a clear detection of quiescent x-rayemission. the x-ray properties (spectra, fractional x-ray luminosities, flarerates) of these young brown dwarfs are similar to those of the low-mass starsin the onc, and thus there is no evidence for changes in the magnetic activityaround the stellar/substellar boundary, which lies at $\sim$ m6 for oncsources. since the x-ray properties of the young brown dwarfs are also similarto those of m6--m9 field stars, the key to the magnetic activity in very coolobjects seems to be the effective temperature, which determines the degree ofionization in the atmosphere.

astro-ph;0506052	the evolution of x-ray emission in young stars	we study the relation between age and magnetic activity in late-type pre-mainsequence (pms) stars, for the first time using mass-stratified subsamples. theeffort is based on the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) which providesvery sensitive and homogenous x-ray data on a uniquely large sample of 481optically well-characterized low-extinction low-mass members of the orionnebula cluster, for which individual stellar masses and ages could bedetermined. more than 98 percent of the stars in this sample are detected asx-ray sources. within the pms phase for stellar ages in the range $\sim 0.1-10$myr, we establish a mild decay in activity with stellar age $\tau$ roughly as$l_{\rm x} \propto \tau^{-1/3}$. on longer timescales, when the orion stars arecompared to main sequence stars, the x-ray luminosity decay law for stars inthe $0.5 &lt; m &lt; 1.2$ m$_\odot$ mass range is more rapid with $l_{\rm x} \propto\tau^{-0.75}$ over the wide range of ages $5 &lt; \log \tau &lt; 9.5$ yr. themagnetic activity history for m stars with masses $0.1 &lt; m &lt; 0.4 m_\odot$ isdistinctly different. only a mild decrease in x-ray luminosity, and even a mildincrease in $l_{\rm x}/l_{\rm bol}$ and $f_{\rm x}$, is seen over the 1-100 myrrange, though the x-ray emission does decay over long timescales on the mainsequence. together with coup results on the absence of a rotation-activityrelation in orion stars, we find that the activity-age decay is strong acrossthe entire history of solar-type stars but is not attributable to rotationaldeceleration during the early epochs. a combination of tachocline anddistributed convective dynamos may be operative in young solar-type stars. theresults for the lowest mass stars are most easily understood by the dominanceof convective dynamos during both the pms and main sequence phases.

astro-ph;0506526	the origin of t tauri x-ray emission: new insights from the chandra  orion ultradeep project	we use the data of the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) to study thenearly 600 x-ray sources that can be reliably identified with optically wellcharacterized t tauri stars (tts) in the orion nebula cluster. we detect x-rayemission from more than 97% of the optically visible late-type (spectral typesf to m) cluster stars. this proofs that there is no ``x-ray quiet'' populationof late-type stars with suppressed magnetic activity. all tts with knownrotation periods lie in the saturated or super-saturated regime of the relationbetween activity and rossby numbers seen for main-sequence (ms) stars, but thetts show a much larger scatter in x-ray activity than seen for the ms stars.strong near-linear relations between x-ray luminosities, bolometricluminosities and mass are present. we also find that the fractional x-rayluminosity rises slowly with mass over the 0.1 - 2 m_sun range. the plasmatemperatures determined from the x-ray spectra of the tts are much hotter thanin ms stars, but seem to follow a general solar-stellar correlation betweenplasma temperature and activity level. the large scatter about the relationsbetween x-ray activity and stellar parameters seems to be related to theinfluence of accretion on the x-ray emission. while the x-ray activity of thenon-accreting tts is consistent with that of rapidly rotating ms stars, theaccreting stars are less x-ray active (by a factor of ~2-3 on average) andproduce much less well defined correlations than the non-accretors. we discusspossible reasons for the suppression of x-ray emission by accretion and theimplications of our findings on long-standing questions related to the originof the x-ray emission from young stars.

astro-ph;0506650	x-ray emission from orion nebula cluster stars with circumstellar disks  and jets	we investigate the x-ray and near-infrared emission properties of a sample ofpre-main sequence (pms) stellar systems in the orion nebula cluster (onc) thatdisplay evidence for circumstellar disks (``proplyds'') and optical jets inhubble space telescope (hst) imaging. approximately 70% of ~140 proplyds weredetected as x-ray sources in the chandra orion ultradeep program observation ofthe onc, including ~25% of proplyds that do not display central stars in hstimaging. many proplyds display near-infrared excesses, suggesting diskaccretion is ongoing onto the central, pms stars. among circumstellar disksthat are detected in absorption in hst imaging, we find that x-ray absorbingcolumn and apparent disk inclination are well correlated, providing insightinto the disk scale heights and metal abundances of uv- and x-ray-irradiatedprotoplanetary disks. jet sources display some of the largest near-infraredexcesses among the x-ray-detected proplyds, suggesting that the origin of thejets is closely related to ongoing, pms stellar accretion. some jet sourcesdisplay double-peaked x-ray spectral energy distributions, with soft componentsindicative of strong shocks in the jet collimation region. these resultssupport models in which circumstellar disks collimate and/or launch jets fromyoung stellar objects and, furthermore, demonstrate that star-disk-jetinteractions may contribute to pms x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0601405	chandra study of the cepheus b star forming region: stellar populations  and the initial mass function	cepheus b (cep b) molecular cloud and a portion of the nearby cep ob3b obassociation, one of the most active regions of star formation within 1 kpc, hasbeen observed with the acis detector on board the chandra x-ray observatory. wedetect 431 x-ray sources, of which 89% are confidently identified as clusteredpre-main sequence stars. two main results are obtained. first, we provide thebest census to date for the stellar population of the region. we identify manymembers of two rich stellar clusters: the lightly obscured cep ob3bassociation, and the deeply embedded cluster in cep b whose existence waspreviously traced only by a handful of radio sources and t tauri stars. second,we find a discrepancy between the x-ray luminosity functions of the cep ob3band the orion nebula cluster. this may be due to different initial massfunctions of two regions (excess of ~0.3 solar mass stars), or different agedistributions. several other results are obtained. a diffuse x-ray componentseen in the field is attributed to the integrated emission of unresolved lowmass pms stars. the x-ray emission from hd 217086 (o7n), the principle ionizingsource of the region, follows the standard model involving many small shocks inan unmagnetized radiatively accelerated wind. the x-ray source #294 joins anumber of similar superflare pms stars where long magnetic structures mayconnect the protoplanetary disk to the stellar surface.

astro-ph;0601508	x-rays from hh210 in the orion nebula	we report the detection during the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) oftwo soft, constant, and faint x-ray sources associated with the herbig-haroobject hh210. hh210 is located at the tip of the nne finger of the emissionline system bursting out of the bn-kl complex, northwest of the trapeziumcluster in the omc-1 molecular cloud. using a recent halpha image obtained withthe acs imager on board hst, and taking into account the known proper motionsof hh210 emission knots, we show that the position of the brightest x-raysource, coup703, coincides with the emission knot 154-040a of hh210, which isthe emission knot of hh210 having the highest tangential velocity (425 km/s).the second x-ray source, coup704, is located on the complicated emission tailof hh210 close to an emission line filament and has no obvious optical/infraredcounterpart. spectral fitting indicates for both sources a plasma temperatureof ~0.8 mk and absorption-corrected x-ray luminosities of about 1e30 erg/s(0.5-2.0 kev). these x-ray sources are well explained by a model invoking afast-moving, radiative bow shock in a neutral medium with a density of ~12000cm^{-3}. the x-ray detection of coup704 therefore reveals, in the complicatedhh210 region, an energetic shock not yet identified at other wavelengths.

astro-ph;0607006	x-ray study of triggered star formation and protostars in ic 1396n	the ic 1396n cometary globule within the large nearby hii region ic 1396 hasbeen observed with the acis detector on board the chandra x-ray observatory. wedetect 117 x-ray sources, of which ~50-60 are likely members of the young opencluster trumpler~37 dispersed throughout the hii region, and 25 are associatedwith young stars formed within the globule. spitzer/2mass photometry shows thex-ray population is very young: 3 older class iii stars, 16 classical t tauristars, 6 protostars including a class 0/i system. we infer a total t tauripopulation of ~30 stars in the globule, including the undetected population,with a star formation efficiency of 1-4%. an elongated source spatialdistribution with an age gradient oriented towards the exciting star isdiscovered in the x-ray population of ic 1396n, supporting similar findings inother cometary globules. the geometric and age distribution is consistent withthe rdi model for triggered star formation in cgs by hii region shocks. theinferred velocity of the shock front propagating into the globule is ~0.6km/s.the large number of x-ray-luminous protostars in the globule suggests either anunusually high ratio of class i/0 vs. class ii/iii stars, or a non-standard imffavoring higher mass stars by the triggering process. the chandra sourceassociated with the luminous class 0/i protostar iras 21391+5802 is one of theyoungest stars ever detected in the x-ray band. we also establish for the firsttime that the x-ray absorption in protostars arises from the local infallingenvelopes rather than ambient molecular cloud material.

astro-ph;0609304	an x-ray census of young stars in the massive southern star-forming  complex ngc 6357	we present the first high spatial resolution x-ray study of the massive starforming region ngc 6357, obtained in a 38 ks chandra/acis observation. insidethe brightest constituent of this large hii region complex is the massive opencluster pismis 24. it contains two of the brightest and bluest stars known, yetremains poorly studied; only a handful of optically bright stellar members havebeen identified. we investigate the cluster extent and initial mass functionand detect ~800 x-ray sources with a limiting sensitivity of 10^{30} ergss^{-1}; this provides the first reliable probe of the rich intermediate-massand low-mass population of this massive cluster, increasing the number of knownmembers from optical study by a factor of ~50. the high luminosity end (logl_h[2-8 kev]\ge 30.3 ergs s^{-1}) of the observed x-ray luminosity function inngc 6357 is clearly consistent with a power law relation as seen in the orionnebula cluster and cepheus b, yielding the first estimate of ngc 6357's totalcluster population, a few times the known orion population. we investigate thestructure of the cluster, finding small-scale substructures superposed on aspherical cluster with 6 pc extent, and discuss its relationship to the nebularmorphology. the long-standing lx - 10^{-7}l_{bol} correlation for o stars isconfirmed. twenty-four candidate o stars and one possible new obscured massiveyso or wolf-rayet star are presented. many cluster members are estimated to beintermediate-mass stars from available infrared photometry (assuming an age of1 myr), but only a few exhibit k-band excess. we report the first detection ofx-ray emission from an evaporating gaseous globule at the tip of a molecularpillar; this source is likely a b0-b2 protostar.

astro-ph;0609799	a re-appraisal of the habitability of planets around m dwarf stars	stable, hydrogen-burning, m dwarf stars comprise about 75% of all stars inthe galaxy. they are extremely long-lived and because they are much smaller inmass than the sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 msun), their temperature and stellarluminosity are low and peaked in the red. we have re-examined what is known atpresent about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, ormigrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an mdwarf star. observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-buildingmaterials are common around m dwarfs, but n-body simulations differ in theirestimations of the likelihood of potentially-habitable, wet planets residingwithin their habitable zones, which are only ~ 1/5 to 1/50 of the width of thatfor a g star. particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planetswith masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 mearth orbiting m stars, there seems noreason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. tidally lockedsynchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone doesn't necessarily leadto atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of anevolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. weconclude that m dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which theorigin and evolution of life can occur. a number of planetary processes such ascessation of geothermal activity, or thermal and non-thermal atmospheric lossprocesses may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods farshorter than the extreme lifetime of the m dwarf star. nevertheless, it makessense to include m dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worldsand evidence of life.

astro-ph;0612590	the young stellar population in m17 revealed by chandra	we report here results from a chandra acis observation of the stellarpopulations in and around the messier 17 h ii region. the field reveals 886sources, 771 of which have stellar counterparts in infrared images. in additionto comprehensive tables of x-ray source properties, several results arepresented: * the x-ray luminosity function is calibrated to that of the orionnebula cluster population to infer a total population of roughly 8000--10,000stars * about 40% of the acis sources are heavily obscured with a_v &gt; 10 mag.some are concentrated around well-studied star-forming regions but most aredistributed across the field. x-ray emission is detected from 64 of thehundreds of class i protostar candidates that can be identified by near- andmid-infrared colors. these constitute the most likely protostar candidatesknown in m17. * the spatial distribution of x-ray stars is complex: we find anew embedded cluster, a 2 pc-long arc of young stars along the southwest edgeof the m17 h ii region, and 0.1 pc substructure within various populations.these structures may indicate that the populations are dynamically young. * all(14/14) of the known o stars but only about half (19/34) of the known b0--b3stars in the m17 field are detected. six of these stars exhibit very hardthermal plasma components (kt&gt;4 kev) that may be due to colliding windbinaries. more than 100 candidate new ob stars are found, including 28 x-raydetected intermediate- and high-mass protostar candidates with infraredexcesses. * only a small fraction (perhaps 10%) of x-ray selected high- andintermediate- mass stars exhibit k-band emitting protoplanetary disks,providing further evidence that inner disks evolve very rapidly around moremassive stars.
