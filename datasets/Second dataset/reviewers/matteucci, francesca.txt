0706.2197	the cycle of interstellar dust in galaxies of different morphological  types	by means of chemical evolution models for galaxies of different morphologicaltype, we have performed a detailed study of the evolution of the cosmic dustproperties in different environments: the solar neighbourhood, ellipticalgalaxies and dwarf irregular galaxies. starting from the same formalism asdeveloped by dwek (1998), we have taken into account dust production from lowand intermediate mass stars, supernovae ii and ia as well as dust destructionand dust accretion processes in a detailed model of chemical evolution for thesolar vicinity. then, by means of the same dust prescriptions but adoptingdifferent galactic models (different star formation histories and presence ofgalactic winds), we have extended our study to ellipticals and dwarf irregulargalaxies. we have investigated how the assumption of different star formationhistories affects the dust production rates, the dust depletion, the dustaccretion and destruction rates. we have shown how the inclusion of the dusttreatment is helpful in solving the so-called fe discrepancy, observed in thehot gaseous halos of local ellipticals, and in reproducing the chemicalabundances observed in the lyman break galaxies. finally, our new models can bevery useful in future detailed spectro-photometric studies of galaxies.

0706.2932	the formation of the [alpha/fe] radial gradients in the stars of  elliptical galaxies	the scope of this paper is two-fold: i) to test and improve our previousmodels of an outside-in formation for the majority of ellipticals in thecontext of the sn-driven wind scenario, by means of a careful study of gasinflows/outflows; ii) to explain the observed slopes, either positive ornegative, in the radial gradient of the mean stellar [alpha/fe], and theirapparent lack of any correlation with all the other observables. in order topursue these goals we present a new class of hydrodynamical simulations for theformation of single elliptical galaxies in which we implement detailedprescriptions for the chemical evolution of h, he, o and fe. we find that allthe models which predict chemical properties (such as the central mass-weightedabundance ratios, the colours as well as the [&lt;fe/h&gt;] gradient) within theobserved ranges for a typical elliptical, also exhibit a variety of gradientsin the [&lt;alpha/fe&gt;] ratio, in agreement with the observations (namely positive,null or negative). all these models undergo an outside-in formation, in thesense that star formation stops earlier in the outermost than in the innermostregions, owing to the onset of a galactic wind. the typical [&lt;z/h&gt;] gradientspredicted by our models have a slope of -0.3 dex per decade variation inradius, consistent with the mean values of several observational samples. wecan safely conclude that the history of star formation is fundamental for thecreation of abundance gradients in ellipticals but that radial flows withdifferent velocity in conjunction with the duration and efficiency of starformation in different galactic regions are responsible for the gradients inthe [&lt;alpha/fe&gt;] ratios.

0904.2168	stellar mass-loss, rotation and the chemical enrichment of early type  galaxies	we present a comparison between the [ca,c,n/fe]-mass relations observed inlocal spheroids and the results of a chemical evolution model which alreadysuccessfully reproduces the [mg/fe]-mass and the [fe/h]-mass relations in thesesystems. we find that the [ca/fe]-mass relation is naturally explained by sucha model without any additional assumption. in particular, the observedunder-abundance of ca with respect to mg can be attributed to the differentcontributions from supernovae type ia and supernovae type ii to thenucleosynthesis of these two elements. for c and n, we consider new stellaryields that take into account stellar mass loss and rotation. these yields havebeen shown to successfully reproduce the c and n abundances in milky waymetal-poor stars. the use of these new stellar yields produces a good agreementbetween the chemical evolution model predictions and the integrated stellarpopulation observations for c. in the case of n, the inclusion of fast rotatorsand stellar mass-loss nucleosynthesis prescriptions improves our predictionsfor the slope of the [n/fe] vs. sigma relation, but a zero point discrepancy of0.3 dex remains. this work demonstrates that current stellar yields are unableto simultaneously reproduce the large mean stellar [&lt;n/fe&gt;] ratios inferredfrom integrated spectra of elliptical galaxies and the low n abundance measuredin the gas of high redshift spheroids from absorption lines. however, it seemsreasonable to suggest that there may be uncertainties in either the inferredstellar or gas-phase n abundances at the level of 0.3 dex.

1004.4139	chemical evolution models for spiral disks: the milky way, m31 and m33	the distribution of chemical abundances and their variation in time areimportant tools to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies: inparticular, the study of chemical evolution models can improve ourunderstanding of the basic assumptions made for modelling our galaxy and otherspirals. to test a standard chemical evolution model for spiral disks in thelocal universe and study the influence of a threshold gas density and differentefficiencies in the star formation rate (sfr) law on radial gradients(abundance, gas and sfr). we adopt a one-infall chemical evolution model wherethe galactic disk forms inside-out by means of infall of gas, and we testdifferent thresholds and efficiencies in the sfr. the model is scaled to thedisk properties of three local group galaxies (the milky way, m31 and m33) byvarying its dependence on the star formation efficiency and the time scale forthe infalling gas into the disk. using this simple model we are able toreproduce most of the observed constraints available in the literature for thestudied galaxies. the radial oxygen abundance gradients and their timeevolution are studied in detail. the present day abundance gradients are moresensitive to the threshold than to other parameters, while their temporalevolutions are more dependent on the chosen sfr efficiency. the most massivedisks seem to have evolved faster (i.e. with more efficient star formation)than the less massive ones, thus suggesting a downsizing in star formation forspirals. the threshold and the efficiency of star formation play a veryimportant role in the chemical evolution of spiral disks and an efficiencyvarying with radius can be used to regulate the star formation. the oxygenabundance gradient can steepen or flatten in time depending on the choice ofthis parameter

1005.3500	the chemical evolution of ic10	dwarf irregular galaxies are relatively simple unevolved objects where it iseasy to test models of galactic chemical evolution. we attempt to determine thestar formation and gas accretion history of ic10, a local dwarf irregular forwhich abundance, gas, and mass determinations are available. we apply detailedchemical evolution models to predict the evolution of several chemical elements(he, o, n, s) and compared our predictions with the observational data. weconsider additional constraints such as the present-time gas fraction, the starformation rate (sfr), and the total estimated mass of ic10. we assume a darkmatter halo for this galaxy and study the development of a galactic wind. weconsider different star formation regimes: bursting and continuous. we exploredifferent wind situations: i) normal wind, where all the gas is lost at thesame rate and ii) metal-enhanced wind, where metals produced by supernovae arepreferentially lost. we study a case without wind. we vary the star formationefficiency (sfe), the wind efficiency, and the time scale of the gas infall,which are the most important parameters in our models. we find that only modelswith metal-enhanced galactic winds can reproduce the properties of ic10. thestar formation must have proceeded in bursts rather than continuously and thebursts must have been less numerous than ~10 over the whole galactic lifetime.finally, ic10 must have formed by a slow process of gas accretion with atimescale of the order of 8 gyr.

0704.2032	effects of the galactic winds on the stellar metallicity distribution of  dwarf spheroidal galaxies	to study the effects of galactic winds on the stellar metallicitydistributions and on the evolution of draco and ursa minor dwarf spheroidalgalaxies, we compared the predictions of several chemical evolution models,adopting different prescriptions for the galactic winds, with thephotometrically-derived stellar metallicity distributions of both galaxies. thechemical evolution models for draco and ursa minor, which are able to reproduceseveral observational features of these two galaxies, such as the severalabundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account forintermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect ofthese objects on the energetics of the systems. for both galaxies, the modelthat best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurringat a rate proportional to the star formation rate. models with a wind rateassumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce theobserved smd, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with nogalactic winds fail to reproduce the observed smds. in the case of ursa minor,the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution verywell with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. the model fordraco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. the observed smd requires amodel with a lower supernova type ia thermalization efficiency ($\eta_{sneia}$= 0.5 instead of $\eta_{sneia}$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind,whereas all the other parameters are kept the same. the model results, comparedto observations, strongly suggest that intense and continuous galactic windsplay a very important role in the evolution of local dsphs.

1101.4900	the role of the igimf in the chemical evolution of the solar  neighbourhood	the integrated galactic initial mass function (igimf) is computed from thecombination of the stellar initial mass function (imf) and the embedded clustermass function, described by a power law with index beta. the result of thecombination is a time-varying imf which depends on the star formation rate. weapplied the igimf formalism to a chemical evolution model for the solarneighbourhood and compared the results obtained by assuming three possiblevalues for beta with the ones obtained by means of a standard, well-tested,constant imf. in general, a lower absolute value of beta implies a flatterigimf, hence a larger number of massive stars, higher type ia and ii supernovarates, higher mass ejection rates and higher [alpha/fe] values at a givenmetallicity. our suggested fiducial value for beta is 2, since with this valuewe can account for most of the local observables. we discuss our results in abroader perspective, with some implications regarding the possible universalityof the imf and the importance of the star formation threshold.

1102.4197	chemical evolution of dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies	dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies are very interesting objects sincethey are relatively simple and unevolved. we present new models for thechemical evolution of these galaxies by assuming different regimes of starformation (bursting and continuous) and different kinds of galactic winds(normal and metal-enhanced). our results show that in order to reproduce allthe properties of these galaxies, including the spread in the chemicalabundances, the star formation should have proceeded in bursts and the numberof bursts should be not larger than 10 in each galaxy, and that metal-enhancedgalactic winds are required. a metal-enhanced wind efficiency increasing withgalactic mass can by itself reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relationalthough also an increasing efficiency of star formation and/or number and/orduration of bursts can equally well reproduce such a relation. metal enhancedwinds together with an increasing amount of star formation with galactic massare required to explain most of the properties of these galaxies. normalgalactic winds, where all the gas is lost at the same rate, do not reproducethe features of these galaxies. we suggest that these galaxies should havesuffered a different number of bursts varying from 2 to 10 and that theefficiency of metal-enhanced winds should have been not too high($\lambda_{mw}\sim1$). we predict for these galaxies present time type ia snrates from 0.00084 and 0.0023 per century. finally, by comparing the abundancepatterns of damped lyman-$\alpha$ objects with our models we conclude that theyare very likely the progenitors of the present day dwarf irregulars.

1107.5477	manganese evolution in omega centauri: a clue to the cluster formation  mechanisms?	we model the evolution of manganese relative to iron in the progenitor systemof the globular cluster omega centauri by means of a self-consistent chemicalevolution model. we use stellar yields that already reproduce the measurementsof [mn/fe] versus [fe/h] in galactic field disc and halo stars, in galacticbulge stars and in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. we compare ourmodel predictions to the mn abundances measured in a sample of 10 red giantmembers and 6 subgiant members of omega cen. the low values of [mn/fe] observedin a few, metal-rich stars of the sample cannot be explained in the frameworkof our standard, homogeneous chemical evolution model. introducing coolingflows that selectively bring to the cluster core only the ejecta from specificcategories of stars does not help to heal the disagreement with theobservations. the capture of field stars does not offer a viable explanationeither. the observed spread in the data and the lowest [mn/fe] values could, inprinciple, be understood if the system experienced inhomogeneous chemicalevolution. such an eventuality is qualitatively discussed in the present paper.however, more measurements of mn in omega cen stars are needed to settle theissue of mn evolution in this cluster.

1207.6303	the thick disk rotation-metallicity correlation as a fossil of an  "inverse chemical gradient" in the early galaxy	the thick disk rotation--metallicity correlation, \partialv_\phi/\partial[fe/h] =40\div 50 km s^{-1}dex^{-1} represents an importantsignature of the formation processes of the galactic disk. we usenondissipative numerical simulations to follow the evolution of a milky way(mw)-like disk to verify if secular dynamical processes can account for thiscorrelation in the old thick disk stellar population. we followed the evolutionof an ancient disk population represented by 10 million particles whosechemical abundances were assigned by assuming a cosmologically plausible radialmetallicity gradient with lower metallicity in the inner regions, as expectedfor the 10-gyr-old mw. essentially, inner disk stars move towards the outerregions and populate layers located at higher |z|. a rotation--metallicitycorrelation appears, which well resembles the behaviour observed in our galaxyat a galactocentric distance between 8 kpc and 10 kpc. in particular,we measurea correlation of \partial v_\phi/\partial[fe/h]\simeq 60 km s^{-1}dex^{-1} forparticles at 1.5 kpc &lt; |z| &lt; 2.0 kpc that persists up to 6 gyr. our pure n-bodymodels can account for the v_\phi vs. [fe/h] correlation observed in the thickdisk of our galaxy, suggesting that processes internal to the disk such asheating and radial migration play a role in the formation of this old stellarcomponent. in this scenario, the positive rotation-metallicity correlation ofthe old thick disk population would represent the relic signature of an ancient"inverse" chemical (radial) gradient in the inner galaxy, which resulted fromaccretion of primordial gas.

1304.2764	neutron-capture element deficiency of the hercules dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	we present an assessment of the barium abundance ratios for red giant memberstars in the faint hercules dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy. our results aredrawn from intermediate-resolution flames/giraffe spectra around the ba ii6141.71 aa absorption line at low signal-to-noise ratios. for three brighterstars we were able to gain estimates from direct equivalent-width measurements,while for the remaining eight stars only upper limits could be obtained. theseresults are investigated in a statistical manner and indicate very low baabundances of log epsilon (ba) &lt; 0.7 dex (3 sigma). we discuss various possiblesystematic biasses, first and foremost, a blend with the fe i 6141.73 aa-line,but most of those would only lead to even lower abundances. a better match withmetal-poor halo and dsph stars can only be reached by including a largeuncertainty in the continuum placement. this contrasts with the highdispersions in iron and calcium (in excess of 1 dex) in this galaxy. while thelatter spreads are typical of the very low luminosity, dark-matter dominateddsphs, a high level of depletion in heavy elements suggests that chemicalenrichment in hercules was governed by very massive stars, coupled with a verylow star formation efficiency. while very low abundances of some heavy elementsare also found in individual stars of other dwarf galaxies, this is the firsttime that a very low ba abundance is found within an entire dsph over a broadmetallicity range.

0801.1769	stars, gas and dust in elliptical galaxies	i will present recent theoretical results on the formation and the highredshift assembly of spheroids. these findings have been obtained by utilisingdifferent and complementary techniques: chemodynamical models offer greatinsight in the radial abundance gradients in the stars; while statesemi-analytic codes implementing a detailed treatment of the chemical evolutionallow an exploration of the role of the galactic mass in shaping many observedrelations. the results will be shown by following the path represented by theevolution of the mass-metallicity relation in stars, gas and dust. i will showhow, under a few sensible assumptions, it is possible to reproduce a largenumber of observables ranging from the xrays to the infrared. by comparingmodel predictions with observations, we derive a picture of galaxy formation inwhich the higher is the mass of the galaxy, the shorter are the infall and thestar formation timescales. therefore, the stellar component of the most massiveand luminous galaxies might attain a metallicity z &gt; z_sun in only 0.5 gyr.each galaxy is created outside-in, i.e. the outermost regions accrete gas, formstars and develop a galactic wind very quickly, compared to the central core inwhich the star formation can last up to ~ 1.3 gyr.

0704.0535	the formation of globular cluster systems in massive elliptical  galaxies: globular cluster multimodality from radial variation of stellar  populations	the most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi-modality in theirglobular cluster system color distributions. understanding the mechanisms whichlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a completepicture of massive galaxy formation. by assuming that globular clusterformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radialvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the pipino &amp;matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute thedistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentricradius. we compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globularclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by puzia et al. (2006) and show that theobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals canbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellarpopulations. our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich populationof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in verygood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. furthermore, we investigatethe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicitydistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role ofmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicitytransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model(abridged)

1402.4137	progenitors of supernovae type ia and chemical enrichment in  hydrodynamical simulations -i. the single degenerate scenario	the nature of the type ia supernovae (snia) progenitors remains stilluncertain. this is a major issue for galaxy evolution models since bothchemical and energetic feedback play a major role in the gas dynamics, starformation and therefore in the overall stellar evolution. the progenitor modelsfor the snia available in the literature propose different distributions forregulating the explosion times of these events. these functions are known asthe delay time distributions (dtds). this work is the first one in a series ofpapers aiming at studying five different dtds for snia. here, we implement andanalyse the single degenerate scenario (sd) in galaxies dominated by a rapidquenching of the star formation, displaying the majority of the starsconcentrated in the bulge component. we find a good fit to both the presentobserved snia rates in spheroidal dominated galaxies, and to the [o/fe] ratiosshown by the bulge of the milky way. additionally, the sd scenario is found toreproduce a correlation between the specific snia rate and the specific starformation rate, which closely resembles the observational trend, at variancewith previous works. our results suggest that snia observations in galaxieswith very low and very high specific star formation rates can help to imposemore stringent constraints on the dtds and therefore on snia progenitors.

0802.3368	a comparison of the s- and r-process element evolution in local dwarf  spheroidal galaxies and in the milky way	we study the nucleosynthesis of several neutron capture elements (barium,europium, lanthanum, and yttrium) in local group dwarf spheroidal (dsph)galaxies and in the milky way by comparing the evolution of [ba/fe], [eu/fe],[la/fe], [y/fe], [ba/y], [ba/eu], [y/eu], and [la/eu] observed in dsph galaxiesand in our galaxy with predictions of detailed chemical evolution models. themodels for all dsph galaxies and for the milky way are able to reproduceseveral observational features of these galaxies, such as a series of abundanceratios and the stellar metallicities distributions. the milky way model adoptsthe two-infall scenario, whereas the most important features of the models forthe dsph galaxies are the low star-formation rate and the occurrence of intensegalactic winds. we predict that the [s-r/fe] ratios in dsphs are generallydifferent than the corresponding ratios in the milky way, at the same [fe/h]values. this is interpreted as a consequence of the time-delay model coupledwith different star formation histories. in particular, the star-formation isless efficient in dsphs than in our galaxy and it is influenced by stronggalactic winds. our predictions are in very good agreement with the availableobservational data. the time-delay model for the galactic chemical enrichmentcoupled with different histories of star formation in different galaxies allowus to succesfully interpret the observed differences in the abundance ratios ofs- and r- process elements, as well as of $\alpha$-elements in dsphs and in themilky way. these differences strongly suggest that the main stellar populationsof these galaxies could not have had a common origin and, consequently, thatthe progenitors of local dsphs might not be the same objects as the buildingblocks of our galaxy.

1502.05221	the igimf and other imfs in dsphs: the case of sagittarius	we have studied the effects of various initial mass functions (imfs) on thechemical evolution of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy (sgr). in particular, wetested the effects of the integrated galactic initial mass function (igimf) onvarious predicted abundance patterns. the igimf depends on the star formationrate and metallicity and predicts less massive stars in a regime of low starformation, as it is the case in dwarf spheroidals. we adopted a detailedchemical evolution model following the evolution of $\alpha$-elements, fe andeu, and assuming the currently best set of stellar yields. we also exploreddifferent yield prescriptions for the eu, including production from neutronstar mergers. although the uncertainties still present in the stellar yieldsand data prevent us from drawing firm conclusions, our results suggest that theigimf applied to sgr predicts lower [$\alpha$/fe] ratios than classical imfsand lower [hydrostatic/explosive] $\alpha$-element ratios, in qualitativeagreement with observations. in our model, the observed high [eu/o] ratios insgr is due to reduced o production, resulting from the igimf mass cutoff of themassive oxygen-producing stars, as well as to the eu yield produced in neutronstar mergers, a more promising site than core-collapse supernovae, althoughmany uncertainties are still present in the eu nucleosynthesis. we find that amodel, similar to our previous calculations, based on the late addition of ironfrom the type ia supernova time-delay (necessary to reproduce the shape of[x/fe] versus [fe/h] relations) but also including the reduction of massivestars due to the igimf, better reproduces the observed abundance ratios in sgrthan models without the igimf.

1503.08300	modern yields per stellar generation: the effect of the imf	gaseous and stellar metallicities in galaxies are nowadays routinely used toconstrain the evolutionary processes in galaxies. this requires the knowledgeof the average yield per stellar generation, $y_{\text{z}}$, i.e. the quantityof metals that a stellar population releases into the interstellar medium(ism), which is generally assumed to be a fixed fiducial value. deviations ofthe observed metallicity from the expected value of $y_{\text{z}}$ are used toquantify the effect of outflows or inflows of gas, or even as evidence forbiased metallicity calibrations or inaccurate metallicity diagnostics. here weshow that $\rm y_{\text{z}}$ depends significantly on the initial mass function(imf), varying by up to a factor larger than three, for the range of imfstypically adopted in various studies. varying the upper mass cutoff of the imfimplies a further variation of $y_{\text{z}}$ by an additional factor that canbe larger than two. these effects, along with the variation of the gas massfraction restored into the ism by supernovae ($r$, which also depends on theimf), may yield to deceiving results, if not properly taken into account. inparticular, metallicities that are often considered unusually high can actuallybe explained in terms of yield associated with commonly adopted imfs such asthe kroupa (2001) or chabrier (2003). we provide our results for two differentsets of stellar yields (both affected by specific limitations) finding that theuncertainty introduced by this assumption can be as large as $\sim0.2$ dex.finally, we show that $y_{\text{z}}$ is not substantially affected by theinitial stellar metallicity as long as $\text{z}&gt; 10^{-3}~\text{z}_{\odot}$.

astro-ph;0002370	dynamical and chemical evolution of gas-rich dwarf galaxies	we study the effect of a single, instantaneous starburst on the dynamical andchemical evolution of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy, whose potential well isdominated by a dark matter halo. we follow the dynamical and chemical evolutionof the ism by means of an improved 2-d hydrodynamical code coupled withdetailed chemical yields originating from type ii sne, type ia sne and singlelow and intermediate mass stars (ims). in particular we follow the evolution ofthe abundances of h, he, c, n, o, mg, si and fe. we find that for a galaxyresembling izw18, a galactic wind develops as a consequence of the starburstand it carries out of the galaxy mostly the metal-enriched gas. in addition, wefind that different metals are lost differentially in the sense that theelements produced by type ia sne are more efficiently lost than others. as aconsequence of that we predict larger [$\alpha$/fe] ratios for the gas insidethe galaxy than for the gas leaving the galaxy. a comparison of our predictedabundances of c, n, o and si in the case of a burst occurring in a primordialgas shows a very good agreement with the observed abundances in izw18 as longas the burst has an age of $\sim 31$ myr and ims produce some primary nitrogen.however, we cannot exclude that a previous burst of star formation had occurredin izw18 especially if the preenrichment produced by the older burst was lowerthan $z=0.01$ z$_{\odot}$. finally, at variance with previous studies, we findthat most of the metals reside in the cold gas phase already after few myr.this result is mainly due to the assumed low snii heating efficiency, andjustifies the generally adopted homogeneous and instantaneous mixing of gas inchemical evolution models.

astro-ph;0004029	the effects of a variable imf on the chemical evolution of the galaxy	in this work we explore the effects of adopting an initial mass function(imf) variable in time on the chemical evolution of the galaxy. in order to dothat we adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodesfor the formation of the galaxy. we study the effects on such a model ofdifferent imfs. first, we use a theoretical one based on the statisticaldescription of the density field arising from random motions in the gas. thisimf is a function of time as it depends on physical conditions of the site ofstar formation. we also investigate the behaviour of the model predictionsusing other variable imfs, parameterized as a function of metallicity. ourresults show that the theoretical imf when applied to our model depends on timebut such time variation is important only in the early phases of the galacticevolution, when the imf is biased towards massive stars. we also show that theuse of an imf which is a stronger function of time does not lead to a goodagreement with the observational constraints suggesting that if the imf variedthis variation should have been small. our main conclusion is that the g-dwarfmetallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large timescale anda constant imf, since it is possible to find variable imfs of the kind studiedhere, reproducing the g-dwarf metallicity but this worsens the agreement withother observational constraints.

astro-ph;0102134	abundance gradients and the formation of the milky way	in this paper we adopt a chemical evolution model, which is an improvedversion of the chiappini, matteucci and gratton (1997) model, assuming two mainaccretion episodes for the formation of the galaxy. the present model takesinto account in more detail than previously the halo density distribution andexplores the effects of a threshold density in the star formation process,during both the halo and disk phases. in the comparison between modelpredictions and available data, we have focused our attention on abundancegradients as well as gas, stellar and star formation rate distributions alongthe disk. we suggest that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leavesdetectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer regions of thedisk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almostcompletely disentangled. this is due to the fact that the halo and diskdensities are comparable at large galactocentric distances and therefore thegas lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outerdisk. we also show that the existence of a threshold density for the starformation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is necessary to reproduce themajority of observational data in the solar vicinity and in the whole disk.moreover, we predict that the abundance gradients along the galactic disk musthave increased with time and that the average [alpha/fe] ratio in stars (haloplus disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 kpcs from the galactic center.we also show that the same ratios increase substantially towards the outermostdisk regions and the expected scatter in the stellar ages decreases, becausethe outermost regions are dominated by halo stars.

astro-ph;0107068	chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies as a constraint to galaxy  formation scenarios	elliptical galaxies are the main contributors to the chemical enrichment ofthe intracluster and intergalactic medium; understanding how they form andevolve enables us to get important hints on the amounts of energy and processedmatter that they eject into the icm/igm. recent pieces of observationalevidence point to a strong connection between high redshift quasars and theirhost galaxies. the aim of this paper is to prove that the main aspects of thechemical evolution of the spheroids can be reproduced in the framework of amodel where the shining of the quasar is intimately related to the formation ofthe galactic nucleus. a key assumption is that the quasars shone in an invertedorder with respect to the hierarchical one (i.e., stars and black holes inbigger dark halos formed before those in smaller ones) during an early episodeof vigorous star formation. this scenario closely resembles the so-called`inverse wind' model invoked to explain the observed increase of the [mg/fe]ratio in the nuclei of ellipticals with increasing the galactic mass, the onlydifference being that now the time for the occurrence of a galactic wind is notdetermined by the energy input from supernovae, but is indeed the energyinjected by the quasar which regulates the onset of the wind phase.

astro-ph;0110008	the origin of blue cores in hubble deep fields e/s0 galaxies	in this letter we address the problem of the origin of blue cores and inversecolor gradients in early-type galaxies reported in the hubble deep field northand south (hdfs) by menanteau, abraham &amp; ellis 2001. we use a multi-zone singlecollapse model. this model accounts for the observed blue cores by adopting abroad spread in formation redshifts for ellipticals, allowing some of thesegalaxies begin forming no more than ~1 gyr before the redshift of observation.the single-zone collapse model then produces cores that are bluer than theouter regions because of the increase of the local potential well toward thecenter which makes star-formation more extended in the central region of thegalaxy. we compare the predicted v-i(r) color gradients with the observed onesusing the redshift of formation ($z_f$) of the elliptical as the only freeparameter. we find that the model can account with relatively good agreementfor the blue cores and inverse color gradients found in many spheroidals and atthe same time for the red and smooth colors profiles reported. based on themodel our analysis suggests two populations of field ellipticals, one formedrecently, within $\lesssim1$gyr and another much older formed $\gtrsim4$gyrsince the redshift of observation.

astro-ph;0203506	chemical evolution in a model for the joint formation of quasars and  spheroids	direct and indirect pieces of observational evidence point to a strongconnection between high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies. in theframework of a model where the shining of the quasar is the episode that stopsthe formation of the galactic spheroid inside a virialized halo, it has beenproven possible to explain the submillimetre source counts together with theirrelated statistics and the local luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies.the time delay between the virialization and the quasar manifestation requiredto fit the counts is short and incresing with decresing the host galaxy mass.in this paper we compute the detailed chemical evolution of gas and starsinside virialized haloes in the framework of the same model, taking intoaccount the combined effects of cooling and stellar feedback. under theassumption of negligible angular momentum, we are able to reproduce the mainobserved chemical properties of local ellipticals. in particular, by using thesame duration of the bursts which are required in order to fit thesubmillimetre source counts, we recover the observed increase of the mg/feratio with galactic mass. since for the most massive objects the assumedduration of the burst is tburst &lt; 0.6 gyr, we end up with a picture forelliptical galaxy formation in which massive spheroids complete their assemblyat early times, thus resembling a monolithic collapse, whereas smaller galaxiesare allowed for a more prolonged star formation, thus allowing for a morecomplicated evolutionary history.

astro-ph;0409473	quantifying the uncertainties of chemical evolution studies. i. the  stellar initial mass function and the stellar lifetimes	the stellar initial mass function and the stellar lifetimes are basicingredients of chemical evolution models, for which different recipes can befound in the literature. in this paper, we quantify the effects on chemicalevolution studies of the uncertainties in these two parameters. we concentrateon chemical evolution models for the milky way, because of the large number ofgood observational constraints. such chemical evolution models have alreadyruled out significant temporal variations for the stellar initial mass functionin our own galaxy, with the exception perhaps of the very early phases of itsevolution. therefore, here we assume a galactic initial mass function constantin time. through an accurate comparison of model predictions for the milky waywith carefully selected data sets, it is shown that specific prescriptions forthe initial mass function in particular mass ranges should be rejected. as faras the stellar lifetimes are concerned, the major differences among existingprescriptions are found in the range of very low-mass stars. because of this,the model predictions widely differ for those elements which are producedmostly by very long-lived objects, as for instance 3he and 7li. however, it isconcluded that model predictions of several important observed quantities,constraining the plausible galactic formation scenarios, are fairly robust withrespect to changes in both the stellar mass spectrum and the stellar lifetimes.for instance, the metallicity distribution of low-mass stars is nearlyunaffected by these changes, since its shape is dictated mostly by the timescale for thin-disk formation.

astro-ph;0409581	interpretation of abundance ratios	in this paper we discuss abundance ratios and their relation to stellarnucleosynthesis and other parameters of chemical evolution models, reviewingand clarifying the correct use of the observed abundance ratios in severalastrophysical contests. in particular, we start from the well known fact thatabundance ratios depend on stellar yields, initial mass function and stellarlifetimes and we show, by means of specific examples, that in some cases it isnot correct to infer constraints on the contributions from different sn types(ia, ii), and particularly on different sets of yields, in the absence of acomplete chemical evolution model taking into account stellar lifetimes. inspite of the fact that some of these results should be well known, we believethat it is useful to discuss the meaning of abundance ratios in the light ofseverel recent claims based upon an incorrect interpretation of observedabundance ratios. in particular, the procedure, often used in the recentliterature, of deriving directly conclusions about stellar nucleosynthesis,just by relating abundance ratios to yield ratios, implicitly assumes theinstantaneous recycling approximation (i.r.a.). this approximation is clearlynot correct when one analyzes the contributions of snia relative to snii asfunctions of cosmic time. in this paper we show that the uncertainty whicharises from adopting this oversimplified procedure in a variety ofastrophysical objects, such as elliptical galaxies, the intracluster medium andhigh redshift objects, does not allow us to draw any firm conclusion, and thatthe differences between abundance ratios predicted by models with i.r.a. andmodels with detailed stellar lifetimes is of the same order as the differencesbetween different sets of yields.

astro-ph;0510113	formation and evolution of late-type dwarf galaxies. i. ngc 1705 and ngc  1569	(abridged.) we present one-zone chemical evolution models for two dwarfstarburst galaxies, ngc 1705 and ngc 1569. using information about the paststar formation history and initial mass function of the systems previouslyobtained from hubble space telescope colour-magnitude diagrams, we identifypossible scenarios of chemical enrichment and development of galactic winds. inorder not to overestimate the current metallicity of the interstellar gasinferred from h ii region spectroscopy, we suggest that the winds efficientlyremove from the galaxies the metal-rich ejecta of dying stars. conversely,requiring the final mass of neutral gas to match the value inferred from 21-cmobservations implies a relatively low efficiency of interstellar mediumentrainment in the outflow, thus confirming previous findings that the windsdriving the evolution of typical starbursts are differential. these conclusionscould be different only if the galaxies accrete huge fractions of unprocessedgas at late times. by assuming standard stellar yields we obtain a good fit tothe observed nitrogen to oxygen ratio of ngc 1569, while the mean n/o ratio inngc 1705 is overestimated by the models. reducing the extent of hot bottomburning in low-metallicity intermediate-mass stars does not suffice to solvethe problem. localized self-pollution from stars more massive than 60 msun inngc 1705 and/or funneling of larger fractions of nitrogen through its winds arethen left to explain the discrepancy between model predictions andobservations. inspection of the log(n/o) vs. log(o/h)+12 diagram for a sampleof dwarf irregular and blue compact dwarf galaxies in the literature favoursthe latter hypothesis.

astro-ph;0510142	the evolution of barium and europium in local dwarf spheroidal galaxies	by means of a detailed chemical evolution model, we follow the evolution ofbarium and europium in four local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies, in order toset constraints on the nucleosynthesis of these elements and on the evolutionof this type of galaxies compared with the milky way. the model, which is ableto reproduce several observed abundance ratios and the present day total massand gas mass content of these galaxies, adopts up to date nucleosynthesis andtakes into account the role played by supernovae of different types (ii, ia)allowing us to follow in detail the evolution of several chemical elements (h,d, he, c, n, o, mg, si, s, ca, fe, ba and eu). by assuming that barium is aneutron capture element produced in low mass agb stars by s-process but also inmassive stars (in the mass range 10 - 30 $m_{\odot}$) by r-process, during theexplosive event of supernovae of type ii, and that europium is a pure r-processelement synthesized in massive stars also in the range of masses 10 - 30$m_{\odot}$, we are able to reproduce the observed [ba/fe] and [eu/fe] asfunctions of [fe/h] in all four galaxies studied. we confirm also the importantrole played by the very low star formation efficiencies ($\nu$ = 0.005 - 0.5gyr$^{-1}$) and by the intense galactic winds (6-13 times the star formationrate) in the evolution of these galaxies. these low star formation efficiencies(compared to the one for the milky way disc) adopted for the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies are the main reason for the differences between the trends of [ba/fe]and [eu/fe] predicted and observed in these galaxies and in the metal-poorstars of our galaxy. finally, we provide predictions for sagittarius galaxy forwhich data of only two stars are available.

astro-ph;0510556	the outside-in formation of elliptical galaxies	in this paper we compare the predictions of a detailed multi-zone chemicalevolution model for elliptical galaxies with the very recent observations ofthe galaxy ngc 4697. as a consequence of the earlier development of the wind inthe outer regions with respect to the inner ones, we predict an increase of themean stellar [&lt;mg/fe&gt;] ratio with radius, in very good agreement with the datafor ngc4697. this finding strongly supports the proposed outside-in formationscenario for ellipticals. we show that, in spite of the good agreement foundfor the [&lt;mg/fe&gt;] ratio, the predicted slope of the mass-weighted metallicitygradient does not reproduce the one derived from observations, once acalibration to convert indices into abundances is applied. this is explained asthe consequence of the different behaviour with metallicity of theline-strength indices as predicted by a single stellar population (ssp) andthose derived by averaging over a composite stellar population (csp). in orderto better address this issue, we calculate the theoretical ``g-dwarf''distributions of stars as functions of both metallicity ([z/h]) and [fe/h],showing that they are broad and asymmetric that a ssp cannot correctly mimickthe mixture of stellar populations at any given radius. we find that thesedistributions differ from the ``g-dwarf'' distributions especially at largeradii,except for the one as a function of [mg/fe]. therefore, we conclude thatin ellipticals the [mg/fe] ratio is the most reliable quantity to be comparedwith observations and is the best estimator of the star formation timescale ateach radius.(abridged)

astro-ph;0702137	formation &amp; evolution of the galactic bulge: constraints from stellar  abundances	we compute the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge in the context of aninside-out model for the formation of the milky way. the model contains updatedstellar yields from massive stars. the main purpose of the paper is to comparethe predictions of this model with new observations of chemical abundanceratios and metallicity distributions in order to put constraints on theformation and evolution of the bulge. we computed the evolution of severalalpha-elements and fe and performed several tests by varying differentparameters such as star formation efficiency, slope of the initial massfunction and infall timescale. we also tested the effect of adopting a primarynitrogen contribution from massive stars. the [alpha/fe] abundance ratios inthe bulge are predicted to be supersolar for a very large range in [fe/h], eachelement having a different slope. these predictions are in very good agreementwith most recent accurate abundance determinations. we also find a good fit ofthe most recent bulge stellar metallicity distributions. we conclude that thebulge formed on a very short timescale (even though timescales much shorterthan about 0.1 gyr are excluded) with a quite high star formation efficiency ofabout 20 gyr$^{-1}$ and with an initial mass function more skewed toward highmasses (i.e. x &lt;= 0.95) than the solar neighbourhood and rest of the disk. theresults obtained here are more robust than previous ones since they are basedon very accurate abundance measurements.

astro-ph;9810422	the earliest phases of galaxy evolution	in this paper we study the very early phases of the evolution of our galaxyby means of a chemical evolution model which reproduces most of theobservational constraints in the solar vicinity and in the disk. we haverestricted our analysis to the solar neighborhood and present the predictedabundances of several elements (c, n, o, mg, si, s, ca, fe) over an extendedrange of metallicities $[fe/h] = -4.0$ to $[fe/h] = 0.0$ compared to previousmodels. we adopted the most recent yield calculations for massive stars takenfrom different authors (woosley &amp; weaver 1995 and thielemann et al. 1996) andcompared the results with a very large sample of data, one of the largest everused to this purpose. these data have been analysed with a new and powerfulstatistical method which allows us to quantify the observational spread inmeasured elemental abundances and obtain a more meaningful comparison with thepredictions from our chemical evolution model. our analysis shows that the``plateau'' observed for the [$\alpha$/fe] ratios at low metallicities ($-3.0&lt;[fe/h] &lt;-1.0$) is not perfectly constant but it shows a slope, especially foroxygen. this slope is very well reproduced by our model with both sets ofyields. this is not surprising since realistic chemical evolution models,taking into account in detail stellar lifetimes, never predicted a completelyflat plateau. this is due either to the fact that massive stars of differentmass produce a slightly different o/fe ratio or to the often forgotten factthat supernovae of type ia, originating from white dwarfs, start appearingalready at a galactic age of 30 million years and reach their maximum at 1 gyr.

astro-ph;9908207	the chemical evolution of the galaxy with variable imfs	in this work we explore the effects of adopting initial mass functions (imfs)variable in time on the chemical evolution of the galaxy. in order to do thatwe adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes forthe formation of the galaxy and which proved to be successful in reproducingthe majority of the observational constraints, at least for the case of aconstant imf. different variable imfs are tested with this model, all assumingthat massive stars are preferentially formed in ambients of low metallicity.this implies that massive stars are formed preferentially at early times and atlarge galactocentric distances. our numerical results have shown that all thevariable imfs proposed so far are unable to reproduce all the relevantobservational constraints in the galaxy and that a constant imf stillreproduces better the observations. in particular, variable imfs of the kindexplored here are unable to reproduce the observed abundance gradients evenwhen allowing for changes in other chemical evolution model parameters as, forinstance, the star formation rate. as a consequence of this we conclude thatthe g-dwarf metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a largetimescale and a constant imf, since it is possible to find variable imfs of thekind studied here, reproducing the g-dwarf metallicity but this worsen theagreement with other observational constraints.

astro-ph;9910279	proto-galactic starbursts at high redshift	we have computed the evolving ultraviolet-millimeter spectral energydistribution (sed) produced by proto-galactic starbursts at high redshift,incorporating the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium in a consistentmanner. dust extinction is calculated in a novel way, that is not based onempirical calibrations of extinction curves, but rather on the lifetime ofmolecular clouds which delays the emergence of each successive generation ofstars at ultraviolet wavelengths by typically 15 myr. the predicted rest-framefar-infrared to millimeter-wave emission includes the calculation of molecularemission-line luminosities ($^{12}$co and o$_{2}$ among other molecules)consistent with the evolving chemical abundances. here we present details ofthis new model, along with the results of comparing its predictions withseveral high-redshift observables, namely: the ultraviolet seds of lyman-limitgalaxies, the high-redshift radiogalaxies 4c41.17 and 8c1435, the scubasub-millimeter survey of the hubble deep field (hdf), and the seds ofintermediate-redshift elliptical galaxies. with our new reddening method, weare able to fit the spectrum of the lyman-limit galaxy 1512-cb58, and we findan extinction of about 1.9 magnitudes at 1600 {\aa}. the model also predictsthat most lyman-limit galaxies should have a value of $\alpha$ inside thatrange, as it is observed. the 850 $\mu$m flux density of a typical lyman-limitgalaxy is expected to be only $\simeq 0.5$ mjy, and therefore the opticalcounterparts of the most luminous sub-mm sources in the hdf (or any othercurrently feasible sub-mm survey) are unlikely to be lyman-break galaxies.

0811.2258	the timescales of chemical enrichment in the galaxy	the time-scales of chemical enrichment are fundamental to understand theevolution of abundances and abundance ratios in galaxies. in particular, thetime-scales for the enrichment by sne ii and sne ia are crucial in interpretingthe evolution of abundance ratios such as [alpha/fe]. in fact, thealpha-elements are produced mainly by sne ii on time-scales of the order of 3to 30 myr, whereas the fe is mainly produced by sne ia on a larger range oftime-scales, going from 30 myr to a hubble time. this produces differences inthe [alpha/fe] ratios at high and low redshift and it is known as "time-delay"model. in this talk we review the most common progenitor models for sne ia andthe derived rates together with the effect of the star formation history on the[alpha/fe] versus [fe/h] diagram in the galaxy. from these diagrams we canderive the timescale for the formation of the inner halo (roughly 2 gyr), thetimescale for the formation of the local disk (roughly 7-8 gyr) as well thetime-scales for the formation of the whole disk. these are functions of thegalactocentric distance and vary from 2-3 gyr in the inner disk up to a hubbletime in the outer disk (inside-out formation). finally, the timescale for theformation of the bulge is found to be no longer than 0.3 gyr, similar to thetimescale for the formation of larger spheroids such as elliptical galaxies. weshow the time-delay model applied to galaxies of different morphological type,identified by different star formation histories, and how it constrainsdiffering galaxy formation models.
