1001.0026	detection of solar-like oscillations from kepler photometry of the open  cluster ngc 6819	asteroseismology of stars in clusters has been a long-sought goal because theassumption of a common age, distance and initial chemical composition allowsstrong tests of the theory of stellar evolution. we report results from thefirst 34 days of science data from the kepler mission for the open cluster ngc6819 -- one of four clusters in the field of view. we obtain the first cleardetections of solar-like oscillations in the cluster red giants and are able tomeasure the large frequency separation and the frequency of maximum oscillationpower. we find that the asteroseismic parameters allow us to testcluster-membership of the stars, and even with the limited seismic data inhand, we can already identify four possible non-members despite their having abetter than 80% membership probability from radial velocity measurements. weare also able to determine the oscillation amplitudes for stars that span abouttwo orders of magnitude in luminosity and find good agreement with theprediction that oscillation amplitudes scale as the luminosity to the power of0.7. these early results demonstrate the unique potential of asteroseismologyof the stellar clusters observed by kepler.

1001.0216	instrument performance in kepler's first months	the kepler mission relies on precise differential photometry to detect the 80parts per million (ppm) signal from an earth-sun equivalent transit. suchprecision requires superb instrument stability on time scales up to ~2 days andsystematic error removal to better than 20 ppm. to this end, the spacecraft andphotometer underwent 67 days of commissioning, which included several data setstaken to characterize the photometer performance. because kepler has noshutter, we took a series of dark images prior to the dust cover ejection, fromwhich we measured the bias levels, dark current, and read noise. these basicdetector properties are essentially unchanged from ground-based tests,indicating that the photometer is working as expected. several image artifactshave proven more complex than when observed during ground testing, as a resultof their interactions with starlight and the greater thermal stability inflight, which causes the temperature-dependent artifact variations to be on thetimescales of transits. because of kepler's unprecedented sensitivity andstability, we have also seen several unexpected systematics that affectphotometric precision. we are using the first 43 days of science data tocharacterize these effects and to develop detection and mitigation methods thatwill be implemented in the calibration pipeline. based on early testing, weexpect to attain kepler's planned photometric precision over 80%-90% of thefield of view.

1001.0256	initial characteristics of kepler long cadence data for detecting  transiting planets	the kepler mission seeks to detect earth-size planets transiting solar-likestars in its ~115 deg^2 field of view over the course of its 3.5 year primarymission by monitoring the brightness of each of ~156,000 long cadence stellartargets with a time resolution of 29.4 minutes. we discuss the photometricprecision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for dataobtained in the 33.5-day long quarter 1 (q1) observations that ended 2009 june15. the lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at varioustimescales is consistent with expected random noise sources, indicating thatkepler has the capability to fulfill its mission. the kepler light curvesexhibit high precision over a large dynamic range, which will surely permittheir use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding andcharacterizing planets. we discuss the temporal characteristics of both the rawflux time series and the systematic error-corrected flux time series producedby the kepler science pipeline, and give examples illustrating kepler's largedynamic range and the variety of light curves obtained from the q1observations.

1001.0258	overview of the kepler science processing pipeline	the kepler mission science operations center (soc) performs several criticalfunctions including managing the ~156,000 target stars, associated targettables, science data compression tables and parameters, as well as processingthe raw photometric data downlinked from the spacecraft each month. the rawdata are first calibrated at the pixel level to correct for bias, smear inducedby a shutterless readout, and other detector and electronic effects. abackground sky flux is estimated from ~4500 pixels on each of the 84 ccdreadout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimalaperture for each star. ancillary engineering data and diagnostic informationextracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in theflux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching forsignatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter.stars with signatures exceeding 7.1 sigma are subjected to a suite ofstatistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion toreject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. physicalparameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature,and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residuallight curve. the pipeline is operational, finding planetary signatures andproviding robust eliminations of false positives.

1001.0331	the kepler pixel response function	kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of earth-size exoplanetsorbiting solar-like stars. such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm.the high photometric precision demanded by kepler requires detailed knowledgeof how the kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation.this information is provided by the kepler pixel response function (prf),defined as the composite of kepler's optical point spread function, integratedspacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematiceffects. to provide sub-pixel resolution, the prf is represented as apiecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. this continuousrepresentation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel giventhe star's pixel position. the advantages and difficulties of this polynomialrepresentation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variationin the prf and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomialpatches. on-orbit super-resolution measurements of the prf across the keplerfield of view are described. two uses of the prf are presented: the selectionof pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal to noise ratiofor that star, and prf-fitted centroids which provide robust and accuratestellar positions on the ccd, primarily used for attitude and plate scaletracking. good knowledge of the prf has been a critical component for thesuccessful collection of high-precision photometry by kepler.

1001.0414	photometric variability in kepler target stars: the sun among stars -- a  first look	the kepler mission provides an exciting opportunity to study the lightcurvesof stars with unprecedented precision and continuity of coverage. this is thefirst look at a large sample of stars with photometric data of a quality thathas heretofore been only available for our sun. it provides the firstopportunity to compare the irradiance variations of our sun to a large cohortof stars ranging from vary similar to rather different stellar properties, at awide variety of ages. although kepler data is in an early phase of maturity,and we only analyze the first month of coverage, it is sufficient to garner thefirst meaningful measurements of our sun's variability in the context of alarge cohort of main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood. we find thatnearly half of the full sample is more active than the active sun, althoughmost of them are not more than twice as active. the active fraction is closerto a third for the stars most similar to the sun, and rises to well more thanhalf for stars cooler than mid k spectral types.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1006.1953	nicmos observations of the transiting hot jupiter xo-1b	we refine the physical parameters of the transiting hot jupiter planet xo-1band its stellar host xo-1 using hst nicmos observations. xo-1b has a radiusrp=1.21+/-0.03 rjup, and xo-1 has a radius rs=0.94+/-0.02 rsun, where theuncertainty in the mass of xo-1 dominates the uncertainty of rp and rs. thereare no significant differences in the xo-1 system properties between thesebroad-band nir observations and previous determinations based upon ground-basedoptical observations. we measure two transit timings from these observationswith 9 s and 15 s precision. as a residual to a linear ephemeris model, thereis a 2.0 sigma timing difference between the two hst visits that are separatedby 3 transit events (11.8 days). these two transit timings and additionaltimings from the literature are sufficient to rule out the presence of an earthmass planet orbiting in 2:1 mean motion resonance coplanar with xo-1b. weidentify and correct for poorly understood gain-like variations present innicmos time series data. this correction reduces the effective noise in timeseries photometry by a factor of two, for the case of xo-1.

1008.0853	white-light flares on cool stars in the kepler quarter 1 data	we present the results of a search for white light flares on the ~23,000 cooldwarfs in the kepler quarter 1 long cadence data. we have identified 373flaring stars, some of which flare multiple times during the observationperiod. we calculate relative flare energies, flare rates and durations, andcompare these with the quiescent photometric variability of our sample. we findthat m dwarfs tend to flare more frequently but for shorter durations than kdwarfs, and that they emit more energy relative to their quiescent luminosityin a given flare than k dwarfs. stars that are more photometrically variable inquiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variabilityis only weakly correlated with flare frequency. we estimate distances for oursample of flare stars and find that the flaring fraction agrees well with otherobservations of flare statistics for stars within 300 pc above the galacticplane. these observations provide a more rounded view of stellar flares bysampling stars that have not been pre-selected by their activity, and areinformative for understanding the influence of these flares on planetaryhabitability.

1008.1092	photometric variability in kepler target stars. ii. an overview of  amplitude, periodicity, and rotation in first quarter data	we provide an overview of stellar variability in the first quarter of datafrom the kepler mission. the intent of this paper is to examine the entiresample of over 150,000 target stars for periodic behavior in their lightcurves,and relate this to stellar characteristics. these data constitute anunprecedented study of stellar variability given its great precision andcomplete time coverage (with a half hour cadence). because the full keplerpipeline is not currently suitable for a study of stellar variability of thissort, we describe our procedures for treating the "raw" pipeline data. abouthalf of the total sample exhibits convincing periodic variability up to twoweeks, with amplitudes ranging from differential intensity changes less than10^{-4} up to more than 10 percent. k and m dwarfs have a greater fraction ofperiod behavior than g dwarfs. the giants in the sample have distinctivequasi-periodic behavior, but are not periodic in the way we define it. not allperiodicities are due to rotation, and the most significant period is notnecessarily the rotation period. we discuss properties of the lightcurves, andin particular look at a sample of very clearly periodic g dwarfs. it is clearthat a large number of them do vary because of rotation and starspots, but itwill take further analysis to fully exploit this.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1103.5805	gravity modes as a way to distinguish between hydrogen- and  helium-burning red giant stars	red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen intheir cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. once a red giantis sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion.outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties inthe amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount ofinternal mixing from rotation and other processes. progress is hampered by ourinability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core andthose still only burning hydrogen in a shell. asteroseismology offers a wayforward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of starsusing their natural oscillation frequencies. here we report observations ofgravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction betweenevolutionary stages to be made. we use high-precision photometry obtained withthe kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in severalhundred red giants. we find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences withapproximately regular period spacings. these stars fall into two clear groups,allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars(period spacing mostly about 50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium(period spacing about 100 to 300 seconds).

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1107.5207	kepler mission stellar and instrument noise properties	kepler mission results are rapidly contributing to fundamentally newdiscoveries in both the exoplanet and asteroseismology fields. the datareturned from kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed,precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extentof high duty cycle observations. as the first mission to provide extensive timeseries measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a levelhitherto possible only for the sun, the results from kepler will vastlyincrease our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. herewe report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of mostinterest for detection of exoplanets via transits. by design the data frommoderately bright kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levelsof noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamentallimitations such as poisson statistics and any instrument noise. the noiselevels attained by kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50% the target levels forsolar-type, quiet stars. we provide a decomposition of observed noise for anensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (poisson andreadout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to thestars. the largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise followsfrom intrinsic stellar noise. we show that using stellar parameters fromgalactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation,activity and hence noise levels reproduces the primary intrinsic stellar noisefeatures.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1302.1141	infrared transmission spectroscopy of the exoplanets hd209458b and xo-1b  using the wide field camera-3 on the hubble space telescope	exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared usinghubble/nicmos is currently ambiguous because different observational groupsclaim different results from the same data, depending on their analysismethodologies. spatial scanning with hubble/wfc3 provides an opportunity toresolve this ambiguity. we here report wfc3 spectroscopy of the giant planetshd209458b and xo-1b in transit, using spatial scanning mode for maximumphoton-collecting efficiency. we introduce an analysis technique that derivesthe exoplanetary transmission spectrum without the necessity of explicitlydecorrelating instrumental effects, and achieves nearly photon-limitedprecision even at the high flux levels collected in spatial scan mode. ourerrors are within 6-percent (xo-1) and 26-percent (hd209458b) of thephoton-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than0.01-percent per spectral channel. both planets exhibit water absorption ofapproximately 200 ppm at the water peak near 1.38 microns. our result for xo-1bcontradicts the much larger absorption derived from nicmos spectroscopy. theweak water absorption we measure for hd209458b is reminiscent of the weaknessof sodium absorption in the first transmission spectroscopy of an exoplanetatmosphere by charbonneau et al. (2002). model atmospheres havinguniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram accountapproximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in thisplanet. our results for hd209458b support the picture advocated by pont et al.(2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmissionspectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.however, the extra opacity needed for hd209458b is grayer than for hd189733b,with a weaker rayleigh component.

1302.2624	fundamental properties of kepler planet-candidate host stars using  asteroseismology	we have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3% and 7% inradius and mass, respectively. the results include new asteroseismic solutionsfor four host stars with confirmed planets (kepler-4, kepler-14, kepler-23 andkepler-25) and increase the total number of kepler host stars withasteroseismic solutions to 77. a comparison with stellar properties in theplanet-candidate catalog by batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants andgiants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by upto a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in goodagreement. we furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a largemajority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassifiedgiants. using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radiichange from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to asub-jupiter size, or vice versa. a comparison of stellar densities fromasteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in batalha et al.assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half ofthe sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters, or due toplanet candidates which may be in eccentric orbits. finally, we investigatetentative correlations between host-star masses and planet candidate radii,orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may beinfluenced by the small sample size and detection biases.

1305.3281	relative photometry of hat-p-1b occultations	we present hst stis observations of two occultations of the transitingexoplanet hat-p-1b. by measuring the planet to star flux ratio near opposition,we constrain the geometric albedo of the planet, which is strongly linked toits atmospheric temperature gradient. an advantage of hat-p-1 as a target isits binary companion ads 16402 a, which provides an excellent photometricreference, simplifying the usual steps in removing instrumental artifacts fromhst time-series photometry. we find that without this reference star, we wouldneed to detrend the lightcurve with the time of the exposures as well as thefirst three powers of hst orbital phase, and this would introduce a strong biasin the results for the albedo. however, with this reference star, we only needto detrend the data with the time of the exposures to achieve the sameper-point scatter, therefore we can avoid most of the bias associated withdetrending. our final result is a 2 sigma upper limit of 0.64 for the geometricalbedo of hat-p-1b between 577 and 947 nm.

1307.8128	kepler-63b: a giant planet in a polar orbit around a young sun-like star	we present the discovery and characterization of a giant planet orbiting theyoung sun-like star kepler-63 (koi-63, $m_{\rm kp} = 11.6$, $t_{\rm eff} =5576$ k, $m_\star = 0.98\, m_\odot$). the planet transits every 9.43 days, withapparent depth variations and brightening anomalies caused by large starspots.the planet's radius is $6.1 \pm 0.2 r_{\earth}$, based on the transit lightcurve and the estimated stellar parameters. the planet's mass could not bemeasured with the existing radial-velocity data, due to the high level ofstellar activity, but if we assume a circular orbit we can place a rough upperbound of $120 m_{\earth}$ (3$\sigma$). the host star has a high obliquity($\psi$ = $104^{\circ}$), based on the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and ananalysis of starspot-crossing events. this result is valuable because almostall previous obliquity measurements are for stars with more massive planets andshorter-period orbits. in addition, the polar orbit of the planet combined withan analysis of spot-crossing events reveals a large and persistent polarstarspot. such spots have previously been inferred using doppler tomography,and predicted in simulations of magnetic activity of young sun-like stars.

1405.3659	kepler-93b: a terrestrial world measured to within 120 km, and a test  case for a new spitzer observing mode	we present the characterization of the kepler-93 exoplanetary system, basedon three years of photometry gathered by the kepler spacecraft. the durationand cadence of the kepler observations, in tandem with the brightness of thestar, enable unusually precise constraints on both the planet and its host. weconduct an asteroseismic analysis of the kepler photometry and conclude thatthe star has an average density of 1.652+/-0.006 g/cm^3. its mass of0.911+/-0.033 m_sun renders it one of the lowest-mass subjects of asteroseismicstudy. an analysis of the transit signature produced by the planet kepler-93b,which appears with a period of 4.72673978+/-9.7x10^-7 days, returns aconsistent but less precise measurement of the stellar density, 1.72+0.02-0.28g/cm^3. the agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetaryinterpretation of the transit signal. the achromatic transit depth, as comparedbetween kepler and the spitzer space telescope, supports the same conclusion.we observed seven transits of kepler-93b with spitzer, three of which weconducted in a new observing mode. the pointing strategy we employed to gatherthis subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratior_p/r_star. we find, after folding together the stellar radius measurement of0.919+/-0.011 r_sun with the transit depth, a best-fit value for the planetaryradius of 1.481+/-0.019 r_earth. the uncertainty of 120 km on our measurementof the planet's size currently renders it one of the most precisely measuredplanetary radii outside of the solar system. together with the radius, theplanetary mass of 3.8+/-1.5 m_earth corresponds to a rocky density of 6.3+/-2.6g/cm^3. after applying a prior on the plausible maximum densities ofsimilarly-sized worlds between 1--1.5 r_earth, we find that kepler-93bpossesses an average density within this group.

1407.1057	revision of earth-sized kepler planet candidate properties with high  resolution imaging by hubble space telescope	we present the results of our hubble space telescope program and describe howour analysis methods were used to re-evaluate the habitability of some of themost interesting kepler planet candidates. our program observed 22 keplerobject of interest (koi) host stars, several of which were found to be multiplestar systems unresolved by kepler. we use our high-resolution imaging tospatially resolve the stellar multiplicity of kepler-296, koi-2626, andkoi-3049, and develop a conversion to the kepler photometry (kp) from the f555wand f775w filters on wfc3/uvis. the binary system kepler-296 (5 planets) has aprojected separation of 0.217" (80au); koi-2626 (1 planet candidate) is atriple star system with a projected separation of 0.201" (70au) between theprimary and secondary components and 0.161" (55au) between the primary andtertiary; and the binary system koi-3049 (1 planet candidate) has a projectedseparation of 0.464" (225au). we use our measured photometry to fit theseparated stellar components to the latest victoria-regina stellar models withsynthetic photometry to conclude that the systems are coeval. the components ofthe three systems range from mid-k dwarf to mid-m dwarf spectral types. wesolved for the planetary properties of each system analytically and via an mcmcalgorithm using our independent stellar parameters. the planets range from~1.6r_earth to ~4.2r_earth, mostly super earths and mini-neptunes. as a resultof the stellar multiplicity, some planets previously in the habitable zone are,in fact, not, and other planets may be habitable depending on their assumedstellar host.

1501.05651	a spin-down clock for cool stars from observations of a  2.5-billion-year-old cluster	the ages of the most common stars - low-mass (cool) stars like the sun, andsmaller - are difficult to derive because traditional dating methods usestellar properties that either change little as the stars age or are hard tomeasure. the rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with timeas the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. if properly calibrated,rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on themethod of gyrochronology. to calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship betweenrotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses,which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars inclusters with well-known ages. hitherto, such measurements have been possibleonly in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years, andgyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions.here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the2.5-billion-year-old cluster ngc 6819. the periods reveal a well-definedrelationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age,suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived forlarge numbers of cool galactic field stars.

1501.07286	planetary candidates observed by kepler v: planet sample from q1-q12 (36  months)	the kepler mission discovered 2842 exoplanet candidates with 2 years of data.we provide updates to the kepler planet candidate sample based upon 3 years(q1-q12) of data. through a series of tests to exclude false-positives,primarily caused by eclipsing binary stars and instrumental systematics, 855additional planetary candidates have been discovered, bringing the total numberknown to 3697. we provide revised transit parameters and accompanying posteriordistributions based on a markov chain monte carlo algorithm for the cumulativecatalogue of kepler objects of interest. there are now 130 candidates in thecumulative catalogue that receive less than twice the flux the earth receivesand more than 1100 have a radius less than 1.5 rearth. there are now a dozencandidates meeting both criteria, roughly doubling the number of candidateearth analogs. a majority of planetary candidates have a high probability ofbeing bonafide planets, however, there are populations of likelyfalse-positives. we discuss and suggest additional cuts that can be easilyapplied to the catalogue to produce a set of planetary candidates with goodfidelity. the full catalogue is publicly available at the nasa exoplanetarchive.

1503.03173	low false-positive rate of kepler candidates estimated from a  combination of spitzer and follow-up observations	(abridged) nasa's kepler mission has provided several thousand transitingplanet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fractionof bona fide planets. estimating the rate of false positives of the overallkepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. we present theresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with thespitzer telescope during the the kepler mission. these observations arededicated to estimating the false positive rate (fpr) amongst the keplercandidates. we select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges instellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transitswith spitzer at 4.5 microns. we use these observations to measures thecandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. a bandpass-dependent depthalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the sourceof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. for most of the candidates(85%), the transit depths measured with kepler are consistent with the depthsmeasured with spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that themost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars thatdilute the photometry. the spitzer constraints on their own yield fprs between5-40%, depending on the kois. by considering the population of the kepler fieldstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, wefind that the overall fpr of our sample is low. the measured upper limit on thefpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. this observationalresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that isnot investigated by the kepler observations, provides an independent indicationthat kepler's false positive rate is low.

1508.05054	kepler mission stellar and instrument noise properties revisited	an earlier study of the kepler mission noise properties on time scales ofprimary relevance to detection of exoplanet transits found that higher thanexpected noise followed to a large extent from the stars, rather thaninstrument or data analysis performance. the earlier study over the first sixquarters of kepler data is extended to the full four years ultimatelycomprising the mission. efforts to improve the pipeline data analysis have beensuccessful in reducing noise levels modestly as evidenced by smaller valuesderived from the current data products. the new analyses of noise properties ontransit time scales show significant changes in the component attributed toinstrument and data analysis, with essentially no change in the inferredstellar noise. we also extend the analyses to time scales of several days,instead of several hours to better sample stellar noise that follows frommagnetic activity. on the longer time scale there is a shift in stellar noisefor solar-type stars to smaller values in comparison to solar values.

0806.1497	photometric oscillations of low luminosity red giant stars	i present details of the variations of several hundred red giant stars ontime scales of a few hours to a few days from hubble space telescope (hst)observations of a low-extinction galactic bulge sample from an intensive sevenday campaign. variations in the red giants are shown to be a strong function ofposition within the color-magnitude diagram (cmd) in accord with generalexpectations from theory. amplitudes are greater for stars with larger radii,whether this results from higher luminosity at the same effective temperatureor lower temperature at a fixed apparent magnitude. likewise, characteristictime scales for the variations increase to the upper right in a cmd as does theratio of amplitudes measured at 606 nm compared to 814 nm. characteristicvariation time scales are well matched by low-order radial pulsation modes. theeffective sample discussed here extends from about two magnitudes above thebulge turnoff at which red giant radii are ~7 r/r_{\odot} at 5,000 k withtypical amplitudes of ~0.5 mmag to ~40 r/r_{\odot} at 4,000 k with amplitudesof ~3.5 mmag. variability characteristics are quite similar at any givenposition in the cmd, and at levels in the cmd where oscillations are easilydetected nearly all red giants show such. if these variations representoscillations with sufficient lifetimes to derive accurate mode frequencies moreextensive observations, e.g. as should soon be provided by the kepler mission},would provide a rich asteroseismic return.

astro-ph;0005192	resolving the controversy over the core radius of 47 tucanae (ngc 104)	this paper investigates the discrepancy between recent measurements of thedensity profile of the globular cluster 47 tuc that have used hst data sets.guhathakurta et al. (1992) used pre-refurbishment wfpc1 v-band images to deriver_c = 23" +/- 2". calzetti et al. (1993) suggested that the density profile isa superposition of two king profiles (r_c = 8" and r_c = 25") based on u-bandfoc images. de marchi et al. (1996) used deep wfpc1 u-band images to derive r_c= 12" +/- 2". differences in the adopted cluster centers are not the cause ofthe discrepancy. our independent analysis of the data used by de marchi et al.reaches the following conclusions: (1) de marchi et al.'s r_c ~ 12" value isspuriously low, a result of radially-varying bias in the star counts in amagnitude limited sample -- photometric errors and a steeply rising stellarluminosity function cause more stars to scatter across the limiting magnitudeinto the sample than out of it, especially near the cluster center wherecrowding effects are most severe. (2) changing the limiting magnitude to themain sequence turnoff, away from the steep part of the luminosity function,partially alleviates the problem and results in r_c = 18". (3) combining such alimiting magnitude with accurate photometry derived from psf fitting, insteadof the less accurate aperture photometry employed by de marchi et al., resultsin a reliable measurement of the density profile which is well fit by r_c = 22"+/- 2". archival wfpc2 data are used to derive a star list with a higher degreeof completeness, greater photometric accuracy, and wider areal coverage thanthe wfpc1 and foc data sets; the wfpc2-based density profile supports the aboveconclusions, yielding r_c = 24" +/- 1.9".

astro-ph;0210554	near-field microlensing and its effects on stellar transit observations  by kepler	in this paper, we explore the astrophysical implications of near-fieldmicrolensing and its effects on stellar transit observations, with a specialemphasis on the kepler mission. kepler is a nasa-approved mission whose goal isto detect a large number of extrasolar, earth-like planets by obtainingnear-continuous photometry of &gt; 100,000 f, g, and k dwarfs for four years. theexpected photometric precision of kepler is 90 micromag (achieved in 15 minutesamples), at which the effect of microlensing by a transiting companion can besignificant. for example, for a solar-type primary transited by a white-dwarfsecondary, the maximum depth of the transit is 0.01%, which is almost entirelycompensated by the microlensing amplification when the white dwarf is at ~0.05au. the combined effect of microlensing and transit increases to a netamplification of 150 micromag at an orbital separation of 0.1 au, and 2.4millimag at an orbital separation of 1 au. thus, the effect of microlensing canbe used to break the degeneracy between a planetary-mass object for which themicrolensing effect is negligible, and a more massive object of the same size.for brown dwarfs at orbital separations of a few au, the effect of microlensingis several percent of the transit depth, and hence the microlensing effect mustbe taken into account in deriving the physical parameters of the brown dwarf.the microlensing signal caused by a neutron star or a black hole in a binarycan be several millimag, far exceeding the transit depth, and potentiallydetectable even from ground-based observations. kepler will be sensitive towhite dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes in binaries through theirmicrolensing signatures. these observations can be used to derive the frequencyof such compact objects in binaries, and to determine their masses.

astro-ph;0509407	exploring the potential of integral field spectroscopy observing  extrasolar planet transits: ground based observations of the atmospheric na  in hd209458b	we explore the use of integral field spectroscopy (ifs) to observe extrasolarplanet transits. although this technique should find its full potential inspace observations (e.g. jwst, tpf), we have tested its basics with groundbased time series observations of hd209458b obtained with wht+integral during atransit. for this analysis we used 5550 spectra, obtained in 150 exposuresduring a period of &gt;7 hours. we found that ifs offers 3 fundamental advantageswith respect to previously used methods. (i) it improves the effective s/n inphoton limited observations by distributing the light coming from the star intothe 2 dimensions of the detector. (ii) this type of ifs data allows to'auto-calibrate' instrumental and background effects. (iii) since the starimage characteristics as well as its photometric properties are extracted fromthe same data-cube, it is possible to decorrelate photometric instabilitiesinduced by psf variations. these data have also allowed us to explore theaccuracy limits of ground based 'relative' spectrophotometry. this was doneusing a photometric index that probes the nad lines, for which we obtained anominal 1-sigma error of ~1.0x10^-4. this result, based on observations of only1 transit, indicates that this type of ground observation can constrain thecharacterization of the transmission spectrum of extrasolar planets. thepresent observations are compatible with no extra nad depression during thetransit. though this result seems to be inconsistent with the recently reportedhst-stis findings we point out its limited statistical meaning: the resultsdisagree within 1-sigma, but agree within 2-sigma. we also give somerecommenda-tions to instrument developers in order to enhance the efficiency ofthe method.

astro-ph;0603542	using stellar limb-darkening to refine the properties of hd 209458b	we use multi-band photometry to refine estimates for the planetary radius andorbital inclination of the transiting planet system hd 209458. we gathered 1066spectra over four distinct transits with the stis spectrometer on the hubblespace telescope using two gratings with a resolution r=1500 and a combinedwavelength range of 290-1030 nm. we divide the spectra into tenspectrophotometric bandpasses, five for each grating, of equal wavelength spanwithin each grating, and fit a transit curve over all bandpassessimultaneously. in our fit we use theoretical values for the stellarlimb-darkening to further constrain the planetary radius. we find that theradius of hd 209458b is 1.320 +/- 0.025 r_jup, which is a factor of two moreprecise than current estimates. we also obtain improved estimates for theorbital period p and time of center of transit t_c. although in principle thephoton-limited precision of the stis data should allow us to measure the timingof individual transits to a precision of 2-7 s, we find that systematicinstrumental offsets in the measured flux from one orbit of the spacecraft tothe next degrade these measurements to a typical precision of +/- 14 s. withinthis level of error, we find no significant variations in the timing of theeight events examined in this work.

astro-ph;9903229	high redshift supernovae in the hubble deep field	two supernovae detected in the hubble deep field using the original december1995 epoch and data from a shorter (63000 s in f814w) december 1997 visit withhst are discussed. the supernovae (sne) are both associated with distinctgalaxies at redshifts of 0.95 (spectroscopic) from cohen etal. (1996) and 1.32(photometric) from the work of fernandez-soto, lanzetta, and yahil (1998).these redshifts are near, in the case of 0.95, and well beyond for 1.32 thegreatest distance reported previously for sne. we show that our observationsare sensitive to sne to z &lt; 1.8 in either epoch for an event near peakbrightness. detailed simulations are discussed that quantify the level at whichfalse events from our search phase would start to to arise, and thecompleteness of our search as a function of both sn brightness and host galaxyredshift. the number of type ia and type ii sne expected as a function ofredshift in the two hdf epochs are discussed in relation to several publishedpredictions and our own detailed calculations. a mean detection frequency ofone sn per epoch for the small hdf area is consistent with expectations fromcurrent theory.

astro-ph;9908270	faint, moving objects in the hubble deep field: components of the dark  halo?	the deepest optical image of the sky, the hubble deep field (hdf), obtainedwith the hubble space telescope (hst) in december 1995, has been compared to asimilar image taken in december 1997. two very faint, blue, isolated andunresolved objects are found to display a substantial apparent proper motion,23+/-5 mas/yr and 26+/-5 mas/yr; a further three objects at the detection limitof the second epoch observations may also be moving. galactic structure modelspredict a general absence of stars in the color-magnitude range in which theseobjects are found. however, these observations are consistent withrecently-developed models of old white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres, whosecolor, contrary to previous expectations, has been shown to be blue. if theseapparently moving objects are indeed old white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheresand masses near 0.5 m_sun, they have ages of approximately 12 gyr, and a localmass density that is sufficient, within the large uncertainties arising fromthe small size of the sample, to account for the entire missing galacticdynamical mass.
