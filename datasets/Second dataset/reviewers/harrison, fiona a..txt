physics;0112001	effects of bulk and surface conductivity on the performance of cdznte  pixel detectors	we studied the effects of bulk and surface conductivity on the performance ofhigh-resistivity cdznte (czt) pixel detectors with pt contacts. we emphasizethe difference in mechanisms of the bulk and surface conductivity as indicatedby their different temperature behaviors. in addition, the existence of a thin(10-100 a) oxide layer on the surface of czt, formed during the fabricationprocess, affects both bulk and surface leakage currents. we demonstrate thatthe measured i-v dependencies of bulk current can be explained by consideringthe czt detector as a metal-semiconductor-metal system with two back-to-backschottky-barrier contacts. the high surface leakage current is apparently dueto the presence of a low-resistivity surface layer that has characteristicswhich differ considerably from those of the bulk material. this surface layerhas a profound effect on the charge collection efficiency in detectors withmulti-contact geometry; some fraction of the electric field lines originated onthe cathode intersects the surface areas between the pixel contacts where thecharge produced by an ionizing particle gets trapped. to overcome this effectwe place a grid of thin electrodes between the pixel contacts; when the grid isnegatively biased, the strong electric field in the gaps between the pixelsforces the electrons landing on the surface to move toward the contacts,preventing the charge loss. we have investigated these effects by using cztpixel detectors indium bump bonded to a custom-built vlsi readout chip.

0911.2448	a comparison of x-ray and mid-infrared selection of obscured agn	we compare the relative merits of agn selection at x-ray and mid-infraredwavelengths using data from moderately deep fields observed by both chandra andspitzer. the x-ray-selected agn sample and associated optical follow-up aredrawn from the sexsi program. mid-infrared data in these fields are derivedfrom spitzer imaging, and mid-infrared agn selection is accomplished primarilythrough application of the irac color-color agn `wedge' selection technique.nearly all x-ray sources in these fields which exhibit clear spectroscopicsignatures of agn activity have mid-infrared colors consistent with irac agnselection. these are predominantly the most luminous x-ray sources. x-raysources that lack high-ionization and/or broad lines in their optical spectraare far less likely to be selected as agn by mid-infrared color selectiontechniques. the fraction of x-ray sources identified as agn in the mid-infraredincreases monotonically as the x-ray luminosity increases. conversely, only 22%of mid-infrared-selected agn are detected at x-ray energies in the moderatelydeep (~100 ks) chandra data. we hypothesize that the irac agn that lack x-raydetections are predominantly high-luminosity agn that are obscured and/or lieat high redshift. a stacking analysis of x-ray-undetected sources shows thatobjects in the mid-infrared agn selection wedge have average x-ray fluxes inthe 2-8 kev band three times higher than sources that fall outside the wedge.their x-ray spectra are also harder. it is evident from this comparative studythat in order to create a complete, unbiased census of supermassive black holegrowth and evolution, a combination of sensitive infrared, x-ray and hard x-rayselection is required. we conclude by discussing what samples will be providedby upcoming survey missions such as wise, erosita, and nustar.

0801.0288	constraints on the average magnetic field strength of relic radio  sources 0917+75 and 1401-33 from xmm-newton observations	we observed two relic radio sources, 0917+75 and 1401-33, with the xmm-newtonx-ray observatory. we did not detect any x-ray emission, thermal ornon-thermal, in excess of the local background level from either target. thisimposes new upper limits on the x-ray flux due to inverse compton scattering ofphotons from the cosmic microwave background by relativistic electrons in therelic sources, and new lower limits on the magnetic field strength from therelative strength of the radio and x-ray emission. the combination of radio andx-ray observations provides a measure of the magnetic field independent ofequipartition or minimum energy assumptions. due to increasing sensitivity ofradio observations, the known population of cluster relics has been growing;however, studies of non-thermal x-ray emission from relics remain scarce. ourstudy adds to the small sample of relics studied in x-rays. in both relics, ourfield strength lower limits are slightly larger than estimates of theequipartition magnetic field.

1310.0745	the ultraluminous x-ray sources ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2: a broadband study  with nustar and xmm-newton	we present the results of nustar and xmm-newton observations of the twoultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2. the combined spectralbandpass of the two satellites enables us to produce the first spectrum of x-1between 0.3 and 30 kev, while x-2 is not significantly detected by nustar above10 kev. the nustar data demonstrate that x-1 has a clear cutoff above 10 kev,whose presence was only marginally detectable with previous x-ray observations.this cutoff rules out the interpretation of x-1 as a black hole in a standardlow/hard state, and it is deeper than predicted for the downturn of a broadenediron line in a reflection-dominated regime. the cutoff differs from theprediction of a single-temperature comptonization model. further, a colddisk-like black body component at ~0.3 kev is required by the data, confirmingprevious measurements by xmm-newton only. we observe a spectral transition inx-2, from a state with high luminosity and strong variability to alower-luminosity state with no detectable variability, and we link thisbehavior to a transition from a super-eddington to a sub-eddington regime.

1312.2635	first hard x-ray detection of the non-thermal emission around the arches  cluster: morphology and spectral studies with nustar	the arches cluster is a young, densely packed massive star cluster in ourgalaxy that shows a high level of star formation activity. the nature of theextended non-thermal x-ray emission around the cluster remains unclear. theobserved bright fe k_alpha line emission at 6.4 kev from material that isneutral or in a low ionization state can be produced either by x-rayphotoionization or by cosmic-ray particle bombardment or both. in this paper wereport on the first detection of the extended emission around the archescluster above 10 kev with the nustar mission, and present results on itsmorphology and spectrum. the spatial distribution of the hard x-ray emission isfound to be consistent with the broad region around the cluster where the 6.4kev line is observed. the interpretation of the hard x-ray emission within thecontext of the x-ray reflection model puts a strong constraint on theluminosity of the possible illuminating hard x-ray source. the properties ofthe observed emission are also in broad agreement with the low-energycosmic-ray proton excitation scenario.

1403.0900	nustar detection of high-energy x-ray emission and rapid variability  from sagittarius a* flares	sagittarius a* harbors the supermassive black hole that lies at the dynamicalcenter of our galaxy. sagittarius a* spends most of its time in a lowluminosity emission state but flares frequently in the infrared and x-ray,increasing up to a few hundred fold in brightness for up to a few hours at atime. the physical processes giving rise to the x-ray flares are uncertain.here we report the detection with the nustar observatory in summer and fall2012 of four low to medium amplitude x-ray flares to energies up to 79 kev. forthe first time, we clearly see that the power-law spectrum of sagittarius a*x-ray flares extends to high energy, with no evidence for a cut off. althoughthe photon index of the absorbed power-law fits are in agreement with pastobservations, we find a difference between the photon index of two of theflares (significant at the 95% confidence level). the spectra of the twobrightest flares (~55 times quiescence in the 2-10 kev band) are compared tosimple physical models in an attempt to identify the main x-ray emissionmechanism, but the data do not allow us to significantly discriminate betweenthem. however, we confirm the previous finding that the parameters obtainedwith synchrotron models are, for the x-ray emission, physically more reasonablethan those obtained with inverse-compton models. one flare exhibits large andrapid (&lt; 100 s) variability, which, considering the total energy radiated,constrains the location of the flaring region to be within ~10 schwarzschildradii of the black hole.

1403.2722	nustar observations of the bullet cluster: constraints on inverse  compton emission	the search for diffuse non-thermal inverse compton (ic) emission from galaxyclusters at hard x-ray energies has been undertaken with many instruments, withmost detections being either of low significance or controversial. backgroundand contamination uncertainties present in the data of non-focusingobservatories result in lower sensitivity to ic emission and a greater chanceof false detection. we present 266ks nustar observations of the bullet cluster,detected from 3-30 kev. nustar's unprecedented hard x-ray focusing capabilitylargely eliminates confusion between diffuse ic and point sources; however, atthe highest energies the background still dominates and must be wellunderstood. to this end, we have developed a complete background modelconstructed of physically inspired components constrained by extragalacticsurvey field observations, the specific parameters of which are derived locallyfrom data in non-source regions of target observations. applying the backgroundmodel to the bullet cluster data, we find that the spectrum is well - but notperfectly - described as an isothermal plasma with kt=14.2+/-0.2 kev. toslightly improve the fit, a second temperature component is added, whichappears to account for lower temperature emission from the cool core, pushingthe primary component to kt~15.3 kev. we see no convincing need to invoke an iccomponent to describe the spectrum of the bullet cluster, and instead arguethat it is dominated at all energies by emission from purely thermal gas. theconservatively derived 90% upper limit on the ic flux of 1.1e-12 erg/s/cm^2(50-100 kev), implying a lower limit on b&gt;0.2{\mu}g, is barely consistent withdetected fluxes previously reported. in addition to discussing the possibleorigin of this discrepancy, we remark on the potential implications of thisanalysis for the prospects for detecting ic in galaxy clusters in the future.

1403.6751	a hard x-ray power-law spectral cutoff in centaurus x-4	the low-mass x-ray binary cen x-4 is the brightest and closest (&lt;1.2 kpc)quiescent neutron star transient. previous 0.5-10 kev x-ray observations of cenx-4 in quiescence identified two spectral components: soft thermal emissionfrom the neutron star atmosphere and a hard power-law tail of unknown origin.we report here on a simultaneous observation of cen x-4 with nustar (3-79 kev)and xmm-newton (0.3-10 kev) in 2013 january, providing the first sensitive hardx-ray spectrum of a quiescent neutron star transient. the 0.3-79 kev luminositywas 1.1 x 10^(33) erg/s (for d=1kpc), with around 60 percent in the thermalcomponent. we clearly detect a cutoff of the hard spectral tail above 10 kev,the first time such a feature has been detected in this source class. we showthat thermal comptonization and synchrotron shock origins for the hard x-rayemission are ruled out on physical grounds. however, the hard x-ray spectrum iswell fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with an 18 kev electron temperature,which can be understood as arising either in a hot layer above the neutron staratmosphere or in a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (riaf). the power-lawcutoff energy may be set by the degree of compton cooling of the bremsstrahlungelectrons by thermal seed photons from the neutron star surface. lower thermalluminosities should lead to higher (possibly undetectable) cutoff energies. wecompare cen~x-4's behavior with psr j1023+0038, igr j18245-2452, and xssj12270-4859, which have shown transitions between lmxb and radio pulsar modesat a similar x-ray luminosity.

1407.3974	the variable hard x-ray emission of ngc4945 as observed by nustar	we present a broadband (~0.5-79 kev) spectral and temporal analysis ofmultiple nustar observations combined with archival suzaku and chandra data ofngc4945, the brightest extragalactic source at 100 kev. we observe hard x-ray(&gt; 10 kev) flux and spectral variability, with flux variations of a factor 2 ontimescales of 20 ksec. a variable primary continuum dominates the high energyspectrum (&gt;10 kev) in all the states, while the reflected/scattered flux whichdominates at e&lt; 10 kev stays approximately constant. from modelling the complexreflection/transmission spectrum we derive a compton depth along the line ofsight of tau_thomson ~ 2.9, and a global covering factor for the circumnucleargas of ~ 0.15. this agrees with the constraints derived from the high energyvariability, which implies that most of the high energy flux is transmitted,rather that compton-scattered. this demonstrates the effectiveness of spectralanalysis in constraining the geometric properties of the circumnuclear gas, andvalidates similar methods used for analyzing the spectra of other bright,compton-thick agn. the lower limits on the e-folding energy are between 200-300kev, consistent with previous bepposax, suzaku and swift bat observations. theaccretion rate, estimated from the x-ray luminosity and assuming a bolometriccorrection typical of type 2 agn, is in the range ~0.1-0.3 lambda_edd dependingon the flux state. the substantial observed x-ray luminosity variability ofngc4945 implies that large errors can arise from using single-epoch x-ray datato derive l/l_edd values for obscured agns.

1409.3248	no time for dead time: timing analysis of bright black hole binaries  with nustar	timing of high-count rate sources with the nustar small explorer missionrequires specialized analysis techniques. nustar was primarily designed forspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates ratherthan for timing analysis of bright objects. the instrumental dead time perevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percentevent-to-event. the most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noiselevel in the power density spectrum (pds) that cannot be modeled easily withthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. in thispaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completelyindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain agood proxy of the white noise-subtracted pds. thereafter, one can use a montecarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely afrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent dropof the sensitivity to variability. in this way, most of the standard timinganalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relativeto what would be achieved using more standard techniques. we apply thistechnique to nustar observations of the black hole binaries gx 339-4, cyg x-1and grs 1915+105.

1505.02096	broadband x-ray properties of the gamma-ray binary 1fgl j1018.6-5856	we report on nustar, xmm-newton and swift observations of the gamma-raybinary 1fgl j1018.6-5856. we measure the orbital period to be 16.544+/-0.008days using swift data spanning 1900 days. the orbital period is different fromthe 2011 gamma-ray measurement which was used in the previous x-ray study of anet al. (2013) using ~400 days of swift data, but is consistent with a newgamma-ray solution reported in 2014. the light curve folded on the new periodis qualitatively similar to that reported previously, having a spike at phase 0and broad sinusoidal modulation. the x-ray flux enhancement at phase 0 occursmore regularly in time than was previously suggested. a spiky structure at thisphase seems to be a persistent feature, although there is some variability.furthermore, we find that the source flux clearly correlates with the spectralhardness throughout all orbital phases, and that the broadband x-ray spectrameasured with nustar, xmm-newton, and swift are well fit with an unbrokenpower-law model. this spectrum suggests that the system may not beaccretion-powered.

1505.03570	deep nustar and swift monitoring observations of the magnetar 1e  1841-045	we report on a 350-ks nustar observation of the magnetar 1e 1841-045 taken in2013 september. during the observation, nustar detected six bursts of shortduration, with $t_{90}&lt;1$ s. an elevated level of emission tail is detectedafter the brightest burst, persisting for $\sim$1 ks. the emission showed apower-law decay with a temporal index of 0.5 before returning to the persistentemission level. the long observation also provided detailed phase-resolvedspectra of the persistent x-ray emission of the source. by comparing thepersistent spectrum with that previously reported, we find that the sourcehard-band emission has been stable over approximately 10 years. the persistenthard x-ray emission is well fitted by a coronal outflow model, where $e^{+/-}$pairs in the magnetosphere upscatter thermal x-rays. our fit of phase-resolvedspectra allowed us to estimate the angle between the rotational and magneticdipole axes of the magnetar, $\alpha_{mag}=0.25$, the twisted magnetic flux,$2.5\times10^{26}\rm \ g\ cm^2$, and the power released in the twistedmagnetosphere, $l_j=6\times10^{36}\rm \ erg\ s^{-1}$. assuming this model forthe hard x-ray spectrum, the soft x-ray component is well fit by atwo-blackbody model, with the hotter blackbody consistent with the footprint ofthe twisted magnetic field lines on the star. we also report on the 3-yearswift monitoring observations obtained since 2011 july. the soft x-ray spectrumremained stable during this period, and the timing behavior was noisy, withlarge timing residuals.

1506.02001	nustar and swift observations of the black hole candidate xte j1908+094  during its 2013 outburst	the black hole candidate xte j1908+094 went into outburst for the first timesince 2003 in october 2013. we report on an observation with the nuclearspectroscopic telescope array (nustar) and monitoring observations with swiftduring the outburst. nustar caught the source in the soft state: the spectrashow a broad relativistic iron line, and the light curves reveal a ~40 ks flarewith the count rate peaking about 40% above the non-flare level and withsignificant spectral variation. a model combining a multi-temperature thermalcomponent, a power-law, and a reflection component with an iron line provides agood description of the nustar spectrum. although relativistic broadening ofthe iron line is observed, it is not possible to constrain the black hole spinwith these data. the variability of the power-law component, which can also bemodeled as a comptonization component, is responsible for the flux and spectralchange during the flare, suggesting that changes in the corona (or possiblycontinued jet activity) are the likely cause of the flare.

(2014). we find that a significantdegeneracy appears in the inferred parameters if the footprint of the j-bundleis allowed to be a thin ring instead of a polar cap. the degeneracy is reducedwhen the footprint is required to be the hot spot inferred from the soft x-raydata.

1506.06182	3c 273 with nustar: unveiling the agn	we present results from a 244\,ks \textit{nustar} observation of 3c\,273obtained during a cross-calibration campaign with the \textit{chandra},\textit{integral}, \textit{suzaku}, \textit{swift}, and \textit{xmm-newton}observatories. we show that the spectrum, when fit with a power-law model usingdata from all observatories except \textit{integral} over the 1--78\,kev band,leaves significant residuals in the \textit{nustar} data between 30--78\,kev.the \nustar\ 3--78\,kev spectrum is well-described by an exponentially cutoffpower-law ($\gamma = 1.646 \pm 0.006$, e$_\mathrm{cutoff} =202_{-34}^{+51}$\,kev) with a weak reflection component from cold, densematerial. there is also evidence for a weak ($ew = 23 \pm 11$ ev) neutral ironline. we interpret these features as arising from coronal emission plusreflection off an accretion disk or distant material. beyond 80\,kev\textit{integral} data show clear excess flux relative to an extrapolation ofthe agn model fit to \nustar. this high-energy power-law is consistent with thepresence of a beamed jet, which begins to dominate over emission from the inneraccretion flow at 30-40 kev. modeling the jet locally (in the \textit{nustar} +\textit{integral} band) as a power-law, we find the coronal component is fit by$\gamma_\mathrm{agn} = 1.638 \pm 0.045$, $e_\mathrm{cutoff} = 47 \pm 15$\,kev,and jet photon index by $\gamma_\mathrm{jet} = 1.05 \pm 0.4$. we also consider\textit{fermi}/lat observations of 3c\,273 and here the broad-band spectrum ofthe jet can be described by a log-parabolic model, peaking at $\sim 2$\,mev.finally, we investigate the spectral variability in the \textit{nustar} bandand find an inverse correlation between flux and $\gamma$.

1506.06780	the accreting black hole swift j1753.5-0127 from radio to hard x-ray	(abridged) we report on multi-wavelength measurements of swift j1753.5-0127in the hard state at l=2.7e36 erg/s (assuming d=3 kpc) in 2014. the radioemission is optically thick synchrotron, presumably from a compact jet. we takeadvantage of the low extinction and model the near-ir to uv emission with amulti-temperature disk model. assuming a bh mass of m_bh=5 msun and a systeminclination of 40 deg, the fits imply an inner radius for the disk ofrin/rg&gt;212 d_3 (5msun/m_bh). the outer radius is r_out/r_g=90,000 d_3(5msun/m_bh), which corresponds to 6.6e10 d_3 cm, consistent with the expectedsize of the disk. the 0.5-240 kev spectrum measured by swift/xrt, suzaku, andnustar is relatively well characterized by a power-law with a photon index ofgamma=1.722+/-0.003, but a significant improvement is seen when a secondcontinuum component is added. reflection is a possibility, but no iron line isdetected, implying a low iron abundance. we are able to fit the entire sed witha multi-temperature disk component, a comptonization component, and a brokenpower-law, representing the emission from the compact jet. the broken power-lawcannot significantly contribute to the soft x-ray emission, and this may berelated to why swift j1753.5-0127 is an outlier in the radio/x-ray correlation.the broken power-law might dominate above 20 kev, which would constrain thebreak frequency to be between 2.4e10 hz and 3.6e12 hz. although the fits to thefull sed do not include significant thermal emission in the x-ray band,previous observations have consistently seen such a component, and we find thatthere is evidence at the 3.1-sigma level for a disk-blackbody component with atemperature of 150(+30)(-20) ev and an inner radius of 5-14 r_g. if thiscomponent is real, it might imply the presence of an inner accretion disk inaddition to the strongly truncated (r_in&gt;212 r_g) disk.

1506.07175	nustar observations of the powerful radio-galaxy cygnus a	we present nustar observations of the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a,focusing on the central absorbed active galactic nucleus (agn). cygnus a isembedded in a cool-core galaxy cluster, and hence we also examine archivalxmm-newton data to facilitate the decomposition of the spectrum into the agnand intracluster medium (icm) components. nustar gives a source-dominatedspectrum of the agn out to &gt;70kev. in gross terms, the nustar spectrum of theagn has the form of a power law (gamma~1.6-1.7) absorbed by a neutral columndensity of n_h~1.6x10^23 cm^-2. however, we also detect curvature in the hard(&gt;10kev) spectrum resulting from reflection by compton-thick matter out of ourline-of-sight to the x-ray source. compton reflection, possibly from the outeraccretion disk or obscuring torus, is required even permitting a high-energycutoff in the continuum source; the limit on the cutoff energy is e_cut&gt;111kev(90% confidence). interestingly, the absorbed power-law plus reflection modelleaves residuals suggesting the absorption/emission from a fast(15,000-26,000km/s), high column-density (n_w&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2), highly ionized(xi~2,500 erg cm/s) wind. a second, even faster ionized wind component is alsosuggested by these data. we show that the ionized wind likely carries asignificant mass and momentum flux, and may carry sufficient kinetic energy toexercise feedback on the host galaxy. if confirmed, the simultaneous presenceof a strong wind and powerful jets in cygnus a demonstrates that feedback fromradio-jets and sub-relativistic winds are not mutually exclusive phases of agnactivity but can occur simultaneously.

1510.04453	a nustar survey of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present a nustar, chandra, and xmm--newton survey of nine of the nearestultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). the unprecedented sensitivity ofnustar at energies above 10 kev enables spectral modeling with far betterprecision than was previously possible. six of the nine sources observed weredetected sufficiently well by nustar to model in detail their broadband x-rayspectra, and recover the levels of obscuration and intrinsic x-rayluminosities. only one source (iras 13120--5453) has a spectrum consistent witha compton--thick agn, but we cannot rule out that a second source (arp 220)harbors an extremely highly obscured agn as well. variability in column density(reduction by a factor of a few compared to older observations) is seen in iras05189--2524 and mrk 273, altering the classification of these border-linesources from compton-thick to compton-thin. the ulirgs in our sample havesurprisingly low observed fluxes in high energy (&gt;10 kev) x-rays, especiallycompared to their bolometric luminosities. they have lower ratios of unabsorbed2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity, and unabsorbed 2--10 kev to mid-ir [o iv]line luminosity than do seyfert 1 galaxies. we identify iras 08572+3915 asanother candidate intrinsically x-ray weak source, similar to mrk 231. wespeculate that the x-ray weakness of iras 08572+3915 is related to its powerfuloutflow observed at other wavelengths.
