0706.3624	absorption line-strengths of 18 late-type spiral galaxies observed with  sauron	we present absorption line-strength maps for a sample of 18 sb-sd galaxiesobserved using the integral-field spectrograph sauron. the sauron spectralrange allows the measurement of the lick/ids indices hbeta, fe5015 and mgb,which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. we presenthere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. from the maps, welearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high hbeta and low fe5015 andmgb values, and that the hbeta index has often a positive gradient over thefield, while the metal indices peak in the central region. we investigate therelations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations withmorphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observedbehaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals fromthe sauron survey. we find that our galaxies lie below the mg - sigma relationdetermined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend withmorphological type. from the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicityand abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-ssp approach andfrom a two-ssp approach. late-type galaxies are generally younger and moremetal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.we also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover thestar formation history using the evolutionary models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (sfr).we find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst andthe central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shortertau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basicallyended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0906.3321	the sauron project - xiv. no escape from v$_{\mathrm{esc}}$: a global  and local parameter in early-type galaxy evolution	we present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity(vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from thesauron sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies withboth detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling.values of vesc are computed using multi gaussian expansion (mge) photometricfitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneouslyon hst and ground-based images. we determine line strengths and escapevelocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation ofthe correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. we finda tight correlation between vesc and the line-strength indices. for mgb we findthat this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but alsoinside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. therelation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the globalrelation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsicscatter in the local gradients. we transform our line strength indexmeasurements to the single stellar population (ssp) equivalent age (t),metallicity ([z/h]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/fe]) and carry out a principalcomponent analysis of our ssp and vesc data. we find that in thisfour-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a goodapproximation confined to a plane, given by $\log\mathrm({v}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[z/h]} + 0.43 \log(\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{gyrs})$ - 0.20. it is surprising that it is a combinationof age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy'between age and metallicity or a weakness in the ssp models.

0910.2714	integrated k-band spectra of old and intermediate-age globular clusters  in the large magellanic cloud	current stellar population models have arguably the largest uncertainties inthe near-ir wavelength range, partly due to a lack of large and well calibratedempirical spectral libraries. in this paper we present a project, which aim itis to provide the first library of luminosity weighted integrated near-irspectra of globular clusters to be used to test the current stellar populationmodels and serve as calibrators for the future ones. our pilot study presentsspatially integrated k-band spectra of three old (&gt;10 gyr) and metal poor([fe/h]~-1.4), and three intermediate age (1-2 gyr) and more metal rich([fe/h]~-0.4) globular clusters in the lmc. we measured the line strengths ofthe na i, ca i and 12co(2-0) absorption features. the na i index decreases withthe increasing age and decreasing metallicity of the clusters. the dco index,used to measure the 12co(2-0) line strength, is significantly reduced by thepresence of carbon-rich tp-agb stars in the globular clusters with age ~1 gyr.this is in contradiction with the predictions of the stellar population modelsof maraston (2005). we find that this disagreement is due to the different coabsorption strength of carbon-rich milky way tp-agb stars used in the modelsand the lmc carbon stars in our sample. for globular clusters with age &gt;2 gyrwe find dco index measurements consistent with the model predictions.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1006.1574	the sauron project - xvii. stellar population analysis of the absorption  line strength maps of 48 early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a stellar population analysis of the absorption linestrength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample. using the linestrength index maps of hbeta, fe5015, and mgb, measured in the lick/ids systemand spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, together with predictionsfrom up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellarpopulation-equivalent (ssp-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio[alpha/fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately oneeffective radius. we find a large range of ssp-equivalent ages in our sample,of which ~40% of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellarpopulation. the most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, withssp-equivalent ages of &lt;=3 gyr observed over the full field-of-view, andsometimes even showing signs of residual star-formation, are restricted to lowmass systems(sigma_e &lt;= 100 k/ms or ~2x10^10 m_sol). spatially restricted casesof young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively belinked to the presence of star-formation in a thin, dusty disk/ring, also seenin the near-uv or mid-ir. the flattened components with disk-like kinematicspreviously identified in all fast rotators (krajnovi\'c et al.) are shown to beconnected to regions of distinct stellar populations. these range from theyoung, still star-forming circumnuclear disks and rings with increasedmetallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, toapparently old structures with extended disk-like kinematics, which areobserved to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [alpha/fe] ratiocompared to the main body of the galaxy. the slow rotators generally show nostellar population signatures over and above the well known metallicitygradients and are largely consistent with old (&gt;=10 gyr) stellar populations.

1007.2059	early-type galaxies in different environments: an hi view	we present an analysis of deep wsrt observations of the hi in 33 nearbyearly-type galaxies selected from a sample studied earlier at opticalwavelengths with the sauron integral-field spectrograph. the sample covers bothfield environments and the virgo cluster. our analysis shows that gas accretionplays a role in the evolution of field early-type galaxies, but less so forthose in clusters. for detection limits of a few times 10^6 msun, hi isdetected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies, while &lt;10% of the virgo objectsare detected. in about half of the detections, the hi forms a regularlyrotating disc or ring. all hi discs have counterparts of ionised gas and innerhi discs are also detected in molecular gas. the cold ism is dominated bymolecular gas (m_h2/m_hi ~ 10). we conclude that accretion of hi is common forfield early-type galaxies, but the amount of material involved is usuallysmall. cluster galaxies appear not to accrete hi. the few galaxies with asignificant young sub-population all have inner gas discs, but for theremaining galaxies there is no trend between stellar population and hi. someearly-type galaxies are very gas rich, but only have an old population. thestellar populations of field galaxies are typically younger than those invirgo. this is likely related to differences in accretion history. in about 50%of the galaxies we detect a central continuum source. in many objects thisemission is from a low-luminosity agn, in some it is consistent with theobserved star formation. galaxies with hi in the central regions are morelikely detected in continuum. this is due to a higher probability for starformation to occur in such galaxies and not to hi-related agn fuelling.(abridged)

1007.2263	spatially resolved spectroscopy of starburst and post-starburst galaxies  in the rich z~0.55 cluster cl0016+16	we have used the low resolution imaging spectrograph (lris) on the w.m. kecki telescope to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy of a small sample of sixpost-starburst and three dusty-starburst galaxies in the rich cluster cl0016+16at z=0.55. we use this to measure radial profiles of the hdelta and oii3727lines which are diagnostic probes of the mechanisms that give rise to theabrupt changes in star-formation rates in these galaxies. in the post-starburstsample we are unable to detect any radial gradients in the hdelta lineequivalent width - although one galaxy exhibits a gradient from one side of thegalaxy to the other. the absence of hdelta gradients in these galaxies isconsistent with their production via interaction with the intra-cluster medium,however, our limited spatial sampling prevents us from drawing robustconclusions. all members of the sample have early type morphologies, typical ofpost-starburst galaxies in general, but lack the high incidence of tidal tailsand disturbances seen in local field samples. this argues against a mergerorigin and adds weight to a scenario where truncation by the intra-clustermedium is at work. the post-starburst spectral signature is consistent over theradial extent probed with no evidence of oii3727 emission and strong hdeltaabsorption at all radii i.e. the post-starburst classification is not anaperture effect. in contrast the dusty-starburst sample shows a tendency for acentral concentration of oii3727 emission. this is most straightforwardlyinterpreted as the consequence of a central starburst. however, otherpossibilities exist such as a non-uniform dust distribution (which is expectedin such galaxies) and/or a non-uniform starburst age distribution. the sampleexhibit late type and irregular morphologies.

1012.4092	nuclei of early-type dwarf galaxies: insights from stellar populations	(abridged) we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatially resolvedstellar population properties of 26 early-type dwarf (de) galaxies in the virgocluster. using lick/ids absorption line indices we derive simple stellarpopulation(ssp)-equivalent age, metallicity and [$\alpha$/fe] abundance ratio.in particular, we focus on the comparison of the stellar populations betweenthe central nucleus and the surrounding galactic main body. the stellarpopulations of the nuclei are, for most des, significantly younger than thoseof the respective galactic main bodies, with an average difference of 3.5 gyr.we find only five des with significantly older nuclei than their galactic mainbodies. furthermore, we observe most de nuclei to be more metal rich comparedto their host galaxies. these age and metallicity behaviours are shown byalmost all des brighter than m$_{\it r}$ = -17 mag.  we also examine the presence of radial gradients in the ssp parameters for asubset of 13 des (up to 1.2 kpc or 15 arcsec radius). we notice two differenttypes of gradients, namely smooth profiles that include the nucleus, andprofiles where a break occurs between the nucleus and the rest of the galaxy.nevertheless, an overall trend of increasing age and decreasing metallicitywith radius exists, consistent with earlier studies.

1101.0568	the stellar populations of early-type galaxies -- ii. the effects of  environment and mass	the degree of influence that environment and mass have on the stellarpopulations of early-type galaxies is uncertain. in this paper we present theresults of a spectroscopic analysis of the stellar populations of early-typegalaxies aimed at addressing this question. the sample of galaxies is drawnfrom four clusters, with &lt;z&gt;=0.04, and their surrounding structure extending to~10r_{vir}. we find that the distributions of the absorption-line strengths andthe stellar population parameters age, metallicity and alpha-element abundanceratio do not differ significantly between the clusters and their outskirts, butthe tight correlations found between these quantities and velocity dispersionwithin the clusters are weaker in their outskirts. all three stellar populationparameters of cluster galaxies are positively correlated with velocitydispersion. galaxies in clusters form a homogeneous class of objects that havesimilar distributions of line-strengths and stellar population parameters, andfollow similar scaling relations regardless of cluster richness or morphology.we estimate the intrinsic scatter of the gaussian distribution of metallicitiesto be 0.3 dex, while that of the alpha-element abundance ratio is 0.07 dex. thee-folding time of the exponential distribution of galaxy ages is estimated tobe 900 myr. the intrinsic scatters of the metallicity and alpha-elementabundance ratio distributions can almost entirely be accounted for by thecorrelations with velocity dispersion and the intrinsic scatter about theserelations. this implies that a galaxies mass plays the major role indetermining its stellar population.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.2438	the stellar kinematics and populations of boxy bulges: cylindrical  rotation and vertical gradients	boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are seen in about half of edge-on discgalaxies. comparisons of the photometry and major-axis gas and stellarkinematics of these bulges to simulations of bar formation and evolutionindicate that they are bars viewed in projection. if the properties of boxybulges can be entirely explained by assuming they are bars, then this may implythat their hosts are pure disc galaxies with no classical bulge. a handful ofthese bulges, including that of the milky way, have been observed to rotatecylindrically, i.e. with a mean stellar velocity independent of height abovethe disc. in order to assess whether such behaviour is ubiquitous in boxybulges, and whether a pure disc interpretation is consistent with their stellarpopulations, we have analysed the stellar kinematics and populations of theboxy or peanut-shaped bulges in a sample of five edge-on galaxies. we placedslits along the major axis of each galaxy and at three offset but parallelpositions to build up spatial coverage. the boxy bulge of ngc3390 rotatesperfectly cylindrically within the spatial extent and uncertainties of thedata. this is consistent with the metallicity and alpha-element enhancement ofthe bulge, which are the same as in the disk. this galaxy is thus a pure discgalaxy. the boxy bulge of eso311-g012 also rotates very close to cylindrically.the boxy bulge of ngc1381 is neither clearly cylindrically nornon-cylindrically rotating, but it has a negative vertical metallicity gradientand is alpha-enhanced with respect to its disc, suggesting a composite bulgecomprised of a classical bulge and bar (and possibly a discy pseudobulge)[abridged] even this relatively small sample is sufficient to demonstrate thatboxy bulges display a range of rotational and population properties, indicatingthat they do not form a homogeneous class of object.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1105.4076	the atlas3d project - vi. simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the  link with fast rotators, slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies through mergers with a sampleof 70 high-resolution (softening length &lt; 60 pc and 12*10^6 particles)numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies and 16 simulations ofetg remergers. these simulations, designed to accompany observations and modelsconducted within the atlas3d project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. the progenitor discgalaxies are spiral-like with bulge to disc ratios typical of sb and scgalaxies. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the atlas3dcriterion (based on the lambda_r parameter): they preserve the structure of theinput fast rotating spiral progenitors. they have intrinsic ellipticitieslarger than 0.5, cover intrinsic lambda_r values between 0.2 and 0.6, withinthe range of observed fast rotators. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the fast rotators produced inmajor mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities between 0.4 and0.6. most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. besides a handful ofspecific observed systems -- the counter-rotating discs (2-sigma galaxies) --these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators inthe nearby universe. the mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamentalparameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but italso requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (sb) progenitor galaxywith respect to the orbital angular momentum.

1107.0002	the atlas3d project - x. on the origin of the molecular and ionised gas  in early-type galaxies	we make use of interferometric co and hi observations, and opticalintegral-field spectroscopy to probe the origin of the molecular and ionisedinterstellar medium (ism) in local early-type galaxies (etgs). we find that36\pm5% of our sample of fast rotating etgs have their ionised gaskinematically misaligned with respect to the stars, setting a strong lowerlimit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and coldaccretion). slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicatingthat the dominant source of gas is external. the molecular, ionised and atomicgas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even whenthey are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases ofthe ism share a common origin. in addition, we find that the origin of the coldand warm gas in fast-rotating etgs is strongly affected by environment, despitethe molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent ofgroup/cluster membership. galaxies in dense groups and the virgo cluster nearlyalways have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellarkinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin. in the field, however,kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicatethat &gt;46% of local fast-rotating etgs have their gas supplied from externalsources. we discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmentaldichotomy, but find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematicmisalignment difference and the constant detection rate. furthermore, ourresults suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factorassociated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotatinggalaxies in our sample (m_k&lt;-24 mag; stellar mass of &gt;8x10^10 msun) alwayshaving kinematically aligned gas.

1107.0963	the effect of the environment on the gas kinematics and the structure of  distant galaxies	with the aim of distinguishing between possible physical mechanisms acting ongalaxies when they fall into clusters, we study the properties of the gas andthe stars in a sample of 422 emission-line galaxies from ediscs in differentenvironments up to z~1. we identify galaxies with kinematical disturbances(from emission-lines in their 2d spectra) and find that they are more frequentin clusters than in the field. the fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxiesincreases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from thecluster centre, but remains constant with projected galaxy density. we alsostudied morphological disturbances in the stellar light from hst/f814w images,finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar inall environments. moreover, there is little correlation between the presence ofkinematically-disturbed gas and morphological distortions. we also study thedependence of the tully-fisher relation, star formation, and extent of theemission on environment, and conclude that the gas disks in cluster galaxieshave been truncated, and therefore their star formation is more concentratedthan in low-density environments. if spirals transform into s0s, our findingsimply that the physical mechanism transforming cluster galaxies efficientlydisturbs the star-forming gas and reduces their specific star formation rate.moreover, this star-forming gas is either removed more efficiently from theoutskirts of the galaxies or is driven towards the centre (or both), helping tobuild the bulges of s0s. these results, in addition to the finding that thetransformation mechanism does not seem to induce strong morphologicaldisturbances on the galaxies, suggest that the physical processes involved arerelated to the intracluster medium, with galaxy-galaxy interactions playingonly a limited role in clusters.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1109.6323	the road to the red sequence: a detailed view of the formation of a  massive galaxy at z~2	(abridged) we present here a detailed analysis of the star formation history(sfh) of fw4871, a massive galaxy at z=1.893+-0.002. we compare rest-frameoptical and nuv slitless grism spectra from the hubble space telescope with alarge set of composite stellar populations to constrain the underlying starformation history. even though the morphology features prominent tidal tails,indicative of a recent merger, there is no sign of on-going star formationwithin an aperture encircling one effective radius, which corresponds to aphysical extent of 2.6 kpc. a model assuming truncation of an otherwiseconstant sfh gives a formation epoch zf~10, with a truncation after 2.7 gyr,giving a mass-weighted age of 1.5 gyr and a stellar mass of 0.8-3e11msun,implying star formation rates of 30-110 msun/yr. a more complex model includinga recent burst of star formation places the age of the youngest component at145 myr, with a mass contribution lower than 20%, and a maximum amount of dustreddening of e(b-v)&lt;0.4 mag (95% confidence levels). this low level of dustreddening is consistent with the low emission observed at 24 micron,corresponding to rest-frame 8 micron, where pah emission should contributesignificantly if a strong formation episode were present. the colour profile offw4871 does not suggest a significant radial trend in the properties of thestellar populations out to 3re. we suggest that the recent merger that formedfw4871 is responsible for the quenching of its star formation.

1111.3371	stellar population gradients in the cores of nearby field e+a galaxies	we have selected a sample of local e+a galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) data release 7 for follow up integral field spectroscopy with thewide field spectrograph (wifes) on the anu 2.3-m telescope. the sample wasselected using the halpha line in place of the [oii]3727 line as the indicatorof on-going star formation (or lack thereof). this allowed us to select a lowerredshift sample of galaxies than available in the literature since the[oii]3727 falls off the blue end of the wavelength coverage in the sdss for thevery lowest redshift objects. this low redshift selection means that thegalaxies have a large angular to physical scale which allows us to resolve thecentral ~1kpc region of the galaxies; the region where stellar populationgradients are expected. such observations have been difficult to make usingother higher redshift samples because even at redshifts z~0.1 the angular tophysical scale is similar to the resolution provided by ground based seeing.our integral field spectroscopy has enabled us to make the first robustdetections of balmer line gradients in the centres of e+a galaxies. six out ofour sample of seven, and all the galaxies with regular morphologies, areobserved to have compact and centrally-concentrated balmer line absorption.this is evidence for compact young cores and stellar population gradients whichare predicted from models of mergers and tidal interactions which funnel gasinto the galaxy core. given the generally isolated nature of our sample thisargues for the galaxies being seen in the late stage of a merger where theprogenitors have already coalesced.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1203.2558	a way to deal with the fringe-like pattern in vimos-ifu data	the use of integral field units is now commonplace at all major observatoriesoffering efficient means of obtaining spectral as well as imaging informationat the same time. ifu instrument designs are complex and spectral images havetypically highly condensed formats, therefore presenting challenges for the ifudata reduction pipelines. in the case of the vlt vimos-ifu, a fringe-likepattern affecting the spectra well into the optical and blue wavelength regimeas well as artificial intensity variations, require additional reduction stepsbeyond standard pipeline processing. in this research note we propose anempirical method for the removal of the fringe-like pattern in the spectraldomain and the intensity variations in the imaging domain. we also demonstratethe potential consequences for data analysis if the effects are not corrected.here we use the example of deriving stellar velocity, velocity dispersion andabsorption line-strength maps for early-type galaxies. we derive for eachspectrum, reduced by the eso standard vimos pipeline, a correction-spectrum byusing the median of the eight surrounding spectra as a proxy for theunaffected, underlying spectrum. this method relies on the fact that ourscience targets (nearby etgs) cover the complete fov of the vimos-ifu withslowly varying spectral properties and that the exact shape of the fringe-likepattern is nearly independent and highly variable between neighboring spatialpositions. we find that the proposed correction methods for the removal of thefringe-like pattern and the intensity variations in vimos-ifu data-cubes aresuitable to allow for meaningful data analysis in our sample of nearbyearly-type galaxies. since the method relies on the scientific targetproperties it is not suitable for general implementation in the pipelinesoftware for vimos.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1210.5524	the atlas3d project - xviii. carma co imaging survey of early-type  galaxies	we present the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy (carma)atlas3d molecular gas imaging survey, a systematic study of the distributionand kinematics of molecular gas in co-rich early-type galaxies. our full sampleof 40 galaxies (30 newly mapped and 10 taken from the literature) is completeto a 12co(1-0) integrated flux of 18.5 jy km/s, and it represents the largest,best-studied sample of its type to date. a comparison of the co distribution ofeach galaxy to the g-r color image (representing dust) shows that the moleculargas and dust distributions are in good agreement and trace the same underlyinginterstellar medium. the galaxies exhibit a variety of co morphologies,including discs (50%), rings (15%), bars+rings (10%), spiral arms (5%), andmildly (12.5%) and strongly (7.5%) disrupted morphologies. there appear to beweak trends between galaxy mass and co morphology, whereby the most massivegalaxies in the sample tend to have molecular gas in a disc morphology. wederive a lower limit to the total accreted molecular gas mass across the sampleof 2.48x10^10 msuns, or approximately 8.3x10^8 msuns per minor merger withinthe sample, consistent with minor merger stellar mass ratios.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.4615	the atlas3d project - xxi. correlations between gradients of local  escape velocity and stellar populations in early-type galaxies	we explore the connection between the local escape velocity, v_esc, and thestellar population properties in the atlas3d survey, a complete, volume-limitedsample of nearby early-type galaxies. we make use of ugriz photometry toconstruct multi-gaussian expansion models of the surface brightnesses of ourgalaxies. we are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profilesfound in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results ofstate-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mags. weutilise these photometric models and sauron integral-field spectroscopy,combined with jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local v_esc derivedfrom the surface brightness. we find that the local v_esc is tightly correlatedwith the mgb and fe5015 linestrengths and optical colours, and anti-correlatedwith the hbeta linestrength. in the case of the mgb and colour - v_escrelations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows theglobal relation between different galaxies. we intentionally ignored anyuncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empiricaldescription of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that isideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. we identify apopulation of galaxies that occur only at low v_esc that exhibit negativegradients in the mgb - and colour -v_esc relations. these galaxies typicallyhave young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts ofmolecular gas and dust. combining these results with n-body simulations ofbinary mergers we use the mgb-v_esc relation to constrain the possible numberof dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - atypical massive etg can have experienced only ~1.5 major mergers beforebecoming a significant outlier in the mgb-v_esc relation.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1212.2630	the atlas 3d project - xvi. physical parameters and spectral line energy  distributions of the molecular gas in gas-rich early-type galaxies	[abridged] we present a detailed study of the physical properties of themolecular gas in a sample of 18 molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies (etgs)from the atlas$ 3d sample. our goal is to better understand the star formationprocesses occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the densestar-forming gas. we use existing integrated $^{12}$co(1-0, 2-1),$^{13}$co(1-0, 2-1), hcn(1-0) and hco$^{+}$(1-0) observations and present new$^{12}$co(3-2) single-dish data. from these, we derive for the first time theaverage kinetic temperature, h$_{2}$ volume density and column density of theemitting gas, this using a non-lte theoretical model. since the co lines tracedifferent physical conditions than of those the hcn and hco$^{+}$ lines, thetwo sets of lines are treated separately. we also compare for the first timethe predicted co spectral line energy distributions (sleds) and gas propertiesof our molecular gas-rich etgs with those of a sample of nearby well-studieddisc galaxies. the gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 etgs appearanalogous to those in the centre of the milky way. such results have never beenobtained before for etgs and open a new window to explore furtherstar-formation processes in the universe. the conclusions drawn shouldnevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number ofobservations and on a simple model. in the near future, with higher cotransition observations, it should be possible to better identify the variousgas components present in etgs, as well as more precisely determine theirassociated physical conditions. to achieve these goals, we show here from ourtheoretical study, that mid-j co lines (such as the $^{12}$co(6-5) line) areparticularly useful.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1303.1210	the complex nature of the nuclear star cluster in fcc 277	recent observations have shown that compact nuclear star clusters (nscs) arepresent in up to 80% of galaxies. however, detailed studies of their dynamicaland chemical properties are confined mainly to spiral galaxy hosts, where theyare more easily observed. in this paper we present our study of the nsc in fcc277, a nucleated elliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster. we use a combinationof adaptive optics assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopy, hubblespace telescope imaging, and literature long slit data. we show that while thensc does not appear to rotate within our detection limit of ~6 km/s, rotationis detected at larger radii, where the isophotes appear to be disky, suggestingthe presence of a nuclear disk. we also observe a distinct central velocitydispersion drop that is indicative of a dynamically cold rotating sub-system.following the results of orbit-based dynamical modelling, co-rotating as wellas counter-rotating stellar orbits are simultaneously needed to reproduce theobserved kinematics. we find evidence for varying stellar populations, with thensc and nuclear disk hosting younger and more metal rich stars than the mainbody of the galaxy. we argue that gas dissipation and some level of merginghave likely played an important role in the formation of the nucleus of thisintermediate-mass galaxy. this is in contrast to nscs in low-mass early- typegalaxies, which may have been formed primarily through the infall of starclusters.

1303.4307	the cold gas content of post-starburst galaxies	post-starburst galaxies, or e+a galaxies, are characterized by opticalspectra showing strong balmer absorption lines, indicating a young stellarpopulation, and little or no emission lines, implying no active star formation.these galaxies are interpreted as a transitional population betweenstar-forming, disk-dominated galaxies and spheroidal quiescent, non-starforming galaxies. here, we present single dish hi 21-cm emission linemeasurements of a sample of eleven of these galaxies at redshifts z&lt;0.05. wedetect h i emission in six of the e+a galaxies. in combination with earlierstudies, the total number of e+a galaxies with measured cold gas components isnow eleven. roughly half of the e+as studied so far have detectable hi. the gasfractions of these galaxies, measured with respect to their stellar mass, arebetween 1 and 10 percent and are at the high end of the gas fractions measuredin gas-bearing early type galaxies and typically lower than seen in late-typegalaxies with comparable stellar masses. this finding is consistent with theidea that e+as are currently evolving from the blue cloud to the red sequence.however, the question of why the star formation has ceased in these galaxieswhile a significant gas reservoir is still present can only be answered byhigher spatial resolution observations of the cold gas.

(2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1402.6090	globular clusters of ngc 3115 in the near-infrared. demonstrating the  correctness of two opposing scenarios	we combined new near-infrared vlt/hawk-i data of the globular clusters (gcs)in the isolated edge-on s0 galaxy ngc 3115 with optical and spectroscopic onestaken from the literature, with the aim of analyzing the multiband gc colordistributions. a recent study from the sluggs survey has shown that the gcs inthis galaxy follow a bimodal distribution of ca ii triplet indices. thus, ngc3115 presents a critical example of a gc system with multiple, distinct,metallicity subpopulations, and this may argue against the "projection"scenario, which posits that the ubiquitous color bimodality mainly results fromnonlinearities in the color-metallicity relations. using optical, nir, andspectroscopic data, we found strong and consistent evidence of indexbimodality, which independently confirms the metallicity bimodality in ngc 3115gcs. at the same time, we also found evidence for some color-colornonlinearity. taken in the broader context of previous studies, the multicolorconsistency of the gc bimodality in ngc 3115 suggests that in cases where gcsystems exhibit clear differences between their optical and optical-nir colordistributions (as in some giant ellipticals), the apparent inconsistencies mostlikely result from nonlinearities in the color-metallicity relations.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

0807.1505	the sauron project - xii. kinematic substructures in early-type  galaxies: evidence for disks in fast rotators	[abridged] we analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxiesobtained with the sauron and oasis integral-field spectrographs usingkinemetry, a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher order momentsof the line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd). in the sauron sample, wefind that 31% of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91% of themulti-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest havingthree. in addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. we find that the velocitymaps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in thetransition regions between kinematic subcomponents. in terms of e/s0classification, this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components withdisk-like kinematics. for the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axialratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary towhat is predicted with isotropic jeans models viewed at different inclinations.the position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly inslow rotators. velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similarto the distribution of light. we constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - v/sigmaand h4 - v/sigma diagrams from sauron observations. we confirm the classicalanti-correlation of h3 and v\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero insome objects or even weakly correlated with v/sigma. the distribution of h4 forfast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. the difference betweenslow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the losvd, withevidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likelydifferent evolutionary paths.

astro-ph;0001210	the stellar populations of early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster	we have measured central line strengths for a magnitude-limited sample ofearly-type galaxies in the fornax cluster, comprising 11 elliptical (e) and 11lenticular (s0) galaxies, more luminous than mb=-17. when compared withsingle-burst stellar population models we find that the centres of fornaxellipticals follow a locus of fixed age and have metallicities varying roughlyfrom half solar to two times solar. the centres of (lower luminosity)lenticular galaxies, however, exhibit a substantial spread to youngerluminosity-weighted ages indicating a more extended star formation history.galaxies with old stellar populations show tight scaling relations betweenmetal-line indices and the central velocity dispersion. remarkably also thefe-lines are well correlated with sigma. our detailed analysis of the stellarpopulations suggests that these scaling relations are driven mostly bymetallicity. galaxies with a young stellar component do generally deviate fromthe main relation. in particular the lower luminosity s0s show a large spread.furthermore we find that elliptical galaxies and the bulge of one bright s0 areoverabundant in magnesium, where the most luminous galaxies show the strongestoverabundances. the stellar populations of young and faint s0s are consistentwith solar abundance ratios or a weak mg underabundance.

astro-ph;0008160	a photometric study of the ages and metallicities of early-type galaxies  in a2218	we present deep optical and near-infrared imaging of the rich cluster a2218at z=0.17. our optical imaging comes from new multicolour hubble spacetelescope wfpc2 observations in the f450w (b), f606w (v) and f814w (i)passbands. these observations are complemented by deep near-infrared, ks-band,imaging from the new ingrid imager on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope.this combination provides unique high-precision multicolour optical-infraredphotometry and morphological information for a large sample of galaxies in thecore of this rich cluster at a lookback time of ~3gyrs. we analyse the (b-i),(v-i) and (i-ks) colours of galaxies spanning a range of a factor of 100 ink-band luminosity in this region and compare these with grids of stellarpopulation models. we find that the locus of the colours of the stellarpopulations in the luminous (&gt;0.5l*) early-type galaxies, both ellipticals ands0s, traces a sequence of varying metallicity at a single age. at fainterluminosities (&lt;0.1l*), this sequence is extended to lower metallicities by themorphologically-classified ellipticals. however, the faintest s0s exhibit verydifferent behaviour, showing a wide range in colours, including a largefraction (30%) with relatively blue colours which appear to have youngerluminosity-weighted ages for their stellar populations, 2-5gyrs. we show thatthe proportion of these young s0s in the cluster population is consistent withthe observed decrease in the s0 population seen in distant clusters wheninterpreted within the framework of a two-step spectroscopic and morphologicaltransformation of accreted spiral field galaxies into cluster s0s.

astro-ph;0010187	lensing in the hercules supercluster	we report keck lris observations of an arc-like background galaxy near thecenter of abell 2152 (z=0.043), one of the three clusters comprising thehercules supercluster. the background object has a redshift z=0.1423 and issituated 25 arcsec north of the primary component of the a2152 brightestcluster galaxy (bcg). the object is about 15 arcsec in total length and has areddening-corrected r-band magnitude of $m_r = 18.55\pm0.03$. its spectrumshows numerous strong emission lines, as well as absorption features. thestrength of the h-alpha emission would imply a star formation rate $\sfr\approx 3h^{-2} \msun $yr$^{-1}$ in the absence of any lensing. however, thecurved shaped of this object and its tangential orientation along the majoraxis of the bcg suggest lensing. we model the a2152 core mass distributionincluding the two bcg components and the cluster potential. we present velocityand velocity dispersion profile measurements for the two bcg components and usethese to help constrain the potential. the lens modeling indicates a likelymagnification factor of $\sim1.9$ for the lensed galaxy, making a2152 thenearest cluster in which such significant lensing of a background source hasbeen observed. finally, we see evidence for a concentration of early-typegalaxies at $z=0.13$ near the centroid of the x-ray emission previouslyattributed to a2152. we suggest that emission from this backgroundconcentration is the cause of the offset of the x-ray center from the a2152bcg. the background concentration and the dispersed mass of the herculessupercluster could add further to the lensing strength of the a2152 cluster.

astro-ph;0011234	on the dependence of spectroscopic indices of early-type galaxies on  age, metallicity and velocity dispersion	we investigate the mg-sigma and &lt;fe&gt;-sigma relations in a sample of 72early-type galaxies drawn mostly from cluster and group environments using ahomogeneous data-set which is well-calibrated onto the lick/ids system. thesmall intrinsic scatter in mg at a given sigma gives upper limits on the spreadin age and metallicity of 49% and 32% respectively, if the spread is attributedto one quantity only and if the variations in age and metallicity areuncorrelated. the age/metallicity distribution as inferred from the hbeta vs&lt;fe&gt; diagnostic diagram reinforces this conclusion, as we find mostly galaxieswith large luminosity weighted ages spanning a range in metallicity. in oursample we do not find significant evidence for an anti-correlation of ages andmetallicities which would keep the index-sigma relations tight while hiding alarge spread in age and metallicity. as a result of correlated errors in theage-metallicity plane, a mild age-metallicity anti-correlation cannot becompletely ruled out given the current data. correcting the line-strengthsindices for non-solar abundance ratios following the recent paper by trager etal., leads to higher mean metallicity and slightly younger age estimates whilepreserving the metallicity sequence. the [mg/fe] ratio is mildly correlatedwith the central velocity dispersion and ranges from [mg/fe]=0.05 to 0.3 forgalaxies with sigma &gt; 100 km/s. under the assumption that there is no agegradient along the index-sigma relations, the abundance-ratio correctedmg-sigma, &lt;fe&gt;-sigma and hbeta-sigma relations give consistent estimates ofdelta [m/h]/ delta log sigma = 0.9 (+- 0.1). the slope of the hbeta-sigmarelation limits a potential age trend as a function of sigma to 2-3 gyrs alongthe sequence.(abriged)

astro-ph;0011254	galaxy mapping with the sauron integral-field spectrograph: the star  formation history of ngc 4365	we report the first wide-field mapping of the kinematics and stellarpopulations in the e3 galaxy ngc 4365. the velocity maps extend previouslong-slit work. they show two independent kinematic subsystems: the central 300x 700 pc rotates about the projected minor axis, and the main body of thegalaxy, 3 x 4 kpc, rotates almost at right angles to this. the line-strengthmaps show that the metallicity of the stellar population decreases from acentral value greater than solar, to one-half solar at a radius of 2 kpc. thedecoupled core and main body of the galaxy have the same luminosity-weightedage, of ~14 gyr, and the same elevated magnesium-to-iron ratio. the twokinematically distinct components have thus shared a common star formationhistory. we infer that the galaxy underwent a sequence of mergers associatedwith dissipative star formation that ended &gt;12 gyr ago. the misalignmentbetween the photometric and kinematic axes of the main body is unambiguousevidence of triaxiality. the similarity of the stellar populations in the twocomponents suggests that the observed kinematic structure has not changedsubstantially in 12 gyr.

astro-ph;0104084	on the origin of the colour-magnitude relation in the virgo cluster	we explore the origin of the colour-magnitude relation (cmr) of early typegalaxies in the virgo cluster using spectra of very high s/n ratio for sixelliptical galaxies selected along the cmr. the data are analysed using a newevolutionary stellar population synthesis model to generate galaxy spectra atthe resolution given by their velocity dispersions. in particular we use a newage indicator that is virtually free of the effects of metallicity. we findthat the luminosity weighted mean ages of virgo ellipticals are greater than ~8gyr, and show no clear trend with galaxy luminosity. we also find a positivecorrelation of metallicity with luminosity, colour and velocity dispersion. weconclude that the cmr is driven primarily by a luminosity-metallicitycorrelation. however, not all elements increase equally with the totalmetallicity and we speculate that the cmr may be driven by both a totalmetallicity increase and by a systematic departure from solar abundance ratiosof some elements along the cmr. a full understanding of the role played by thetotal metallicity, abundance ratios and age in generating the cmr requires theanalysis of spectra of very high quality, such as those reported here, for alarger number of galaxies in virgo and other clusters.

astro-ph;0204129	two-dimensional kinematics and stellar populations of early-type  galaxies: first results from the sauron survey	we present the sauron project, which is aimed at studying the morphology,two-dimensional kinematics and stellar populations of a representative sampleof elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges. sauron, a dedicated integral-fieldspectrograph that is optimized for wide-field observations and has highthroughput, was built in lyon and is now operated at the wht 4.2m telescope. atpresent, we have observed approximately two thirds of the seventy-two samplegalaxies with sauron. a comparison with published long-slit measurementsdemonstrates that the sauron-data is of equal or better quality, and providesfull two-dimensional coverage. the velocity and velocity dispersion fieldsexhibit a large variety of morphologies: from simple rotating systems tocylindrical, disky and triaxial velocity fields, bars and decoupled cores. mostof these kinematical signatures do not have counterparts in the lightdistribution. while some galaxies are consistent with axisymmetry, most aremore complex systems than assumed previously. this suggests that thekinematical properties of nearby e/s0 galaxies do not agree with the oftenassumed simplistic two-family model, in which the giant non-rotating triaxialellipticals are opposed to the fast-rotating axisymmetric faint ellipticals ands0s.

astro-ph;0207504	early-type galaxies in low-density environments	we describe the construction and study of an objectively-defined sample ofearly-type galaxies in low-density environments. the sample galaxies areselected from a recently-completed redshift survey using uniform andreadily-quantified isolation criteria, and are drawn from a sky area of ~700deg^2, to a depth of 7000 k/ms and an apparent magnitude limit of b_j &lt; 16.1.their early-type (e/s0) morphologies are confirmed by subsequent ccd imaging.five out of the nine sample galaxies show signs of morphological peculiaritysuch as tidal debris or blue circumnuclear rings. we confirm that e/s0 galaxiesare rare in low-density regions, accounting for only ~8% of the total galaxypopulation in such environments. we present spectroscopic observations of ninegalaxies in the sample, which are used, in conjunction with updated stellarpopulation models, to investigate star-formation histories. environmentaleffects on early-type galaxy evolution are investigated by comparison with asample of fornax cluster e/s0s. results from both samples are compared withpredictions from semi-analytic galaxy formation models. the mg-sig relation ofe/s0s in low-density regions is shown to be indistinguishable from that of thefornax sample. luminosity-weighted stellar ages and metallicities aredetermined by considering various combinations of line-indices. at a givenluminosity, the e/s0 galaxies in low-density regions are younger than the e/s0sin clusters (by ~2-3 gyr), and also more metal-rich (by ~0.2 dex). we inferthat an anti-correlation of age and metallicity effects is responsible formaintaining the zero-point of the mg-sig relation. the youngest galaxies in oursample show clear morphological signs of interaction.

astro-ph;0407219	line-of-sight velocity distribution corrections for lick/ids indices of  early-type galaxies	we investigate line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd) corrections forabsorption line-strength indices of early-type galaxies in the lick/ids system.this system is often used to estimate basic stellar population parameters suchas luminosity weighted ages and metallicities. using single stellar populationmodel spectral energy distributions by vazdekis (1999) we find that the losvdcorrections are largely insensitive to changes in the stellar populations forold galaxies (age &gt;3 gyr). only the lick/ids balmer series indices show anappreciable effect, which is on the order of the correction itself.furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the losvd corrections tonon-gaussian losvds. in this case the losvd can be described by a gauss-hermiteseries and it is shown that typical values of h_3 and h_4 observed inearly-type galaxies can lead to significant modifications of the losvdcorrections and thus to changes in the derived luminosity weighted ages andmetallicities. a new, simple parameterisation for the losvd corrections, takinginto account the h_3 and h_4 terms, is proposed and calibrations given for asubset of the lick/ids indices and two additional indices applicable to old (&gt;3gyr) stellar populations.

astro-ph;0502467	old globular clusters masquerading as young in ngc 4365?	high signal-to-noise, low-resolution spectra have been obtained for 22globular clusters (gcs) in ngc 4365. some of these were selected as probablerepresentatives of an intermediate-age (2-5 gyr), extremely metal-rich gcsubpopulation. the presence of such a subpopulation had been inferred from theunusual optical and near-ir color distributions of gcs in this otherwisetypical virgo elliptical galaxy. however, ages derived from lick indices areconsistent with uniformly old mean ages for all gcs in our sample. themetallicities of the clusters show some evidence for a trimodal distribution.the most metal-poor and metal-rich peaks are consistent with the valuesexpected for an elliptical galaxy of this luminosity, but there appears to bean additional, intermediate-metallicity peak lying between them. new hubblespace telescope photometry is consistent with this result. a plausible scenariois that in earlier data these three peaks merged into a single broaddistribution. our results suggest that it is difficult to identifyintermediate-age gc subpopulations solely with photometry, even when bothoptical and near-infrared colors are used.
