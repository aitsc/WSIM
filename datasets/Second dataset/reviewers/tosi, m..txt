0901.1237	star formation history in the smc: the case of ngc602	deep hst/acs photometry of the young cluster ngc 602, located in the remotelow density "wing" of the small magellanic cloud, reveals numerous pre-mainsequence stars as well as young stars on the main sequence. the resolvedstellar content thus provides a basis for studying the star formation historyinto recent times and constraining several stellar population properties, suchas the present day mass function, the initial mass function and the binaryfraction. to better characterize the pre-main sequence population, we present anew set of model stellar evolutionary tracks for this evolutionary phase withmetallicity appropriate for the small magellanic cloud (z = 0.004). we use astellar population synthesis code, which takes into account a full range ofstellar evolution phases to derive our best estimate for the star formationhistory in the region by comparing observed and synthetic color-magnitudediagrams. the derived present day mass function for ngc 602 is consistent withthat resulting from the synthetic diagrams. the star formation rate in theregion has increased with time on a scale of tens of myr, reaching $0.3-0.7\times 10^{-3} m_\odot yr^{-1}$ in the last 2.5 myr, comparable to what isfound in galactic ob associations. star formation is most complete in the maincluster but continues at moderate levels in the gas-rich periphery of thenebula.

0904.4505	star formation histories, abundances and kinematics of dwarf galaxies in  the local group	within the local universe galaxies can be studied in great detail star bystar, and here we review the results of quantitative studies in nearby dwarfgalaxies. the color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established asthe most accurate way to determine star formation history of galaxies back tothe earliest times. this approach received a large boost from the exceptionaldata sets that wide field ccd imagers on the ground and the hubble spacetelescope could provide. spectroscopic studies using large ground basedtelescopes such as vlt, magellan, keck and het have allowed the determinationof abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarfgalaxies. these studies have shown how the properties of stellar populationscan vary spatially and temporally. this leads to important constraints totheories of galaxy formation and evolution. the combination of spectroscopy andimaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolutionis the aim of this review.

0908.3500	star formation history of the smc: six hst/acs	we observed six fields of the small magellanic cloud (smc) with the advancedcamera for survey on board the hubble space telescope in the f555w and f814wfilters. these fields sample regions characterized by very different star andgas densities, and, possibly, by different evolutionary histories. we find thatthe smc was already forming stars ~12 gyr ago, even if the lack of a clearhorizontal branch suggests that in the first few billion years the starformation activity was low. within the uncertainties of our two-bandphotometry, we find evidence of a radial variation in chemical enrichment, withthe smc outskirts characterized by lower metallicity than the central zones.  from our cmds we also infer that the smc formed stars over a long interval oftime until ~2-3 gyr ago. after a period of modest activity, star formationincreased again in the recent past, especially in the bar and the wing of thesmc, where we see an enhancement in the star-formation activity starting from~500 myr ago. the inhomogeneous distribution of stars younger than ~100 myrindicates that recent star formation has mainly developed locally.

0910.1299	on the origin of the helium-rich population in omega centauri	to study the possible origin of the huge helium enrichment attributed to thestars on the blue main sequence of omega centauri, we make use of a chemicalevolution model that has proven able to reproduce other major observedproperties of the cluster, namely, its stellar metallicity distributionfunction, age-metallicity relation and trends of several abundance ratios withmetallicity. in this framework, the key condition to satisfy all the availableobservational constraints is that a galactic-scale outflow develops in a muchmore massive parent system, as a consequence of multiple supernova explosionsin a shallow potential well. this galactic wind must carry out preferentiallythe metals produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, whereaselements restored to the interstellar medium through low-energy stellar windsby both asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massive stars must be mostlyretained. assuming that helium is ejected through slow winds by both agb starsand fast rotating massive stars (frmss), the interstellar medium of omegacentauri's parent galaxy gets naturally enriched in helium in the course of itsevolution.

0707.2371	i zw 18 revisited with hst/acs and cepheids: new distance and age	we present new v and i-band hst/acs photometry of i zw 18, the mostmetal-poor blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy in the nearby universe. it has beenargued in the past that i zw 18 is a very young system that started formingstars only &lt; 500 myr ago, but other work has hinted that older (&gt; 1 gyr) redgiant branch (rgb) stars may also exist. our new data, once combined witharchival hst/acs data, provide a deep and uncontaminated opticalcolor-magnitude diagram (cmd) that now strongly indicates an rgb. the rgb tip(trgb) magnitude yields a distance modulus (m-m)_0 = 31.30 +/- 0.17, i.e., d =18.2 +/- 1.5 mpc. the time-series nature of our observations allows us to alsodetect and characterize for the first time three classical cepheids in i~zw~18.the time-averaged cepheid &lt;v&gt; and &lt;i&gt; magnitudes are compared to the vireddening-free wesenheit relation predicted from new non-linear pulsationmodels specifically calculated at the metallicity of i zw 18. for the onebona-fide classical cepheid with a period of 8.63 days this implies a distancemodulus (m-m)_0 = 31.42 +/- 0.26. the other two cepheids have unusually longperiods (125.0 and 129.8 d) but are consistent with this distance. the coherentpicture that emerges is that i zw 18 is older and farther away than previouslybelieved. this rules out the possibility that i zw 18 is a truly primordialgalaxy formed recently (z &lt; 0.1) in the local universe.

1001.4044	multi-epoch hst observations of izw18: characterization of variable  stars at ultra-low metallicities	variable stars have been identified for the first time in the very metal-poorblue compact dwarf galaxy izw18, using deep multi-band (f606w,f814w)time-series photometry obtained with the advanced camera for surveys(acs) on board the hubble space telescope (hst). we detected 34 candidatevariable stars in the galaxy. we classify three of them as classical cepheids,with periods of 8.71, 125.0 and 130.3 days, respectively, and other two as longperiod variables with periodicities longer than a hundred days. these are thelowest metallicity classical cepheids known so far, thus providing theopportunity to explore and fit models of stellar pulsation fo classicalcepheids at previously inaccessible metallicities. the period distribution ofthe confirmed cepheids is markedly different from what is seen in other nearbygalaxies, which is likely related to the star bursting nature of izw18. byapplying to the 8.71 days cepheid theoretical wesenheit (v,i) relations basedon new pulsation models of classical cepheids specifically computed for theextremely low metallicity of this galaxy (z=0.0004, y=0.24), we estimate thedistance modulus of izw18 to be mu_0= 31.4pm0.2 d=19.0^{+1.8}_{-1.7}mpc) forcanonical models of classical cepheids, and of 31.2pm0.2 mag(d=17.4^{+1.6}_{-1.6}mpc) using over luminous models. the theoretical modelingof the star's light curves provides mu_0=31.4pm0.1 mag, d=19.0^{+0.9}_{-0.9}mpc, in good agreement with the results from the theoretical wesenheitrelations. these pulsation distances bracket the distance of 18.2pm1.5mpcinferred by aloisi et al.

1001.4442	pre-main sequence turn-on as a chronometer for young clusters: ngc346 as  a benchmark	we present a novel approach to derive the age of very young star clusters, byusing the turn-on (ton). the ton is the point in the color-magnitude diagram(cmd) where the pre-main sequence (pms) joins the main sequence (ms). in the msluminosity function (lf) of the cluster, the ton is identified as a peakfollowed by a dip. we propose that by combining the cmd analysis with themonitoring of the spatial distribution of ms stars it is possible to reliablyidentify the ton in extragalactic star forming regions. compared to alternativemethods, this technique is complementary to the turn-off dating and avoids thesystematic biases affecting the pms phase. we describe the method and itsuncertainties, and apply it to the star forming region ngc346, which has beenextensively imaged with the hubble space telescope (hst). this study extendsthe lf approach in crowded extragalactic regions and opens the way for futurestudies with hst/wfc3, jwst and from the ground with adaptive optics.

1002.4752	pulsation models for ultra-low (z=0.0004) metallicity classical cepheids	classical cepheids are primary distance indicators playing a fundamental rolein the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale. the possible dependenceof their characteristic period-luminosity (pl) relation on chemical compositionis still debated in the literature, and the behaviour of these pulsators atvery low metallicity regimes is almost unexplored. in order to deriveconstraints on the application of the period-luminosity relation at low metalabundances, we investigate the properties of the few ultra-low metallicity (z ~0.0004) cepheids recently discovered in the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18. tothis purpose we have computed an updated and extended set of nonlinearconvective models for z=0.0004 and y=0.24, spanning a wide range of stellarmasses, and taking into account the evolutionary constraints for selectedluminosity levels. as a result we are able to predict the topology of theinstability strip, the variations of all the relevant quantities along thepulsation cycle, including the morphology of the light curves, the theoreticalperiod-luminosity-color, period-wesenheit and period-luminosity relations atsuch a low metallicity. for each of these relations we provide the appropriatecoefficients for fundamental mode pulsators with z=0.0004. by comparing theseresults with the properties of more metal rich cepheids we find that thesynthetic pl relations for z=0.0004 are steeper than at higher z, but similarto the z=0.004 ones, thus suggesting a leveling off of the metallicity effecttowards the lowest zs.

0708.0852	starbursts in the local universe: new hst/acs observations of the  irregular galaxy ngc 4449	we present photometry with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope (hst) of stars in the magellanic starburst galaxy ngc4449. the galaxy has been imaged in the f435w (b), f555w (v) and f814w (i)broad-band filters, and in the f658n (halpha) narrow-band filter. ourphotometry includes ~300,000 objects in the (b, v) color-magnitude diagram(cmd) down to v &lt; 28, and ~400,000 objects in the (v, i) cmd, down to i &lt; 27 .a subsample of ~200,000 stars has been photometrized in all the three bandssimultaneously. the features observed in the cmds imply a variety of stellarages up to at least 1 gyr, and possibly as old as a hubble time. the spatialvariation of the cmd morphology and of the red giant branch colors point towardthe presence of an age gradient: young and intermediate-age stars tend to beconcentrated toward the galactic center, while old stars are presenteverywhere. the spatial variation in the average luminosity of carbon starssuggests that there is not a strong metallicity gradient (&lt; 0.2 dex). also, wedetect an interesting resolved star cluster on the west side of the galaxy,surrounded by a symmetric tidal or spiral feature consisting of young stars.the positions of the stars in ngc 4449 younger than 10 myr are stronglycorrelated with the halpha emission. we derive the distance of ngc 4449 fromthe tip of the red giant branch to be d=3.82 \pm 0.27 mpc. this result is inagreement with the distance that we derive from the luminosity of the carbonstars.

0708.1138	progressive star formation in the young smc cluster ngc 602	ngc 602 is a young stellar cluster located in a peripheral region of thesmall magellanic cloud known as the wing. far from the main body of the galaxyand abutting the magellanic bridge, the smc's wing is characterized by low gasand stellar content. with deep optical imaging from the advanced camera forsurveys (acs) aboard the hubble space telescope (hst), we have discovered anextensive pre-main sequence (pms) population, with stellar masses in the range0.6-3 solar masses. these low mass pms stars formed coevally with the centralcluster about 4 myr ago. spitzer space telescope (spitzer) images of the sameregion from the infrared array camera (irac) also reveal a population of youngstellar objects (ysos), some of which are still embedded in nebular materialand most of which likely formed even more recently than the young starsdetected with hst/acs imaging. we infer that star formation started in thisregion about 4 myr ago with the formation of the central cluster and graduallypropagated towards the outskirts where star formation is presently ongoing.

1006.5863	quantifying the uncertainties of chemical evolution studies. ii. stellar  yields	this is the second paper of a series which aims at quantifying theuncertainties in chemical evolution model predictions related to the underlyingmodel assumptions. specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to thechoice of the stellar yields. we adopt a widely used model for the chemicalevolution of the galaxy and test the effects of changing the stellarnucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemicalspecies. we find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesisin stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect the modelpredictions. this is especially true for the majority of the iron-peakelements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen.the main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different modelsassuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observationsare: (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type ii supernovaexplosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning inmodels of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects ofrotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adoptedrates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions, and (vi) the differenttreatments of convection. our results suggest that it is mandatory to includeprocesses such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars and rotation instars of all masses in accurate studies of stellar evolution andnucleosynthesis. in spite of their importance, both these processes still haveto be better understood and characterized. as for massive stars, presupernovamodels computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the literature,but they still wait for a self-consistent coupling with the results ofexplosive nucleosynthesis computations.

1010.0340	history and modes of star formation in the most active region of the  small magellanic cloud, ngc 346	we discuss the star formation history of the smc region ngc 346 based onhubble space telescope images. the region contains both field stars and clustermembers. using a classical synthetic cmd procedure applied to the field aroundngc 346 we find that there the star formation pace has been rising from a quitelow rate 13 gyr ago to \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-8} mo yr^{-1}pc^{-2} in the last100 myr. this value is significantly higher than in other star forming regionsof the smc. for ngc 346 itself, we compare theoretical and observedcolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of several stellar sub-clusters identified inthe region, and we derive their basic evolution parameters. we find that ngc346 experienced different star formation regimes, including a dominant andfocused "high density mode", with the sub-clusters hosting both pre-mainsequence (pms) and upper main sequence (ums) stars, and a diffuse "low densitymode", as indicated by the presence of low-mass pms sub-clusters.quantitatively, the star formation in the oldest sub-clusters started about 6myr ago with remarkable synchronization, it continued at high rate (up to 2\times 10^{-5} mo yr^{-1} pc^{-2}) for about 3 myr and is now progressing at alower rate. interestingly, sub-clusters mainly composed by low mass pms starsseem to experience now the first episode of star formation, followingmulti-seeded spatial patterns instead of resulting from a coherent trigger. twospeculative scenarios are put forth to explain the deficiency of ums stars: thefirst invokes under-threshold conditions of the parent gas; the secondspeculates that the initial mass function (imf) is a function of time, with theyoungest sub-clusters not having had sufficient time to form more massivestars.

1106.5974	is the young star cluster ngc 376 dissolving in the field of the smc?	we use deep images acquired with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) onboard of the hubble space telescope (hst) in the filters f555w and f814w tocharacterize the properties of ngc 376, a young star cluster located in thewing of the small magellanic cloud (smc). using isochrone fitting we derive forngc 376 an age of 28+/-7 myr, in good agreement with previous studies. the highspatial resolution acs data allow us to determine the center of gravity of thecluster and to construct extended surface brightness and radial densityprofiles. neither of these profiles can be fitted with a theoretical model,suggesting that the cluster is not in virial equilibrium. considering the youngage of the cluster, we speculate that the distortion of the radial profiles maybe the result of the rapid gas dispersal that follows the initial phase of starformation. the cluster shows clear evidence of dynamical mass segregation. fromthe properties of the radial profiles and the present day mass function (pdmf)we conclude that ngc 376 appears to have already lost nearly 90% of its initialstellar mass, probably as a consequence of the sudden gas dispersal thatfollows the early phase of star formation (sf).

1204.2266	effects of thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing on the  evolution of light elements in the galaxy : d, 3he and 4he	recent studies of low- and intermediate-mass stars show that the evolution ofthe chemical elements in these stars is very different from that proposed bystandard stellar models. rotation-induced mixing modifies the internal chemicalstructure of main sequence stars, although its signatures are revealed onlylater in the evolution when the first dredge-up occurs. thermohaline mixing islikely the dominating process that governs the photospheric composition oflow-mass red giant branch stars and has been shown to drastically reduce thenet 3he production in these stars. the predictions of these new stellar modelsneed to be tested against galaxy evolution. in particular, the resultingevolution of the light elements d, 3he and 4he should be compared with theirprimordial values inferred from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe dataand with the abundances derived from observations of different galacticregions. we study the effects of thermohaline mixing and rotation-inducedmixing on the evolution of the light elements in the milky way. we computegalactic evolutionary models including new yields from stellar models computedwith thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing. we discuss theeffects of these important physical processes acting in stars on the evolutionof the light elements d, 3he, and 4he in the galaxy. galactic chemicalevolution models computed with stellar yields including thermohaline mixing androtation fit better observations of 3he and 4he in the galaxy than modelscomputed with standard stellar yields. the inclusion of thermohaline mixing instellar models provides a solution to the long-standing "3he problem" on agalactic scale. stellar models including rotation-induced mixing andthermohaline instability reproduce also the observations of d and 4he.

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1312.6472	the gaia-eso survey: abundance ratios in the inner-disk open clusters  trumpler 20, ngc 4815, ngc 6705	open clusters are key tools to study the spatial distribution of abundancesin the disk and their evolution with time. using the first release of stellarparameters and abundances of the gaia-eso survey, we analyse the chemicalproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely ngc6705, ngc 4815, and trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the galacticdisk at galactocentric radius r$_{gc}\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving theirhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. we study theabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosyntheticchannels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. the main results can besummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable[el/fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metalcontent [el/h], with ngc 4815 having the lowest metallicity. their [el/fe]ratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, bothin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing theabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and withfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of mg,ni, ca in ngc 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequentvariation of its r$_{gc}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbitdetermination. the full dataset of the gaia-eso survey will be a superlativetool to constrain the chemical evolution of our galaxy by disentanglingdifferent formation and evolution scenarios.

1403.7451	the gaia-eso survey: properties of the intermediate age open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a populous ~500 myr open cluster at a galactocentric radius of 7kpc observed in the first six months of the gaia-eso survey. located in theinner galactic disk, ngc 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,where few intermediate age open clusters are found. we use the survey derivedradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elementalabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry outan analysis of cluster properties. the radial velocity distribution of stars inthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derivelikely cluster membership for stars observed by the gaia-eso survey. weinvestigate the distributions of fe and fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, andthe light elements na and al and characterize the cluster's internal chemicalhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram isanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,distance, and age. ngc 4815 is found to have a mean [fe/h]=+0.03. elementalabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, withinternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

astro-ph;0207059	anomalous rr lyrae stars(?). iii. cm leonis	time series of b,v,i ccd photometry and radial velocity measurements fromhigh resolution spectroscopy (r=30,000) covering the full pulsation cycle arepresented for the field rr lyrae star cm leonis. the photometric data span a 6year interval from 1994 to 1999, and allow us to firmly establish the pulsationmode and periodicity of the variable. the derived period p=0.361699 days (+/-0.000001) is very close to the value published in the fourth edition of thegeneral catalogue of variable stars (p=0.361732 days). however, contrary towhat was previously found, the amplitude and shape of the light curve qualifycm leo as a very regular first overtone pulsator with a prominent hump on therising branch of its multicolour light curves. according to an abundaceanalysis performed on three spectra taken near minimum light (0.42 &lt; phase &lt;0.61), cm leo is a metal-poor star with metal abundance [fe/h]=-1.93 +/- 0.20.the photometric and radial velocity curves of cm leo have been compared withthe predictions of suitable pulsational models to infer tight constraints onthe stellar mass, effective temperature, and distance modulus of the star. wederive a true distance modulus of cm leo of (m-m)0=13.11 +/- 0.02 mag and acorresponding absolute magnitude of mv=0.47 +/- 0.04. this absolute magnitude,once corrected for evolutionary and metallicity effects, leads to a truedistance modulus of the large magellanic cloud of (m-m)0=18.43 +/- 0.06 mag, inbetter agreement with the long astronomical distance scale.

astro-ph;0210200	understanding dwarf galaxies as galactic building blocks	this is a summary of a general discussion held during the thirdeuroconference on galaxy evolution. various observational features of thestellar populations in present--day dwarf galaxies were presented to introducethe discussion on the possibility that these systems be the main buildingblocks of spiral and elliptical galaxies. many people in the audience turnedout to think that the inconsistencies among the observed properties of largeand dwarf galaxies are too many to believe that the former are built up only bymeans of successive accretions of the latter. however, theorists ofhierarchical galaxy formation suggested that present--day dwarfs are notrepresentative of the galactic building blocks, which may be completelyinvisible nowadays. some of them suggested that, contrary to what is usuallyassumed in hierarchical modelling, the actual building blocks were still fullygaseous systems when their major mergers occurred. if this is the case, thenmost of the inconsistencies can be overcome, and the scenario of hierarchicalgalaxy formation becomes not too different from that of a slow gas accretion.

astro-ph;0309265	the star formation history of ngc 1705: a post-starburst galaxy on the  verge of activity	we infer the star formation history in different regions of the blue compactdwarf ngc 1705 by comparing synthetic color-magnitude diagrams with hst opticaland near-infrared photometry. we find that ngc 1705 is not a young galaxybecause its star formation commenced at least 5 gyr ago. on the other hand, weconfirm the existence of a recent burst of star formation between 15 and 10 myrago. we also find evidence for new strong activity, which started 3 myr ago andis still continuing. the old population is spread across the entire galaxy,while the young and intermediate stars are more concentrated in the centralregions. we derive an almost continuous star formation with variable rate, andexclude the presence of long quiescent phases between the episodes during thelast ~1 gyr. the central regions experienced an episode of star formation of\~0.07 msun/yr (for a salpeter initial mass function [imf]) 15 to 10 myr ago.this coincides with the strong activity in the central super star cluster. wefind a rate of ~0.3 msun/yr for the youngest ongoing burst which started ~3 myrago. this is higher than in other dwarfs and comparable to the rate of ngc1569. the star formation rate of earlier episodes is not especially high andfalls in the range 10^{-3}-10^{-1} msun/yr. the imf is close to the salpetervalue or slightly steeper.

astro-ph;0404298	iron abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy of the open clusters  ngc 2506, ngc 6134, and ic 4651	this is the first of a series of papers devoted to derive the metallicity ofold open clusters in order to study the time evolution of the chemicalabundance gradient in the galactic disk. we present detailed iron abundancesfrom high resolution (r~40000) spectra of several red clump and bright giantstars in the open clusters ic 4651, ngc 2506 and ngc 6134. we observed 4 starsof ngc 2506, 3 stars of ngc 6134, and 5 stars of ic 4651 with the ferosspectrograph at the eso 1.5 m telescope; moreover, 3 other stars of ngc 6134were observed with the uves spectrograph on kueyen (vlt ut2). after excludingthe cool giants near the red giant branch tip (one in ic 4651 and one in ngc2506), we found overall [fe/h] values of -0.20 +/- 0.01, rms = 0.02 dex (2stars) for ngc 2506, +0.15 +/- 0.03, rms = 0.07 dex (6 stars) for ngc 6134, and+0.11 +/- 0.01, rms = 0.01 dex (4 stars) for ic 4651. the metal abundancesderived from line analysis for each star were extensively checked usingspectrum synthesis of about 30 to 40 fe i lines and 6 fe ii lines. ourspectroscopic temperatures provide reddening values in good agreement withliterature data for these clusters, strengthening the reliability of theadopted temperature and metallicity scale. also, gravities from the feequilibrium of ionization agree quite well with expectations based on clusterdistance moduli and evolutionary masses.

astro-ph;0406484	continuous star formation in izw18	we study the dynamical and chemical evolution of a galaxy similar to izw18under the assumption of a continuous star formation during bursts. we adopt a2-d hydrocode coupled with detailed chemical yields originating from sneii,sneia and from single intermediate-mass stars. different nucleosynthetic yieldsand different imf slopes are tested. in most of the explored cases, a galacticwind develops, mostly carrying out of the galaxy the metal-enriched gasproduced by the burst itself. the chemical species with the largest escapeprobabilities are fe and n. consequently, we predict that the [$\alpha$/fe] and[$\alpha$/n] ratios outside the galaxy are lower than inside. in order toreproduce the chemical composition of izw18, the best choice seems to be theadoption of the yields of meynet &amp; maeder (2002) which take into accountstellar rotation, although these authors do not follow the whole evolution ofall the stars. models with a flat imf (x=0.5) seem to be able to betterreproduce the chemical properties of izw18, but they inject in the gas a muchlarger amount of energy and the resulting galactic wind is very strong, atvariance with observations. we also predict the evolution of the abundances inthe \hi medium and compare them with recent {\sl fuse} observations.

astro-ph;0504281	the complex star formation history of ngc 1569	we present new results on the star formation history of the dwarf irregulargalaxy ngc 1569. the data were obtained with hubble space telescope'snicmos/nic2 in the f110w (j) and f160w (h) near-infrared (nir) filters andinterpreted with the synthetic color-magnitude diagram method. the galaxyexperienced a complex star formation (sf) activity. the best fit to the data isfound by assuming three episodes of activity in the last 1-2 gyr. the mostrecent and strong episode constrained by these nir data started ~37 myr ago andended ~13 myr ago, although we cannot exclude the possibility that up to threesf episodes occurred in this time interval. the average star-formation rate(sfr) of the episode is 3.2 msun yr-1 kpc-2, in agreement with literature data.a previous episode produced stars between 150 myr and 40 myr ago, with a meansfr about 2/3 lower than the mean sfr of the youngest episode. an older sfepisode occurred about 1 gyr ago. all these sfrs are 2-3 orders of magnitudehigher than those derived for late-type dwarfs of the local group. in all casesan initial mass function similar to salpeter's allows for a good reproductionof the data, but we cannot exclude flatter mass functions. these results havebeen obtained adopting a distance of 2.2 mpc and a reddening e(b-v)=0.56. alarger distance would require younger episodes and higher sfrs. we haveexplored some possible scenarios using the astrated mass in the best fit model,in order to constrain the past star formation history. we cannot rule out a lowrate in the past sf but we can safely conclude that the last 1-2 gyr have beenpeculiar.

astro-ph;0609330	past and present star formation in the smc: ngc 346 and its neighborhood	in the quest of understanding how star formation occurs and propagates in thelow metallicity environment of the small magellanic cloud (smc), we acquireddeep f555w (~v), and f814w (~i) hst/acs images of the young and massive starforming region ngc 346. these images and their photometric analysis provide uswith a snapshot of the star formation history of the region. we find evidencefor star formation extending from ~10 gyr in the past until ~150 myr in thefield of the smc. the youngest stellar population (~3 +/- 1 myr) is associatedwith the ngc 346 cluster. it includes a rich component of low mass pre-mainsequence stars mainly concentrated in a number of sub-clusters, spatially co-located with co clumps previously detected by rubio et al. (2000). within ouranalysis uncertainties, these sub-clusters appear coeval with each other. themost massive stars appear concentrated in the central sub-clusters, indicatingpossible mass segregation. a number of embedded clusters are also observed.this finding, combined with the overall wealth of dust and gas, could implythat star formation is still active. an intermediate age star cluster, bs90,formed ~4.3 +/-0.1 gyr ago, is also present in the region. thus, this region ofthe smc has supported star formation with varying levels of intensity over muchof the cosmic time.

astro-ph;0701162	the chemical evolution of omega centauri's progenitor system	chemical evolution models are presented for the anomalous globular clusteromega centauri. after demonstrating that the chemical features of omega cen cannot be reproduced in the framework of the closed-box self-enrichment scenario,we discuss a model in which this cluster is the remnant of a dwarf spheroidalgalaxy evolved in isolation and then swallowed by the milky way. both infall ofprimordial matter and metal-enriched gas outflows have to be considered inorder to reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution function, theage-metallicity relation and several abundance ratios. yet, as long as anordinary stellar mass function and standard stellar yields are assumed, we failby far to get the enormous helium enhancement required to explain the blue mainsequence (and, perhaps, the extreme horizontal branch) stellar data. rotatingmodels of massive stars producing stellar winds with large helium excesses atlow metallicities have been put forward as promising candidates to solve the`helium enigma' of omega cen (maeder &amp; meynet, 2006, a&amp;a, 448, l37). however,we show that for any reasonable choice of the initial mass function thehelium-to-metal enrichment of the integrated stellar population is unavoidablymuch lower than 70 and conclude that the issue of the helium enhancement inomega cen still waits for a satisfactory explanation. we briefly speculate uponpossible solutions.

astro-ph;9409013	star formation in dwarf irregular galaxies: ngc 6822	our proposed method to study the star formation histories in nearbyirregulars is here applied to ngc 6822. to this purpose we have obtainedaccurate ccd photometry of three regions in the galaxy, reaching v$\simeq$23.5with an accuracy of $\sigma_{bvr}\leq$0.1 mag. the comparison of theobservational color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions withcorresponding synthetic simulations reveals that the star formation activity inthe last gyr has been rather continuous, possibly occurring in long episodesseparated by short quiescent periods, and that the initial mass functionexponent $\alpha$ is in the vicinity of salpeter's value. the studied regionsof ngc~6822 appear to contain different stellar populations. the preferred starformation regime for region a is a continuous activity coupled with amoderately flat $\alpha$. for region c, instead, our best models suggest adiscontinuous star formation and a moderately steep $\alpha$. ngc 6822 is thelast object of our original sample of five nearby irregulars. we can then drawthe scenario resulting from this sample: most of the observed fields appear tohave experienced a {\it gasping} regime of star formation, with averageexponent $\alpha$=2.35 for the initial mass function. despite their smallsizes, the majority of the sample galaxies contain different stellarpopulations in different regions.

astro-ph;9609184	3he in planetary nebulae: a challenge to stellar evolution models	the discrepancy between the observed abundances of 3he in the ism and thosepredicted by stellar and galactic chemical evolution remains largelyunexplained. in this paper, we attempt to shed some light on this unsolvedproblem by presenting a quantitative comparison of the 3he abundances recentlymeasured in six planetary nebulae (pne) with the corresponding predictions ofstellar evolution theory. the determination of the mass of the pne progenitorsallows us to dismiss, to a good degree of confidence, the hypothesis that theabundance of 3he in the envelope of all low-mass stars is strongly reduced withrespect to the standard theoretical values by some mixing mechanism acting inthe latest phases of stellar evolution. the abundance versus mass correlation,allowance made for the limitation of the sample, is in fact found to be fullyconsistent with the classical prediction of stellar evolution. we examine theimplications of this result on the galactic evolution of 3he with the help of aseries of models with standard and non-standard nucleosynthesis prescriptions.the results are found to be consistent with the observed galactic abundancesonly if the vast majority of low-mass stars follows non-standard prescriptions.this implies that either the sample of pne nebulae under exam is highly biased,or the solution to the 3he problem lies elsewhere.

astro-ph;9904219	the star formation history of izw18	the star formation history in izw18 has been inferred from hst/wfpc2 archivaldata. this is done by comparing the derived v, b-v and v, v-i color-magnitudediagrams and luminosity functions with synthetic ones, based on various sets ofstellar evolutionary tracks. at a distance of 10 mpc, the stars resolved in thefield of izw18 allow for a lookback time up to 1 gyr. we find that the mainbody is not experiencing its first episode of star formation. instead, it hasbeen forming stars over the last 0.5-1 gyr, at a rate of ~ 1-2 * 10**(-2) msolper year per kpc**2. a more intense activity of 6-16 * 10**(-2) msol per yearper kpc**2 has taken place between 15 and 20 myr ago. for the secondary body,the lookback time is 0.2 gyr at most and the uncertainty is much higher, due tothe shallower diagrams and the small number of resolved stars. the derivedrange of star formation rate is 3-10 * 10**(-3) msol per year per kpc**2. theimf providing the best fit to the observed stellar populations in the main bodyhas a slope 1.5, much flatter than in any similar galaxy analyzed with the samemethod. in the secondary body, it is peaked at 2.2, closer to salpeter's slope(2.35).
