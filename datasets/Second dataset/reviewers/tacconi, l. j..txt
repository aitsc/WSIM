0902.0978	the role of molecular gas in obscuring seyfert active galactic nuclei	in a sample of local active galactic nuclei studied at a spatial resolutionon the order of 10 pc we show that the interstellar medium traced by themolecular hydrogen v=1-0 s(1) 2.1um line forms a geometrically thick, clumpydisk. the kinematics of the molecular gas reveals general rotation, although anadditional significant component of random bulk motion is required by the highlocal velocity dispersion. the size scale of the typical gas disk is found tohave a radius of ~30 pc with a comparable vertical height. within this radiusthe average gas mass is estimated to be ~10^7 msun based on a typical gas massfraction of 10%, which suggests column densities of nh ~ 5x10^23 cm^-2.extinction of the stellar continuum within this same region suggest lowercolumn densities of nh ~ 2x10^22 cm^-2, indicating that the gas distribution onthese scales is dominated by dense clumps. in half of the observed seyfertgalaxies this lower column density is still great enough to obscure the agn atoptical/infrared wavelengths. we conclude, based on the spatial distribution,kinematics, and column densities that the molecular gas observed is spatiallymixed with the nuclear stellar population and is likely to be associated withthe outer extent of any smaller scale nuclear obscuring structure. furthermore,we find that the velocity dispersion of the molecular gas is correlated withthe star formation rate per unit area, suggesting a link between the twophenomena, and that the gas surface density follows known "schmidt-kennicutt"relations. the molecular/dusty structure on these scales may be dynamic sinceit is possible that the velocity dispersion of the gas, and hence the verticaldisk height, is maintained by a short, massive inflow of material into thenuclear region and/or by intense, short-lived nuclear star formation.

0903.1872	the sins survey: sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of z ~ 2  star-forming galaxies	we present the sins survey with sinfoni of high redshift galaxies. with 80objects observed and 63 detected, sins is the largest survey of spatiallyresolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forminggalaxies at z~1-3. we describe the selection of the targets, the observations,and the data reduction. we then focus on the "sins halpha sample" of 62rest-uv/optically-selected sources at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.6 for which we targeted primarilythe halpha and [nii] emission lines. only 30% of this sample had previousnear-ir spectroscopic observations. as a whole, the sins halpha sample covers areasonable representation of massive log(m*/msun)&gt;~10 star-forming galaxies atz~1.5-2.5, with some bias towards bluer systems compared to pure k-selectedsamples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. the sample spans twoorders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formationrates, with median values of approximately log(m*/msun) = 10.5, 70 msun/yr, and3/gyr. the ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved onscales ranging from 1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations totypically 4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. the halpha morphologies tend to beirregular and/or clumpy. about one-third are rotation-dominated yet turbulentdisks, another third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominatedobjects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; thefraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part ofthe sample. the halpha luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on averageroughly twice higher dust attenuation towards the hii regions relative to thebulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formationrates.

0706.2656	dynamical properties of z~2 star forming galaxies and a universal star  formation relation	we present the first comparison of the dynamical properties of differentsamples of z~1.4-3.4 star forming galaxies from spatially resolved imagingspectroscopy from sinfoni/vlt integral field spectroscopy and iram comillimeter interferometry. our samples include 16 rest-frame uv-selected, 16rest-frame optically-selected and 13 submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we findthat restframe uv- and optically bright (k&lt;20) z~2 star forming galaxies aredynamically similar, and follow the same velocity-size relation as diskgalaxies at z~0. in the theoretical framework of rotating disks forming fromdissipative collapse in dark matter halos, the two samples require a spinparameter ranging from 0.06 to 0.2. in contrast bright smgs have largervelocity widths and are much more compact. hence, smgs have lower angularmomenta and higher matter densities than either of the uv- or opticallyselected populations. this indicates that dissipative major mergers maydominate the smgs population, resulting in early spheroids, and that themajority of uv/optically bright galaxies have evolved less violently [...].these early disks may later evolve into spheroids via disk instabilities ormergers. because of their small sizes and large densities, smgs lie at the highsurface density end of a universal (out to z=2.5) "schmidt-kennicutt" relationbetween gas surface density and star formation rate surface density with aslope of ~1.7.

0906.2493	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): xii. the head-on collision  in ngc1961	we present high-resolution co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the liner 2 galaxyngc1961. this galaxy is unusual among late-type (sc) disk galaxies in having avery large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. we propose a head-oncollision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both theoff-centered rings and the inflated radius. this scenario is supported by thedetection of a steep velocity gradient in the co(1-0) map at the position of asouthwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. this peak wouldrepresent the remnant of the disrupting companion. we use numerical models todemonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. while ram pressure strippingcould in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce thestriking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group inx-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.the collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,which accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on thesouthern side. we argue that ngc1961 has a strongly warped disk, which givesthe false impression of a nearly face-on system; the main disk is actually moreedge-on, and this error in the true inclination has led to the surprisinglyhigh dynamical mass for a morphologically late-type galaxy. in addition, theoutward propagating ring artificially enlarges the disk. the collisionde-stabilizes the inner disk and can provide gas inflow to the active nucleus.

0911.4355	[the impact of nuclear star formation on gas inflow to agn	our adaptive optics observations of nearby agn at spatial resolutions assmall as 0.085arcsec show strong evidence for recent, but no longer active,nuclear star formation. we begin by describing observations that highlight twocontrasting methods by which gas can flow into the central tens of parsecs. gasaccumulation in this region will inevitably lead to a starburst, and we discussthe evidence for such events. we then turn to the impact of stellar evolutionon the further inflow of gas by combining a phenomenological approach withanalytical modelling and hydrodynamic simulations. these complementaryperspectives paint a picture in which all the processes are ultimatelyregulated by the mass accretion rate into the central hundred parsecs, and theensuing starburst that occurs there. the resulting supernovae delay accretionby generating a starburst wind, which leaves behind a clumpy interstellarmedium. this provides an ideal environment for slower stellar outflows toaccrete inwards and form a dense turbulent disk on scales of a few parsecs.such a scenario may resolve the discrepancy between the larger scale structureseen with adaptive optics and the small scale structure seen with vlti.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1104.0248	constraints on the assembly and dynamics of galaxies. ii. properties of  kiloparsec-scale clumps in rest-frame optical emission of z ~ 2 star-forming  galaxies	we study the properties of luminous stellar clumps identified in deep, highresolution hst/nic2 f160w imaging at 1.6um of six z~2 star-forming galaxieswith existing near-ir integral field spectroscopy from sinfoni at the vlt.individual clumps contribute ~0.5%-15% of the galaxy-integrated rest-frame~5000a emission, with median of about 2%; the total contribution of clump lightranges from 10%-25%. the median intrinsic clump size and stellar mass are ~1kpcand log(mstar[msun])~9, in the ranges for clumps identified in rest-uv or lineemission in other studies. the clump sizes and masses in the subset of disksare broadly consistent with expectations for clump formation via gravitationalinstabilities in gas-rich, turbulent disks given the host galaxies' globalproperties. by combining the nic2 data with acs/f814w imaging available for onesource, and ao-assisted sinfoni halpha data for another, we infer modest color,m/l, and stellar age variations within each galaxy. in these two objects, setsof clumps identified at different wavelengths do not fully overlap;nic2-identified clumps tend to be redder/older than acs- or halpha-identifiedclumps without rest-frame optical counterparts. there is evidence for asystematic trend of older ages at smaller galactocentric radii among theclumps, consistent with scenarios where inward migration of clumps transportsmaterial towards the central regions. from constraints on a bulge-likecomponent at radii &lt;1-3kpc, none of the five disks in our sample appears tocontain a compact massive stellar core, and we do not discern a trend of bulgestellar mass fraction with stellar age of the galaxy. further observations arenecessary to probe the build-up of stellar bulges and the role of clumps inthis process.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1106.2098	the metallicity dependence of the co {\rightarrow} h_2 conversion factor  in z&gt;1 star forming galaxies	we use the first systematic samples of co millimeter emission in z&gt;1'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (sfgs) to study the metallicitydependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}co, from co line luminosity tomolecular gas mass. the molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio ofthe star formation rate (sfr) to co luminosity, is ~1 gyr-1 for near-solarmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above m_s~1e11 m_sun. in this regimethe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as afunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. belowm_s the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. we arguethat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physicalparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamentalmetallicity-sfr-stellar mass relation. a more probable explanation is that theconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in'co-dark' gas. the trend is also expected theoretically from the effect ofenhanced photodissociation of co by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.from the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of thelog({\alpha}co) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairlyinsensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formationactivity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas massesestimated from co luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward forgalaxies below m_s.

1106.3070	building the cosmic infrared background brick by brick with herschel/pep	the cosmic infrared background (cib) includes roughly half of the energyradiated by all galaxies at all wavelengths across cosmic time, as observed atthe present epoch. the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey is exploited hereto study the cib and its redshift differential, at 70, 100 and 160 micron,where the background peaks. combining pacs observations of the goods-s,goods-n, lockman hole and cosmos areas, we define number counts spanning overmore than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mjy to few hundreds mjy.stacking of 24 micron sources and p(d) statistics extend the analysis down to~0.2 mjy. taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in pep fields,differential number counts and cib are studied up to z=5. based on thesecounts, we discuss the effects of confusion on pacs blank field observationsand provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. the total cibsurface brightness emitted above pep 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35+/- 0.95 and 9.49 +/- 0.59 [nw/m2/sr] at 70, 100, and 160 micron, respectively.these values correspond to 58 +/- 7% and 74 +/- 5% of the cobe/dirbe cib directmeasurements at 100 and 160 micron. employing the p(d) analysis, thesefractions increase to ~65% and ~89%. more than half of the resolved cib wasemitted at redshift z&lt;=1. the 50%-light redshifts lie at z=0.58, 0.67 and 0.73at the three pacs wavelengths. the distribution moves towards earlier epochs atlonger wavelengths: while the 70 micron cib is mainly produced by z&lt;=1.0objects, the contribution of z&gt;1.0 sources reaches 50% at 160 micron. most ofthe cib resolved in the three pacs bands was emitted by galaxies with infraredluminosities in the range 1e11-1e12 l(sun).

1107.3140	outflows from agn: kinematics of the narrow-line and coronal-line  regions in seyfert galaxies	as part of an extensive study of the physical properties of active galacticnuclei (agn) we report high spatial resolution near-ir integral-fieldspectroscopy of the narrow-line region (nlr) and coronal-line region (clr) ofseven seyfert galaxies. these measurements elucidate for the first time thetwo-dimensional spatial distribution and kinematics of the recombination linebr{\gamma} and high-ionization lines [sivi], [alix] and [caviii] on scales &lt;300pc from the agn. the observations reveal kinematic signatures of rotation andoutflow in the nlr and clr. the spatially resolved kinematics can be modeled asa combination of an outflow bicone and a rotating disk coincident with themolecular gas. high-excitation emission is seen in both components, suggestingit is leaking out of a clumpy torus. while ngc 1068 (seyfert 2) is viewednearly edge-on, intermediate-type seyferts are viewed at intermediate angles,consistent with unified schemes. a correlation between the outflow velocity andthe molecular gas mass in r&lt;30 pc indicates that the accumulation of gas aroundthe agn increases the collimation and velocity of the outflow. the outflow rateis 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than the accretion rate, implying that theoutflow is mass-loaded by the surrounding interstellar medium (ism). in half ofthe observed agn the kinetic power of the outflow is of the order of the powerrequired by two-stage feedback models to be thermally coupled to the ism andmatch the m-{\sigma}* relation. in these objects the radio jet is clearlyinteracting with the ism, indicative of a link between jet power and outflowpower.

1108.0285	how well can we measure the intrinsic velocity dispersion of distant  disk galaxies?	the kinematics of distant galaxies, from z=0.1 to z&gt;2, play a key role in ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution from early times to the present. one of theimportant parameters is the intrinsic, or local, velocity dispersion of agalaxy, which allows one to quantify the degree of non-circular motions such aspressure support. however, this is difficult to measure because the observeddispersion includes the effects of (often severe) beam smearing on the velocitygradient. here we investigate four methods of measuring the dispersion thathave been used in the literature, to assess their effectiveness at recoveringthe intrinsic dispersion. we discuss the biasses inherent in each method, andapply them to model disk galaxies in order to determine which methods yieldmeaningful quantities, and under what conditions. all the mean weighteddispersion estimators are affected by (residual) beam smearing. in contrast,the dispersion recovered by fitting a spatially and spectrally convolved diskmodel to the data is unbiassed by the beam smearing it is trying to compensate.because of this, and because the bias it does exhibit depends only on thesignal-to-noise, it can be considered reliable. however, at very lowsignal-to-noise, all methods should be used with caution.

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.2904	evidence of strong quasar feedback in the early universe	most theoretical models invoke quasar driven outflows to quench starformation in massive galaxies, this feedback mechanism is required to accountfor the population of old and passive galaxies observed in the local universe.the discovery of massive, old and passive galaxies at z=2, implies that suchquasar feedback onto the host galaxy must have been at work very early on,close to the reionization epoch. we have observed the [cii]158um transition insdssj114816.64+525150.3 that, at z=6.4189, is one of the most distant quasarsknown. we detect broad wings of the line tracing a quasar-driven massiveoutflow. this is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likelytracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early universe.the outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that theoutflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedbackmodels. the inferred outflow rate, dm/dt &gt; 3500 msun/yr, is the highest everfound. at this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, andtherefore quench star formation, in a few million years.

1205.4242	physical properties of dense molecular gas in centres of seyfert  galaxies	we present new ~1" resolution data of the dense molecular gas in the central50-100 pc of four nearby seyfert galaxies. pdbi observations of hcn and, in 2of the 4 sources, simultaneously hco+ allow us to carefully constrain thedynamical state of the dense gas surrounding the agn. analysis of thekinematics shows large line widths of 100-200 km/s fwhm that can only partiallyarise from beam smearing of the velocity gradient. the observed morphologicaland kinematic parameters (dimensions, major axis position angle, red and bluechannel separation, and integrated line width) are well reproduced by a thickdisk, where the emitting dense gas has a large intrinsic dispersion (20-40km/s), implying that it exists at significant scale heights (25-30% of the diskradius). to put the observed kinematics in the context of the starburst and agnevolution, we estimate the toomre q parameter. we find this is always greaterthan the critical value, i.e. q is above the limit such that the gas is stableagainst rapid star formation. this is supported by the lack of direct evidence,in these 4 seyfert galaxies, for on-going star formation close around the agn.instead, any current star formation tends to be located in a circumnuclearring. we conclude that the physical conditions are indeed not suited to starformation within the central ~100 pc.

1209.0476	the impact of interactions, bars, bulges, and agn on star formation  efficiency in local massive galaxies	using observations from the gass and cold gass surveys and complementary datafrom sdss and galex, we investigate the nature of variations in gas depletiontime observed across the local massive galaxy population. the large andunbiased cold gass sample allows us to assess the relative importance of galaxyinteractions, bar instabilities, morphologies and the presence of agn inregulating star formation efficiency. both the h2 mass fraction and depletiontime vary as a function of the distance of a galaxy from the main sequence inthe sfr-m* plane. the longest gas depletion times are found in below-mainsequence bulge-dominated galaxies that are either gas-poor, or else on averageless efficient than disk-dominated galaxy at converting into stars any cold gasthey may have. we find no link between agn and these long depletion times. thegalaxies undergoing mergers or showing signs of morphological disruptions havethe shortest molecular gas depletion times, while those hosting strong stellarbars have only marginally higher global star formation efficiencies as comparedto matched control samples. our interpretation is that depletion timevariations are caused by changes in the ratio between the gas mass traced bythe co(1-0) observations, and the gas mass in high density star-forming cores,with interactions, mergers and bar instabilities able to locally increasepressure and raise the ratio of efficiently star-forming gas to co-detectedgas. building a sample representative of the local massive galaxy population,we derive a global kennicutt-schmidt relation of slope 1.18+/-0.24, and observestructure within the scatter around this relation, with galaxies having low(high) stellar mass surface densities lying systematically above (below) themean relation, suggesting that gas surface density is not the only parameterdriving the global star formation ability of a galaxy.

1211.5770	the far-infrared, uv and molecular gas relation in galaxies up to z=2.5	we use the infrared excess (irx) fir/uv luminosity ratio to study therelation between the effective uv attenuation (a_irx) and the uv spectral slope(beta) in a sample of 450 1&lt;z&lt;2.5 galaxies. the fir data is from very deepherschel observations in the goods fields that allow us to detect galaxies withsfrs typical of galaxies with log(m)&gt;9.3. thus, we are able to study galaxieson and even below the main sfr-stellar mass relation (main sequence). we findthat main sequence galaxies form a tight sequence in the irx--beta plane, whichhas a flatter slope than commonly used relations. this slope favors a smc-likeuv extinction curve, though the interpretation is model dependent. the scatterin the irx-beta plane, correlates with the position of the galaxies in thesfr-m plane. using a smaller sample of galaxies with co gas masses, we studythe relation between the uv attenuation and the molecular gas content. we finda very tight relation between the scatter in the irx-beta plane and thespecific attenuation (s_a), a quantity that represents the attenuationcontributed by the molecular gas mass per young star. s_a is sensitive to boththe geometrical arrangement of stars and dust, and to the compactness of thestar forming regions. we use this empirical relation to derive a method forestimating molecular gas masses using only widely available integratedrest-frame uv and fir photometry. the method produces gas masses with anaccuracy between 0.12-0.16 dex in samples of normal galaxies between z~0 andz~1.5. major mergers and sub-millimeter galaxies follow a different s_arelation.

1304.7771	molecular gas mass functions of normal star forming galaxies since z~3	we use deep far-infrared data from the pep/goods-herschel surveys and restframe ultraviolet photometry to study the evolution of the molecular gas massfunction of normal star forming galaxies. computing the molecular gas mass,m(mol), by scaling star formation rates (sfr) through depletion timescales, orcombining ir luminosity and obscuration properties as in nordon et al., weobtain m(mol) for roughly 700, z=0.2-3.0 galaxies near the star forming "mainsequence". the number density of galaxies follows a schechter function ofm(mol). the characteristic mass m* is found to strongly evolve up to z~1, andthen to flatten at earlier epochs, resembling the infrared luminosity evolutionof similar objects. at z~1, our result is supported by an estimate based on thestellar mass function of star forming galaxies and gas fraction scalings fromthe phibss survey. we compare our measurements to results from current models,finding better agreement with those that are treating star formation lawsdirectly rather than in post-processing. integrating the mass function, westudy the evolution of the m(mol) density and its density parameter omega(mol).

1306.6676	nebular excitation in z~2 star-forming galaxies from the sins and luci  surveys: the influence of shocks and agn	based on high-resolution, spatially resolved data of 10 z~2 star-forminggalaxies from the sins/zc-sinf survey and luci data for 12 additional galaxies,we probe the excitation properties of high-z galaxies and the impact of activegalactic nuclei (agn), shocks and photoionization. we explore how thesespatially-resolved line ratios can inform our interpretation of integratedemission line ratios obtained at high redshift. many of our galaxies fall inthe `composite' region of the z~0 [nii]/ha versus [oiii]/hb diagnostic (bpt)diagram, between star-forming galaxies and those with agn. based on ourresolved measurements, we find that some of these galaxies likely host an agn,while others appear to be affected by the presence of shocks possibly caused byan outflow or from enhanced ionization parameter as compared with hii regionsin normal local star-forming galaxies. we find that the mass-excitation (mex)diagnostic, which separates purely star-forming and agn hosting local galaxiesin the [oiii]/hb versus stellar mass plane, does not properly separate z~2galaxies classified according to the bpt diagram. however, if we shift thegalaxies based on the offset between the local and z~2 mass-metallicityrelation (i.e. to the mass they would have at z~0 with the same metallicity),we find better agreement between the mex and bpt diagnostics. finally, we findthat metallicity calibrations based on [nii]/ha are more biased by shocks andagn at high-z than the [oiii]/hb/[nii]/ha calibration.

1309.3559	the mid-infrared emission of narrow-line active galactic nuclei:  star-formation, nuclear activity and two populations revealed by wise	we explore the nature of the long-wavelength mid-infrared (mir) emission of asample of 13000 local type ii (narrow-line) active galactic nuclei (agns) fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) using 12 and 22 micron photometry from thewise all-sky survey. in combination with first 1.4 ghz measurements, we showthat agns divide into two relatively distinct populations or "branches" in theplane of mir and radio luminosity. seyfert galaxies lie almost exclusively on amir-bright branch (branch a), while low-ionization nuclear emission linegalaxies (liners) are split evenly into branch a and the mir-faint branch b. wedevise various tests to constrain the processes that define the branches,including a comparison to the properties of pure star-forming (sf) inactivegalaxies on the mir-radio plane. we demonstrate that the total mir emission ofobjects on branch a, including most seyfert galaxies, is governed primarily byhost star-formation, with about 15% of the 22 micron luminosity coming fromagn-heated dust. this implies that on-going dusty star-formation is a generalproperty of seyfert host galaxies. we show that the 12 micron broad-bandluminosity of agns on branch a is suppressed with respect to star-forminggalaxies, possibly due to the destruction of pahs or deeper 10 microns siabsorption in agns. we uncover a correlation between the mir luminosity and [oiii] luminosity in agns. this suggests a relationship between the sfr andnuclear luminosity in the agn population, but we caution on the importance ofselection effects inherent to such agn-dominated emission-line galaxies indriving such a correlation. we highlight the mir-radio plane as a useful toolin comparative studies of sf and nuclear activity in agn.

1310.1922	the mean star-forming properties of qso host galaxies	quasi-stellar objects (qsos) occur in galaxies in which supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. manypopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and smbhs predict thatqsos are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by importantprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature ofgalaxies. a detailed study of the star-forming properties of qsos is a criticaltest of such models. we present a far-infrared herschel/pacs study of the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of a sample of spectroscopically observed qsos to z~2from the cosmos extragalactic survey. this is the largest sample to date ofmoderately luminous agns studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.we study trends of the mean sfr with redshift, black hole mass, nuclearbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (eddington ratio). tominimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of smbhproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects withinspectroscopic qso samples that influence the interpretation of sfr trends. wefind that the mean sfrs of these qsos are consistent with those of normalmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between smbh and galaxy massat all redshifts. no strong enhancement in sfr is found even among the mostrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean sfr trends from differentassumptions about the star-forming properties of qso hosts and redshiftevolution of the smbh-galaxy relationship. while limited currently byuncertainties, valuable constraints on agn-galaxy co-evolution can emerge fromour approach.

1310.3838	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for  gravitational quenching	as part of the sins/zc-sinf surveys of high-z galaxy kinematics, we derivethe radial distributions of h-alpha surface brightness, stellar mass surfacedensity, and dynamical mass at ~2 kpc resolution in 19 z~2 star-forming diskswith deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. from these data we infer theradial distribution of the toomre q-parameter for these main-sequence starforming galaxies (sfgs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (10^9.6 to10^11.5 solar masses). in more than half of our sfgs, the h-alpha distributionscannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, butare better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and anexponential. at the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of amass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponentialdistribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. the resulting q-distributions arecentrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for threequarters of the sfgs. the occurrence of h-alpha rings and of large nuclearq-values is strongly correlated, and is more common for the more massive sfgs.while our sample is small and there remain substantial uncertainties andcaveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloudfragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas richhigh-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of thedisks grows.

0801.4637	extended silicate dust emission in pg qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the silicate emission observed in pg qsos,based on observations with the spitzer space telescope. scenarios based on theunified model suggest that silicate emission in agn arises mainly from theilluminated faces of the clouds in the torus at temperatures near sublimation.however, detections of silicate emission in type 2 qsos, and the estimated cooldust temperatures, argue for a more extended emission region.to investigatethis issue we present the mid-infrared spectra of 23 qsos. these spectra, andespecially the silicate emission features at ~10 and ~18 mu can be fitted usingdusty narrow line region (nlr) models and a combination of black bodies. thebolometric luminosities of the qsos allow us to derive the radial distances andcovering factors for the silicate-emitting dust. the inferred radii are 100-200times larger than the dust sublimation radius, much larger than the expecteddimensions of the inner torus. our qso mid-ir spectra are consistent with thebulk of the silicate dust emission arising from the dust in the innermost partsof the nlr.

1311.2596	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for powerful  agn-driven nuclear outflows in massive star-forming galaxies	we report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive (&gt;10^11 msun) z~2 star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which are plausibly driven by anactive galactic nucleus (agn). the sample consists of the eight most massivesfgs from our sins/zc-sinf survey of galaxy kinematics with the imagingspectrometer sinfoni, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptiveoptics (ao) assisted observations. all of the objects are disks hosting asignificant stellar bulge. the spectra in their central regions exhibit a broadcomponent in halpha and forbidden [nii] and [sii] line emission, with typicalvelocity fwhm ~ 1500 km/s, [nii]/halpha ratio ~ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2- 3 kpc. these properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflowsassociated with type 2 agn, the presence of which is confirmed via independentdiagnostics in half the galaxies. the data imply a median ionized gas massoutflow rate of ~ 60 msun/yr and mass loading of ~ 3. at larger radii, a weakerbroad component is detected but with lower fwhm ~ 485 km/s and [nii]/halpha ~0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in thelower-mass sins/zc-sinf galaxies. the high inferred mass outflow rates andfrequent occurrence suggest the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out ofthe centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles, and may thus contribute tothe process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. larger samples athigh masses will be crucial to confirm the importance and energetics of thenuclear outflow phenomenon, and its connection to agn activity and bulgegrowth.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1401.4120	alma reveals the feeding of the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 1566	we report alma observations of co(3-2) emission in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc1566, at a spatial resolution of 25 pc. our aim is to investigate themorphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc, and to probe nuclearfueling and feedback phenomena. ngc 1566 has a nuclear bar of 1.7 kpc radiusand a conspicuous grand design spiral starting from this radius. the alma fieldof view, of diameter 0.9 kpc, lies well inside the nuclear bar and reveals amolecular trailing spiral structure from 50 to 300~pc in size, which iscontributing to fuel the nucleus, according to its negative gravity torques.  the spiral starts with a large pitch angle from the center and then winds upin a pseudo-ring at the inner lindblad resonance (ilr) of the nuclear bar.  this is the first time that a trailing spiral structure is clearly seendriving the gas inwards inside the ilr ring of the nuclear bar. this phenomenonshows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influenceon the gas, triggering its fueling.  the gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen throughextinction in hst images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0.87mmcontinuum. this continuum emission must come essentially from cold dust heatedby the interstellar radiation field. the hcn(4-3) and hco+(4-3) lines weresimultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral. the hco+(4-3) line is3 times stronger than the hcn(4-3), as expected when star formation excitationdominates over active galactic nucleus (agn) heating. the co(3-2)/hco+(4-3)integrated intensity ratio is \sim 100.  the molecular gas is in remarkably regular rotation, with only slightnon-circular motions at the periphery of the nuclear spiral arms. theseperturbations are quite small, and no outflow nor agn feedback is detected.

1405.7706	molecular line emission in ngc1068 imaged with alma. i an agn-driven  outflow in the dense molecular gas	we investigate the fueling and the feedback of star formation and nuclearactivity in ngc1068, a nearby (d=14mpc) seyfert 2 barred galaxy, by analyzingthe distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the disk. we have usedalma to map the emission of a set of dense molecular gas tracers (co(3-2),co(6-5), hcn(4-3), hco+(4-3) and cs(7-6)) and their underlying continuumemission in the central r ~ 2kpc of ngc1068 with spatial resolutions ~0.3"-0.5" (~ 20-35pc). molecular line and dust continuum emissions are detectedfrom a r ~ 200pc off-centered circumnuclear disk (cnd), from the2.6kpc-diameter bar region, and from the r ~ 1.3kpc starburst (sb) ring. mostof the emission in hco+, hcn and cs stems from the cnd. molecular line ratiosshow dramatic order-of-magnitude changes inside the cnd that are correlatedwith the uv/x-ray illumination by the agn, betraying ongoing feedback. the gaskinematics from r ~ 50pc out to r ~ 400pc reveal a massive (m_mol ~ 2.7 (+0.9,-1.2) x 10^7 msun) outflow in all molecular tracers. the tight correlationbetween the ionized gas outflow, the radio jet and the occurrence of outwardmotions in the disk suggests that the outflow is agn-driven. the outflow rateestimated in the cnd, dm/dt ~ 63 (+21, -37) msun yr^-1, is an order ofmagnitude higher than the star formation rate at these radii, confirming thatthe outflow is agn-driven. the power of the agn is able to account for theestimated momentum and kinetic luminosity of the outflow. the cnd mass loadrate of the cnd outflow implies a very short gas depletion time scale of &lt;=1myr.

1406.0183	evidence for wide-spread agn driven outflows in the most massive z~1-2  star forming galaxies	in this paper we follow up on our previous detection of nuclear ionizedoutflows in the most massive (log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) z~1-3 star-forming galaxies(forster schreiber et al.), by increasing the sample size by a factor of six(to 44 galaxies above log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) from a combination of thesins/zc-sinf, luci, gnirs, and kmos^3d spectroscopic surveys. we find a fairlysharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (fwhm in the ha, [nii],and [sii] lines ~ 450-5300 km/s), with large [nii]/ha ratios, abovelog(m*/msun) ~ 10.9, with about two thirds of the galaxies in this mass rangeexhibiting this component. broad nuclear components near and above theschechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, and at z~1 and ~2. the line ratios of the nuclearcomponent are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (agn), or by acombination of shocks and photoionization. the incidence of the most massivegalaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of agnsidentified by x-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. the mass loading ofthe nuclear outflows is near unity. our findings provide compelling evidencefor powerful, high-duty cycle, agn-driven outflows near the schechter mass, andacting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

1505.04705	high-resolution imaging of the molecular outflows in two mergers:  iras17208-0014 and ngc1614	galaxy evolution scenarios predict that the feedback of star formation andnuclear activity (agn) can drive the transformation of gas-rich spiral mergersinto ulirgs, and, eventually, lead to the build-up of qso/elliptical hosts. westudy the role that star formation and agn feedback have in launching andmaintaining the molecular outflows in two starburst-dominated advanced mergers,ngc1614 and iras17208-0014, by analyzing the distribution and kinematics oftheir molecular gas reservoirs. we have used the pdbi array to image with highspatial resolution (0.5"-1.2") the co(1-0) and co(2-1) line emissions inngc1614 and iras17208-0014, respectively. the velocity fields of the gas areanalyzed and modeled to find the evidence of molecular outflows in thesesources and characterize the mass, momentum and energy of these components.while most (&gt;95%) of the co emission stems from spatially-resolved(~2-3kpc-diameter) rotating disks, we also detect in both mergers the emissionfrom high-velocity line wings that extend up to +-500-700km/s, well beyond theestimated virial range associated with rotation and turbulence. the kinematicmajor axis of the line wing emission is tilted by ~90deg in ngc1614 and by~180deg in iras17208-0014 relative to their respective rotating disk majoraxes. these results can be explained by the existence of non-coplanar molecularoutflows in both systems. in stark contrast with ngc1614, where star formationalone can drive its molecular outflow, the mass, energy and momentum budgetrequirements of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 can be best accountedfor by the existence of a so far undetected (hidden) agn of l_agn~7x10^11l_sun. the geometry of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 suggests thatthe outflow is launched by a non-coplanar disk that may be associated with aburied agn in the western nucleus.

1511.05147	measures of galaxy dust and gas mass with herschel photometry and  prospects for alma	(abridged) combining the deepest herschel extragalactic surveys (pep,goods-h, hermes), and monte carlo mock catalogs, we explore the robustness ofdust mass estimates based on modeling of broad band spectral energydistributions (seds) with two popular approaches: draine &amp; li (2007, dl07) anda modified black body (mbb). as long as the observed sed extends to at least160-200 micron in the rest frame, m(dust) can be recovered with a &gt;3 sigmasignificance and without the occurrence of systematics. an average offset of afactor ~1.5 exists between dl07- and mbb-based dust masses, based on consistentdust properties. at the depth of the deepest herschel surveys (in the goods-sfield) it is possible to retrieve dust masses with a s/n&gt;=3 for galaxies on themain sequence of star formation (ms) down to m(stars)~1e10 [m(sun)] up to z~1.at higher redshift (z&lt;=2) the same result is achieved only for objects at thetip of the ms or lying above it. molecular gas masses, obtained convertingm(dust) through the metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust ratio delta(gdr), areconsistent with those based on the scaling of depletion time, and on cospectroscopy. focusing on co-detected galaxies at z&gt;1, the delta(gdr)dependence on metallicity is consistent with the local relation. we combinefar-ir herschel data and sub-mm alma expected fluxes to study the advantages ofa full sed coverage.

0807.1184	from rings to bulges: evidence for rapid secular galaxy evolution at z~2  from integral field spectroscopy in the sins survey	we present ha integral field spectroscopy of well resolved, uv/opticallyselected z~2 star-forming galaxies as part of the sins survey with sinfoni onthe eso vlt. our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show thepresence of turbulent rotating star forming rings/disks, plus centralbulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to total dynamicalmass appears to scale with [nii]/ha flux ratio and star formation age. wepropose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies atz~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. highredshift disks exhibit large random motions. this turbulence may in part bestirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid cold accretionflows along the filaments of the cosmic web. as a result dynamical friction andviscous processes proceed on a time scale of &lt;1 gyr, at least an order ofmagnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. early secular evolution thus drivesgas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks andmassive bulges, even without major mergers. secular evolution along withincreased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also helpto account for the short time scales of the stellar buildup observed in massivegalaxies at z~2.

0705.3662	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) vii. ngc4569, a large scale  bar funnelling gas into the nuclear region	this work is part of the nuga survey of co emission in nearby activegalaxies. we present observations of ngc4569, a member of the virgo cluster. weanalyse the molecular gas distribution and kinematics in the central region andwe investigate a possible link to the strong starburst present at the nucleus.70% of the 1.1x10^9 msolar of molecular gas detected in the inner 20" is foundto be concentrated within the inner 800 pc and is distributed along the largescale stellar bar seen in near-infrared observations. a hole in the codistribution coincides with the nucleus where most of the halpha emission andblue light are emitted. the kinematics are modelled in three different ways,ranging from the purely geometrical to the most physical. this approach allowsus to constrain progressively the physical properties of the galaxy andeventually to emerge with a reasonable fit to an analytical model of orbits ina barred potential. fitting an axisymmetric model shows that the non-circularmotions must be comparable in amplitude to the circular motions (120 km/s).fitting a model based on elliptical orbits allows us to identify withconfidence the single inner lindblad resonance (ilr) of the large scale bar.finally, a model based on analytical solutions for the gas particle orbits in aweakly barred potential constrained by the ilr radius reproduces theobservations well. the mass inflow rate is then estimated and discussed basedon the best fit model solution. the gravitational torques implied by this modelare able to efficiently funnel the gas inside the ilr down to 300 pc, althoughanother mechanism must take over to fuel the nuclear starburst inside 100 pc.

0808.0194	mergers and mass accretion rates in galaxy assembly: the millennium  simulation compared to observations of z~2 galaxies	recent observations of uv-/optically selected, massive star forming galaxiesat z~2 indicate that the baryonic mass assembly and star formation history isdominated by continuous rapid accretion of gas and internal secular evolution,rather than by major mergers. we use the millennium simulation to build newhalo merger trees, and extract halo merger fractions and mass accretion rates.we find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretionrates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation ratesobserved in z~2 disks. on the other hand, the fraction of major mergers in themillennium simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts ofsubmillimeter galaxies (smgs), in support of observational evidence that theseare major mergers. when following the fate of these two populations in themillennium simulation to z=0, we find that subsequent mergers are not frequentenough to convert all z~2 turbulent disks into elliptical galaxies at z=0.similarly, mergers cannot transform the compact smgs/red sequence galaxies atz~2 into observed massive cluster ellipticals at z=0. we argue therefore, thatsecular and internal evolution must play an important role in the evolution ofa significant fraction of z~2 uv-/optically and submillimeter selected galaxypopulations.

astro-ph;0001424	stellar dynamics and the implications on the merger evolution in ngc6240	we report near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of the luminous merginggalaxy ngc 6240. stellar velocities show that the two k-band peaks separated by1.6arcsec are the central parts of inclined, rotating disk galaxies with equalmass bulges. the dynamical masses of the nuclei are much larger than thestellar mass derived from the k-band light, implying that the progenitorgalaxies were galaxies with massive bulges. the k-band light is dominated byred supergiants formed in the two nuclei in starbursts, triggered ~2x10^7 yearsago, possibly by the most recent perigalactic approach. strong feedback effectsof a superwind and supernovae are responsible for a short duration burst(~5x10^6 years) which is already decaying. the two galaxies form aprograde-retrograde rotating system and from the stellar velocity field itseems that one of the two interacting galaxies is subject to a progradeencounter. between the stellar nuclei is a prominent peak of molecular gas(h_2, co). the stellar velocity dispersion peaks there indicating that the gashas formed a local, self-gravitating concentration decoupled from the stellargravitational potential. ngc 6240 has previously been reported to fit theparadigm of an elliptical galaxy formed through the merger of two galaxies.this was based on the near-infrared light distribution which follows ar^1/4-law. our data cast strong doubt on this conclusion: the system is by farnot relaxed, rotation plays an important role, as does self-gravitating gas,and the near-infrared light is dominated by young stars.

astro-ph;0509707	evolution of local ultraluminous mergers from nir spectroscopy	we present results from our vlt large program to study the dynamicalevolution of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). we have so far obtainednear-infrared high-resolution isaac spectra of 53 local ulirgs at severalmerger timescales and 12 palomar-green qsos (more than half of which areir-bright sources). we have extracted the stellar velocity dispersion androtational velocity along our slits to derive the kinematics of the merginggalaxies. these quantities enable us to answer the following questions aboutthe evolution of ulirgs: 1) what are the progenitor mass ratios?, 2) how do thestellar kinematics evolve?, and, 3) is there a connection between ulirgs andqsos? we find that the ultraluminous phase is mainly triggered by mergers ofapproximately equal mass galaxies, however, less violent minor mergers (ofprogenitor mass ratio ~3:1) also exist in our sample. dynamical heating of themerging hosts is observed as the stellar systematic rotation decreases withtime in favour of the increase of random motions. the merger remnants, beingdispersion-dominated systems with non-negligible rotation, resemble ellipticalgalaxies. placing ulirgs on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies showsthat they resemble intermediate-mass ellipticals. after the nuclearcoalescence, the black hole masses of ulirgs, calculated from their relation tothe host dispersions, are of the order 10^7-10^8 m_sun. to investigate whetherulirgs go through a qso phase during their evolution, we perform a similar(preliminary) analysis of the ir-bright-qso kinematics. we find that theaverage dispersion of the ir-bright qsos is similar to that of the ulirgremnants, indicating that evolutionary links between the two populations mayexist.

astro-ph;0512055	probing for evolutionary links between local ulirgs and qsos from nir  spectroscopy	we present a study of the dynamical evolution of ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs), merging galaxies of infrared luminosity &gt;10^12 l_sun. duringour very large telescope large program, we have obtained isaac near-infrared,high-resolution spectra of 54 ulirgs (at several merger phases) and 12 localpalomar-green qsos to investigate whether ulirgs go through a qso phase duringtheir evolution. one possible evolutionary scenario is that after nuclearcoalescence, the black hole radiates close to eddington to produce qsoluminosities. the mean stellar velocity dispersion that we measure from ourspectra is similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ulirgs and 7 ir-brightqsos. the black holes in both populations have masses of order 10^7-10^8 m_sun(calculated from the relation to the host dispersion) and accrete at rates &gt;0.5eddington. placing ulirgs and ir-bright qsos on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies shows that they are located on a similar region (that ofmoderate-mass ellipticals), in contrast to giant ellipticals and radio-loudqsos. while this preliminary comparison of the ulirg and qso host kinematicalproperties indicates that (some) ulirgs may undergo a qso phase in theirevolutionary history before they settle down as ellipticals, further data onnon-ir excess qsos are necessary to test this scenario.

(2003), have hosts which are larger and moreluminous. the hosts of ulirgs and pg qsos lie close to the locations ofintermediate-size (about 1 -- 2 l*) spheroids in the photometric projection ofthe fundamental plane of ellipticals, although there is a tendency in oursample for the ulirgs with small hosts to be brighter than normal spheroids.excess emission from a young stellar population in the ulirg/qso hosts may beat the origin of this difference. our results provide support for a possiblemerger-driven evolutionary connection between cool ulirgs, warm ulirgs, andpg~qsos although this sequence may break down at low luminosity.

astro-ph;0606158	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest): i. the origin of the  far infrared continuum of qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the far-infrared (fir) continuum of qsos,based on the quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest) of nearby qsos and ulirgsusing observations with the spitzer space telescope. for 27 palomar-green qsosat z &lt;~ 0.3, we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([neii]12.8um,[nev]14.3um, [oiv]25.9um) and emission features (pah7.7um emission which isrelated to star formation), as well as continuum luminosities over a range ofmid- to far-infrared wavelengths between 6 and 60um. we detect star-formationrelated pah emission in 11/26 qsos and fine-structure line emission in all ofthem, often in multiple lines. the detection of pahs in the average spectrum ofsources which lack individual pah detections provides further evidence for thewidespread presence of pahs in qsos. similar pah/fir and [neii]/fir ratios arefound in qsos and in starburst-dominated ulirgs and lower luminositystarbursts. we conclude that the typical qso in our sample has at least 30% butlikely most of the far-infrared luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)lsun) arising fromstar formation, with a tendency for larger star formation contribution at thelargest fir luminosities. in the qso sample, we find correlations between mostof the quantities studied including combinations of agn tracers and starbursttracers. the common scaling of agn and starburst luminosities (and fluxes) isevidence for a starburst-agn connection in luminous agn. strong correlations offar-infrared continuum and starburst related quantities (pah, low excitation[neii]) offer additional support for the starburst origin of far-infraredemission.

astro-ph;0607468	dynamical properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. ii. traces of  dynamical evolution and end products of local ultraluminous mergers	we present results from our very large telescope large program to study thedynamical evolution of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos.this paper is the second in a series presenting the stellar kinematics of 54ulirgs, derived from high resolution, long-slit h- and k-band spectroscopy. thedata presented here, including observations of 17 new targets, are mainlyfocused on sources that have coalesced into a single nucleus. the stellarkinematics, extracted from the co ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,indicate that ulirg remnants are dynamically heated systems with a meandispersion of 161 km/s. the combination of kinematic, structural, andphotometric properties of the remnants indicate that they mostly originate frommajor mergers and that they result in the formation of systems supported byrandom motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. the peak of the velocitydispersion distribution and the locus of ulirgs on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies indicate that the end products of ultraluminous mergers aretypically moderate-mass ellipticals (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 m_sun).converting the host dispersion into black hole mass with the aid of them_bh-sigma relation yields black hole mass estimates of the order 10^7 - 10^8m_sun and high accretion rates with eddington efficiencies often &gt;0.5.

astro-ph;9911488	bars and warps traced by the molecular gas in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068	we present new interferometer observations of the 12co(1-0) and 12co(2-1)line emission of ngc 1068 with a resolution of 0.7''. the molecular gas in theinner 5'' is resolved into a ring with two bright knots east and west of thenuclear continuum emission. for the first time in ngc 1068, we can tracemolecular gas at ~0.18'' (13pc) from the nucleus. the high velocities in thisregion imply an enclosed mass of ~10^8 m_solar. this value is consistent with ablack hole mass of 1.7x10^7 m_solar plus a contribution from a compact nuclearstellar cluster. perpendicular to the kinematic major axis optical images ofngc1068 show a bright, stellar, oval structure of eccentricity 0.8 and adeprojected length of 17kpc. analysis of the rotation curve shows the co spiralarms are at the inner lindblad resonance of this bar-like structure. inside themolecular spiral arms the co kinematic axis changes direction probably inresponse to the 2.5kpc (deprojected) long stellar bar seen in the near infrared(nir). the low velocity dispersion indicates the molecular gas is in a diskwith a thickness of 10pc in the nuclear region and 100pc in the spiral arms.  we constructed kinematic models for the molecular gas using elliptical orbitscaused by a ~1'' nuclear bar and using tilted rings resulting in a warp. wefind that the gas motions are consistent with either the warp or the barmodels. however, because there is no evidence for a 1'' nuclear bar in nirimages, we favor the warp model. a warped co disk can also explain theobscuration of the agn, the extinction of light from the nuclear stellarcluster, and the observed nir and mid-ir polarization. the model predicts thewarped co disk should become edge-on at a radius of 70pc, thereby creating acavity for the ionization cone.

0809.4943	molecular gas streamers feeding and obscuring the active nucleus of  ngc1068	we report the first direct observations of neutral, molecular gas streamingin the nucleus of ngc1068 on scales of &lt;30 pc using sinfoni near-infraredintegral field spectroscopy. at a resolution of 0.075", the flux map of 2.12$\mu$m 1-0 s(1) molecular hydrogen emission around the nucleus in the centralarcsec reveals two prominent linear structures leading to the agn from thenorth and south. the kinematics of the gas in these features are dominated bynon-circular motions and indicate that material is streaming towards thenucleus on highly elliptical or parabolic trajectories whose orientations arecompatible with that of the disk plane of the galaxy. we interpret the data asevidence for fueling of gas to the central region. the radial transport ratefrom ~30 pc to a few parsec from the nucleus is ~15 m$_\sun$ yr$^{-1}$. one ofthe infalling clouds lies directly in front of the central engine. we interpretit as a tidally disrupted streamer that forms the optically thick outerpart ofan amorphous clumpy molecular/dusty structure which contributes to the nuclearobscuration.
