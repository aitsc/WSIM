0901.4114	hizels: a high redshift survey of h-alpha emitters. ii: the nature of  star-forming galaxies at z=0.84	new results from a large survey of h-alpha emission-line galaxies at z=0.84using wfcam/ukirt and a custom narrow-band filter in the j band are presentedas part of the hizels survey. reaching an effective flux limit of 1e-16erg/s/cm^2 in a comoving volume of 1.8e5 mpc^3, this represents the largest anddeepest survey of its kind ever done at z~1. there are 1517 potential lineemitters detected across 1.4 sq.deg of the cosmos and ukidss uds fields, ofwhich 743 are selected as h-alpha emitters. these are used to calculate theh-alpha luminosity function, which is well-fitted by a schechter function withphi*=10^(-1.92+-0.10) mpc^-3, l*=10^(42.26+-0.05)erg/s, and alpha=-1.65+-0.15.the integrated star formation rate density (sfrd) at z=0.845 is 0.15+-0.01m_sun/yr/mpc^3. the results robustly confirm a strong evolution of sfrd fromthe present day out to z~1 and then flattening to z~2, using a singlestar-formation indicator. out to z~1, both the characteristic luminosity andspace density of the h-alpha emitters increase significantly; at higherredshifts, l* continues to increase, but phi* decreases. the z=0.84 h-alphaemitters are mostly disk galaxies (82+-3%), while 28+-4% of the sample showsigns of merger activity and contribute ~20% to the total sfrd. irregulars andmergers dominate the h-alpha luminosity function above l*, while disks aredominant at fainter luminosities. these results demonstrate that it is theevolution of 'normal' disk galaxies that drives the strong increase in the sfrdfrom the current epoch to z~1, although the continued strong evolution of l*beyond z=1 suggests an increasing importance of merger activity at higherredshifts.

0907.0003	bright lyman-alpha emitters at z~9: constraints on the luminosity  function from hizels	new results are presented, as part of the hi-z emission line survey (hizels),from the largest area survey to date (1.4 sq.deg) for lyman-alpha emitters(laes) at z~9. the survey, which is primarily targeting h-alpha emitters atz&lt;3, uses the wide field camera on the united kingdom infrared telescope and acustom narrow-band filter in the j band and reaches a lyman-alpha luminositylimit of ~10^43.8 erg/s over a co-moving volume of 1.12x10^6 mpc^3 atz=8.96+-0.06. only 2 candidates were found out of 1517 line emitters and thosewere rejected as laes after follow-up observations. the limit on the spacedensity of bright laes is improved by 3 orders of magnitude, consistent withsuppression of the bright end of the lyman-alpha luminosity function beyondz~6. combined with upper limits from smaller but deeper surveys, this rules outsome of the most extreme models for high-redshift laes. the potentialcontamination of future narrow-band lyman-alpha surveys at z&gt;7 by galacticbrown dwarf stars is also examined, leading to the conclusion that suchcontamination may well be significant for searches at 7.7&lt;z&lt;8.0, 9.1&lt;z&lt;9.5 and11.7 &lt; z &lt; 12.2.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0910.3642	the blast 250-micron selected galaxy population in goods-south	we identify and investigate the nature of the 20 brightest 250-micron sourcesdetected by the blast within the central 150 sq. arcmin of the goods-southfield. aided by the available deep vla radio imaging, reaching s_1.4 = 30micro-jy, we have identified radio counterparts for 17/20 of the 250-micronsources. the resulting enhanced positional accuracy of ~1 arcsec has thenallowed us to exploit the deep multi-frequency imaging of goods-south toestablish secure galaxy counterparts for the 17 radio-identified sources, andplausible galaxy candidates for the 3 radio-unidentified sources. confusion isa serious issue for this deep blast 250-micron survey, due to the large size ofthe beam. nevertheless, we argue that our chosen counterparts are significant,and often dominant contributors to the measured blast flux densities. for allof these 20 galaxies we have been able to determine spectroscopic (8) orphotometric (12) redshifts. the result is the first `complete' redshiftdistribution for a deep 250-micron selected galaxy sample. this reveals that250-micron surveys reaching detection limits of ~30 mjy contain not onlylow-redshift spirals/lirgs, but also the extreme z~2 dust-enshrouded starburstgalaxies previously discovered at sub-millimetre wavelengths. based on theirirac colours, we find that virtually all of the blast galaxy identificationsappear better described as analogues of the m82 starburst galaxy, or scstar-forming discs rather than highly obscured ulirgs. inspection of the laboca870-micron imaging of the goods-south field yields detections of 7/11 of thez&gt;1 blast sources, and reveals 250/870 flux-density ratios consistent with astandard 40k modified black-body fit with a dust emissivity index beta=1.5.

0912.0039	x-ray groups and clusters of galaxies in the subaru-xmm deep field	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in subaru-xmm deep  field. we reach a depth for a total cluster flux in the 0.5-2 kev band of2x10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} over one of the widest xmm-newton contiguousraster surveys, covering an area of 1.3 square degrees. cluster candidates areidentified through a wavelet detection of extended x-ray emission. the redsequence technique allows us to identify 57 cluster candidates. we report onthe progress with the cluster spectroscopic follow-up and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray luminosity and cluster scaling relations. inaddition, 3 sources are identified as x-ray counterparts of radio lobes, and in3 further sources, x-ray counterpart of radio lobes provides a significantfraction of the total flux of the source. in the area covered by nir data, ouridentification success rate achieves 86%. we detect a number of radio galaxieswithin our groups and for a luminosity-limited sample of radio galaxies wecompute halo occupation statistics using a marked cluster mass function. wecompare the cluster detection statistics in the sxdf with the predictions ofconcordance cosmology and current knowledge of the x-ray cluster properties,concluding that a reduction of concordance sigma_8 value by 5% is required inorder to match the prediction of the model and the data. this conclusion stillneeds verification through the completion of cluster follow-up.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.5176	a near-infrared morphological comparison of high-redshift submm and  radio galaxies: massive star-forming discs vs relaxed spheroids	we present deep, high-quality k-band images of complete subsamples ofpowerful radio and sub-mm galaxies at z=2. the data were obtained in the bestavailable seeing at ukirt and gemini north, with integration times scaled toensure that comparable rest-frame surface brightness levels are reached for allgalaxies. we fit two-dimensional axi-symmetric galaxy models to determinegalaxy morphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths &gt; 4000a, varyingluminosity, axial ratio, half-light radius, and sersic index. we find that,while some images show evidence of galaxy interactions, &gt;95% of the rest-frameoptical light in all galaxies is well-described by these simple models. we alsofind a clear difference in morphology between these two classes of galaxy; fitsto the individual images and image stacks reveal that the radio galaxies aremoderately large (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=8.4+-1.1kpc; median r{1/2}=7.8), de vaucouleursspheroids (&lt;n&gt; = 4.07+-0.27; median n=3.87), while the sub-mm galaxies appearto be moderately compact (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=3.4+-0.3kpc; median r{1/2}=3.1kpc)exponential discs (&lt;n&gt;=1.44+-0.16; median n=1.08). we show that the z=2 radiogalaxies display a well-defined kormendy relation but that, while larger thanother recently-studied high-z massive galaxy populations, they are still ~1.5times smaller than their local counterparts. the scalelengths of the starlightin the sub-mm galaxies are comparable to those reported for the molecular gas.their sizes are also similar to those of comparably massive quiescent galaxiesat z&gt;1.5. in terms of stellar mass surface density, the majority of the radiogalaxies lie within the locus defined by local ellipticals. in contrast, whilebest modelled as discs, most of the sub-mm galaxies have higher stellar massdensities than local galaxies, and appear destined to evolve into present-daymassive ellipticals.

0704.2136	the colour selection of distant galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey  early data release	we investigate colour selection techniques for high redshift galaxies in theukidss ultra deep survey early data release (uds edr). combined with very deepsubaru optical photometry, the depth (k_ab = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of theuds edr allows us to investigate optical/near-ir selection using a large sampleof over 30,000 objects. by using the b-z, z-k colour-colour diagram (the bzktechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z &gt; 1.4, which can befurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pbzk and sbzkrespectively). our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature notpreviously seen in bzk diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving trackof early type galaxies at z &lt; 1.4. we also compare the bzk technique with ther-k colour selection of extremely red objects (eros) and the j-k selection ofdistant red galaxies (drgs), and quantify the overlap between thesepopulations. we find that the majority of drgs, at these relatively brightmagnitudes are also eros. since previous studies have found that drgs at thesemagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these drg/ero galaxieshave seds consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or agn at z &lt; 2.finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pbzk galaxies, similarto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosityfunction of passive z &gt; 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.

1009.1455	detection of an ultra-bright submillimeter galaxy in the  subaru/xmm-newton deep field using aztec/aste	we report the detection of an extremely bright ($\sim$37 mjy at 1100 $\mu$mand $\sim$91 mjy at 880 $\mu$m) submillimeter galaxy (smg),aztec-aste-sxdf1100.001 (hereafter referred to as sxdf1100.001 or orochi),discovered in 1100 $\mu$m observations of the subaru/xmm-newton deep fieldusing aztec on aste. subsequent carma 1300 $\mu$m and sma 880 $\mu$mobservations successfully pinpoint the location of orochi and suggest that ithas two components, one extended (fwhm of $\sim$ 4$^{\prime\prime}$) and onecompact (unresolved). z-spec on cso has also been used to obtain a wide bandspectrum from 190 to 308 ghz, although no significant emission/absorption linesare found. the derived upper limit to the line-to-continuum flux ratio is0.1--0.3 (2 $\sigma$) across the z-spec band.  based on the analysis of the derived spectral energy distribution fromoptical to radio wavelengths of possible counterparts near the sma/carma peakposition, we suggest that orochi is a lensed, optically dark smg lying at $z\sim 3.4$ behind a foreground, optically visible (but red) galaxy at $z \sim1.4$. the deduced apparent (i.e., no correction for magnification) infraredluminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$) and star formation rate (sfr) are $6 \times 10^{13}$$l_{\odot}$ and 11000 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, assuming that the$l_{\rm ir}$ is dominated by star formation. these values suggest that orochiwill consume its gas reservoir within a short time scale ($3 \times 10^{7}$yr), which is indeed comparable to those in extreme starbursts like the centresof local ulirgs.

1102.4881	a robust sample of galaxies at redshifts 6.0&lt;z&lt;8.7: stellar populations,  star-formation rates and stellar masses	we present the results of a photometric redshift analysis designed toidentify z&gt;6 galaxies from the near-ir hst imaging in three deep fields (hudf,hudf09-2 &amp; ers). by adopting a rigorous set of criteria for rejecting low-zinterlopers, and by employing a deconfusion technique to allow the availableirac imaging to be included in the candidate selection process, we have deriveda robust sample of 70 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) spanning the redshift range6.0&lt;z&lt;8.7. based on our final sample we investigate the distribution of uvspectral slopes (beta), finding a variance-weighted mean value of &lt;beta&gt;=-2.05+/- 0.09 which, contrary to some previous results, is not significantly bluerthan displayed by lower-redshift starburst galaxies. we confirm the correlationbetween uv luminosity and stellar mass reported elsewhere, but based on fittinggalaxy templates featuring a range of star-formation histories, metallicitiesand reddening we find that, at z&gt;=6, the range in mass-to-light ratio (m*/l_uv)at a given uv luminosity could span a factor of ~50. focusing on a sub-sampleof twenty-one candidates with irac detections at 3.6-microns we find that l*lbgs at z~6.5 have a median stellar mass of m* = (2.1 +/- 1.1) x 10^9 msun anda median specific star-formation rate of 1.9 +/- 0.8 gyr^-1. using the samesub-sample we have investigated the influence of nebular continuum and lineemission, finding that for the majority of candidates (16 out of 21) thebest-fitting stellar-mass estimates are reduced by less than a factor of 2.5.finally, a detailed comparison of our final sample with the results of previousstudies suggests that, at faint magnitudes, several high-redshift galaxysamples in the literature are significantly contaminated by low-redshiftinterlopers (abridged).

1102.5005	a critical analysis of the uv-continuum slopes of high-redshift  galaxies; no evidence (yet) for extreme stellar populations at z &gt; 6	it has recently been reported that the faintest galaxies at z~6-7 displayextremely blue uv continuum slopes, with a uv power-law index beta ~ -3. suchslopes are bluer than previously reported for any other galaxy population, andimply extinction-free, young, very low-metallicity stellar populations with ahigh ionizing photon escape fraction. here we undertake a critical study of theevidence for such extreme values of beta, combining three new wfc3/ir-selectedsamples of galaxies spanning ~2 decades in uv luminosity over the redshiftrange z~4.5-8. we explore the impact of inclusion/exclusion of less robusthigh-z candidates, and use the varying depths of the samples to explore theeffects of noise and selection bias. simple data-consistency arguments suggestthat artificially blue average values of beta can result when the analysis isextended into the deepest ~ 0.5-mag bin of these wfc3/ir-selected samples,regardless of the actual luminosity or z range probed. by confining attentionto robust, well-detected high-z galaxy candidates, we find that the averagevalue of beta is consistent with -2.05 +/- 0.10 for z=5-7, and -22 &lt; m_uv &lt;-18. we create and analyse a set of simulations which demonstrate that a biastowards artifically low/blue average values of beta is indeed expected when theuv slope analysis is extended towards the source detection threshold, andconclude that there is as yet no clear evidence for uv slopes significantlybluer than beta ~ -2, the typical value displayed by the bluest star-forminggalaxies at more modest z. a robust measurement of beta for the faintestgalaxies at z~7-8 remains a key observational goal, as it provides afundamental test for high escape fractions from a potentially abundant sourceof reionizing photons. this goal is achievable with hst, but requires stilldeeper wfc3/ir imaging in the hudf.

1104.2904	agn environments at z&lt;1.5 in the ukidss ultra-deep survey	we investigate the environments of both x-ray and radio-loud agn within theukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) using deep infrared selection to sample thegalaxy density field in the redshift range 1.0 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.5. using angularcross-correlation techniques we find that both x-ray and radio-loud agnpreferentially reside in overdense environments. we also find that both typesof agn cluster more strongly with those galaxies classified as `passive' ratherthan those that are actively star-forming. we infer clustering scale lengthscomparable to those of passive red galaxies, suggesting that typical agn atthese epochs reside in dark-matter halos of mass m &gt;~ 10^13 m_sun. a closerlook at the small-scale environments of the agn reveals that the neighbouringgalaxies of radio-loud agn have u-b colours more skewed towards the`green-valley' and the red sequence, whereas the neighbours of x-ray agn showno difference to the general galaxy population. this suggests that althoughboth agn types live in overdense environments, the radio-loud agn may bepreferentially located in more evolved cluster cores, in a similar environmentto low-powered radio agn in the local universe.

1110.1722	a remarkably high fraction of strong ly_alpha emitters amongst luminous  redshift 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 lyman break galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey	we present spectroscopic confirmation of ten highly luminous (l &gt;= 2l*) lymanalpha emitters in the redshift range 6.01&lt;z&lt;6.49 (nine galaxies and one agn),initially drawn from a sample of fourteen z_phot &gt;= 6 lyman break galaxies(lbgs) selected from an area of 0.25 square degrees within the ukidssultra-deep survey (uds). overall, our high rate of spectroscopic confirmation(&gt;= 71%) and low rate of contamination provides a strong vindication of thephotometric redshift analysis used to define the original sample. byconsidering star-formation rate estimates based on the ly_alpha and uvcontinuum luminosity we conclude that our sample is consistent with a ly_alphaescape fraction of ~25%. moreover, after careful consideration of the potentialuncertainties and biases, we find that 40%-50% of our sample of l &gt;= 2l*galaxies at 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 display strong ly_alpha emission (rest-frame equivalentwidth &gt;= 25 angs), a fraction which is a factor of ~2 higher than previouslyreported for l &lt;= l* galaxies at z~6. our results suggest that, as the epoch ofreionization is approached, it is plausible that the ly_alpha emitter fractionamongst luminous (l &gt;=2 l*) lbgs shows a similarly sharp increase to thatobserved in their lower-luminosity (l &lt;= l*) counterparts.

0710.3136	on the evolution of clustering of 24um-selected galaxies	this paper investigates the clustering properties of a complete sample of1041 24um-selected sources brighter than f[24um]=400 ujy in the overlappingregion between the swire and ukidss uds surveys. we have concentrated on thetwo (photometric) interval ranges z=[0.6-1.2] (low-z sample) and z&gt;1.6 (high-zsample) as it is in these regions were we expect the mid-ir population to bedominated by intense dust-enshrouded activity such as star formation and blackhole accretion. investigations of the angular correlation function produce acorrelation length are r0~15.9 mpc for the high-z sample and r0~8.5 mpc for thelow-z one. comparisons with physical models reveal that the high-z sources areexclusively associated with very massive (m&gt;~10^{13} m_sun)haloes, comparableto those which locally host groups-to-clusters of galaxies, and are very commonwithin such (rare) structures. conversely, lower-z galaxies are found to residein smaller halos (m_min~10^{12} m_sun) and to be very rare in such systems.while recent studies have determined a strong evolution of the 24um luminosityfunction between z~2 and z~0, they cannot provide information on the physicalnature of such an evolution. our clustering results instead indicate that thisis due to the presence of different populations of objects inhabiting differentstructures, as active systems at z&lt;~1.5 are found to be exclusively associatedwith low-mass galaxies, while very massive sources appear to have concludedtheir active phase before this epoch. finally, we note that the small-scaleclustering data seem to require steep profiles for the distribution of galaxieswithin their halos. this is suggestive of close encounters and/or mergers whichcould strongly favour both agn and star-formation activity.

1201.3609	improved constraints on the expansion rate of the universe up to z~1.1  from the spectroscopic evolution of cosmic chronometers	we present new improved constraints on the hubble parameter h(z) in theredshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopicevolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. we extract a largesample of early-type galaxies (\sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys,spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.42). weselect the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving andwithout signature of ongoing star formation. those galaxies can be used asstandard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by jimenez &amp; loeb (2002),whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probesh(z). we analyze the 4000 {\aa} break (d4000) as a function of redshift, usestellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependenceof the differential age evolution on the differential d4000, and estimate thehubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors.we provide 8 new measurements of h(z) (see tab. 4), and determine its change inh(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z\sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on h(z) at z \neq 0 with aprecision comparable with the one achieved for the hubble constant (about 5-6%at z \sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8) which is crucialto distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. these measurements havebeen tested to best match a \lambda cdm model, clearly providing astatistically robust indication that the universe is undergoing an acceleratedexpansion. this method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constraina variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g.euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z \sim 2.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1205.4058	the sizes, masses and specific star-formation rates of massive galaxies  at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5: strong evidence in favour of evolution via minor mergers	we report the results of a comprehensive study of the relationship betweengalaxy size, stellar mass and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) at redshifts1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5. based on a mass complete (m_star &gt;= 6x10^10 msun), spectroscopicsample from the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), with accurate stellar-massmeasurements derived from spectro photometric fitting, we find that at z~1.4the location of massive galaxies on the size-mass plane is determined primarilyby their ssfr. at this epoch we find that massive galaxies which are passive(ssfr &lt;= 0.1 gyr^-1) follow a tight size-mass relation, with half-light radii afactor f=2.4+/-0.2 smaller than their local counterparts. moreover, amongst thepassive sub-sample we find no evidence that the off-set from the localsize-mass relation is a function of stellar population age. based on asub-sample with dynamical mass estimates we also derive an independent estimateof f=2.3+/-0.3 for the typical growth in half-light radius between z~1.4 andthe present day. focusing on the passive sub-sample, we conclude that toproduce the necessary evolution predominantly via major mergers would requirean unfeasible number of merger events and over populate the high-mass end ofthe local stellar mass function. in contrast, we find that a scenario in whichmass accretion is dominated by minor mergers can produce the necessaryevolution, whereby an increase in stellar mass by a factor of ~2, accompaniedby an increase in size by a factor of ~3.5, is sufficient to reconcile thesize-mass relation at z~1.4 with that observed locally. finally, we note that asignificant fraction (44+/-12%) of the passive galaxies in our sample have adisk-like morphology, providing additional evidence that separate physicalprocesses are responsible for the quenching of star-formation and themorphological transformation of massive galaxies (abridged).

1206.4322	the morphologies of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels-uds field:  compact bulges, and the rise and fall of massive disks	we have used deep, hst, near-ir imaging to study the morphological propertiesof the most massive galaxies at high z, modelling the wfc3/ir h-band images ofthe ~200 galaxies in the candels-uds field with 1 &lt; z_phot &lt; 3, and stellarmasses m_star &gt; 10^11 m_sun. we have used both single-sersic and bulge+diskmodels, have investigated the errors/biases introduced by uncertainties in thebackground and the psf, and have obtained formally-acceptable model fits to&gt;90% of the galaxies. our results indicate that these massive galaxies at 1 &lt; z&lt; 3 lie both on and below the local size-mass relation, with a median r_e~2.6kpc, a factor of ~2.3 smaller than comparably-massive local galaxies. moreover,we find that bulge-dominated objects in particular show evidence for a growingbimodality in the size-mass relation with increasing z, and by z &gt; 2 thecompact bulges display effective radii a factor ~4 smaller than localellipticals of comparable mass. these trends appear to extend to the bulgecomponents of disk-dominated galaxies, and vice versa. we also find that, whilesuch massive galaxies at low z are bulge-dominated, at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 they arepredominantly mixed bulge+disk systems, and by z &gt; 2 they are mostlydisk-dominated. the majority of the disk-dominated galaxies are activelyforming stars, but this is also true for many of the bulge-dominated systems.interestingly, however, while most of the quiescent galaxies arebulge-dominated, we find that a significant fraction (25-40%) of the mostquiescent galaxies have disk-dominated morphologies. thus, while our resultsshow that the massive galaxy population is undergoing dramatic changes at thiscrucial epoch, they also suggest that the physical mechanisms which quenchstar-formation activity are not simply connected to those responsible for themorphological transformation of massive galaxies into present-day giantellipticals.

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

1208.3464	the properties of (sub)millimetre-selected galaxies as revealed by  candels hst wfc3/ir imaging in goods-south	we have exploited the hst candels wfc3/ir imaging to study the properties of(sub-)mm galaxies in goods-south. after using the deep radio and spitzerimaging to identify galaxy counterparts for the (sub-)mm sources, we have usedthe new candels data in two ways. first, we have derived improved photometricredshifts and stellar masses, confirming that the (sub-)mm galaxies are massive(&lt;m*&gt;=2.2x10^11 m_solar) galaxies at z=1-3. second, we have exploited the depthand resolution of the wfc3/ir imaging to determine the sizes and morphologiesof the galaxies at rest-frame optical wavelengths, fitting two-dimensionalaxi-symmetric sersic models. crucially, the wfc3/ir h-band imaging enablesmodelling of the mass-dominant galaxy, rather than the blue high-surfacebrightness features which often dominate optical (rest-frame uv) images of(sub-)mm galaxies, and can confuse visual morphological classification. as aresult of this analysis we find that &gt;95% of the rest-frame optical light inalmost all of the (sub-)mm galaxies is well-described by either a singleexponential disk, or a multiple-component system in which the dominantconstituent is disk-like. we demonstrate that this conclusion is consistentwith the results of high-quality ground-based k-band imaging, and explain why.the massive disk galaxies which host luminous (sub-)mm emission are reasonablyextended (r_e=4 kpc), consistent with the sizes of other massive star-formingdisks at z~2. in many cases we find evidence of blue clumps within the sources,with the mass-dominant disk becoming more significant at longer wavelengths.finally, only a minority of the sources show evidence for a major galaxy-galaxyinteraction. taken together, these results support the view that most (sub-)mmgalaxies at z~2 are simply the most extreme examples of normal star-forminggalaxies at that era.

1208.5780	moons: a multi-object optical and near-infrared spectrograph for the vlt	moons is a new conceptual design for a multi-object optical and near-infraredspectrograph for the very large telescope (vlt), selected by eso for a phase astudy. the baseline design consists of 1000 fibers deployable over a field ofview of 500 square arcmin, the largest patrol field offered by the nasmythfocus at the vlt. the total wavelength coverage is 0.8um-1.8um and tworesolution modes: medium resolution and high resolution. in the mediumresolution mode (r=4,000-6,000) the entire wavelength range 0.8um-1.8um isobserved simultaneously, while the high resolution mode covers simultaneouslythree selected spectral regions: one around the caii triplet (at r=8,000) tomeasure radial velocities, and two regions at r=20,000 one in the j-band andone in the h-band, for detailed measurements of chemical abundances. the graspof the 8.2m very large telescope (vlt) combined with the large multiplex andwavelength coverage of moons - extending into the near-ir - will provide theobservational power necessary to study galaxy formation and evolution over theentire history of the universe, from our milky way, through the redshift desertand up to the epoch of re-ionization at z&gt;8-9. at the same time, the highspectral resolution mode will allow astronomers to study chemical abundances ofstars in our galaxy, in particular in the highly obscured regions of the bulge,and provide the necessary follow-up of the gaia mission. such characteristicsand versatility make moons the long-awaited workhorse near-ir mos for the vlt,which will perfectly complement optical spectroscopy performed by flames andvimos.

1212.0860	the uv continua and inferred stellar populations of galaxies at z ~ 7 -  9 revealed by the hubble ultra deep field 2012 campaign	we use the new ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra-deepfield (hudf) provided by our udf12 hst wfc3/ir campaign to explore therest-frame uv properties of galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 6.5. we present the firstunbiased measurement of the average uv power-law index, beta, for faintgalaxies at z ~ 7, the first meaningful measurements of beta at z ~ 8, andtentative estimates for a new sample of galaxies at z ~ 9. utilising galaxyselection in the new f140w imaging to minimize colour bias, and applying bothcolour and power-law estimators of beta, we find beta = -2.1 (+/-0.2) at z ~ 7for galaxies with m_uv ~ -18. this means that the faintest galaxies uncoveredat this epoch have, on average, uv colours no more extreme than those displayedby the bluest star-forming galaxies at low redshift. at z ~ 8 we find a similarvalue, beta = -1.9 (+/-0.3). at z ~ 9, we find beta = -1.8 (+/-0.6),essentially unchanged from z ~ 6 - 7 (albeit highly uncertain). finally, weshow that there is as yet no evidence for a significant intrinsic scatter inbeta within our new, robust z ~ 7 galaxy sample. our results are most easilyexplained by a population of steadily star-forming galaxies with either ~ solarmetallicity and zero dust, or moderately sub-solar (~ 10-20%) metallicity withmodest dust obscuration (a_v ~ 0.1-0.2). this latter interpretation isconsistent with the predictions of a state-of-the-art galaxy-formationsimulation, which also suggests that a significant population of very-lowmetallicity, dust-free galaxies with beta ~ -2.5 may not emerge until m_uv &gt;-16, a regime likely to remain inaccessible until the james webb spacetelescope.

0712.3613	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - ix: the  environment, mass and redshift dependence of star formation	we present a comparison between the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) at 450 and 850 microns in the lockman hole east with a deep spitzerspace telescope survey at 3.6-24 microns conducted in guaranteed time. usingstacking analyses we demonstrate a striking correspondence between the galaxiescontributing the submm extragalactic background light, with those likely todominate the backgrounds at spitzer wavelengths. using a combination brizk plusspitzer photometric redshifts, we show that at least a third of thespitzer-identified submm galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 appear to reside in overdensitieswhen the density field is smoothed at 0.5-2 mpc comoving diameters, supportingthe high-redshift reversal of the local star formation - galaxy densityrelation. we derive the dust-shrouded cosmic star formation history of galaxiesas a function of assembled stellar masses. for model stellar masses &lt;10^11msun, this peaks at lower redshifts than the ostensible z~2.2 maximum for submmpoint sources, adding to the growing consensus for ``downsizing'' in starformation. our surveys are also consistent with ``downsizing'' in massassembly. both the mean star formation rates &lt;dm/dt&gt; and specific starformation rates &lt;(1/m)dm/dt&gt; are in striking disagreement with somesemi-analytic predictions from the millenium simulation. the discrepancy couldeither be resolved with a top-heavy initial mass function, or a significantcomponent of the submm flux heated by the interstellar radiation field.

1304.7276	high velocity outflows from young star-forming galaxies in the ukidss  ultra-deep survey	we investigate galactic-scale outflows in the redshift range 0.71 &lt; z &lt; 1.63,using 413 k-band selected galaxies observed in the spectroscopic follow-up ofthe ukidss ultra-deep survey (udsz). the galaxies have an average stellar massof ~10^9.5 solar masses and span a wide range in rest-frame colours,representing typical star-forming galaxies at this epoch. we stack the spectraby various galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [oii] equivalent width,star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate and rest-frame spectralindices. we find that outflows are present in virtually all spectral stacks,with velocities ranging from 100-1000 km s^-1, indicating that large-scaleoutflowing winds are a common property at these redshifts. the highest velocityoutflows (&gt;500 km s^-1) are found in galaxies with the highest stellar massesand the youngest stellar populations. our findings suggest that high velocitygalactic outflows are mostly driven by star-forming processes rather than agn,with implied mass outflow rates comparable to the rates of star formation. suchbehaviour is consistent with models required to reproduce the high-redshiftmass-metallicity relation.

1306.6333	chronos: a nir spectroscopic galaxy survey. from the formation of  galaxies to the peak of activity	chronos is our response to esa's call for white papers to define the sciencefor the future l2, l3 missions. chronos targets the formation and evolution ofgalaxies, by collecting the deepest nir spectroscopic data, from the formationof the first galaxies at z~10 to the peak of formation activity at z~1-3. thestrong emission from the atmospheric background makes this type of surveyimpossible from a ground-based observatory. the spectra of galaxies representthe equivalent of a dna fingerprint, containing information about the pasthistory of star formation and chemical enrichment. the proposed survey willallow us to dissect the formation process of galaxies including the timescalesof quenching triggered by star formation or agn activity, the effect ofenvironment, the role of infall/outflow processes, or the connection betweenthe galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes. to provide these data,the mission requires a 2.5m space telescope optimised for a campaign of verydeep nir spectroscopy. a combination of a high multiplex and very longintegration times will result in the deepest, largest, high-qualityspectroscopic dataset of galaxies from z=1 to 12, spanning the history of theuniverse, from 400 million to 6 billion years after the big bang, i.e. coveringthe most active half of cosmic history.

0802.0497	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - vii. optical/ir  photometry and stellar masses of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present estimates of the photometric redshifts, stellar masses and starformation histories of sources in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades). this paper describes the 60 scuba sources detected in the lockmanhole covering an area of ~320 square arcmin. using photometry spanning the bband to 8um, we find that the average scuba source forms a significant fractionof its stars in an early period of star formation and that most of theremainder forms in a shorter more intense burst around the redshift it isobserved. this trend does not vary significantly with source redshift but theexact ratio of early to late mass is quite sensitive to the way extinction istreated in the modelling. however, the sources show a clear increase in stellarmass with redshift, consistent with downsizing. in terms of sed types, only twoout of the 51 sources we have obtained photometric redshifts for are best fitby a quasar-like spectral energy distribution, with approximately 80 per centof the sources being best fit with late-type spectra (sc, im and starburst). byincluding photometry at 850um, we conclude that the average scuba source isforming stars at a rate somewhere between 6 and 30 times the rate implied fromthe rest-frame optical in a dust obscured burst and that this burst creates15-65 per cent of the total stellar mass. using a simplistic calculation, weestimate from the average star formation history that between one in five andone in 15 bright (l_* +2 mag &lt; l_optical &lt; l_* -1 mag) galaxies in the fieldover the interval 0 &lt; z &lt; 3 will at some point in their lifetime experience asimilar energetic dusty burst of star formation. finally, we compute theevolution of the star formation rate density and find it peaks around z=2.

1311.5761	rest-frame ultra-violet spectra of massive galaxies at z=3: evidence of  high-velocity outflows	galaxy formation models invoke the presence of strong feedback mechanismsthat regulate the growth of massive galaxies at high redshifts. in this paperwe aim to: (1) confirm spectroscopically the redshifts of a sample of massivegalaxies selected with photometric redshifts z &gt; 2.5; (2) investigate theproperties of their stellar and interstellar media; (3) detect the presence ofoutflows, and measure their velocities. to achieve this, we analysed deep,high-resolution (r~2000) fors2 rest-frame uv spectra for 11 targets. weconfirmed that 9 out of 11 have spectroscopic redshifts z &gt; 2.5. we alsoserendipitously found two mask fillers at redshift z &gt; 2.5, which originallywere assigned photometric redshifts 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. in the four highest-qualityspectra we derived outflow velocities by fitting the absorption line profileswith models including multiple dynamical components. we found stronglyasymmetric, high-ionisation lines, from which we derived outflow velocitiesranging from 480 to 1518 km/s. the two galaxies with highest velocity showsigns of agn. we revised the spectral energy distribution fitting u-bandthrough 8 micron photometry, including the analysis of a power-law componentsubtraction to identify the possible presence of active galactic nuclei (agn).the revised stellar masses of all but one of our targets are &gt;1e10 msun, withfour having stellar masses &gt; 5e10 msun. three galaxies have a significantpower-law component in their spectral energy distributions, which indicatesthat they host agn. we conclude that massive galaxies are characterised bysignificantly higher velocity outflows than the typical lyman break galaxies atz ~ 3. the incidence of high-velocity outflows (~40% within our sample) is alsomuch higher than among massive galaxies at z &lt; 1, which is consistent with thepowerful star formation and nuclear activity that most massive galaxies displayat z &gt; 2.

1312.1173	a reassessment of the redshift distribution and physical properties of  luminous (sub-)millimetre galaxies	motivated by the current controversy over the redshift distribution andphysical properties of luminous (sub-)mm sources, we have undertaken a newstudy of the brightest sample of unlensed (sub-)mm sources with pre-almainterferometric follow-up in the cosmos field. exploiting the very latestmulti-frequency supporting data, we find that this sample displays a redshiftdistribution indistinguishable from that of the lensed sources uncovered withthe south pole telescope (spt), with z_median ~ 3.5. we also find that, overthe redshift range z ~ 2-6 the median stellar mass of the most luminous(sub-)mm sources is m_* ~ 3 * 10^11 m_odot, yielding a typical specificstar-formation rate ssfr ~ 3 gyr^-1. consistent with recent alma and smastudies, we confirm that source blending is not a serious issue in the study ofluminous (sub-)mm sources uncovered by ground-based, single-dish surveys; only~ 10-15% of bright (s_850 ~ 5 - 10 mjy) (sub-)mm sources arise from significant(i.e. &gt;20%) blends, and so our conclusions are largely unaffected by whether weadopt the original single-dish mm/sub-mm flux-densities/positions, or theinterferometric data. our results suggest that apparent disagreements over theredshift distribution of (sub-)mm sources are a result of "down-sizing" indust-enshrouded star-formation, consistent with existing knowledge of thestar-formation histories of massive galaxies. they also indicate that extremestar-forming galaxies at high redshift are, on average, subject to the samestar-formation rate-limiting processes as less luminous objects, and lie on the"main sequence" of star-forming galaxies at z&gt;3.

1405.1736	the bulge-disk decomposed evolution of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  candels	we present the results of a new and improved study of the morphological andspectral evolution of massive galaxies over the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3. ouranalysis is based on a bulge-disk decomposition of 396 galaxies withmstar&gt;10^11 msolar from the candels wfc3/ir imaging within the cosmos andukidss uds survey fields. we find that, by modelling the h(160) image of eachgalaxy with a combination of a de vaucouleurs bulge (sersic index n=4) and anexponential disk (n=1), we can then lock all derived morphological parametersfor the bulge and disk components, and successfully reproduce theshorter-wavelength j(125), i(814), v(606) hst images simply by floating themagnitudes of the two components. this then yields sub-divided 4-band hstphotometry for the bulge and disk components which, with no additional priors,is well described by spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution. armed withthis information we are able to properly determine the masses andstar-formation rates for the bulge and disk components, and find that: i) fromz=3 to z=1 the galaxies move from disk-dominated to increasinglybulge-dominated, but very few galaxies are pure bulges/ellipticals by z=1; ii)while most passive galaxies are bulge-dominated, and most star-forming galaxiesdisk-dominated, 18+/-5% of passive galaxies are disk-dominated, and 11+/-3% ofstar-forming galaxies are bulge-dominated, a result which needs to be explainedby any model purporting to connect star-formation quenching with morphologicaltransformations; iii) there exists a small but significant population of purepassive disks, which are generally flatter than their star-forming counterparts(whose axial ratio distribution peaks at b/a~0.7); iv) flatter/larger disksre-emerge at the highest star-formation rates, consistent with recent studiesof sub-mm galaxies, and with the concept of a maximum surface-density forstar-formation activity.

1405.5221	the decomposed bulge and disk size-mass relations of massive galaxies at  1&lt;z&lt;3 in candels	we have constructed a mass-selected sample of mstar&gt;10^11msolar galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels uds and cosmos fields and have decomposed these systemsinto their separate bulge and disk components according to their h(160)-bandmorphologies. by extending this analysis to multiple bands we have been able toconduct individual bulge and disk component sed fitting which has provided uswith stellar-mass and star-formation rate estimates for the separate bulge anddisk components. these have been combined with size measurements to explore theevolution of these massive high-redshift galaxies. by utilising the newdecomposed stellar-mass estimates, we confirm that the bulge components displaya stronger size evolution than the disks. this can be seen from both thefraction of bulge components which lie below the local relation and the mediansizes of the bulge components, where the bulges are a median factor of2.93+/-0.32 times smaller than similarly massive local galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and3.41+/-0.58 smaller at 2&lt;z&lt;3; for the disks the corresponding factors are1.65+/-0.14 and 1.99+/-0.25. moreover, by splitting our sample into the passiveand star-forming bulge and disk sub-populations and examining their sizes as afraction of their present-day counter-parts, we find that the star-forming andpassive bulges are equally compact, star-forming disks are larger, while thepassive disks have intermediate sizes. this trend is not evident whenclassifying galaxy morphology on the basis of single-sersic fits and adoptingthe overall star-formation rates. finally, by evolving the star-formationhistories of the passive disks back to the redshifts when the passive diskswere last active, we show that the passive and star-forming disks haveconsistent sizes at the relevant epoch. these trends need to be reproduced byany mechanisms which attempt to explain the morphological evolution ofgalaxies.

1409.7082	the hawk-i uds and goods survey (hugs): survey design and deep k-band  number counts	we present the results of a new, ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging surveyexecuted with the hawk-i imager at the eso vlt, of which we make all the datapublic. this survey, named hugs (hawk-i uds and goods survey), provides deep,high-quality imaging in the k and y bands over the candels uds and goods-southfields. we describe here the survey strategy, the data reduction process, andthe data quality. hugs delivers the deepest and highest quality k-band imagesever collected over areas of cosmological interest, and ideally complements thecandels data set in terms of image quality and depth. the seeing is exceptionaland homogeneous, confined to the range 0.38"-0.43". in the deepest region ofthe goods-s field, (which includes most of the hudf) the k-band exposure timeexceeds 80 hours of integration, yielding a 1-sigma magnitude limit of ~28.0mag/sqarcsec. in the uds field the survey matches the shallower depth of thecandels images reaching a 1-sigma limit per sq.arcsec of ~27.3mag in the k bandand ~28.3mag in the y-band, we show that the hugs observations are well matchedto the depth of the candels wfc3/ir data, since the majority of even thefaintest galaxies detected in the candels h-band images are also detected inhugs. we present the k-band galaxy number counts produced by combining the hugsdata from the two fields. we show that the slope of the number counts dependssensitively on the assumed distribution of galaxy sizes, with potential impacton the estimated extra-galactic background light (abridged).

0804.3471	a new measurement of the evolving near-infrared galaxy luminosity  function out to z~4: a continuing challenge to theoretical models of galaxy  formation	we present the most accurate measurement to date of cosmological evolution ofthe near-infrared galaxy luminosity function, from the local universe out toz~4. the analysis is based on a large and highly complete sample of galaxiesselected from the first data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey.exploiting a master catalogue of k- and z-band selected galaxies over an areaof 0.7 square degrees, we analyse a sample of ~50,000 galaxies, all withreliable photometry in 16-bands from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.the unique combination of large area and depth provided by the ultra deepsurvey allows us to trace the evolution of the k-band luminosity function withunprecedented accuracy. in particular, via a maximum likelihood analysis weobtain a simple parameterization for the luminosity function and itscosmological evolution, including both luminosity and density evolution, whichprovides an excellent description of the data from z =0 up to z~4. we finddifferential evolution for galaxies dependent on galaxy luminosity, revealingonce again the ``down-sizing behaviour'' of galaxy formation. finally, wecompare our results with the predictions of the latest theoretical models ofgalaxy formation, based both on semi-analytical prescriptions, and on fullhydrodynamical simulations.

0805.1335	the luminosity function, halo masses and stellar masses of luminous  lyman-break galaxies at redshifts 5&lt;z&lt;6	we present the results of a study of a large sample of luminous (z'{ab}&lt;26)lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the redshift interval 4.7&lt;z&lt;6.3, selected from acontiguous 0.63 square degree area covered by the ukidss ultra deep survey(uds) and the subaru xmm-newton survey (sxds). utilising the large areacoverage and the excellent available optical+nearir data, we use a photometricredshift analysis to derive a new, robust, measurement of the bright end (l&gt;l*)of the uv-selected luminosity function at high redshift. when combined withliterature studies of the fainter lbg population, our new sample providesimproved constraints on the luminosity function of redshift 5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs over theluminosity range 0.1l*&lt;l&lt;10l*. a maximum likelihood analysis returnsbest-fitting schechter function parameters of m*_1500=-20.73, phi*=0.0009mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.66 for the luminosity function at z=5, and m*_1500 =-20.04, phi*=0.0018 mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.71 at z=6. in addition, an analysis ofthe angular clustering properties of our lbg sample demonstrates that luminous5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs are strongly clustered (r_0 = 8.1 mpc), and are consistent with theoccupation of dark matter halos with masses of ~10^{11.5-12.0} msun. moreover,by stacking the available multi-wavelength imaging data for the high-redshiftlbgs it is possible to place useful constraints on their typical stellar mass.the results of this analysis suggest that luminous lbgs at 5&lt;z&lt;6 have anaverage stellar mass of ~10^10 msun, consistent with the results of theclustering analysis assuming plausible values for the ratio of stellar to darkmatter. finally, by combining our luminosity function results with those of thestacking analysis we derive estimates of ~1x10^7 msun mpc^-3 and 4x10^6 msunmpc^-3 for the stellar mass density at z~5 and z~6 respectively.

astro-ph;0301526	the radio loud / radio quiet dichotomy: news from the 2df qso redshift  survey	we present a detailed analysis of a sample of radio-detected quasars,obtained by matching together objects from the first and 2df quasar redshiftsurveys. the dataset consists of 113 sources, spanning a redshift range 0.3 &lt; z&lt; 2.2, with optical magnitudes 18.25 &lt; b_j &lt; 20.85 and radio fluxes s_{1.4 ghz}&lt; 1 mjy. these objects exhibit properties such as redshift and colourdistribution in full agreement with those derived for the whole quasarpopulation, suggestive of an independence of the mechanism(s) controlling thebirth and life-time of quasars of their level of radio emission. the longdebated question of radio-loud (rl)/radio-quiet (rq) dichotomy is theninvestigated for the combined first-2df and first-lbqs sample, since theypresent similar selection criteria. we find the fraction of radio detections toincrease with magnitude from &lt; 3% at the faintest levels up to 20% for thebrightest sources. the classical rl/rq dichotomy, in which the distribution ofradio-to-optical ratios and/or radio luminosities shows a lack of sources, isruled out by our analysis. we also find no tight relationship between opticaland radio luminosities for sources in the considered sample, result that tendsto exclude the mass of the quasar black hole as the physical quantityassociated to the level of radio emission.

astro-ph;0306415	is there a dichotomy in the radio loudness distribution of quasars?	we present a new approach to tackle the issue of radio loudness in quasars.we constrain a (simple) prescription for the intrinsic distribution ofradio-to-optical ratios by comparing properties of monte carlo simulatedsamples with those of observed optically selected quasars. we find strongevidence for a dependence of the radio luminosity on the optical one, eventhough with a large scatter. the dependence of the fraction of radio loudquasars on apparent and absolute optical magnitudes results in a selectioneffect related to the radio and optical limits of current surveys. theintrinsic distribution of the radio-to-optical ratios shows a peak at$r^*_{1.4} \sim 0.3$, with only $\simlt 5$ per cent of objects being includedin a high $r^*_{1.4}$ tail which identifies the radio loud regime. no lack ordeficit of sources -- but only a steep transition region -- is present betweenthe radio loud and radio quiet populations at any $r^*_{1.4}$. we brieflydiscuss possible origins for this behaviour (e.g. absence of jets in radioquiet sources, large range of radiative radio efficiency, different life-timesfor the accretion and jet ejection phenomena, ...).

0808.3139	the star-formation history of k-selected galaxies	we have studied the ujy radio properties of k-selected galaxies detected inthe ultra-deep survey portion of ukidss using 610- and 1,400-mhz images fromthe vla and gmrt. these deep radio mosaics, combined with the largest anddeepest k image currently available, allow high-s/n detections of manyk-selected sub-populations, including sbzk and pbzk star-forming and passivegalaxies. we find a strong correlation between the radio and k fluxes and alinear relationship between sfr and k luminosity. we find no evidence, fromeither radio spectral indices or a comparison with submm-derived sfrs, that thefull sample is strongly contaminated by agn. the sbzk and pbzk galaxies havesimilar levels of radio flux, sfr and specific sfr (ssfr) at z &lt; 1.4,suggesting there is strong contamination of the pbzk sample by star-forminggalaxies. at z &gt; 1.4, pbzk galaxies become difficult to detect in the radiostack, though the implied sfrs are still much higher than expected forpassively evolving galaxies. their radio emission may come from low-luminosityagn. eros straddle the passive and star-forming regions of the bzk diagram andalso straddle the two groups in terms of their radio properties. k-bright erosamples are dominated by passive galaxies and faint ero samples contain morestar-forming galaxies. the star-formation history (sfh) from stacking all ksources in the uds agrees well with that derived for other wavebands and otherradio surveys, at least out to z ~ 2. the radio-derived sfh then appears tofall more steeply than that measured at other wavelengths. the ssfr fork-selected sources rises strongly with redshift at all stellar masses, andshows a weak dependence on stellar mass. high- and low-mass galaxies show asimilar decline in ssfr since z ~ 2 (abridged).

astro-ph;0412131	faint radio-loud quasars: clues to their evolution	the quasar sample selected by cross-correlating the first and the 2df quasarredshift surveys allows us to explore, for the first time, the faint end of theradio and optical luminosity functions up to z = 2.2. we find indications (~3\sigma) of a negative evolution for these faint sources at z &gt; 1.8, both inradio and optical bands. this corresponds to a decrement in the space densityof faint quasars of about a factor 2 at z=2.2 and confirms the presence of adifferential evolution for the population of radio-active quasars. the faintend of both luminosity functions flattens and the comparison with the (optical)number density of the whole quasar population supports a dependence of thefraction of radio detected quasars on the optical luminosity. a progressivedecrease in the fraction of quasars in the whole radio source population can beconsistently accounted for within the `receding torus' scenario. the populationof low luminosity quasars, which the first-2df detects, appears to depart fromthe `classical' scheme for radio-loud quasars.

astro-ph;0504600	dynamical and photometric imprints of feedback processes on the early  evolution of e/s0 galaxies	we show that the observed velocity dispersion function of e/s0 galaxiesmatches strikingly well the distribution function of virial velocities ofmassive halos virializing at z &gt; 1.5, as predicted by the standard hierarchicalclustering scenario in a \lambdacdm cosmology, for a constant ratio sigma/v_vir= 0.55 \pm 0.05, close to the value expected at virialization if it typicallyoccurred at z &gt; 3. this strongly suggests that dissipative processes and latermerging events had little impact on the matter density profile. adopting theabove sigma/v_vir ratio, the observed relationships between photometric anddynamical properties which define the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies,such as the luminosity-sigma (faber-jackson) and the luminosity-effectiveradius relations, as well as the m_bh-sigma relation, are nicely reproduced.their shapes turn out to be determined by the mutual feedback of star-formation(and supernova explosions)and nuclear activity, along the lines discussed bygranato et al. (2004). to our knowledge, this is the first semi-analytic modelfor which simultaneous fits of the fundamental plane relations and of theepoch-dependent luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies have been presented.

astro-ph;0511571	further constraints on the evolution of ks-selected galaxies in the  goods/cdfs field	we have selected and analysed the properties of a sample of 2905 ks&lt;21.5galaxies in ~ 131 sq.arcmin of the great observatories origins deep survey(goods) chandra deep field south (cdfs), to obtain further constraints on theevolution of ks-selected galaxies with respect to the results already obtainedin previous studies. we made use of the public deep multiwavelength imagingfrom the optical b through the infrared (ir) 4.5 micron bands, in conjunctionwith available spectroscopic and combo17 data in the cdfs, to construct anoptimised redshift catalogue for our galaxy sample. we computed the ks-band lfand determined that its characteristic magnitude has a substantial brighteningand a decreasing total density from z=0 to &lt;z&gt;=2.5. we also analysed thecolours and number density evolution of galaxies with different stellar masses.within our sample, and in contrast to what is observed for less massivesystems, the vast majority (~ 85-90%) of the most massive (m&gt;2.5x10^11 msun)local galaxies appear to be in place before redshift z ~1. around 65-70% of thetotal assemble between redshifts z=1 and z=3 and most of them display extremelyred colours, suggesting that plausible star formation in these very massivesystems should mainly proceed in obscured, short-timescale bursts. theremaining fraction (up to ~ 20%) could be in place at even higher redshiftsz=3-4, pushing the first epoch of formation of massive galaxies beyond thelimits of current near-ir surveys.

astro-ph;0606116	the discovery of a significant sample of massive galaxies at redshifts 5  &lt; z &lt; 6 in the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we have exploited the large area coverage of the combined ukidss ultra deepsurvey (uds) and subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) to search for brightlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z &gt;= 5. using the availableoptical+near-infrared photometry to efficiently exclude low-redshiftcontaminants, we identify nine z &gt;= 5 lbg candidates brighter than z'=25(ab)within the 0.6 square degree overlap region between the uds early data release(edr) and the optical coverage of the sxds. accounting for selectionincompleteness, we estimate the corresponding surface density of z &gt;= 5 lbgswith z'&lt;=25(ab) to be 0.005+/-0.002 per square arcmin. modelling of theoptical+near-infrared photometry constrains the candidates' redshifts to lie inthe range 5.1 &lt; z &lt; 5.9, and provides estimates for their stellar masses.although the stellar mass estimates are individually uncertain, a stackinganalysis suggests that the typical stellar mass of the lbg candidates is&gt;~5x10^10 msun which, if confirmed, places them amongst the most massivegalaxies currently known at z &gt;= 5. it is found that lambda cdm structureformation can produce sufficient numbers of dark matter halos at z &gt;= 5 toaccommodate our estimated number density of massive lbgs for plausible valuesof sigma_8 and the ratio of stellar to dark matter. moreover, it is found thatrecent galaxy formation models can also account for the existence of suchmassive galaxies at z &gt;= 5. finally, no evidence is found for the existence oflbgs with stellar masses in excess of ~3x10^11 msun at this epoch, despite thelarge co-moving volume surveyed.

astro-ph;0606192	a systematic search for very massive galaxies at z &gt; 4	motivated by the claimed discovery of a very massive galaxy (hudf-jd2;m~5x10^11 msun) at extreme redshift (z = 6.5) within the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf) (mobasher et al. 2005), we have completed a systematic search forcomparably massive galaxies with z &gt; 4 among the 2688 galaxies in our k &lt; 23.5(ab) catalogue within the cdfs/goods-south field. this search was conductedusing redshift estimates based on the recently-completed, uniquely-deep 11-bandimaging in this 125 square arcmin field, ~25 times larger than the nicmos hudf.initial spectral fitting, based on published catalogue sextractor photometry,led us to conclude that at least 2669 of the galaxies in our sample lie at z &lt;4. we carried out a detailed investigation of the 19 remaining z &gt; 4candidates, performing aperture photometry on all images, and includingmarginal detections and formal non-detections in the fitting process. this ledto the rejection of a further 13 galaxies to lower redshift. moreover,subjecting hudf-jd2 to the same analysis, we find that it lies at z ~ 2.2,rather than the extreme redshift favoured by mobasher et al. (2005). the 6remaining candidates appear to be credible examples of galaxies in the redshiftrange z = 4 - 6, with plausible stellar ages. however, refitting with allowancefor extreme values of extinction we find that, even for these objects,statistically acceptable solutions can be found at z &lt; 3. moreover, therecently-released spitzer mips imaging in goods-south has revealed that 5 ofour 6 final z &gt; 4 candidates are detected at 24 microns. we conclude that thereis no convincing evidence for any galaxy with m &gt; 3 x 10^11 msun, and z &gt; 4within the goods-south field (abridged).

astro-ph;0606297	on the radio properties of the highest redshift quasars	we present deep radio observations of the most distant complete quasar sampledrawn from the sloan digital sky survey. combining our new data with those fromliterature we obtain a sample which is ~100 per cent complete down to s_1.4ghz= 60 \mu jy over the redshift range 3.8 &lt; z &lt; 5. the fraction of radiodetections is relatively high (~43 per cent), similar to what observed locallyin bright optical surveys. even though the combined radio and opticalproperties of quasars remain overall unchanged from z ~ 5 to the localuniverse, there is some evidence for a slight over-abundance of radio-loudsources at the highest redshifts when compared with the lower-z regime.  exploiting the deep radio vla observations we present the first attempt todirectly derive the radio luminosity function of bright quasars at z ~ 4. theunique depth -- both in radio and optical -- allows us to thoroughly explorethe population of optically bright fr~ii quasars up to z ~ 5 and opens a windowon the behaviour of the brightest fr~i sources. a close investigation of thespace density of radio loud quasars also suggests a differential evolution,with the more luminous sources showing a less pronounced cut-off at high z whencompared with the less luminous ones.

astro-ph;0608624	galaxy clusters at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.4 in the ukidss ultra deep survey early  data release	we present the first cluster catalogue extracted from the ukirt infrared deepsky survey early data release. the catalogue is created using ukidss ultra deepsurvey infrared j and k data combined with 3.6 micro-m and 4.5 micro-m spitzerbands and optical bvri'z' imaging from the subaru telescope over 0.5 squaredegrees in the subaru xmm-newton deep field. we have created a newcluster-detection algorithm, based on the friends-of-friends and voronoitessellation methods, which utilises probability distribution functions derivedfrom a photometric redshift analysis. we employ mock catalogues to understandthe selection effects and contamination associated with the algorithm. thecluster catalogue contains 13 clusters at redshifts 0.61 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.39 withluminosities 10 l* &lt;~ l_tot &lt;~ 50 l*, corresponding to masses 5 x 10^13 m_sun&lt;~ m_cluster &lt;~ 3 x 10^14 m_sun for (m/m_sun) / (l/l_sun) = 75h. the measuredsky surface density of ~ 10 deg^-2 for high-redshift (z=0.5-1.5), massive(&gt;10^14 m_sun) clusters is precisely in line with theoretical predictionspresented by kneissl et al.

astro-ph;0609287	the evolution of the near-ir galaxy luminosity function and colour  bimodality up to z ~ 2 from the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near-infraredgalaxy luminosity function, derived from the analysis of a new sample of\~22,000 k(ab) &lt; 22.5 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 square degrees fromthe early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds). our study hasexploited the multi-wavelength coverage of the uds field provided by the newukidss wfcam k and j-band imaging, the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey and thespitzer-swire survey. the unique combination of large area and depth providedby this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and hasallowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sourcesout to z~2 with good statistical accuracy.  in agreement with previous studies we find that the characteristic luminosityof the near-infrared luminosity function brightens by 1 magnitude between z=0and z~2, while the total density decreases by a factor ~2. using the rest-frame(u-b) colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies, we confirm theclassic luminosity-dependent colour bimodality at z&lt;1. however, the strength ofthe colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, andseems to disappear by z&gt;1.5. due to the large size of our sample we are able toinvestigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxypopulations. it is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies(m_k &lt; -23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sourcesdominate the bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&lt;1. incontrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease inspace density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominatethe bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&gt;1.

0809.2677	the clustering and abundance of star-forming and passive galaxies at $z  \sim 2$	we use the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), currently the deepest panoramicnear infra-red survey, together with deep subaru optical imaging to measure theclustering, number counts and luminosity function of galaxies at $z\sim 2$selected using the bzk selection technique. we find that both star-forming(sbzk) and passive (pbzk) galaxies, to a magnitude limit of $k_{ab} &lt; 23$, arestrongly clustered. the passive galaxies are the most strongly clusteredpopulation, with scale lengths of $r_0 = 15.0^{+1.9}_{-2.2}$h$^{-1}$mpccompared with $r_0 = 6.75^{+0.34}_{-0.37}$h$^{-1}$mpc for star-forminggalaxies. the direct implication is that passive galaxies inhabit the mostmassive dark-matter halos, and are thus identified as the progenitors of themost massive galaxies at the present day. in addition, the pbzks exhibit asharp flattening and potential turn-over in their number counts, in agreementwith other recent studies. this plateau cannot be explained by the effects ofincompleteness. we conclude that only very massive galaxies are undergoingpassive evolution at this early epoch, consistent with the downsizing scenariofor galaxy evolution. assuming a purely passive evolution for the pbzks fromtheir median redshift to the present day, their luminosity function suggeststhat only $\sim 2.5 %$ of present day massive ellipticals had a pbzk as a mainprogenitor.
