0901.4372	subaru weak lensing measurements of four strong lensing clusters: are  lensing clusters over-concentrated?	we derive radial mass profiles of four strong lensing selected clusters whichshow prominent giant arcs (abell 1703, sdss j1446+3032, sdss j1531+3414, andsdss j2111-0115), by combining detailed strong lens modeling with weak lensingshear measured from deep subaru suprime-cam images. weak lensing signals aredetected at high significance for all four clusters, whose redshifts range fromz=0.28 to 0.64. we demonstrate that adding strong lensing information withknown arc redshifts significantly improves constraints on the mass densityprofile, compared to those obtained from weak lensing alone. while the massprofiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in n-body simulationsof the lcdm model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrallyconcentrated (the concentration parameters c_vir \sim 8) than theoreticalpredictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrationsinherent in lensing selected samples. our results are consistent with previousstudies which similarly detected a concentration excess, and increases thetotal number of clusters studied with the combined strong and weak lensingtechnique to ten. combining our sample with previous work, we find thatclusters with larger einstein radii are more anomalously concentrated. we alsopresent a detailed model of the lensing cluster a1703 with constraints frommultiple image families, and find the dark matter inner density profile to becuspy with the slope consistent with -1, in agreement with expectations.

0903.2478	galaxy clusters in formation: determining the age of the red-sequence in  optical and x-ray clusters at z~1 with hst	using deep two-band imaging from the hubble space telescope, we measure thecolor-magnitude relations (cmr) of e/s0 galaxies in a set of 9optically-selected clusters principally from the red-sequence cluster survey(rcs) at 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.23. we find that the mean scatter in the cmr in theobserved frame of this set of clusters is 0.049 +/- 0.008, as compared to 0.031+/- 0.007 in a similarly imaged and identically analyzed x-ray sample atsimilar redshifts. single-burst stellar population models of the cmr scattersuggest that the e/s0 population in these rcs clusters truncated theirstar-formation at z~1.6, some 0.9 gyrs later than their x-ray e/s0 counterpartswhich were truncated at z~2.1. the notion that this is a manifestation of thediffering evolutionary states of the two populations of cluster galaxies issupported by comparison of the fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies found inthe two samples which shows that optically-selected clusters contain a smallerfraction of e/s0 galaxies at the their cores

1003.0030	two lensed z~3 lyman break galaxies discovered in the sdss giant arcs  survey	we report the discovery of two strongly-lensed z ~ 3 lyman break galaxies(lbgs) discovered as u-band dropouts as part of the sdss giant arcs survey(sgas). the first, sgas j122651.3+215220 at z = 2.9233 is lensed by one ofseveral sub-clusters, sdss j1226+2152, in a complex massive cluster at z =0.43. its (g, r, i) magnitudes are (21.14, 20.60, 20.51) which translate tosurface brightnesses, mu_{g,r,i}, of (23.78, 23.11, 22.81). the second, sgasj152745.1+065219, is an lbg at z = 2.7593 lensed by the foreground sdssj1527+0652 at z = 0.39, with (g, r, z)=(20.90, 20.52, 20.58) andmu_{g,r,z}=(25.15, 24.52, 24.12). moderate resolution spectroscopy confirms theredshifts suggested by photometric breaks, and shows both absorption andemission features typical of lbgs. lens mass models derived from combinedimaging and spectroscopy reveal that sgas j122651.3+215220 is a highlymagnified source (m ~40), while sgas j152745.1+065219 is magnified by no morethan m ~ 15. compared to lbg survey results (steidel et al. 2003), theluminosities and lensing-corrected magnitudes suggest that sgasj122651.3+215220 is among the faintest 20% of lbgs in that sample. sgasj152745.1+065219, on the other hand, appears to be more representative of theaverage lbg, similar to the "cosmic eye".

1005.2621	a bright, spatially extended lensed galaxy at z = 1.7 behind the cluster  rcs2 032727-132623	we present the discovery of an extremely bright and extended lensed sourcefrom the second red sequence cluster survey (rcs2). rcsga 032727-132609 isspectroscopically confirmed as a giant arc and counter-image of a backgroundgalaxy at $z=1.701$, strongly-lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster rcs2032727-132623 at $z=0.564$. the giant arc extends over $\sim 38$\,\arcsec andhas an integrated $g$-band magnitude of 19.15, making it $\sim 20$ times largerand $\sim 4$ times brighter than the prototypical lensed galaxy ms1512-cb58.this is the brightest distant lensed galaxy in the universe known to date. itslocation in the `redshift desert' provides unique opportunities to connectbetween the large samples of galaxies known at $z\sim3$ and $z\sim1$. we havecollected photometry in 9 bands, ranging from $u$ to $k_s$, which denselysample the rest-frame uv and optical light, including the age-sensitive4000\aa\ break. a lens model is constructed for the system, and results in arobust total magnification of $2.04 \pm 0.16$ for the counter-image; weestimate an average magnification of $17.2 \pm 1.4$ for the giant arc based onthe relative physical scales of the arc and counter-image. fits ofsingle-component spectral energy distribution (sed) models to the photometryresult in a moderately young age, $t = 115 \pm 65$\,myr, small amounts of dust,$e(b-v) \le 0.035$, and an exponentially declining star formation history with\textit{e}-folding time $\tau = 10-100$\,myr. after correcting for the lensingmagnification, we find a stellar mass of$\log(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{m}_\odot)=10.0 \pm 0.1$. allowing for episodic starformation, an underlying old burst could contain up to twice the mass inferredfrom single-component modeling. this stellar mass estimate is consistent withthe average stellar mass of a sample of `bm' galaxies ($1.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.0$) studiedby reddy et al. (2006).

1010.6011	constraining the redshift evolution of first radio sources in rcs1  galaxy clusters	we conduct a statistical analysis of the radio source population in galaxyclusters as a function of redshift by matching radio sources from the faintimages of the radio sky at twenty-centimeters (first) catalog with 618optically-selected galaxy clusters from the first red-sequence cluster survey(rcs1). the number of excess radio sources (above the background level) percluster is 0.14 +/- 0.02 for clusters with 0.35 &lt; z &lt; 0.65 and is 0.10 +/- 0.02for clusters with 0.65 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. the richest clusters in the sample have moreradio sources than clusters with low or intermediate richness. when we divideour sample into bins according to cluster richness, we do not observe anysignificant difference (&gt; 1.5 sigma) in the number of radio sources per unit ofcluster mass for the galaxy clusters with 0.35 &lt; z &lt; 0.65 as compared to thegalaxy clusters with 0.65 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. thus the entire sample can becharacterized by the number of (l(1.4 ghz) &gt; 4.1 x 10^(24) w/hz) radio sourcesper unit (10^14 solar masses) mass, which we measure to be 0.031 +/- 0.004. wefurther characterize the population of galaxy cluster-related radio sourcesthrough visual inspection of the rcs1 images, finding that although the radioactivity of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) also does not strongly evolvebetween our high and low redshift samples, the lower-redshift, richest clustersare more likely to host radio-loud bcgs than the higher-redshift, richestclusters or poorer clusters at the 2-sigma level.

1010.6060	the redshift distribution of giant arcs in the sloan giant arcs survey	we measure the redshift distribution of a sample of 28 giant arcs discoveredas a part of the sloan giant arcs survey (sgas). gemini/gmos-north spectroscopyprovides precise redshifts for 24 arcs, and "redshift desert" constraints forthe remaining four. this is a direct measurement of the redshift distributionof a uniformly selected sample of bright giant arcs, which is an observablethat can be used to inform efforts to predict giant arc statistics. our primarygiant arc sample has a median redshift z=1.821 and nearly two thirds of thearcs - 64% - are sources at z \gtrsim 1.4, indicating that the population ofbackground sources that are strongly lensed into bright giant arcs residesprimarily at high redshift. we also analyze the distribution of redshifts for19 secondary strongly lensed background sources that are not visually apparentin sdss imaging, but were identified in deeper follow-up imaging of the lensingcluster fields. our redshift sample for the secondary sources is notspectroscopically complete, but combining it with our primary giant arc samplesuggests that a large fraction of all background galaxies which are stronglylensed by foreground clusters reside at z \gtrsim 1.4. kolmogorov-smirnov (ks)tests indicate that our well-selected, spectroscopically complete primary giantarc redshift sample can be reproduced with a model distribution that isconstructed from a combination of results from studies of strong lensingclusters in numerical simulations, and observational constraints on the galaxyluminosity function.

1011.6341	sunyaev zel'dovich effect observations of strong lensing galaxy  clusters: probing the over-concentration problem	we have measured the sunyaev zel'dovich (sz) effect for a sample of tenstrong lensing selected galaxy clusters using the sunyaev zel'dovich array(sza). the sza is sensitive to structures on spatial scales of a fewarcminutes, while the strong lensing mass modeling constrains the mass at smallscales (typically &lt; 30"). combining the two provides information about theprojected concentrations of the strong lensing clusters. the einstein radii wemeasure are twice as large as expected given the masses inferred from szscaling relations. a monte carlo simulation indicates that a sample randomlydrawn from the expected distribution would have a larger median einstein radiusthan the observed clusters about 3% of the time. the implied overconcentrationhas been noted in previous studies with smaller samples of lensing clusters. itpersists for this sample, with the caveat that this could result from asystematic effect such as if the gas fractions of the strong lensing clustersare substantially below what is expected.

1107.4093	galaxy-galaxy lensing constraints on the relation between baryons and  dark matter in galaxies in the red sequence cluster survey 2	we present the results of a study of weak gravitational lensing by galaxiesusing imaging data that were obtained as part of the second red sequencecluster survey (rcs2). in order to compare to the baryonic properties of thelenses we focus here on the ~300 square degrees that overlap with the dr7 ofthe sdss. the depth and image quality of the rcs2 enables us to significantlyimprove upon earlier work for luminous galaxies at z&gt;=0.3. comparison withdynamical masses from the sdss shows a good correlation with the lensing massfor early-type galaxies. for low luminosity (stellar mass) early-type galaxieswe find a satellite fraction of ~40% which rapidly decreases to &lt;10% withincreasing luminosity (stellar mass). the satellite fraction of the late-typeshas a value in the range 0-15%. we find that early-types in the range10^10&lt;l_r&lt;10^11.5 lsun have virial masses that are about five times higher thanthose of late-type galaxies and that the mass scales as m_200 \propto l^2.34+0.09 \ -0.16. we also measure the virial mass-to-light ratio, and find forl_200&lt;10^11 lsun a value of m_200/l_200=42+-10 for early-types, which increasesfor higher luminosities to values that are consistent with those observed forgroups and clusters of galaxies. for late-type galaxies we find a lower valueof m_200/l_200=17+-9. our measurements also show that early- and late-typegalaxies have comparable halo masses for stellar masses m_*&lt;10^11 msun, whereasthe virial masses of early-type galaxies are higher for higher stellar masses.finally, we determine the efficiency with which baryons have been convertedinto stars. our results for early-type galaxies suggest a variation inefficiency with a minimum of ~10% for a stellar mass m_*,200=10^12 msun. theresults for the late-type galaxies are not well constrained, but do suggest alarger value.

1109.2594	combined strong and weak lensing analysis of 28 clusters from the sloan  giant arcs survey	we study the mass distribution of a sample of 28 galaxy clusters using strongand weak lensing observations. the clusters are selected via their stronglensing properties as part of the sloan giant arcs survey (sgas) from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). mass modelling of the strong lensing informationfrom the giant arcs is combined with weak lensing measurements from deepsubaru/suprime-cam images to primarily obtain robust constraints on theconcentration parameter and the shape of the mass distribution. we find thatthe concentration c_vir is a steep function of the mass, c_vir \proptom_vir^-0.59\pm0.12, with the value roughly consistent with thelensing-bias-corrected theoretical expectation for high mass (10^15 h^-1 m_sun)clusters. however, the observationally inferred concentration parameters appearto be much higher at lower masses (10^14 h^-1 m_sun), possibly a consequence ofthe modification to the inner density profiles provided by baryon cooling. thesteep mass-concentration relation is also supported from direct stackinganalysis of the tangential shear profiles. in addition, we explore thetwo-dimensional shape of the projected mass distribution by stacking weaklensing shear maps of individual clusters with prior information on theposition angle from strong lens modelling, and find significant evidence for alarge mean ellipticity with the best-fit value of e = 0.47 \pm 0.06 for themass distribution of the stacked sample. we find that the luminous clustermember galaxy distribution traces the overall mass distribution very well,although the distribution of fainter cluster galaxies appears to be moreextended than the total mass.

1202.5267	constraints on the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation at  z=1-2 from lensed galaxies	we present multi-wavelength imaging and near-ir spectroscopy for tengravitationally lensed galaxies at 0.9&lt;z&lt;2.5 selected from a new, large sampleof strong lens systems in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr7. we derivestellar masses from the rest-frame uv to near-ir spectral energy distributions,star formation rates (sfr) from the dust-corrected ha flux, and metallicitiesfrom the [n ii]/ha flux ratio. we combine the lensed galaxies with a sample ofsixty star-forming galaxies from the literature in the same redshift range forwhich measurements of [n ii]/ha have been published. due to the lensingmagnification, the lensed galaxies probe intrinsic stellar masses that are onaverage a factor of 11 lower than have been studied so far at these redshifts.they have specific star formation rates that are an order of magnitude higherthan seen for main-sequence star-forming galaxies at z~2. we measure anevolution of 0.16+/-0.06 dex in the mass-metallicity relation between z~1.4 andz~2.2. in contrast to previous claims, the redshift evolution is smaller at lowstellar masses. we do not see a correlation between metallicity and sfr atfixed stellar mass. the combined sample is in general agreement with the localfundamental relation between metallicity, stellar mass and sfr from mannucci etal. (2010, 2011). using the kennicutt-schmidt law to infer gas fractions, weinvestigate the importance of gas inflows and outflows on the shape of themass-metallicity relation using simple analytical models. this suggests thatthe maiolino et al.(2008) calibration of the [n ii]/ha flux ratio is biasedhigh. we conclude that both an absolute metallicity calibration and directmeasurements of the gas mass are needed to use the observed mass-metallicityrelation to gain insight into the impact of gas flows on the chemical evolutionof galaxies.

1202.5269	sgas 143845.1+145407: a big, cool starburst at redshift 0.816	we present the discovery and a detailed multi-wavelength study of astrongly-lensed luminous infrared galaxy at z=0.816. unlike most known lensedgalaxies discovered at optical or near-infrared wavelengths this lensed sourceis red, r-ks = 3.9 [ab], which the data presented here demonstrate is due toongoing dusty star formation. the overall lensing magnification (a factor of17) facilitates observations from the blue optical through to 500micron, fullycapturing both the stellar photospheric emission as well as the re-processedthermal dust emission. we also present optical and near-ir spectroscopy. theseextensive data show that this lensed galaxy is in many ways typical ofir-detected sources at z~1, with both a total luminosity and size in accordancewith other (albeit much less detailed) measurements in samples of galaxiesobserved in deep fields with the spitzer telescope. its far-infrared spectralenergy distribution is well-fit by local templates that are an order ofmagnitude less luminous than the lensed galaxy; local templates of comparableluminosity are too hot to fit. its size (d~7kpc) is much larger than localluminous infrared galaxies, but in line with sizes observed for such galaxiesat z~1. the star formation appears uniform across this spatial scale. in thissource, the luminosity of which is typical of sources that dominate the cosmicinfrared background, we find that star formation is spatially extended and wellorganised, quite unlike the compact merger-driven starbursts which are typicalfor sources of this luminosity at z~0.

1206.4304	constraints on the shapes of galaxy dark matter haloes from weak  gravitational lensing	we study the shapes of galaxy dark matter haloes by measuring the anisotropyof the weak gravitational lensing signal around galaxies in the secondred-sequence cluster survey (rcs2). we determine the average shear anisotropywithin the virial radius for three lens samples: all galaxies with19&lt;m_r'&lt;21.5, and the `red' and `blue' samples, whose lensing signals aredominated by massive low-redshift early-type and late-type galaxies,respectively. to study the environmental dependence of the lensing signal, weseparate each lens sample into an isolated and clustered part and analyse themseparately. we also measure the azimuthal dependence of the distribution ofphysically associated galaxies around the lens samples. we find that thesesatellites preferentially reside near the major axis of the lenses, andconstrain the angle between the major axis of the lens and the average locationof the satellites to &lt;theta&gt;=43.7 deg +/- 0.3 deg for the `all' lenses,&lt;theta&gt;=41.7 deg +/- 0.5 deg for the `red' lenses and &lt;theta&gt;=42.0 deg +/- 1.4deg for the `blue' lenses. for the `all' sample, we find that the anisotropy ofthe galaxy-mass cross-correlation function &lt;f-f_45&gt;=0.23 +/- 0.12, providingweak support for the view that the average galaxy is embedded in, andpreferentially aligned with, a triaxial dark matter halo. assuming anelliptical navarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, we find that the ratio of thedark matter halo ellipticity and the galaxy ellipticityf_h=e_h/e_g=1.50+1.03-1.01, which for a mean lens ellipticity of 0.25corresponds to a projected halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38+0.26-0.25 if the haloand the lens are perfectly aligned. for isolated galaxies of the `all' sample,the average shear anisotropy increases to &lt;f-f_45&gt;=0.51+0.26-0.25 andf_h=4.73+2.17-2.05, whilst for clustered galaxies the signal is consistent withzero.

1211.0543	stellar mass versus velocity dispersion as tracer of the lensing signal  around bulge-dominated galaxies	we present the results of a weak gravitational lensing analysis to determinewhether the stellar mass or the velocity dispersion is more closely related tothe amplitude of the lensing signal around galaxies - and hence to theprojected distribution of dark matter. the lensing signal on scales smallerthan the virial radius corresponds most closely to the lensing velocitydispersion in the case of a singular isothermal profile, but is on largerscales also sensitive to the clustering of the haloes. we select over 4000 lensgalaxies at a redshift z&lt;0.2 with concentrated (or bulge-dominated) surfacebrightness profiles from the ~300 square degree overlap between thered-sequence cluster survey 2 (rcs2) and the data release 7 (dr7) of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we consider both the spectroscopic velocitydispersion and a model velocity dispersion (a combination of the stellar mass,the size and the sersic index of a galaxy). comparing the model andspectroscopic velocity dispersion we find that they correlate well for galaxieswith concentrated brightness profiles. we find that the stellar mass and thespectroscopic velocity dispersion trace the amplitude of the lensing signal onsmall scales equally well. the model velocity dispersion, however, doessignificantly worse. a possible explanation is that the halo properties thatdetermine the small-scale lensing signal - mainly the total mass - also dependon the structural parameters of galaxies, such as the effective radius andsersic index, but we lack data for a definitive conclusion.

1303.3917	the imacs cluster building survey: iv. the log-normal star formation  history of galaxies	we present here a simple model for the star formation history of galaxiesthat is successful in describing both the star formation rate density overcosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific star formation rates ofgalaxies at the current epoch, and the evolution of this quantity in galaxypopulations to a redshift of z=1. we show first that the cosmic star formationrate density is remarkably well described by a simple log-normal in time. wenext postulate that this functional form for the ensemble is also a reasonabledescription for the star formation histories of individual galaxies. using themeasured specific star formation rates for galaxies at z~0 from paper iii inthis series, we then construct a realisation of a universe populated by suchgalaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal star formation history ofeach galaxy are adjusted to match the specific star formation rates at z~0 aswell as fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic star formation rate density from z=0to z=8. this model predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution ofspecific star formation rates in mass-limited galaxy samples to z=1; this matchis not achieved by other models with a different functional form for the starformation histories of individual galaxies, but with the same number of degreesof freedom, suggesting that the log-normal form is well matched to the likelyactual histories of individual galaxies. we also impose the specific starformation rate versus mass distributions at higher redshifts from paper iii asconstraints on the model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxiesin the field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediateredshifts. as emphasized in paper iii, starbursts are insufficient...[abridged]

1303.4148	the imacs cluster building survey: v. further evidence for starburst  recycling from quantitative galaxy morphologies	using $j$ and $k_s$ band imaging obtained as part of the imacs clusterbuilding survey (icbs) we measure s\'ersic indices for 2160 field and clustergalaxies at $0.31 &lt; z &lt; 0.54$. using both mass- and magnitude-limited samples,we compare the distributions for spectroscopically determined passive,continuously starforming, starburst, and poststarburst systems and show thatpreviously established spatial and statistical connections between these typesextend to their gross morphologies. outside of cluster cores, we find closestructural ties between starburst and continuously starforming, as well aspoststarburst and passive types, but not between starbursts and poststarbursts.these results independently support two conclusions presented in paper ii ofthis icbs series (dressler et al.): 1) most starbursts are the product of anon-disruptive triggering mechanism that is insensitive to global environment,such as minor-mergers; 2) starbursts and poststarbursts generally representtransient phases in the lives of "normal" starforming and quiescent galaxies,respectively, originating from and returning to these systems in closed"recycling" loops. in this picture, spectroscopically identified poststarburstsconstitute a minority of all recently terminated starbursts, largely ruling-outthe typical starburst as a quenching event in all but the densest environments.

1303.4272	the imacs cluster building survey: ii. spectral evolution of galaxies in  the epoch of cluster assembly	the imacs cluster building survey (icbs) provides spectra of ~2200 galaxies0.31&lt;z&lt;0.54 in 5 rich clusters (r &lt;= 5 mpc) and the field. infalling,dynamically cold groups with tens of members account for approximately half ofthe supercluster population, contributing to a growth in cluster mass of ~100%by today. the icbs spectra distinguish non-starforming (pas) and poststarburst(psb) from starforming galaxies -- continuously starforming (csf) orstarbursts, (sbh or sbo), identified by anomalously strong h-delta absorptionor [o ii] emission. for the infalling cluster groups and similar field groups,we find a correlation between pas+psb fraction and group mass, indicatingsubstantial "preprocessing" through quenching mechanisms that can turnstarforming galaxies into passive galaxies without the unique environment ofrich clusters. sbh + sbo starburst galaxies are common, and they maintain anapproximately constant ratio (sbh+sbo)/csf ~ 25% in all environments -- fromfield, to groups, to rich clusters. similarly, while psb galaxies stronglyfavor denser environments, psb/pas ~ 10-20% for all environments. this result,and their timescale tau &lt; 500 myr, indicates that starbursts are not signaturesof a quenching mechanism that produces the majority of passive galaxies. wesuggest instead that starbursts and poststarbursts signal minor mergers andaccretions, in starforming and passive galaxies, respectively, and that theprincipal mechanisms for producing passive systems are (1) early major mergers,for elliptical galaxies, and (2) later, less violent processes -- such asstarvation and tidal stripping, for s0 galaxies.

1402.7076	the mass-independence of specific star formation rates in galactic disks	the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the sfr "mainsequence"; ${\rm sfr}-m_*$) is not quite unity: specific star formation rates$({\rm sfr}/m_*)$ are weakly-but-significantly anti-correlated with $m_*$. herewe demonstrate that this trend may simply reflect the well-known increase inbulge mass-fractions -- portions of a galaxy not forming stars -- with $m_*$.using a large set of bulge/disk decompositions and sfr estimates derived fromthe sloan digital sky survey, we show that re-normalizing sfr by disk stellarmass $({\rm ssfr_{\rm disk}\equiv sfr}/m_{*,{\rm disk}})$ reduces the$m_*$-dependence of sf efficiency by $\sim0.25$ dex per dex, erasing itentirely in some subsamples. quantitatively, we find $\log {\rmssfr_{disk}}-\log m_*$ to have a slope $\beta_{\rm disk}\in[-0.20,0.00]\pm0.02$(depending on sfr estimator and main sequence definition) for star-forminggalaxies with $m_*\geq10^{10}m_{\odot}$ and bulge mass-fractions$b/t\lesssim0.6$, generally consistent with a pure-disk control sample($\beta_{\rm control}=-0.05\pm0.04$). that $\langle{\rm sfr}/m_{*,{\rmdisk}}\rangle$ is (largely) independent of host mass for star-forming disks hasstrong implications for aspects of galaxy evolution inferred from any ${\rmsfr}-m_*$ relation, including: manifestations of "mass quenching" (bulgegrowth), factors shaping the star-forming stellar mass function (uniform $d\logm_*/dt$ for low-mass, disk-dominated galaxies), and diversity in star formationhistories (dispersion in ${\rm sfr}(m_*,t)$). our results emphasize the need totreat galaxies as composite systems -- not integrated masses -- inobservational and theoretical work.

1407.2251	a thirty kiloparsec chain of "beads on a string" star formation between  two merging early type galaxies in the core of a strong-lensing galaxy  cluster	new hubble space telescope ultraviolet and optical imaging of thestrong-lensing galaxy cluster sdss j1531+3414 (z=0.335) reveals two centrallydominant elliptical galaxies participating in an ongoing major merger. theinteraction is at least somewhat rich in cool gas, as the merger is associatedwith a complex network of nineteen massive superclusters of young stars (orsmall tidal dwarf galaxies) separated by ~1 kpc in projection from one another,combining to an estimated total star formation rate of ~5 solar masses peryear. the resolved young stellar superclusters are threaded by narrow h-alpha,[o ii], and blue excess filaments arranged in a network spanning ~27 kpc acrossthe two merging galaxies. this morphology is strongly reminiscent of thewell-known "beads on a string" mode of star formation observed on kpc-scales inthe arms of spiral galaxies, resonance rings, and in tidal tails betweeninteracting galaxies. nevertheless, the arrangement of this star formationrelative to the nuclei of the two galaxies is difficult to interpret in adynamical sense, as no known "beads on a string" systems associated withkpc-scale tidal interactions exhibit such lopsided morphology relative to themerger participants. in this letter we present the images and follow-upspectroscopy, and discuss possible physical interpretations for the uniquearrangement of the young stellar clusters. while we suggest that thismorphology is likely to be dynamically short-lived, a more quantitativeunderstanding awaits necessary multiwavelength follow-up, including opticalintegral field spectroscopy, alma sub-mm interferometry, and chandra x-rayimaging.

1511.03594	the gini coefficient as a tool for image family idenitification in  strong lensing systems with multiple images	the sample of cosmological strong lensing systems has been steadily growingin recent years and with the advent of the next generation of space-basedsurvey telescopes, the sample will reach into the thousands. the accuracy ofstrong lens models relies on robust identification of multiple image familiesof lensed galaxies. for the most massive lenses, often more than one backgroundgalaxy is magnified and multiply-imaged, and even in the cases of only a singlelensed source, identification of counter images is not always robust. recently,we have shown that the gini coefficient in space-telescope-quality imaging is ameasurement of galaxy morphology that is relatively well-preserved by stronggravitational lensing. here, we investigate its usefulness as a diagnostic forthe purposes of image family identification and show that it can remove some ofthe degeneracies encountered when using color as the sole diagnostic, and cando so without the need for additional observations since whenever a color isavailable, two gini coefficients are as well.

1511.03673	pics: simulations of strong gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters	gravitational lensing has become one of the most powerful tools available forinvestigating the 'dark side' of the universe. cosmological stronggravitational lensing, in particular, probes the properties of the dense coresof dark matter halos over decades in mass and offers the opportunity to studythe distant universe at flux levels and spatial resolutions otherwiseunavailable. studies of strongly-lensed variable sources offer yet furtherscientific opportunities. one of the challenges in realizing the potential ofstrong lensing is to understand the statistical context of both the individualsystems that receive extensive follow-up study, as well as that of the largersamples of strong lenses that are now emerging from survey efforts. motivatedby these challenges, we have developed an image-simulation pipeline, pics(pipeline for images of cosmological strong lensing) to generate realisticstrong gravitational lensing signals from group and cluster scale lenses. picsuses a low-noise and unbiased density estimator based on (resampled) delaunaytessellations to calculate the density field; lensed images are produced byray-tracing images of actual galaxies from deep hubble space telescopeobservations. other galaxies, similarly sampled, are added to fill in the lightcone. the pipeline further adds cluster-member galaxies and foreground starsinto the lensed images. the entire image ensemble is then observed using arealistic point spread function which includes appropriate detector artifactsfor bright stars. noise is further added, including such non-gaussian elementsas noise window-paning from mosaiced observations, residual bad pixels, andcosmic rays. the aim is to produced simulated images that appear identical - tothe eye (expert or otherwise) - to real observations in various imagingsurveys.

astro-ph;0004092	a new method for galaxy cluster detection i: the algorithm	numerous methods for finding clusters at moderate to high redshifts have beenproposed in recent years, at wavelengths ranging from radio to x-rays. in thispaper we describe a new method for detecting clusters in two-bandoptical/near-ir imaging data. the method relies upon the observation that allrich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequenceof early-type galaxies. the emerging picture is that all rich clusters containa core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies which are coevaland formed at high redshifts. the proposed search method exploits this strongempirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity.the fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters,cluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normalgalaxies at lower redshifts. a simple color cut thus virtually eliminates allforeground contamination, even at significant redshifts. in this paper, one ofa series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques ofthe method in detail, and contrast the method with those used by other authors.we provide a brief demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique usingreal redshift data, and from this conclude that the method offers a powerfulyet simple way of identify galaxy clusters. we find that the method canreliably detect structures to masses as small as groups with velocitydispersions of only ~300 km/sec, with redshifts for all detected structuresestimated to an accuracy of ~10%.

(2001) which used faintergalaxies (and consequently higher redshift galaxies). the good agreementbetween these two very different weak lensing studies demonstrates that weaklensing is a useful tool in observational cosmology.

astro-ph;0202309	the optical afterglow of grb 011211	we present early-time optical photometry and spectroscopy of the opticalafterglow of the gamma-ray burst grb 011211. the spectrum of the opticalafterglow contains several narrow metal lines which are consistent with theburst occurring at a redshift of 2.140 +/- 0.001. the optical afterglow decaysas a power law with a slope of alpha = 0.83 +/- 0.04 for the firstapproximately two days after the burst at which time there is evidence for abreak. the slope after the break is at least 1.4. there is evidence for rapidvariations in the r-band light approximately 0.5 days after the burst. thesevariations suggest that there are density fluctuations near the gamma-ray burston spatial scales of approximately 40--125 au. the magnitude of the break inthe light curve, the spectral slope, and the rate of decay in the optical,suggest that the burst expanded into an ambient medium that is homogeneous onlarge scales. we estimate that the local particle density is betweenapproximately 0.1 and 10 cm^{-3} and that the total gamma-ray energy in theburst was 1.2--1.9 x 10^{50} erg. this energy is smaller than, but consistentwith, the ``standard'' value of (5 +/- 2) x 10^{50} erg. comparing the observedcolor of the optical afterglow with predictions of the standard beaming modelsuggests that the rest-frame v-band extinction in the host galaxy is less thanapproximately 0.03 mag.

astro-ph;0206103	weak lensing study of galaxy biasing	we combine weak lensing measurements from the red-sequence cluster survey andthe virmos-descart survey, and present the first direct measurements of thebias parameter b and the galaxy-mass cross-correlation coefficient r on scalesranging from 0.2 to 9.3 h_{50}^{-1} mpc at a lens redshift z~0.35. we findstrong evidence that both b and r change with scale for our sample of lensgalaxies (19.5&lt;r_c&lt;21), which have luminosities around l_*. for the currentlyfavored cosmology (\omega_m=0.3,\omega_\lambda=0.7), we find b=0.71^+0.06_-0.04on a scale of 1-2 mpc, increasing to ~1 on larger scales. the value of r hasonly minimal dependence on the assumed cosmology. the variation of r with scaleis very similar to that of b, and reaches a minimum value of r=0.57^+0.08_-0.07(at 1 mpc). this suggests significant stochastic biasing and/or non-linearbiasing. on scales larger than ~4 mpc the value of r is consistent with a valueof 1. in addition we use rcs data alone to measure the ratio b/r on scaleranging from 0.15 to 12.5 mpc, and find that the ratio varies somewhat withscale. we obtain an average value of b/r=1.090+-0.035, in good agreement withprevious estimates. a (future) careful comparison of our results with models ofgalaxy formation can provide unique constraints, as r is linked intimately tothe details of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0207412	a spectroscopic survey of a sample of active m dwarfs	a moderate resolution spectroscopic survey of fleming's sample of 54 x-rayselected m dwarfs with photometric distances less than 25 pc is presented.radial and rotation velocities have been measured by fits to the h-alphaprofiles. radial velocities have been measured by cross correlation. artificialbroadening of an observed spectrum has produced a relationship between h-alphafwhm and rotation speed, which we use to infer rotation speeds for the entiresample by measurement of the h-alpha emission line. we find 3 ultra-fastrotators (ufrs, vsini &gt; 100km/s), and 8 stars with 30 &lt; vsini &lt; 100 km/s. theufrs have variable emission. cross-correlation velocities measured forultra-fast rotators (ufrs) are shown to depend on rotation speed and thefiltering used. the radial velocity dispersion of the sample is 17 km/s. a newdouble emission line spectroscopic binary with a period of 3.55 days has beendiscovered, and another known one is in the sample. three other objects aresuspected spectroscopic binaries, and at least six are visual doubles. the onlystar in the sample observed to have significant lithium is a known tw hyaassociation member, twa 8a. these results show that there are a number of young(&lt; 10^8 yr) and very young (&lt; 10^7 yr) low mass stars in the immediate solarneighbourhood. the h-alpha activity strength does not depend on rotation speed.our fast rotators are less luminous than similarly fast rotators in thepleiades. they are either younger than the pleiades, or gained angular momentumin a different way.

astro-ph;0303341	the incidence of strong-lensing clusters in the red-sequence cluster  survey	the incidence of giant arcs due to strong-lensing clusters of galaxies isknown to be discrepant with current theoretical expectations. this resultderives from a comparison of several cluster samples to predictions in theframework of the currently favored $\lambda$cdm cosmology, and one possibleexplanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct.in this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the red-sequencecluster survey (rcs), which again shows significant disagreement withtheoretical predictions. we briefly describe a total of eight strong lenssystems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. based on thedetails of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single to multiple arcsystems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in thecurrently favored cosmology, by modifying the details of the lenses themselves.specifically, the high incidence of multiple arc systems and their overall highredshift suggests that a sub-population of the global cluster population isresponsible for much of the observed lensing. the lack of lensing clusters at$z&lt;0.64$ in the rcs indicates that a property associated with clusters at earlytimes results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely a combination ofellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changesin the cluster mass profiles is responsible. cluster mass, which should evolveto globally higher values toward lower redshifts, is clearly not the mostsignificant consideration for the formation of giant arcs.

astro-ph;0306515	properties of galaxy dark matter halos from weak lensing	we present the results of a study of weak lensing by galaxies based on 45.5deg$^2$ of $r_c$ band imaging data from the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs).we present the first weak lensing detection of the flattening of galaxy darkmatter halos. we use a simple model in which the ellipticity of the halo is $f$times the observed ellipticity of the lens. we find a best fit value of$f=0.77^{+0.18}_{-0.21}$, suggesting that the dark matter halos are somewhatrounder than the light distribution. the fact that we detect a significantflattening implies that the halos are well aligned with the light distribution.given the average ellipticity of the lenses, this implies a halo ellipticity of$&lt;e_{\rm halo} &gt;=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$, in fair agreement with results fromnumerical simulations of cdm. this result provides strong support for theexistence of dark matter, as an isotropic lensing signal is excluded with 99.5%confidence. we also study the average mass profile around the lenses, using amaximum likelihood analysis. we consider two models for the halo mass profile:a truncated isothermal sphere (tis) and an nfw profile. we adoptobservationally motivated scaling relations between the lens luminosity and thevelocity dispersion and the extent of the halo. the best fit nfw model yields amass $m_{200}=(8.4\pm0.7\pm0.4)\times 10^{11} h^{-1} m_\odot$ and a scaleradius $r_s=16.2^{+3.6}_{-2.9} h^{-1}$ kpc. this value for the scale radius isin excellent agreement with predictions from numerical simulations for a haloof this mass.

astro-ph;0310756	properties of galaxy dark matter halos from weak lensing	we present the results of a study of the average mass profile around galaxiesusing weak gravitational lensing. we use 45.5 deg^2 of r_c band imaging datafrom the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs) and define a sample of 1.2\times10^5 lenses with 19.5&lt;r_c&lt;21, and a sample of 1.5\times 10^6 backgroundgalaxies with 21.5&lt;r&lt;24. we constrain the power law scaling relations betweenthe $b$-band luminosity and the mass and size of the halo, and find that theresults are in excellent agreement with observed luminosity-line-widthrelations. under the assumption that the luminosity does not evolve withredshift, the best fit nfw model yields a mass m_{200}=(8.8\pm0.7)\times10^{11} h^{-1} msun and a scale radius r_s=16.7^{+3.7}_{-3.0} h^{-1} kpc for agalaxy with a fiducial luminosity of \lumstar. the latter result is inexcellent agreement with predictions from numerical simulations for a halo ofthis mass. we also observe a signficant anisotropy of the lensing signal aroundthe lenses, implying that the halos are flattened and aligned with the lightdistribution. we find an average projected) halo ellipticity of &lt;e_{\rmhalo}&gt;=0.20^{+0.04}_{-0.05}, in fair agreement with results from numericalsimulations of cdm. alternative theories of gravity (without dark matter)predict an isotropic lensing signal, which is excluded with 99.5% confidence.hence, our results provide strong support for the existence of dark matter.

astro-ph;0603588	cosmological constraints from the red-sequence cluster survey	[abridged] we present a first cosmological analysis of a refined clustercatalog from the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs). the input cluster sample isderived from 72.07 square degrees of imaging data [...] the catalog contains956 clusters over 0.35&lt;z&lt;0.95, limited by cluster richness and richness error.the calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked againstpublicly available sloan digital sky survey imaging [...] we analyze thecluster sample via a general self-calibration technique including scatter inthe mass-richness relation [...]. we fit simultaneously for omega_m andsigma_8, and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness tomass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the richness-mass relation.the principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (orlack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster massobservables) and available results on both from independent measures. from anunconstrained analysis, omega_m and sigma_8 are 0.31+0.11-0.10 and0.67+0.18-0.13 respectively. an analysis including gaussian priors on the slopeand zeropoint of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results:0.30+0.12-0.11 and 0.70+0.27-0.15. both analyses are in good agreement with thecurrent literature. the parameters describing the mass-richness relation in theunconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and agree with existingfollow-up data on both the rcs-1 and other cluster samples. our resultsdirectly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with muchlarger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probesof cosmology.
