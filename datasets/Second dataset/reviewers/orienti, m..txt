0910.3771	the spectral energy distribution of the central parsecs of the nearest  agn	spectral energy distributions (seds) of the central few tens of parsec regionof some of the nearest, most well studied, active galactic nuclei (agn) arepresented. these genuine agn-core seds, mostly from seyfert galaxies, arecharacterised by two main features: an ir bump with the maximum in the 2-10micron range, and an increasing x-ray spectrum in the 1 to ~200 kev region.these dominant features are common to seyfert type 1 and 2 objects alike. type2 agn exhibit a sharp drop shortward of 2 micron, with the optical to uv regionbeing fully absorbed, while type 1s show instead a gentle 2 micron drop ensuedby a secondary, partially-absorbed optical to uv emission bump. assuming thebulk of optical to uv photons generated in these agn are reprocessed by dustand re-emitted in the ir in an isotropic manner, the ir bump luminosityrepresents &gt;70% of the total energy output in these objects while the highenergies above 20 kev are the second energetically important contribution.  galaxies selected by their warm ir colours, i.e. presenting a relatively-flatflux distribution in the 12 to 60 micron range have often being classified asagn. the results from these high spatial resolution seds question thiscriterion as a general rule. it is found that the intrinsic shape of the ir sedof an agn and inferred bolometric luminosity largely depart from those derivedfrom large aperture data. agn luminosities can be overestimated by up to twoorders of magnitude if relying on ir satellite data. we find these differencesto be critical for agn luminosities below or about 10^{44} erg/s. above thislimit, agns tend to dominate the light of their host galaxy regardless of theaperture size used. we tentatively mark this luminosity as a threshold toidentify galaxy-light- vs agn- dominated objects.

0911.0852	radio structures of the nuclei of nearby seyfert galaxies and the nature  of the missing diffuse emission	we present archival high spatial resolution vla and vlba data of the nucleiof seven of the nearest and brightest seyfert galaxies in the southernhemisphere. at vla resolution (~0.1 arcsec), the nucleus of the seyfertgalaxies is unresolved, with the exception of mcg-5-23-16 and ngc 7469 showinga core-jet structure. three seyfert nuclei are surrounded by diffuse radioemission related to star-forming regions. vlba observations with parsec-scaleresolution pointed out that in mrk 1239 the nucleus is clearly resolved intotwo components separated by ~30 pc, while the nucleus of ngc 3783 isunresolved. further comparison between vla and vlba data of these two sourcesshows that the flux density at parsec scales is only 20% of that measured bythe vla. this suggests that the radio emission is not concentrated in a singlecentral component, as in elliptical radio galaxies, and an additionallow-surface brightness component must be present. a comparison of seyfertnuclei with different radio spectra points out that the ``presence'' ofundetected flux on milli-arcsecond scale is common in steep-spectrum objects,while in flat-spectrum objects essentially all the radio emission is recovered.in the steep-spectrum objects, the nature of this ``missing'' flux is likelydue to non-thermal agn-related radiation, perhaps from a jet that getsdisrupted in seyfert galaxies because of the denser environment of their spiralhosts.

0911.1723	the last breath of the young gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio source pks  1518+047	we present the results from multi-frequency vlba observations from 327 mhz to8.4 ghz of the gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio source pks 1518+047 (4c 04.51)aimed at studying the spectral index distribution across the source. furthermulti-frequency archival vla data were analysed to constrain the spectral shapeof the whole source. the pc-scale resolution provided by the vlba data allowsus to resolve the source structure in several sub-components. the analysis oftheir synchrotron spectra showed that the source components have steep spectralindices, suggesting that no supply/re-acceleration of fresh particles iscurrently taking place in any region of the source. by assuming theequipartition magnetic field of 4 mg, we found that only electrons with$\gamma$ &lt; 600, are still contributing to the radio spectrum, while electronswith higher energies have been almost completed depleted. the source radiativelifetime we derived is 2700+/-600 years. considering the best fit to theoverall spectrum, we find that the time in which the nucleus has not beenactive represents almost 20% of the whole source lifetime, indicating that thesource was 2150+/-500 years old when the radio emission switched off.

1003.2910	proper motion and apparent contraction in j0650+6001	we present a multi-epoch and multi-frequency vlbi study of the compact radiosource j0650+6001. in vlbi images the source is resolved into three components.the central component shows a flat spectrum, suggesting the presence of thecore, while the two outer regions, with a steeper spectral index, display ahighly asymmetric flux density. the time baseline of the observationsconsidered to derive the source expansion covers about 15 years. during thistime interval, the distance between the two outer components has increased by0.28+/-0.13 mas, that corresponds to an apparent separation velocity of0.39c+/-0.18c and a kinematic age of 360+/-170 years. on the other hand, amulti-epoch monitoring of the separation between the central and the southerncomponents points out an apparent contraction of about 0.29+/-0.02 mas,corresponding to an apparent contraction velocity of 0.37c+/-0.02c. assumingthat the radio structure is intrinsically symmetric, the high flux densityratio between the outer components can be explained in terms of doppler beamingeffects where the mildly relativistic jets are separating with an intrinsicvelocity of 0.43c+/-0.04c at an angle between 12 and 28 degrees to the line ofsight. in this context, the apparent contraction may be interpreted as a knotin the jet that is moving towards the southern component with an intrinsicvelocity of 0.66c+/-0.03c, and its flux density is boosted by a doppler factorof 2.0.

1006.2049	spectral variability in faint high frequency peakers	we present the analysis of simultaneous multi-frequency very large array(vla) observations of 57 out of 61 sources from the ``faint'' high frequencypeaker (hfp) sample carried out in various epochs. sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data have been used to identify the optical counterpart of each radiosource. from the analysis of the multi-epoch spectra we find that 24 sources donot show evidence of spectral variability, while 12 objects do not possess apeaked spectrum anymore at least in one of the observing epochs. among theremaining 21 sources showing some degree of variability, we find that in 8objects the spectral properties change consistently with the expectation for aradio source undergoing adiabatic expansion. the comparison between thevariability and the optical identification suggests that the majority of radiosources hosted in galaxies likely represent the young radio source population,whereas the majority of those associated with quasars are part of a differentpopulation similar to flat-spectrum objects, which possess peaked spectraduring short intervals of their life, as found in other samples ofhigh-frequency peaking objects. the analysis of the optical images from thesdss points out the presence of companions around 6 hfp hosted in galaxies,suggesting that young radio sources resides in groups.

0708.3979	constraining the nature of high frequency peakers. i. the spectral  variability	we investigate the spectral characteristics of 51 candidate high frequencypeakers (hfps), from the ``bright'' hfp sample, in order to determine thenature of each object, and to obtain a smaller sample of genuine young radiosources. simultaneous multi-frequency vla observations carried out at variousepochs have been used to detect flux density and spectral shape variability inorder to pinpoint contaminant objects, since young radio sources are notexpected to be significantly variable on such a short time-scale. from theanalysis of the spectral variability we find 13 contaminant objects, 11quasars, 1 bl lac, and 1 unidentified object, which we have rejected from thesample of candidate young radio sources. the 6 years elapsed between the firstand latest observing run are not enough to detect any substantial evolution ofthe overall spectrum of genuine, non variable, young radio sources. if we alsoconsider the pc-scale information, we find that the total radio spectrum weobserve is the result of the superposition of the spectra of different regions(lobes, hot-spots, core, jets), instead of a single homogeneous radiocomponent. this indicates that the radio source structure plays a relevant rolein determining the spectral shape also in the rather common case in which themorphology appears unresolved even on high-resolution scales.

1012.0111	steep-spectrum sources and the duty cycle of the radio emission	it is currently accepted that intrinsically compact and bright radio sourcescharacterized by a convex spectrum peaking at frequencies ranging from 100 mhzto a few ghz are young objects. following the evolutionary models, theseobjects would evolve into the population of classical radio galaxies. however,the fraction of young radio sources in flux density-limited samples is muchlarger than what expected from the number counts of large radio sources. thismay suggest that for some reason a significant fraction of young objects wouldnever become large radio galaxies with sizes up to a few mpc. the discovery ofthe young radio source pks 1518+047 characterized by an uncommonly steepspectrum confirms that the radio emission may switch off shortly after itsonset. then the source spectrum steepens and evolves due to energy losses. ifthe interruption is not temporary, the fate of the fading sources is todisappear at frequencies lower than those explored by current radio telescopes.fossils of past activities have been recently found at pc-scale distances fromnewly born radio sources, suggesting the presence of short-lived objects withan intermittent radio emission.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1106.3205	multi-epoch parsec-scale observations of the blazar pks 1510-089	(abridged) we investigate the flux density variability and changes in theparsec-scale radio structure of the flat spectrum radio quasar pks 1510-089.this source was target of multi-epoch vlbi and space-vlbi observations at 4.8,8.4 and 22 ghz carried out between 1999 and 2001. the comparison of theparsec-scale structure observed at different epochs shows the presence of anon-stationary jet feature moving with a superluminal apparent velocity of16.2c+-0.7c. over three epochs at 8.4 ghz during this period the core fluxdensity varies of about 50%, while the scatter in the jet flux density iswithin 10%. the polarization percentage of both core and jet componentssignificantly change from 2 to 9 per cent, while the polarization angle of thecore shows an abrupt change of about 90 degrees becoming roughly perpendicularto the jet direction, consistent with a change in the opacity. to complete thepicture of the physical processes at work, we complemented our observationswith multi-epoch vlba data at 15 ghz from the mojave programme spanning a timebaseline from 1995 to 2010. since 1995 jet components are ejected roughly onceper year with the same position angle and an apparent speed between 15c and20c, indicating that no jet precession is taking place on a timescale longerthan a decade in our frame. the variability of the total intensity flux densitytogether with variations in the polarization properties may be explainedassuming either a change between the optically-thick and -thin regimes producedby a shock that varies the opacity, or a highly ordered magnetic field producedby the compression of the relativistic plasma by a shock propagating along thejet. taking into account the high gamma-ray emission observed from this sourceby the agile and fermi satellites we investigated the connection between theradio and gamma-ray activity during 2007-2010.

1205.0395	parsec-scale morphology and spectral index distribution in faint high  frequency peakers	we investigate the parsec-scale structure of 17 high frequency peaking radiosources from the faint hfp sample. vlba observations were carried out at twoadjacent frequencies, 8.4 and 15.3 ghz, both in the optically-thin part of thespectrum, to obtain the spectral index information. we found that 64% of thesources are resolved into subcomponents, while 36% are unresolved even at thehighest frequency. among the resolved sources, 7 have a morphology and aspectral index distribution typical of young radio sources, while in other 4sources, all optically associated with quasars, the radio properties resemblethose of the blazar population. the equipartition magnetic field of the singlecomponents are a few tens milligauss, similar to the values found in thehotspots of young sources with larger sizes. such high magnetic fields causesevere radiative losses, precluding the formation of extended lobe structuresemitting at centimeter wavelengths. the magnetic fields derived in the variouscomponents of individual source are usually very different, indicating a nonself-similar source evolution, at least during the very first stages of thesource growth.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1210.4319	radio and gamma-ray follow-up of the exceptionally high activity state  of pks 1510-089 in 2011	we investigate the radio and gamma-ray variability of the flat spectrum radioquasar pks 1510-089 in the time range between 2010 november and 2012 january.in this period the source showed an intense activity, with two major gamma-rayflares detected in 2011 july and october. during the latter episode both thegamma-ray and the radio flux density reached their historical peak.multiwavelength analysis shows a rotation of about 380 deg of the opticalpolarization angle close in time with the rapid and strong gamma-ray flare in2011 july. an enhancement of the optical emission and an increase of thefractional polarization both in the optical and in radio bands is observedabout three weeks later, close in time with another gamma-ray outburst. on theother hand, after 2011 september a huge radio outburst has been detected, firstin the millimeter regime followed with some time delay at centimeter down todecimeter wavelengths. this radio flare is characterized by a rising and adecaying stage, in agreement with the formation of a shock and its evolution,as a consequence of expansion and radiative cooling. if the gamma-ray flareobserved in 2011 october is related to this radio outburst, then this stronglyindicates that the region responsible for the gamma-ray variability is notwithin the broad line, but a few parsecs downstream along the jet.

1308.3709	multifrequency studies of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513 was first detected by the largearea telescope (lat) on-board fermi in 2011 june-july when it underwent aperiod of flaring activity. since then, as fermi continues to accumulate dataon this source, its flux has been monitored on a daily basis. two furthergamma-ray flaring episodes from sbs 0846+513 were observed in 2012 may andaugust, reaching a daily peak flux integrated above 100 mev of (50+/-12)x10^-8ph/cm^2/s, and (73+/-14)x10^-8 ph/cm^2/s on may 24 and august 7, respectively.three outbursts were detected at 15 ghz by the owens valley radio observatory40-m telescope in 2012 may, 2012 october, and 2013 january, suggesting acomplex connection with the gamma-ray activity. the most likely scenariosuggests that the 2012 may gamma-ray flare may not be directly related to theradio activity observed over the same period, while the two gamma-ray flaringepisodes may be related to the radio activity observed at 15 ghz in 2012october and 2013 january. the gamma-ray flare in 2012 may triggered swiftobservations that confirmed that sbs 0846+513 was also exhibiting high activityin the optical, uv and x-ray bands, thus providing a firm identificationbetween the gamma-ray source and the lower-energy counterpart. we compared thespectral energy distribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2012 may with thatof a quiescent state. the two seds, modelled as an external compton componentof seed photons from a dust torus, could be fitted by changing the electrondistribution parameters as well as the magnetic field. no significant evidenceof thermal emission from the accretion disc has been observed. interestingly,in the 5 ghz radio luminosity vs. synchrotron peak frequency plot sbs 0846+513seems to lie in the flat spectrum radio quasar part of the so-called `blazarsequence'.

1309.5286	on the connection between radio and gamma rays. variability and  polarization properties in relativistic jets	relativistic jets are one of the most powerful manifestations of the releaseof energy produced around supermassive black holes at the centre of activegalactic nuclei (agn). their emission is observed across the entireelectromagnetic spectrum, from the radio band to gamma rays. despite decades ofefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. inparticular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energyemission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths areamong the greatest challenges in the study of agn. from the comparison of theradio and gamma-ray light curves of gamma-ray flaring objects, there isevidence that some flares, either in radio or in gamma rays, have not anobvious connection at the other extreme of the electromagnetic spectrum, likein the case of the narrow-line seyfert 1 sbs 0846+513. an intriguing aspectpointed out by high resolution radio observations is the change of thepolarization properties close in time with some high energy flares. inparticular, in pks 1510-089 and 3c 454.3 a rotation of almost 90 degrees hasbeen observed after strong gamma-ray flares. the swing of the polarizationangle may be related either to the propagation of a shock along the jet thatorders the magnetic field, or a change of the opacity regime.

1311.2999	physical properties in young radio sources. vlba observations of high  frequency peaking radio sources	multifrequency very long baseline array (vlba) observations were performed tostudy the radio morphology and the synchrotron spectra of four high frequencypeaking radio sources. they are resolved in several compact components and theradio emission is dominated by the hotspots/lobes. the core region isunambiguously detected in j1335+5844 and j1735+5049. the spectra of the mainsource components peak above 3 ghz. assuming that the spectral peak is producedby synchrotron self-absorption, we estimate the magnetic field directly fromobservable quantities and in half of the components it agrees with theequipartition field, while in the others the difference exceeds an order ofmagnitude. by comparing the physical properties of the targets with those oflarger objects we found that the luminosity increases with the linear size forsources smaller than a few kpc, while it decreases for larger objects. theasymmetric sources j1335+5844 and j1735+5049 suggest that the ambient medium isinhomogeneous and is able to influence the evolution of the radio emission evenduring its first stages. the core luminosity increases with the linear size forsources up to a few kpc, while it seems constant for larger sources suggestingan evolution independent from the source total luminosity.

1412.5846	the physics of the radio emission in the quiet side of the agn  population with the ska	despite targets of many multiwavelength campaigns, the main physicalprocesses at work in agn are still under debate. in particular the origin ofthe radio emission and the mechanisms involved are among the open questions inastrophysics. in the radio-loud agn population the radio emission is linked tothe presence of bipolar outflows of relativistic jets. however, the largemajority of the agn population do not form powerful highly-relativistic jets onkpc scales and are characterized by radio luminosity up to 10^23 w/hz at 1.4ghz, challenging our knowledge on the physical processes at the basis of theradio emission in radio-quiet objects. the main mechanisms proposed so far aresynchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic mini-jets, thermalcyclo-synchrotron emission by low-efficiency accretion flow (like adaf oradios), or thermal free-free emission from the x-ray heated corona or wind. thedifficulty in understanding the main mechanism involved is related to theweakness of these objects, which precludes the study of non-local radio-quietagn. multifrequency, high-sensitivity radio observations are crucial toconstrain the nature of the power engine, and they may help in distinguishingbetween the contribution from star formation and agn activity. the advent ofthe ska, with its sub-arcsecond resolution and unprecedented sensitivity willallow us to investigate these processes in radio-quiet agn, even at highredshift for the first time. both the broad-band radio spectrum and thepolarization information will help us in disentangling between non-thermal andthermal origin of the radio emission. the jump in sensitivity of a few order ofmagnitudes at the (sub-)ujy level will enable us to detect radio emission froma large number of radio-quiet agn at high redshift, providing a fundamentalstep in our understanding of their cosmological evolution.

1504.03119	radio and gamma-ray connection in relativistic jets	relativistic jets are one of the most powerful manifestations of the releaseof energy related to the supermassive black holes at the centre of activegalactic nuclei (agn). their emission is observed across the entireelectromagnetic spectrum, from the radio band to gamma rays. despite decades ofefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. inparticular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energyemission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths areamong the greatest challenges in the study of agn. recent high resolution radioobservations of flaring objects locate the high-energy emitting regiondownstream the jet at parsec scale distance from the central engine, posingquestions on the nature of the seed photons upscattered to gamma-rays.furthermore, monitoring campaigns of the most active blazars indicate that notall the high energy flares have the same characteristics in the various energybands, even from the same source, making the interpretation of the mechanismresponsible for the high-energy emission not trivial. although the variabilityof the most luminous blazars is well explained by the "shock-in-jet" scenario,the sub-class of tev emitting objects suggests a more complex emission modelwith velocity gradients in a structured jet. this contribution presents resultsobtained by recent multiwavelength campaigns of blazars aimed at studying theradio and gamma-ray connection and the physical mechanisms at the basis of theemission in these low and high energy bands.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

0806.4831	are young radio sources in equipartition?	the knowledge of physical conditions in young radio sources is important fordefining the framework of models describing radio source evolution. weinvestigate whether young radio sources are in equipartition (i.e. minimumenergy) conditions by comparing the equipartition magnetic fields of 5 highfrequency peakers (hfp) with values directly inferred from the spectral peakassumed to be produced by synchrotron self absorption. multi-frequency vlbaobservations of 5 hfps were carried out in both the optically thick and thinpart of the spectrum to determine the spectral shape and angular size of thecomponents for which individual radio spectra were obtained. we find that themagnetic fields measured using observations agree well with those obtained byassuming equipartition, which implies that these sources are in minimum energycondition and the turnover in their spectra is due probably to ssa. in twosource components, we found that the peak of the spectrum is caused byabsorption of a thermal plasma instead of being due to ssa. the magnetic fieldsfound in the various components range from 10 to 100 mg. in the presence ofsuch high magnetic fields, electron populations with rather low $\gamma$ emitin the ghz-regime. in one source, we detect low-surface brightness extendedemission at low frequency located ~30 mas (~50 pc) from the main source. thisfeature may be related to either an earlier episode of radio activity or adiscontinuous start of the radio activity (sputtering). by comparing our datawith previous vlba observations, we estimate the hotspot advance speed to be inthe range 0.1-0.7c and kinematic ages of a few hundred years.
